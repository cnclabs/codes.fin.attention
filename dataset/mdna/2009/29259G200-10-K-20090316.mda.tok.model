reconciliations of net income loss to net income as adjusted  adjusted ebitda and discretionary cash flow are included in non gaap measures in item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
throughout our growth over the last several years  we have continued to impose financial discipline on our operations 
cash flow provided by used in operations was million in versus million in and million in discretionary cash flow was million in compared to million and million in and  respectively 
this increase in discretionary cash flow allowed us to repay million in debt while spending million in capital expenditures in the increase in discretionary cash flow from to reflects the significant increase in commodity prices that occurred in mid offset by an increase in current taxes 
current tax increases reflect increased revenues due to the higher commodity prices and lack of tax deductions as a result of a delay in capital spending as several of our projects did not begin drilling until late net income for was million  or per diluted share  reflecting the significant unrealized gain on the mark to market of commodity derivatives and higher commodity prices during mid for and  net loss was million and million  respectively  or per share and per share  respectively 
the net income loss reflects a significant unrealized gain losses on the application of mark to market accounting effectively pulling forward into current periods the non cash gains and losses from commodity price fluctuations relating to all future delivery

as of december   we had proved reserves of  mmcf of natural gas and  mbbls of crude oil  condensate and ngls  for a combined  mboe 
nearly percent of our proved reserves are located in the uk at december  the goldeneye field contributed approximately of our production at  mboe and of our proved reserves   mboe  at the end of the year 
goldeneye is predominately a gas field and represented over of our gas production in the njord and brage fields each contributed approximately of our production with and mboe  respectively 
these two fields had approximately of our proved reserves at december  with  and mboe at njord and brage  respectively 
we have three significant development projects underway  all in the uk 
for both the columbus and cygnus projects  we submitted development plans to the applicable authorities for approval during and anticipate receiving final approval in with these ongoing development activities  we recorded proved reserves on both cygnus and columbus at december  as a result  they now represent nearly of our proved reserves at year end 
as cygnus and columbus reserves are predominately gas reserves  our total reserves are becoming increasingly weighted toward gas 
in the first quarter of  we announced the successful drilling at our third project rochelle 
as the well was not completed until  our proved reserves at december  do not include any contribution from rochelle  however  we expect the rochelle project to be a significant part of our operations and reserves as the development activities get underway 
reserves for and  our proved oil and gas reserves were estimated by independent reserve engineers  netherland  sewell associates  inc for  our proved oil and gas reserves in the united kingdom were also estimated by netherland  sewell associates  inc our proved oil and gas reserves in norway for were estimated by independent reserve engineers 
our internal technical staff  or those of the operator  evaluate all technical data available on each field including production data  wells logs  pressure data  petrophysical analysis  fluid properties  seismic data  mapping based on seismic interpretations and well control along with offset well data 
we provide our analysis and data to our independent reservoir engineers for their independent estimates using the securities and exchange commission  or sec  definitions of proved reserves 
the independent engineers then perform their own analysis of the same raw data including analysis of all production data  pressure data  well logs  petrophysical analysis  fluid analysis  seismic data and mapping based on that seismic data to determine their own reserves in place and ultimately estimate the quantity of proved oil and gas reserves attributable to a specific property

drilling activities at cygnus  rochelle and two us projects were started in and continued into we expect to continue development programs in both the uk and norway 
our exploration program could also cover up to wells throughout our focus areas 
approximately million to million is expected to be spent for development drilling and facilities improvements to maintain maximum production levels 
we intend to fund these exploration and development activities through cash flow generated from operations 
the timing and order of this program will be determined by available capital  the completion of ongoing technical work  partner and governmental approvals and rig scheduling for individual prospects 
we may increase or decrease our planned activities for or prioritize our exploratory prospects  depending upon drilling results  potential acquisition candidates  product prices  the availability of capital resources  and other factors affecting the economic viability of such activities 
company history endeavour international corporation a nevada corporation formed in is an independent oil and gas company engaged in the acquisition  exploration and development of energy reserves 
during  we significantly transformed the nature and scope of our business 
on february   we completed a series of transactions that provided a new management team  
table of contents endeavour international corporation a new business strategy of exploration  exploitation and acquisition focused on the north sea  the acquisition of nsnv  inc which possessed the seismic data and management team that were central to our new strategy  and a restructuring which resulted in the sale of all our then existing interests in us oil and gas properties 
the transformed company  renamed endeavour international corporation  emerged with a business strategy focused on exploration  production and development in the north sea 
throughout  we made significant strides in our goal to capitalize on opportunities in the north sea 
throughout and  we sold all remaining us oil and gas properties and our partnership interests in thailand  thereby optimizing the assets of our predecessor company in support of our north sea drilling plans and strategy 
in november  we purchased a majority interest in oer oil as oer  a privately held norwegian exploration and production company based in oslo the oer acquisition 
in january  we purchased the remaining interest in oer from the minority interest holders 
through this acquisition  we hold working interests in the agat  brage and njord fields 
in may  we announced our largest acquisition to date the purchase of producing properties in the uk the talisman acquisition 
on november   we completed this acquisition of all the outstanding shares of talisman expro limited for us million  after purchase price adjustments and expenses 
as a result of the talisman acquisition  we acquired interests in eight fields in the united kingdom sector of the north sea and over seven million boe of proved reserves as of the closing date 
in the second quarter of  we purchased an eight percent interest in the enoch field in the north sea for approximately million 
the field is one of the first discoveries to be developed along the median line between the united kingdom and norway after the ratification of the uk norway framework treaty concerning cross boundary petroleum cooperation 
while working to complete and integrate these acquisitions  we also moved forward in our drilling program 
during and  we gained approval in the uk and norway to act as an operator or licensee in both countries and began participating in the license round process 
we continue to participate in the licensing rounds in both the uk and norway 
we have also pursued various farm in and license transfer opportunities to build acreage and exploration potential and spread the risk of exploration drilling among multiple prospects 
most notably  we have three significant development projects ongoing in the uk columbus  cygnus and rochelle 
in  we initiated operations in the united states and announced our first production there in january 
table of contents endeavour international corporation environmental endeavour was established on a commitment to find and develop energy resources in a manner that protects the health and safety of people and preserves the quality of the environment 
adhering to high performance standards in the areas of health  safety and the environment hse is an integral part of our operations in our efforts to end each day injury and incident free 
our operations in the uk portions of the north sea are subject to numerous uk and european union laws and regulations relating to environmental and safety 
environmental matters are addressed both before oil and gas production activities commence and during the exploration and production activities 
before a uk licensing round begins  the department of energy and climate change previously called the department for business  enterprise regulatory reform will consult with various public bodies that have responsibility for the environment 
applicants for production licenses are required to submit a statement of the general environmental policy of the operator in respect of the contemplated license activities  a summary of its management systems for implementation of that policy and how those systems will be applied to the proposed work program 
additionally  the offshore petroleum production and pipelines assessment of environmental effects regulations require the secretary of state to exercise his licensing powers under the uk petroleum act in such a way to ensure that an environmental assessment is undertaken and considered before consent is given to certain projects 
in the norwegian portions of the north sea  our operations are subject to the environmental and safety requirements of the norwegian petroleum act  as well as other laws and regulations 
our production licenses in norway incorporate the environmental and safety requirements provided in the norwegian petroleum act  and failure to comply with such requirements can result in the imposition of fines and penalties as well as the potential suspension or revocation of our authorizations to operate 
in the united states  various federal  state and local laws regulating the discharge of materials into the environment  or otherwise relating to the protection of the environment  directly impact oil and gas exploration  development and production operations  and consequently may impact our operations and costs 
these regulations include  among others  i regulations by the environmental protection agency and various state agencies regarding approved methods of disposal for certain hazardous and nonhazardous wastes  ii the comprehensive environmental response  compensation  and liability act  federal resource conservation and recovery act and analogous state laws that regulate the removal or remediation of previously disposed wastes including wastes disposed of or released by prior owners or operators  property contamination including groundwater contamination  and remedial plugging operations to prevent future contamination  iii the clean air act and comparable state and local requirements  which may result in the gradual imposition of certain pollution control requirements with respect to air emissions from our operations  iv the oil pollution act of  which contains numerous requirements relating to the prevention of and response to oil spills into waters of the united states  v the resource conservation and recovery act  which is the principal federal statute governing the treatment  storage and disposal of hazardous wastes  and vi state regulations and statutes governing the handling  treatment  storage and disposal of naturally occurring radioactive material

oil and gas mineral rights may be held by individuals  corporations or governments having jurisdiction over the area in which such mineral rights are located 
as a general rule  parties holding such mineral rights grant licenses or leases to third parties to facilitate the exploration and development of these mineral rights 
the terms of the leases and licenses are generally established to require timely development 
notwithstanding the ownership of mineral rights  the government of the jurisdiction in which mineral rights are located generally retains authority over the manner of development of those rights 
competition the petroleum and natural gas industry is highly competitive 
numerous independent oil and gas companies  oil and gas syndicates and major oil and gas companies actively seek out and bid for oil and gas properties as well as for the services of third party providers  such as drilling companies  upon which we rely 
petroleum and natural gas producers also compete with other suppliers of energy and fuel to industrial  commercial and individual customers 
competitive conditions may be substantially affected by various forms of energy legislation and or regulation considered from time to time by the governments and or agencies thereof and other factors out of our control including  international political conditions  overall levels of supply and demand for oil and gas  and the markets for synthetic fuels and alternative energy sources

the words may  will  expect  anticipate  believe  continue  estimate  project  intend and similar expressions used in this form k are intended to identify forward looking statements within the meaning of section a of the securities act and section e of the securities exchange act 
you should not place undue reliance on these forward looking statements  which speak only as of the date made 
we undertake no obligation to publicly release the result of any revision of these forward looking statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date they are made or to reflect the occurrence of unanticipated events 
you should also know that such statements are not guarantees of future performance and are subject to risks  uncertainties and assumptions 
should any of these risks or uncertainties materialize  or should any of our assumptions prove incorrect  actual results may differ materially from those included within the forward looking statements 
the following material risk factors  among others  may affect our financial condition and results of operations 

table of contents endeavour international corporation risks related to our business our ability to produce commercial quantities of oil and gas from our properties may be adversely affected by factors outside of our control 
if we are unable to produce oil and gas from our properties in commercial quantities  our operations will be severely affected 
our business of exploring  developing and producing oil and gas involves a substantial risk of investment loss 
drilling oil and gas wells involves the risk that the wells may be unproductive or that the wells  although productive  do not produce oil or gas in economic quantities 
other hazards  such as unusual or unexpected geological formations  pressures  fires  blowouts  loss of circulation of drilling fluids  or other conditions may substantially delay or prevent completion of any well 
this could result in a total loss of our investment in a particular property 
certain of our operating areas are subject to severe weather conditions which could adversely impact our operations 
a productive well may become uneconomic if water or other substances are encountered  which impair or prevent the production of oil and gas from the well 
in addition  production from any well may be unmarketable if it is impregnated with water or other deleterious substances 
we cannot assure you that oil and gas will be produced from the properties in which we have interests  nor can we assure the marketability of oil and gas that may be acquired or discovered 
numerous factors are beyond our control  including the proximity and capacity of oil and gas pipelines and processing equipment  market fluctuations of prices  taxes  royalties  allowable production and environmental regulations 
we cannot predict how these factors may affect our business 
we may not be able to replace production with new reserves which could cause our production and reserves to decline 
our future oil and gas production is highly dependent upon our level of success in finding or acquiring additional reserves 
in general  the volume of production from oil and gas properties declines as reserves are depleted 
the decline rates depend on reservoir characteristics 
our reserves will decline unless we acquire properties with proved reserves or conduct successful development and exploration drilling activities 
we have limited control over the availability or cost of drilling rigs and other equipment and services which are essential to our operations  and market conditions or transportation impediments may hinder access to oil and gas markets or delay production 
we have limited control over the availability and cost of drilling rigs and other services and equipment which are necessary for us to carry out our exploration and development activities 
procuring a sufficient number of drilling rigs is expensive and difficult as the market for such rigs is highly competitive 
there is no assurance that we will be able to contract for such services or equipment on a timely basis or that the cost of such services and equipment will remain at a satisfactory or affordable level 
for example  the terminal facility servicing our ivrrh  renee and rubie fields has experienced significant increases in operating costs in recent periods  causing the 
table of contents endeavour international corporation operator to cease operations at that facility 
as a result  we expect to suspend production at these fields by the end of the first quarter we also expect to incur approximately million of abandonment costs for the facility  before salvage value  by mid  however we cannot assure you that total abandonment costs will not exceed that amount 
shortages or the high cost of drilling rigs  equipment  supplies or personnel could delay or adversely affect our exploration and development operations  which could have a material adverse effect on business  financial condition or results of operations 
market conditions  the unavailability of satisfactory oil and natural gas transportation or the location of our drilling operations may hinder our access to oil and gas markets  delay production or increase our expenses 
the availability of a ready market for oil and gas production depends on a number of factors  including the demand for  and supply of  oil and gas and the proximity of reserves to pipelines and terminal facilities 
our debt level and terms of our debt agreements could negatively impact our financial condition  results of operations and business prospects 
as of december   we had million in outstanding indebtedness 
our level of indebtedness and the terms of our debt agreements could have important consequences on our operations  including placing restrictions on certain operating activities  making it more difficult for us to satisfy our obligations under our indentures or the terms of our other debt and increasing the risk that we may default on our debt obligations  requiring us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operating activities to required payments on debt  thereby reducing the availability of cash flow for working capital  capital expenditures and other general business activities  limiting our ability to obtain additional financing in the future for working capital  capital expenditures  acquisitions and other general business activities  decreasing our ability to withstand a downturn in our business or the economy generally  and placing us at a competitive disadvantage against other less leveraged or restricted competitors 
we may not have sufficient funds to repay our outstanding debt 
if we are unable to repay our debt out of cash on hand  we could attempt to refinance such debt  sell assets or repay such debt with the proceeds from an equity offering 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to generate sufficient cash flow from operating activities to pay the interest on our debt or that future borrowings  equity financings or proceeds from the sale of assets will be available to repay or refinance such debt 
factors that will affect our ability to raise cash through an offering of our capital stock  a refinancing of our debt or a sale of assets include financial market conditions  our market value and our operating performance at the time of such offering or other financing 
we cannot assure you that any such offering  refinancing or sale of assets can be successfully completed 
the inability to repay or refinance our debt  could have a material adverse effect on our operations and negatively impact our capital program 

table of contents endeavour international corporation we have outstanding million of convertible senior notes due upon specified change of control events  each holder of those notes may require us to purchase all or a portion of the holder s notes at a price equal to of the principal amount  plus accrued and unpaid interest  if any  up to but excluding the date of purchase  plus in certain circumstances  a makewhole premium 
in early  under a private offering  we issued million of guaranteed convertible bonds due to a company controlled by the smedvig family office of norway 
if we undergo a change of control the holders of these bonds also have the right  subject to certain conditions  to redeem the bonds and accrued interest 
at december   we also have outstanding million under a secured revolving loan and a letter of credit facility agreement together  the debt agreements 
upon specified change of control events  each lender under the debt agreements may cancel the facility and declare outstanding loans  plus accrued and unpaid interest  outstanding letters of credit and other outstanding fees  if any  due and payable 
we cannot assure you we would have sufficient financial resources to purchase the notes for cash or repay the lenders under our debt agreements upon the occurrence of a change of control 
in addition  events involving a change of control may result in an event of default under other debt we may incur in the future 
variable rate indebtedness subjects us to interest rate risk  which could cause our debt service obligations to increase 
certain of our borrowings  primarily borrowings under our bank facilities  are at variable rates of interest and expose us to interest rate risk 
if interest rates increase  our debt service obligations on the variable rate indebtedness would increase even though the amount borrowed would remain the same  and our net income would decrease 
a change in interest rates would not result in a material change in our annual interest expense 
recent changes in the financial and credit markets may impact economic growth  and a sustained decline of oil and natural gas prices can also affect our ability to obtain funding  obtain funding on acceptable terms or obtain funding under our current senior bank facility 
this may hinder or prevent us from meeting our future capital needs 
global financial markets and economic conditions have been  and continue to be  disrupted and volatile 
the credit and capital markets have become exceedingly distressed 
these issues  along with significant write offs in the financial services sector  the re pricing of credit risk and the current weak economic conditions have made  and will likely continue to make  it difficult to obtain funding 
in addition  we may be unable to obtain adequate funding under our current senior bank facility because i our lending counterparties may be unwilling or unable to meet their funding obligations or ii our borrowing base under our current senior bank facility is redetermined at least twice per year and may decrease as a result of lower oil or natural gas prices  operating difficulties  declines in reserves  lending requirements or regulations  or for any other reason 

table of contents endeavour international corporation due to these factors  we cannot be certain that funding will be available if needed  and to the extent required  on acceptable terms 
if funding is not available as needed  or is available only on unfavorable terms  we may be unable to meet our obligations as they come due  or we may be unable to implement our capital program  enhance our existing business  complete acquisitions or otherwise take advantage of business opportunities or respond to competitive pressures  any of which could have a material adverse effect on our production  revenues and results of operations 
we will not be the operator of all of the interests we own or acquire  and therefore we may not be in a position to control the timing of development efforts  the associated costs  or the rate of production of the reserves in respect of such interests 
a significant number of our interests  including several of our producing fields  are located in blocks that we do not currently operate and as we carry out our planned drilling program  we will not serve as operator of all planned wells 
as a result  we may have limited ability to exercise influence over the operations of these interests or their associated costs 
dependence on the operator and other working interest owners for these projects  and limited ability to influence operations and associated costs could prevent the realization of expected returns on capital in drilling or acquisition activities 
the success and timing of development and exploitation activities on properties operated by others depend upon a number of factors that will be largely outside our control  including the timing and amount of their capital expenditures  the availability of suitable offshore drilling rigs  drilling equipment  support vessels  production and transportation infrastructure and qualified operating personnel  the operator s expertise and financial resources  approval of other participants and regulatory agencies to drill wells and implement other work programs  selection of technology  and the rate of production of the reserves 
our inability to control the development efforts  costs and timing on the interests where we are not the operator could have a material adverse effect on our financial conditions  results of operations and business prospects 
if we are unable to obtain additional financing or generate sufficient operating cash flow  we may not be able to adequately fund our existing development and exploration projects  acquire additional oil and gas interests or maintain our rights in such projects 
we expect to incur substantial expenditures in connection with our oil and gas exploration  development and production activities  which may be in excess of operating cash flows and may require us to seek external sources of capital in the future 
we may not have an adequate amount of financial resources to adequately fund all of our development and exploration projects 
in the past  we have relied on operating cash flows  credit facility borrowings and the sale of our debt and equity securities to fund the acquisition  exploration and development of our petroleum 
table of contents endeavour international corporation properties 
we may need to raise additional capital to continue funding projects 
we cannot assure you that additional funding will be available to us for exploration and development of our projects or to fulfill our obligations under any agreements 
we also cannot assure you that we will be able to generate sufficient operating cash flow or obtain adequate financing in the future or that the terms of any such financing will be acceptable to us 
failure to generate such additional operating cash flow or obtain such additional financing could result in delay  postponement or cancellation of further exploration and development of our projects or the loss of our interest in our prospects 
competition for oil and gas properties and prospects is intense and some of our competitors have larger financial  technical and personnel resources that give them an advantage in evaluating  obtaining and developing properties and prospects 
we operate in a highly competitive environment for reviewing prospects  acquiring properties  marketing oil and gas and securing trained personnel 
many of our competitors are major or independent oil and gas companies that have longer operating histories in our areas of operation and employ superior financial resources which allow them to obtain substantially greater technical and personnel resources and which better enable them to acquire and develop the prospects that they have identified 
we also actively compete with other companies when acquiring new leases or oil and gas properties 
our relatively small size could adversely affect our ability to obtain new licenses in the future 
specifically  competitors with greater resources than our own have certain advantages that are particularly important in reviewing prospects and purchasing properties 
competitors may be able to evaluate  bid for and purchase a greater number of properties and prospects than our financial or personnel resources permit 
competitors may also be able to pay more for productive oil and gas properties and exploratory prospects than we are able or willing to pay 
if we are unable to compete successfully in these areas in the future  our future revenues and growth may be diminished or restricted 
these competitors may also be better able to withstand sustained periods of unsuccessful drilling or downturns in the economy  including decreases in the price of commodities as experienced in larger competitors may be able to absorb the burden of any changes in laws and regulations more easily than we can  which would adversely affect our competitive position 
in addition  most of our competitors have been operating for a much longer time and have demonstrated the ability to operate through industry cycles 
if we are unable to identify additional oil and gas prospects in which we can acquire an interest at an affordable price  we may not be able to grow successfully 
one element of our strategy is to continue to grow through selected acquisitions of additional interests in oil and gas prospects 
this strategy may not be successful  however  because we may not be able to identify additional desirable oil and gas prospects and acquire interests in such prospects  any acquisition of interests in oil and gas prospects may be found not to include prospects that contain proven oil or gas reserves  
table of contents endeavour international corporation we may not have the ability to develop prospects that contain proven oil or gas reserves to the point of commercial production  we may not have the financial ability to complete additional acquisitions of interests in oil and gas prospects or to develop the prospects that we acquire to the point of production  and we may not be able to consummate additional acquisitions on terms favorable to us or at all 
if we are unsuccessful at either identifying new oil and gas properties that are attractive to us  or are unable to acquire such properties at commercially acceptable terms  our business prospects and ability to grow could be materially adversely affected 
acquiring interests in properties for oil and natural gas exploration is speculative in nature and may not result in operating revenues or profits 
we cannot assure you that we will discover oil and gas in commercial quantities in our current properties or properties we may acquire in the future 
our success depends upon our ability to acquire working and revenue interests in properties upon which oil and gas reserves ultimately are discovered 
we face risks associated with our acquisition strategy 
as part of our growth strategy  we intend to pursue strategic acquisitions of new properties that expand our current asset base and potentially offer unexploited reserve potential 
this strategy involves risks and we cannot assure you that we will be able to finance or consummate the transactions we select  any acquisitions will be profitable or be successfully integrated into our existing operations  we will be able to retain and motivate key personnel of acquired businesses  any acquisitions and integrations will not divert management resources  or any acquisitions and integrations will not have an adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition 
market fluctuations in the prices of oil and gas could adversely affect the price at which we can sell oil or gas discovered on our properties  and lower oil and gas prices may cause us to record ceiling test write downs 
in recent decades  there have been periods of both worldwide over production and underproduction of hydrocarbons  varying weather patterns and periods of both increased and relaxed energy conservation efforts 
these conditions have resulted in periods of excess supply of  and reduced demand for  crude oil on a worldwide basis and for natural gas on a regional basis 
these periods historically have been followed by periods of short supply of  and increased demand for  crude oil and natural gas 
the excess or short supply of oil and gas has placed pressures on prices and has resulted in dramatic price fluctuations  even during relatively short periods of seasonal market demand 
we cannot predict with any degree of certainty future oil and gas prices 
changes in oil and gas prices significantly affect our revenues  operating results  profitability and the amount and value of our oil and gas reserves 
lower prices may reduce the amount of oil and gas that we can produce economically 

table of contents endeavour international corporation we use the full cost method of accounting for our oil and gas operations 
accordingly  we capitalize the cost to acquire  explore and develop oil and gas properties 
under full cost accounting rules  the net capitalized costs of oil and gas properties net of related deferred taxes  including estimated capitalized abandonment costs  may not exceed a ceiling limit  which is based upon the present value of estimated future net cash flows from proved reserves  discounted at and excluding cash flows related to estimated abandonment costs  plus the lower of cost or fair value of unproved properties 
if net capitalized costs of oil and gas properties exceed the ceiling limit  we must charge the amount of the excess to earnings as an impairment charge 
this is called a ceiling test write down 
this charge does not impact cash flow from operating activities  but does reduce net income 
the risk that we will be required to write down the carrying value of oil and gas properties increases when oil and natural gas prices are low 
in addition  write downs may occur if we experience substantial downward adjustments to our estimated proved reserves 
we cannot assure you that we will not experience ceiling test write downs in the future 
our results of operations could be adversely affected by goodwill impairments 
as a result of mergers and acquisitions  at december  we had million of goodwill on our balance sheet 
goodwill is not amortized  but instead must be tested at least annually for impairment by applying a fair value based test 
goodwill is deemed impaired to the extent that its carrying amount exceeds the fair value of the reporting unit 
although our latest tests indicate that no goodwill impairment is currently required  future deterioration in market conditions could lead to goodwill impairments that could have a substantial negative effect on our profitability 
derivative transactions may limit our potential gains and involve other risks 
to manage our exposure to price risk with our production  we entered into commodity derivative contracts 
we may also enter into other commodity derivative contracts from time to time with respect to a portion of our future production to manage our exposure to price risk or exposure to interest rate risk 
the goal of these derivative contracts is to limit volatility and increase the predictability of cash flow 
these transactions may limit our potential gains if oil and gas prices were to rise over  or interest rates fall below  the prices established by the derivative contracts 
in addition  derivative contracts may expose us to the risk of financial loss in certain circumstances  including instances in which our production is less than expected  the counterparties to our contracts fail to perform under the contracts  or a sudden  unexpected event materially impacts oil or gas prices or interest rates 
the use of d seismic is only an interpretive tool and we may be unable to recognize significant geological features 
the use of d seismic is only an interpretive tool and we may be unable to recognize significant geological features due to errors in analysis of data  processing limitations or other factors 
the use of seismic information does not guarantee that the wells we drill will encounter hydrocarbons  or if we do encounter hydrocarbons  that they will be present in commercial quantities

the exploration  production and sale of oil and gas are extensively regulated by governmental bodies 
applicable legislation is under constant review for amendment or expansion 
these efforts frequently result in an increase in the regulatory burden on companies in our industry and consequently an increase in the cost of doing business and decrease in profitability 
numerous governmental departments and agencies are authorized to  and have  issued rules and regulations imposing additional burdens on the oil and gas industry that often are costly to comply with and carry substantial penalties for failure to comply 
production operations are affected by changing tax and other laws relating to the petroleum industry  by constantly changing administrative regulations and possible interruptions or termination by government authorities 
oil and gas mineral rights may be held by individuals  corporations or governments having jurisdiction over the area in which such mineral rights are located 
as a general rule  parties holding such mineral rights grant licenses or leases to third parties to facilitate the exploration and development of these mineral rights

these hazards can cause personal injury and loss of life  severe damage to and destruction of property and equipment  pollution or environmental damage and suspension of operations 
we maintain insurance for some  but not all  of the potential risks and liabilities associated with our business 
if a significant accident or other event resulting in damage to our operations  including severe weather  terrorist acts  war  civil disturbances  pollution or environmental damage  occurs and is not fully covered by insurance  it could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 
we do not currently operate all of our oil and gas properties 
in the projects in which we own non operating interests  the operator may maintain insurance of various types to cover our operations with policy limits and retention liability customary in the industry 
the occurrence of a significant adverse event that is not fully covered by insurance could result in the loss of our total investment in a particular prospect and additional liability for us  which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
the cost of decommissioning is uncertain 
we expect to incur obligations to abandon and decommission certain structures associated with our producing properties 
to date  the industry has little experience of removing oil and gas structures from the north sea 
few of the structures in the north sea have been removed 
certain groups have been established to study issues relating to decommissioning and abandonment and how the costs will be borne 
because experience is limited  we cannot precisely predict the costs of any future decommissions for which we might become obligated 
reserve estimates depend on many assumptions that may turn out to be inaccurate and any material inaccuracies in the reserve estimates or underlying assumptions of our assets will materially affect the quantities and present value of those reserves 
estimating oil and gas reserves is complex and inherently imprecise 
it requires interpretation of the available technical data and making many assumptions about future conditions  including price and other economic factors 
in preparing such estimates  projection of production rates  timing of development expenditures and available geological  geophysical  production and engineering data are analyzed 
the extent  quality and reliability of these data can vary 
this process also requires economic assumptions about matters such as oil and natural gas prices  drilling and operating expenses  capital expenditures  taxes and availability of funds 
if our interpretations or assumptions used in arriving at our reserve estimates prove to be inaccurate  the amount of oil and gas that will ultimately be recovered may differ materially from the estimated quantities and net present value of reserves owned by us 
actual future production  oil and natural gas prices  revenues  taxes  development expenditures  operating expenses and quantities of recoverable oil and gas reserves most likely will vary from estimates  perhaps significantly 
in addition  we may adjust estimates of proved reserves to reflect production history  results of exploration and development  prevailing oil and natural gas prices and other factors  many of which are beyond our control

failure to comply with these laws and regulations can result in the imposition of substantial fines and penalties as well as potential orders suspending or terminating our rights to operate 
some environmental laws to which we are subject to provide for strict liability for pollution damages  rendering a person liable without regard to negligence or fault on the part of such person 
in addition  we may be subject to claims alleging personal injury or property damage as a result of alleged exposure to hazardous substances such as oil and gas related products 
aquatic environments in which we operate are often particularly sensitive to environmental impacts  which may expose us to greater potential liability than that associated with exploration  development and production at many onshore locations 
changes in environmental laws and regulations occur frequently  and any changes that result in more stringent or costly requirements for oil and gas exploration and production activities could require us  as well as others in our industry  to make significant expenditures to attain and maintain compliance which could have a corresponding material adverse effect on our competitive position  financial condition or results of operations 
we cannot provide assurance that we will be able to comply with future laws and regulations to the same extent that we believe we have in the past 
similarly  we cannot always precisely predict the potential impact of environmental laws and regulations which may be adopted in the future  including whether any such laws or regulations would restrict our operations in any area

table of contents endeavour international corporation overview we are an international oil and gas exploration and production company focused on the acquisition  exploration and development of energy reserves 
to date  we have invested a significant amount of our resources on various development  acquisition and exploration projects 
over the last several years  we have principally used acquisitions to build our base of production  proved reserves and cash flow while continuing our exploration and development programs 
key items related to our acquisitions  drilling and operations in the last three years include acquisitions in late  we completed the acquisition of various fields in the uk north sea from talisman 
enoch following our acquisition of an interest in this field in  we completed the development program and began initial production in mid exploration during the last three years  we have drilled exploration wells with four successes in the uk  seven in norway and one in the us  including cygnus the first of our wells in our drilling program  the cygnus prospect  was spud in early february in the uk sector of the north sea 
in we submitted a development plan to the uk authorities and began drilling an appraisal well 
we announced the success of the appraisal well in columbus in  we drilled the columbus exploratory prospect in the central graben region of the north sea 
we served as operator of the well 
in december  we completed successful testing of the well 
in  we drilled an appraisal well and its sidetrack effectively confirming the presence of gas condensate bearing sands 
in  we submitted a development plan to the uk authorities and expect to receive approval in rochelle we began appraisal drilling in and announced successful results in united states in  we participated in two exploration wells in the united states 
we announced first production from one well in january while the second well is still undergoing testing and evaluation 
producing assets at the end of  we completed a project that initiated gas production at the njord field 
production from the goldeneye field has continued at levels above our expectations  indicating the quality of this large gas field 
development drilling has been ongoing at njord  brage and alba to maintain production levels 
our realized price before derivatives increased from to largely as a result oil prices climbing to record levels in the summer of and gas prices in our markets improving 
this substantial increase in prices in the first half of helped revenue grow from million in to million in with this higher revenue and strong fiscal discipline over expenses  we repaid million in 
table of contents endeavour international corporation debt  spent million in capital expenditures during and increased cash from year end by million 
at december   we held million in cash and another million in cash restricted for drilling rig commitments 
even with the substantial growth in revenues  net income can be significantly affected by various non cash items  such as unrealized gains and losses on our commodity derivatives  currency impact of long term liabilities and deferred taxes 
cash flow provided by used in operations was million in versus million in and million in discretionary cash flow was in  compared to million in and million in  respectively 
this significant increase in our discretionary cash flow in the past two years has allowed us to repay debt in and while continuing to actively invest in our capital programs 
net income was million for  or per diluted share 
net loss for was million  or per share  reflecting the significant unrealized loss on the mark to market of commodity derivatives 
for  net loss was million  or per share 
the net loss for reflects a significant unrealized gain on the mark to market of commodity derivatives 
net income as adjusted for would have been million without the effect of impairments  derivative transactions and currency impacts of deferred taxes 
net loss as adjusted for would have been million  as compared to net loss as adjusted of million in adjusted ebitda increased to million in  as compared to million in and million in given the significant impact that non cash items may have on our net income  we use various measures in addition to net income  including non financial performance indicators and non gaap measures as key metrics to manage our business 
these key metrics demonstrate the company s ability to maintain or grow production levels and reserves  internally fund capital expenditures and service debt as well as provide comparisons to other oil and gas exploration and production companies 
these measures include  among others  debt and cash balances  production levels  oil and gas reserves  drilling results  discretionary cash flow  adjusted earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation  depletion and amortization adjusted ebitda and adjusted net income 
for definitions of adjusted ebitda and discretionary cash flow  and a reconciliation of adjusted ebitda to net income as adjusted  please see reconciliation of non gaap accounting measures 
in connection with the talisman acquisition  we entered into various oil and gas derivative instruments to stabilize cash flows from the acquired assets and satisfy certain obligations under the financing agreements that funded the acquisition 
hedge accounting has not been elected for these instruments resulting in the application of mark to market accounting effectively pulling forward into current periods the non cash gains and losses from commodity price fluctuations relating to all future delivery periods 
when we entered into these contracts  they covered nearly million boe beginning in and running through at a weighted average 
table of contents endeavour international corporation price of 
as both oil and gas prices fell from the date we entered into the contracts through december   we recorded an unrealized gain of million reflecting the decline in future commodity prices through however  in  commodity prices reversed their declines  continuing to increase to record levels in the case of oil 
with oil prices reaching nearly per barrel and gas prices recovering to levels close to our original contract prices  we recorded an million unrealized loss in on contract volumes through as oil prices spiked to record levels in and then went into an unprecedented decline in the last half of the year  we recorded million in unrealized gain on contract volumes through we expect to continue to have fluctuations in net earnings each period as commodity prices fluctuate based on all remaining unsettled contracts at the end of each period 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for additional information on these derivatives 
revenues  volumes and operating costs our revenues have increased significantly since primarily due to the following in november  we completed the talisman acquisition and each of and reflect a full year s contribution of those assets 
similarly  our enoch field began first production in mid there was an increase in gas production at the end of with the completion of a gas project at njord in the fourth quarter of the last three years have been turbulent times for the global oil market and  to a lesser extent  the north sea gas markets 
experienced seemingly high commodity prices  only to be followed by lower prices in  new  unprecedented highs in mid and a precipitous drop by the end of to soften the extremes of the commodity markets  we have derivative instruments covering a portion of our anticipated sales through natural production declines at certain of our fields have not been offset by infield drilling  resulting in small production decreases at certain fields 
in general total operating costs increased from through as a result of production from the acquisitions discussed above 
operating costs per boe declined for and due to the lower operating costs per boe for our acquired uk properties 
operating costs per boe increased from to primarily due increased fuel costs at a non operated facility where several of our fields deliver production

the prices used to determine the impairment were per barrel for oil and per mcf for gas 
while our commodity derivatives had a fair value of million at december   these derivatives were not included in the calculation of the full cost ceiling test as the derivatives are not accounted for as cash flow hedges

income tax expense in represents the significant increase in revenues as a result of higher realized prices  the strengthening of the us dollar versus the uk pound and norwegian kroner and the shift in anticipated capital expenditures from late to early during  we incurred taxes in all of the jurisdictions in which we do business  except for the us  whereas in  we incurred taxes only on our norwegian operations 
after closing the talisman acquisition in  we began recording tax expense benefit for our uk operations and removed the valuation allowances previously recorded 
the change in income taxes from an expense of million in to a benefit of million in resulted from the impact of the mark to market changes on our derivatives and the activity of our uk operations 
at december   we had net operating loss carryforwards of million in the us 
table of contents endeavour international corporation in  and  we have not recorded any income tax benefits in the us as there was no assurance that we could generate any us taxable earnings  resulting in a full valuation allowance of deferred tax assets generated

see note to the consolidated financial statements for additional discussion of our debt 
cash flow from operations increased to million for primarily due to higher realized commodity prices that were substantially offset by increased current taxes 
the increased revenues generated by a full year of operations of our acquired assets were primarily responsible for the cash flows provided by operations of million for versus the million used by operations in our revenues and cash flows from operating activities are sensitive to changes in prices received for our products 
our production is sold at prevailing market prices which fluctuate in response to many factors that are outside of our control 
given the current tightly balanced supply demand market  small variations in either supply or demand  or both  can have dramatic effects on prices we receive for our oil and natural gas production 
while the market price received for oil and natural gas varies among geographic areas  oil trades in a worldwide market  whereas natural gas  which is still developing a global transportation system  is more subject to local supply and demand conditions 
consequently  price movements for all types and grades of crude oil generally move in the same direction 
natural gas prices in the north sea have been influenced by fuel prices around the world  including crude oil and coal 
these prices are also impacted by european gas supplies  particularly deliveries from russian gas supplies 
in addition  regional supply and demand issues affect gas prices 
the majority of our natural gas is sold in the uk market 
market prices for both oil and natural gas were at historically high levels during and oil prices continued their high levels throughout much of and north sea gas prices declined in the first quarter of but recovered in the second half of the year and remained strong during both crude oil and natural gas prices have declined in as a result of the global economic decline 
non gaap measures net income can be significantly affected by various non cash items  such as unrealized gains and losses on our commodity derivatives  currency impact of long term liabilities and deferred taxes 
given the significant impact that non cash items may have on our net income  we use various measures in addition to net income  including non financial performance indicators and non gaap measures as key metrics to manage our business 
these key metrics demonstrate the company s ability to maintain or grow production levels and reserves  internally fund capital expenditures and service debt as well as provide comparisons to other oil and gas exploration and production 
table of contents endeavour international corporation companies 
these measures include  among others  debt and cash balances  production levels  oil and gas reserves  drilling results  discretionary cash flow  adjusted earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation  depletion and amortization adjusted ebitda and adjusted net income 
net income loss as adjusted  adjusted ebitda and discretionary cash flow are internal  supplemental measures of our performance that are not required by  or presented in accordance with  gaap 
we use these non gaap measures as internal measures of performance and to aid in our budgeting and forecasting processes 
we view these non gaap measures  and we believe that others in the oil and gas industry view these  or similar  non gaap measures  as commonly used analytic indicators to compare performance among companies 
we further believe that these non gaap measures are frequently used by securities analysts  investors  and other interested parties in the evaluation of issuers  many of which present these measures when reporting their results 
we believe these non gaap measures provide useful information to both management and investors to gain an overall understanding of our current financial performance and provide investors with financial measures that most closely align to our internal measurement processes 
since the application of mark to market accounting has the effect of pulling forward into current periods non cash gains and losses related to commodity derivatives relating to future delivery periods  analysis of results of operations from one period to another can be difficult 
we believe that excluding these unrealized non cash gains and losses related to commodity derivatives and currency exchange changes provides a more meaningful representation of our economic performance in the reporting period and is therefore useful to us  investors  analysts and others in facilitating the analysis of our results of operations from one period to another 
these measures should not be considered as measures of financial performance under gaap  and the items excluded from these measures are significant components in understanding and assessing financial performance 
these non gaap measures should not be considered in isolation or as an alternative to net income  operating income or any other performance measures derived in accordance with gaap or as alternatives to cash flows generated by operating  investing or financing activities as a measure of our liquidity 
because net income loss as adjusted  adjusted ebitda and discretionary cash flow are not measurements determined in accordance with gaap and thus susceptible to varying calculations  net income loss as adjusted  adjusted ebitda and discretionary cash flow as presented may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies 
net income loss as adjusted  adjusted ebitda and discretionary cash flow have limitations as an analytical tool  and you should not consider these measures in isolation  or as a substitute for analysis of our financial statement data presented in the consolidated financial statements as reported under gaap 
for example  net income loss as adjusted  adjusted ebitda and discretionary cash flow may not reflect our cash expenditures  or future requirements  for capital expenditures or contractual commitments  
table of contents endeavour international corporation changes in  or cash requirements for  our working capital needs  unrealized gains losses on derivatives  non cash foreign currency gains losses  our interest expense  or the cash requirements necessary to service interest and principal payments on our debts  our preferred stock dividend requirements  and depreciation  depletion and amortization 
because of these limitations  net income loss as adjusted  adjusted ebitda and discretionary cash flow should not be considered as measures of cash available to us to invest in the growth of our business

outlook capital program we anticipate spending approximately million during to fund oil and gas exploration  production and development activities in our core areas of operation in the north sea and the us 
as in  we intend to finance this capital program through our cash flow generated from operations 
to the extent our cash flow from operations is unable to completely finance our capital program  we will postpone certain proposed capital projects until our capital spending does not exceed our available resources 
however  we believe our existing production base  combined with our commodity derivatives in place  should generate sufficient cash flows to fund our ongoing operations and capital program 
a significant portion of our capital program will be directed towards developing our three major projects in the uk sector of the north sea  the rochelle  cygnus and columbus prospects 
in addition  we expect to spend approximately million to million on infield drilling and facilities improvements to maintain production levels on our producing properties 
lastly  we also intend to continue our exploration activities in both the north sea and the us  subject to the availability of sufficient capital 
the timing  completion and process of our capital program is subject to a number of factors  including availability of capital  drilling results  drilling and production costs  availability of drilling services and equipment  partner approvals and technical work 
based on these and other factors  we may increase or decrease our planned capital program or prioritize certain projects over others 

table of contents endeavour international corporation revenues and production we expect production for to range from  to  boe per day  with approximately of that production as gas 
we anticipate this decline in production from due to normal production declines and the suspension of production at three of our fields as discussed below 
with development programs for columbus  cygnus and rochelle  we expect significant increases in production beginning in the fourth quarter of when we anticipate the start of production at rochelle 
we anticipate columbus and cygnus to begin production in when all three projects are fully producing  they have the potential to equal our production levels from all other fields 
our ivrrh  renee and rubie fields all produce to a single floating production facility that has experienced significant increases in operating costs in recent periods 
with the decline in oil prices and the rising operating costs  the operator has decided to cease operations and begin removal and salvage procedures at that floating production facility 
as a result  we expect to suspend production at these fields by the end of the first quarter the production from these fields will be suspended until the development activities at rochelle are operational which we currently anticipate to be late after the start of rochelle production  we expect to re develop ivrrh  renee and rubie if economically feasible 
we also expect to incur approximately million of abandonment costs for the facility  before salvage value  by mid oil prices continued to be impacted by supply and demand on a worldwide basis  while natural gas prices are more impacted by regional economic and weather patterns 
oil prices continue to decrease since year end and natural gas prices in the uk  the market for the majority of our gas production  have recovered due primarily to return to normal weather conditions 
for  we expect realized prices before derivatives to be per mcf less than the national balance point price for gas and per bbl less than the dated brent price for oil 
we have commodity derivative instruments to secure our realized prices for a portion of our oil and gas production through see note to the consolidated financial statements herein for more discussion of our commodity derivative instruments 
we expect operating costs per boe to be in the range of to per boe for commodity prices can also affect our operating cash flow through an indirect effect on operating expenses 
significant commodity price volatility  as experienced in recent years  can lead to fluctuations in drilling and development activities 
as a result  the demand and cost for people  services  equipment and materials may also increase or decrease following worldwide drilling levels  causing an impact on our cash flow 

table of contents endeavour international corporation liquidity and financial resources our primary sources of financial resources and liquidity are internally generated cash flows from operations and access to the credit and capital markets  to the extent available 
we believe the combination of our available cash on hand  cash flow from operations  our ability to time capital expenditures and our flexible capital program and related obligations will allow us to manage volatile markets while enabling us to further our strategic objectives 
we expect to fund our capital requirements through internally generated cash flow from operations 
these cash flows will be significantly impacted by the amount of hydrocarbons we produce  and to a lesser extent  the price we obtain for our produced commodities 
oil prices continue to be impacted by supply and demand on a worldwide basis  while natural gas prices are more impacted by regional economic and weather patterns 
although oil prices have declined significantly since the record high prices in the summer of  natural gas prices in the uk and norway have not experienced as steep of a decline 
while we expect revenues to decline from to as a result of the sharp decline in oil prices  the full impact on our cash flows will be partially mitigated by our balance of gas to oil production and our commodity derivative positions 
as of december   our outstanding commodity derivatives covered to of expected production 
we have historically utilized a combination of borrowings under our bank facility and accessing the capital markets to fund our operations  capital projects or strategic acquisitions 
the worldwide credit and capital markets have recently experience significant disruptions and exhibited adverse conditions 
continued volatility in the credit and capital markets may substantially restrict our ability to access these markets or increase costs associated with issuing debt instruments due to  among other things  increased spreads over relevant interest rate benchmarks and affect our ability to access those markets 
we do not believe our liquidity has been materially affected by the recent events in the global financial markets as we have not required these financing alternatives 
further  we do not expect our liquidity to be materially impacted in the near future as we intend to exercise strict fiscal discipline in matching our future expenditures with cash flow from operations 
nevertheless  we will continue to monitor our capital requirements  the credit and capital markets and circumstances surrounding each of the lenders in our senior bank facility 
to date we have experienced no disruptions in our ability to access additional funding through our senior facility 
however  we cannot predict with any certainty the impact to us of any further disruption in the credit environment 
at december   we had million outstanding under our senior bank facility 
the senior bank facility has a current borrowing base capacity of million  which is secured by our oil and gas assets 
the borrowing base is subject to redetermination every six months on april and october  and we are required to provide our lenders with an independent reserve report every months 
based on our reserve report at december and june each year  commodity prices set by our lenders and terms set forth in the credit agreement  the maximum capacity of our borrowing base is set  and any amounts outstanding over the redetermined borrowing base must be repaid within days of the redetermination date 
the senior bank facility is also subject to maximum commitment levels by the participating lenders that change over time 

table of contents endeavour international corporation we have reflected million in current maturities of long term debt at december  due to the borrowing base capacity and maximum commitment levels 
the next scheduled redetermination of our borrowing base will occur on april  we are currently undergoing the redetermination process based on our reserve report as of december  we cannot estimate the level of the borrowing base capacity that will be in effect as of april  although we do expect the borrowing base capacity to decrease given the decline in commodity prices during we expect to repay amounts outstanding in excess of the redetermined borrowing base with cash on hand 
this will reduce the amount of cash on hand that is immediately available for our capital program 
consistent with our strict financial discipline  we continue to manage our capital expenditures to stay within generated cash flows while anticipating additional debt repayments 
the terms of our credit agreement provide that the borrowing base capacity may be increased as projects are approved by the applicable authority 
we currently have submitted development plans for approval for both our cygnus and columbus projects and anticipate submitting a plan for the rochelle development during as these development plans are approved  we expect to include the new projects in the borrowing base assets and believe that this will result in an increase of our borrowing base capacity 
the senior bank facility also provides for issuances of letters of credit of up to an aggregate million 
while all letters of credit issued under the senior bank facility will reduce the total amount available for drawing under the senior bank facility  letters of credit issued to secure abandonment liabilities in respect of borrowing base assets will not reduce the amount available under the borrowing base 
as of december   we have million of outstanding letters of credit related to abandonment liabilities on certain of our oil and gas properties 
in january  we completed the refinancing of certain debt utilizing a strategic investment by the smedvig family office in norway 
included in this refinancing were the repayment of our second lien term loan  plus accrued interest  issuance of million under a private offering of guaranteed convertible bonds due  and borrowing of million under a junior credit facility 
amounts borrowed under the junior facility were repaid in full during the smedvig family also committed an additional million for future investments with us 
our income tax expense relates primarily to our operations in the uk statutory income tax rate of and to our operations in norway statutory income tax rate of 
we are currently not able to record income tax benefits on our us loss as there is no assurance that we can generate any us taxable earnings 
as operations commence in the us during  we will be able to record income tax benefits in the us and do not anticipate paying current taxes in the us 
table of contents endeavour international corporation off balance sheet arrangements at december   we did not have any off balance sheet arrangements 
rig commitments we have two commitments for the use of drilling rigs in our north sea operations 
one commitment is for the drilling rig that commenced drilling at the rochelle field in december we have million in escrow toward this commitment  included in restricted cash on our condensed consolidated balance sheet 
the reserved amounts in escrow will be released as payments are made for this drilling activity 
we also have a commitment for a semi submersible rig in norway through a consortium with several other operators in the norwegian continental shelf 
the contract commits us to days for two wells for drilling services for million 
we currently estimate the rig will be initially delivered in the third quarter of and again in critical accounting policies and estimates the accompanying financial statements have been prepared on the accrual basis of accounting in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america and have been presented on a going concern basis  which contemplates the realization of assets and satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business 
these accounting principles require management to use estimates  judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements  and revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
management reviews its estimates  including those related to the determination of proved reserves  estimates of future dismantlement costs  income taxes and litigation 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
management believes it is reasonably possible that the following material estimates affecting the financial statements could change in the coming year estimates of proved oil and gas reserves  estimates as to the expected future cash flow from proved oil and gas properties  estimates of future dismantlement and restoration costs  estimates of fair values used in purchase accounting and estimates of the fair value of derivative instruments 
in addition  alternatives may exist among various accounting methods 
in such cases  the choice of accounting method may also have a significant impact on reported amounts 
our critical accounting policies are as follows full cost accounting under the full cost method  all acquisition  exploration and development costs  including certain directly related employee costs and a portion of interest expense  incurred for the purpose of finding oil and gas are capitalized and accumulated in pools on a country by country basis 
capitalized costs include the cost of drilling and equipping productive wells  including the estimated costs of dismantling and abandoning these assets  dry hole costs  lease acquisition costs  seismic and other geological and geophysical costs  delay rentals and costs related to such activities 
employee costs associated with production and other operating activities and general corporate activities are expensed in the period incurred 

table of contents endeavour international corporation capitalized costs are limited on a country by country basis the ceiling test 
the ceiling test limitation is calculated as the sum of the present value of future net cash flows related to estimated production of proved reserves  using end of the current period prices including the effect of derivative instruments that qualify as cash flow hedges  discounted at  plus the lower of cost or estimated fair value of unproved properties  all net of expected income tax effects 
under the ceiling test  if the capitalized cost of the full cost pool  net of deferred taxes  exceeds the ceiling limitation  the excess is charged as an impairment expense 
we utilize a single cost center for each country where we have operations for amortization purposes 
any conveyances of properties are treated as adjustments to the cost of oil and gas properties with no gain or loss recognized unless the operations are suspended in the entire cost center or the conveyance is significant in nature 
unproved property costs include the costs associated with unevaluated properties and properties under development and are not included in the full cost amortization base where proved reserves exist until the project is evaluated 
these costs include unproved leasehold acreage  seismic data  wells and production facilities in progress and wells pending determination  together with interest costs capitalized for these projects 
seismic data costs are associated with specific unevaluated properties where the seismic data is acquired for the purpose of evaluating acreage or trends covered by a leasehold interest owned by us 
significant unproved properties are assessed periodically for possible impairment or reduction in value 
if a reduction in value has occurred  these property costs are considered impaired and are transferred to the related full cost pool 
geological and geophysical costs included in unproved properties are transferred to the full cost amortization base along with the associated leasehold costs on a specific project basis 
costs associated with wells in progress and wells pending determination are transferred to the amortization base once a determination is made whether or not proved reserves can be assigned to the property 
costs of dry holes are transferred to the amortization base immediately upon determination that the well is unsuccessful 
unproved properties whose acquisition costs are not individually significant are aggregated  the portion of such costs estimated to be ultimately nonproductive  based on experience  are amortized to the full cost pool over an average holding period 
in countries where the existence of proved reserves has not yet been determined  unevaluated property costs remain capitalized in unproved property cost centers until proved reserves have been established  exploration activities cease or impairment and reduction in value occurs 
if exploration activities result in the establishment of a proved reserve base  amounts in the unproved property cost center are reclassified as proved properties and become subject to amortization and the application of the ceiling test 
when it is determined that the value of unproved property costs have been permanently diminished in part or in whole based on the impairment evaluation and future exploration plans  the unproved property cost centers related to the area of interest are impaired  and accumulated costs charged against earnings 

table of contents endeavour international corporation we capitalize interest on expenditures for significant exploration and development projects while activities are in progress to bring the assets to their intended use 
capitalized interest is calculated by multiplying our weighted average interest rate on debt by the amount of qualifying costs and is limited to gross interest expense 
as costs are transferred to the full cost pool  the associated capitalized interest is also transferred to the full cost pool 
business combinations accounting for the acquisition of a business requires the allocation of the purchase price to the various assets and liabilities of the acquired business and recording deferred taxes for any differences between the allocated values and tax basis of assets and liabilities 
any excess of the purchase price over the amounts assigned to assets and liabilities is recorded as goodwill 
in connection with the several acquisitions  we recorded goodwill for the excess of the purchase price over the value assigned to individual assets acquired and liabilities assumed 
our fair value estimates for the acquisition are subject to change as additional information becomes available and is assessed 
purchase price allocation the purchase price allocation is accomplished by recording the asset or liability at its estimated fair value 
we use all available information to make these fair value determinations  including information commonly considered by our engineers in valuing individual oil and gas properties and sales prices for similar assets 
estimated deferred taxes are based on available information concerning the tax basis of the acquired company s assets and liabilities and carryforwards at the merger date  although such estimates may change in the future as additional information becomes known 
the amount of goodwill recorded in any particular business combination can vary significantly depending upon the values attributed to assets acquired and liabilities assumed relative to the total acquisition cost 
goodwill and intangible assets goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in an acquisition 
intangible assets represent the purchase price allocation to the assembled workforce as a result of the acquisition of nsnv  inc we assess the carrying amount of goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets by testing the asset for impairment annually at year end  or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired 
the impairment test requires allocating goodwill and all other assets and liabilities to reporting units 
the fair value of each reporting unit is determined and compared to the book value of the reporting unit 
an impairment loss is recognized to the extent that the carrying amount exceeds the asset s fair value 
at december   we had million of goodwill recorded related to past business combinations 
this goodwill is not amortized  but is required to be assessed for impairment annually  or more often as facts and circumstances warrant 
the first step of that process is to compare the fair value of the reporting unit to which goodwill has been assigned to the carrying amount of the associated net assets and goodwill 
the reporting units used to evaluate and measure goodwill for impairment are 
table of contents endeavour international corporation determined from the manner in which the business is managed 
we have determined we have a single reporting unit 
goodwill is tested annually at year end 
although we cannot predict when or if goodwill will be impaired  impairment charges may occur if we are unable to replace the value of our depleting asset base or if other adverse events for example  lower sustained oil and gas prices reduce the fair value of the reporting unit 
we completed our annual goodwill impairment test with no impairment indicated 
to determine the fair value of the company  we worked with a valuation consulting firm and used all available information  such as market multiples  the present values of expected cash flows and the effect of the announcement of drilling results where such drilling had begun 
in the determination of the present value of expected cash flows  we assumed production profiles consistent with our year end estimation of reserves that are disclosed in our supplemental oil and gas disclosures  market prices considering the forward price curve for oil and gas  adjusted for location and quality differentials that we currently receive  as well as capital and operating costs consistent with year end pricing  adjusted for management s view that such costs should decline in the near term to realign with lower commodity prices  and discount rates that management believes a market participant would utilize to consider the risks inherent in our operations 
we also considered our market capitalization based on average stock prices for days around december  and any premium a buyer might pay to obtain control of endeavour 
as part of this analysis  we considered the relatively few transactions in the market  trading multiples for peers to determine an appropriate multiple to apply against our projected ebitda  cash flows and reserves and the material results of our drilling program that were not publicly available at december  in the first quarter of  we announced the successful drilling results of wells at our cygnus and rochelle projects and the expansion of operations into the us 
while these activities were initiated in  the public markets were unaware of the positive outcomes until from december  through february  the date of the last of these three announcements  our common stock price increased  from per share to per share  respectively 
a lower fair value estimate in the future could result in impairment 
examples of factors that could cause a lower fair value estimate could be sustained declines in prices  increases in costs  and changes in discount rate assumptions due to market conditions 
dismantlement  restoration and environmental costs we recognize liabilities for asset retirement obligations associated with tangible long lived assets  such as producing well sites  offshore production platforms  and natural gas processing plants  with a corresponding increase in the related long lived asset 
the asset retirement cost is depreciated along with the property and equipment in the full cost pool 
the asset retirement obligation is recorded at fair value and accretion expense  recognized over the life of the property  increases the liability to its expected settlement value 
if the fair value of the estimated asset retirement obligation changes  an adjustment is recorded for both the asset retirement obligation and the asset retirement cost 
revenue recognition we use the entitlements method to account for sales of gas production 
we may receive more or less than our entitled share of production 
under the entitlements method  if we receive more than our entitled share of production  the imbalance is treated as a liability at the market price at the time the imbalance occurred 
if we receive less than our entitled share  the imbalance is recorded as an asset at the lower of the current market price or the market price at the time the imbalance occurred 
oil revenues are recognized when production is sold to a purchaser at a fixed or determinable price  when delivery has occurred  title has transferred and collectibility of the revenue is probable 

table of contents endeavour international corporation derivative instruments and hedging activities from time to time  we may utilize derivative financial instruments to hedge cash flows from operations or to hedge the fair value of financial instruments 
we may use derivative financial instruments with respect to a portion of our oil and gas production or a portion of our variable rate debt to achieve a more predictable cash flow by reducing our exposure to price fluctuations 
these transactions are likely to be swaps  collars or options and to be entered into with major financial institutions or commodities trading institutions 
derivative financial instruments are intended to reduce our exposure to declines in the market prices of crude oil and natural gas that we produce and sell  to increases in interest rates and to manage cash flows in support of our annual capital expenditure budget 
we also have two embedded derivatives related to our debt instruments 
we record all derivatives at fair market value in our consolidated balance sheets at the end of each period 
the accounting for the fair market value  and the changes from period to period  depends on the intended use of the derivative and the resulting designation 
this evaluation is determined at each derivative s inception and begins with the decision to account for the derivative as a hedge  if applicable 
the accounting for changes in the fair value of a derivative instrument that is not accounted for as a hedge is included in other income expense as an unrealized gain or loss 
where we intend to account for a derivative as a hedge  we document  at its inception  the hedging relationship  the risk management objective and the strategy for undertaking the hedge 
the documentation includes the identification of the hedging instrument  the hedged item or transaction  the nature of the risk being hedged  and the method that will be used to assess effectiveness of derivative instruments that receive hedge accounting treatment 
changes in fair value to hedge instruments  to the extent the hedge is effective  are recognized in other comprehensive income until the forecasted transaction occurs 
hedge effectiveness is assessed at least quarterly based on total changes in the derivative s fair value 
any ineffective portion of the derivative instrument s change in fair value is recognized immediately in other income expense 
we discontinue hedge accounting prospectively when we determine that the derivative is no longer effective in offsetting changes in the fair value or cash flows of a hedged item including hedged items such as firm commitments or forecasted transactions  the derivative expires  it is no longer probable that the forecasted transaction will occur  a hedged firm commitment no longer meets the definition of a firm commitment  or management determines that designating the derivative as a hedging instrument is no longer appropriate 
income taxes we use the liability method of accounting for income taxes under which deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the estimated future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities  and their respective tax bases 
deferred tax assets and 
table of contents endeavour international corporation liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized as part of the provision for income taxes in the period that includes the enactment date 
deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance when  in the opinion of management  it is more likely than not that some portion of  or all of  the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
stock based compensation arrangements we recognize all share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options  based on their fair values 
the share based compensation cost is measured at the grant date  based on the calculated fair value of the award  and is recognized as general and administrative expense over the employee s requisite service period generally the vesting period of the equity award 
we apply the fair value method in accounting for stock option grants to non employees using the black scholes method 
it is our policy to use authorized but unissued shares of stock when stock options are exercised 
at december   we had approximately million additional shares available for issuance pursuant to our existing stock incentive plan 
fair value we estimate fair value for the measurement of derivatives  long lived assets during certain impairment tests  reporting units for goodwill impairment testing and the initial measurement of an asset retirement obligation 
when we are required to measure fair value  and there is not a market observable price for the asset or liability  or a market observable price for a similar asset or liability  we generally utilize an income valuation approach 
this approach utilizes management s best assumptions regarding expectations of projected cash flows  and discounts the expected cash flows using a commensurate risk adjusted discount rate 
such evaluations involve a significant amount of judgment since the results are based on expected future events or conditions  such as sales prices  estimates of future oil and gas production  development and operating costs and the timing thereof  economic and regulatory climates and other factors 
our estimates of future net cash flows are inherently imprecise because they reflect management s expectation of future conditions that are often outside of management s control 
however  assumptions used reflect a market participant s view of long term prices  costs and other factors  and are consistent with assumptions used in our business plans and investment decisions 
recent accounting pronouncements in december  the fasb issued enhanced guidance related to the measurement of identifiable assets acquired  liabilities assumed and disclosure of information related to business combinations and their effect 
the standard applies prospectively to business combinations in and is not subject to early adoption 
we are currently evaluating the potential impact of this new guidance on business combinations and related valuations 

table of contents endeavour international corporation in december  the fasb issued a new standard for the noncontrolling interest in a subsidiary and for the deconsolidation of a subsidiary 
specifically  this statement requires the recognition of a noncontrolling interest minority interest as a component of consolidated equity 
this is a change from the current practice to present noncontrolling interests in liabilities or between liabilities and stockholders equity 
similarly  the new standard requires consolidated net income and comprehensive income to be reported at amounts that include the amounts attributable to both the parent and the noncontrolling interests 
the standard is effective prospectively with respect to transactions involving noncontrolling financial interests that occur on or after january  we are currently evaluating the potential impact  if any  of this new guidance 
in march  the fasb issued a new standard that requires entities to present expanded and detailed financial statement disclosures for their derivatives and hedged financial instruments 
this standard applies to all derivatives and non derivative instruments designated and qualifying as hedges  including bifurcated derivative instruments and related hedged items 
the new standard is effective for interim periods and fiscal years beginning after november  we do not expect the adoption of this pronouncement to have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations 
in may  the fasb posted a new staff position that applies to convertible debt that may be settled in part or in whole in cash upon conversion 
the new staff position requires required issuers of this form of debt to account for its debt and equity components separately 
the new position also expands the definition of convertible preferred shares of an entity s stock that are mandatorily redeemable financial instruments classified as liabilities 
the new fasb staff position is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years after december  and interim period within those fiscal years 
it must be applied retroactively to all presented periods 
we are currently evaluating the potential impact  if any  of this new guidance 
in june  the fasb issued a new staff position that addresses whether instruments that are granted in share based payment transactions are participating securities prior to vesting  and therefore are required to be included in the earnings allocation in the calculation of earnings per share eps under the two class method as described in a prior fasb standard 
the new staff position requires entities to treat unvested share based payment awards with non forfeitable rights to dividend or dividend equivalents as a separate class of securities in calculating eps 
the new staff position is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  we are currently evaluating the potential impact  if any  of this new guidance

in addition  interest on our convertible debt is added to the outstanding principal balance each quarter and reflected as due upon maturity 
as is common in the oil and gas industry  we operate in many instances through joint ventures under joint operating or similar agreements 
typically  the operator under a joint operating agreement enters into contracts  such as rig commitment contracts  for the benefit of all joint venture partners 
through the joint operating agreement  the non operators reimburse  and in some cases advance  the funds necessary to meet the contractual obligations entered into by the operator 
these obligations are typically shared on a working interest basis 
the joint operating agreement provides remedies to the operator in the event that the non operator does not satisfy its share of the contractual obligations 
occasionally  the operator is permitted by the joint operating agreement to enter into lease obligations and other contractual commitments that are then passed on to the non operating joint interest owners as lease operating expenses  frequently without any identification as to the long term nature of any commitments underlying such expenses 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk foreign exchange risk the international scope of our business operations exposes us to the risk of fluctuations in foreign currency markets 
as a result  we are subject to foreign currency exchange rate risk due to effects that foreign exchange rate movements have on our costs and on the cash flows that we receive from foreign operations 
our oil 
table of contents endeavour international corporation revenues are received in us dollars while gas revenues are received in pounds sterling or norwegian kroner 
capital expenditures  payroll and operating expenses may be denominated in us dollars  pounds sterling or norwegian kroner 
we operate a centralized currency management operation to take advantage of potential opportunities to naturally offset exposures against each other 
to date  we have addressed our foreign currency exchange rate risks principally by maintaining our liquid assets in interest bearing accounts  until payments in foreign currency are required  but we have not reduced this risk by hedging to date 
commodity price risk we produce and sell crude oil and natural gas 
realized pricing is primarily driven by the prevailing worldwide price for crude oil and regional gas spot market prices which have been volatile and unpredictable for several years 
as a result  our financial results can be significantly impacted as these commodity prices fluctuate widely in response to changing market forces 
we may engage in oil and gas hedging activities to realize commodity prices which we consider favorable 
at december   we had the following commodity derivative instruments outstanding total oil fixed price swap mbbl weighted average price barrel costless collar mbbl weighted average ceiling price barrel weighted average floor price barrel gas fixed price swap mmcf weighted average price mcf costless collar mmcf weighted average ceiling price mcf weighted average floor price mcf gas derivative contracts are designated in therms and have been converted to mcf at a rate of therm to mcf

table of contents endeavour international corporation interest rate risk we are exposed to changes in interest rates 
changes in interest rates affect the interest earned on cash and cash equivalents and the interest rate paid on borrowings under debt 
in  we entered into an interest rate swap for a notional amount of million whereby we pay a fixed rate of and receive three month libor through november a point change in basis points on libor would not result in a material change in our annual interest expense  given our floating rate debt at december  and the interest rate swap
