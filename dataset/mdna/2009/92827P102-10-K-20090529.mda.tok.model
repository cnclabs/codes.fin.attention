using our enhanced global delivery model  innovative platforming approach and industry expertise  we provide cost effective services that enable our clients to use it to enhance business 
table of contents performance  accelerate time to market  increase productivity and improve customer service 
headquartered in massachusetts  we have offices in the united states and the united kingdom and global delivery centers in hyderabad and chennai  india and colombo  sri lanka 
at march   we had  employees  or team members  and for the fiscal year ended march   we had revenue of million and income from operations of million 
in our fiscal year ended march   our revenue increased to million compared to million in our fiscal year ended march  net income decreased by million to million in our fiscal year ended march   as compared to million in our fiscal year ended march  the key drivers of our revenue growth in our fiscal year ended march  were as follows greater penetration of the north american market  where we experienced revenue growth of in our fiscal year ended march  as compared to our fiscal year ended march  strong performance of our bfsi industry vertical  which had fiscal year over year growth of  and our media and information and other industry vertical which had fiscal year over year growth of approximately increased penetration at existing clients the key drivers of our decrease in net income in our fiscal year ended march  were as follows lower revenue contribution from our largest client lower utilization and increased costs of revenue  particularly in the first half of the fiscal year ended march  substantial depreciation of the uk pound sterling against the us dollar high repeat business and client concentration is common in our industry 
during our fiscal year ended march   of our revenue was derived from clients who had been using our services for more than one year 
accordingly  our global account management and service delivery teams focus on expanding client relationships and converting new engagements to long term relationships to generate repeat revenue and expand revenue streams from existing clients 
we also have a dedicated business development team focused on generating engagements with new clients to continue to expand our client base  and over time  reduce client concentration 
our european revenue decreased to million  or of total revenue  from million  or of total revenue for the fiscal years ended march  and march   respectively 
the primary reasons for the decline in european revenue were due to lower revenue contribution by our largest client and substantial depreciation of the uk pound sterling against the uk dollar 
we perform our services under both time and materials and fixed price contracts 
revenue from fixed price contracts was   and of total revenue for the fiscal years ended march   and  respectively 
the increased revenue earned from fixed price contracts reflects our clients preferences 
as an it services company  our revenue growth has been  and will continue to be  highly dependent on our ability to attract  develop  motivate and retain skilled it professionals 
there is intense competition for it professionals with the skills necessary to provide the type of services we offer 
we closely monitor our overall attrition rates and patterns to ensure our people management strategy aligns with our growth objectives 
for the last twelve months ended march   our voluntary attrition rate was  while our involuntary attrition rate was 
if our attrition rate increases and is sustained at higher levels  our growth may slow and our cost of attracting and retaining it professionals could increase 
in our fiscal year ended march   we initiated a hedging strategy using forward contracts designed to hedge fluctuation in the indian rupee against the us dollar and us pound sterling 
since inception  
table of contents the hedging programs have been effective at minimizing the impact from fluctuations in local currencies on operating results 
however  there is no assurance that these hedging programs will continue to be effective 
we continually monitor and manage a number of operating metrics to ensure quality and reduce volatility in our earnings  including days sales outstanding  or dso  is a measure of the number of days our accounts receivable are outstanding based upon the last days of revenue activity  which indicates the timeliness of our cash collection from clients and our overall credit terms to our clients 
dso was days and days as of march  and march   respectively 
higher dso reduces our cash balance because the revenue to cash conversion process takes longer 
realized billing rates are the rates we charge our clients for our services  which reflect the value our clients place on our services  market competition and the geographic location in which we perform our services 
our realized billing rates were relatively stable for our fiscal years ended march  and any increase in realized billing rates is a result of our ability to successfully preserve or increase our billing rates with existing and or new clients 
average cost per it professional is the sum of team member salaries  including variable compensation  and fringe benefits divided by the average number of it professionals during the period 
we experienced a decrease in our average cost per it professional in asia of from our fiscal year ended march  to our fiscal year ended march   primarily driven by the year over year depreciation of the indian rupee and sri lankan rupee against the us dollar 
utilization rate is the percentage of time billable it professionals are deployed on client engagements  which indicates the efficiency of our billable it resources 
our utilization rate is defined as number of billable hours divided by the total number of available hours of our it professionals in a given period of time  excluding trainees 
we track our utilization rates to measure revenue potential and gross profit margins 
management s targeted range for utilization is between and 
generally  gross margin moves directionally with utilization rate 
utilization is affected by the rate of quarterly sequential revenue growth 
in growth periods  utilization tends to rise as more resources are deployed to meet rising demand 
attrition rate is the ratio of terminated team members during the latest twelve months to the total number of team members at the end of such period  which measures team member turnover 
increased voluntary attrition rates result in increased hiring  training and boarding costs and productivity losses  which may affect our revenue  gross margin and operating profit margin 
our voluntary attrition rate was while our involuntary attrition was for the fiscal year ended march  our voluntary attrition rate was for our fiscal year ended march   while our involuntary attrition rate was immaterial for the same fiscal year 
operating expense efficiency is a measure of operating expenses as a percentage of revenue 
if we continue to successfully grow our revenue  we anticipate that operating expenses will decrease as a percentage of revenue as such expenses are absorbed across a larger revenue base 
in the near term  however  any operating expense efficiency may decline if our revenue declines 
effective tax rate is our worldwide tax expense as a percentage of our consolidated net income before tax  which measures the impact of income taxes worldwide on our operations and net income 
we monitor and assess our effective tax rate to evaluate whether our tax structure is competitive as compared to our industry 
our effective tax rate was for the fiscal year ended march  as compared to an effective tax rate of for the fiscal year ended march  the decrease is primarily due to the change in the geographic mix of our profit 
we anticipate that our effective tax rate will increase in our fiscal years ending after march  when our india stpi tax holiday expires 

table of contents onsite to offshore mix is the measurement of hours billed by resources located offshore to hours billed onsite by our team members over a defined period 
we strive to manage both fixed price contracts and time and materials engagements to a highly efficient  or better  onsite to offshore service delivery team mix 
sources of revenue we generate revenue by providing it services to our clients located primarily in the united states and the united kingdom 
we have historically earned and believe that over the next few years we will continue to earn a significant portion of our revenue from a limited number of clients 
for the fiscal year ended march   our five largest and ten largest clients accounted for and of our revenue  respectively 
our three largest clients accounted for   and  respectively  of our revenue for the fiscal year ended march  the loss of any one of our major clients could reduce our revenue and operating profit and harm our reputation in the industry 
during the fiscal year ended march   of our revenue was generated in the united states and in the united kingdom 
we provide it services on either a time and materials or a fixed price basis 
for the fiscal year ended march   the percentage of revenue from time and materials and fixed price contracts was and  respectively 
revenue from services provided on a time and materials basis is derived from the number of billable hours in a period multiplied by the contractual rates at which we bill our clients 
revenue from services provided on a fixed price basis is recognized as efforts are expended pursuant to the percentage of completion method 
revenue also includes reimbursements of travel and out of pocket expenses with equivalent amounts of expense recorded in costs of revenue 
most of our client contracts  including those that are on a fixed price basis  can be terminated by our clients with or without cause on to days prior written notice 
all fees for services provided by us through the date of cancellation are generally due and payable under the contract terms 
our unit pricing is driven by business need  delivery timeframes  complexity of the engagement  operating differences such as onsite offshore ratio  competitive environment and engagement size or volume 
as a pricing strategy to encourage clients to increase the volume of services that we provide to them  we may  on occasion  offer volume discounts 
we manage our business carefully to protect our account margins and our overall profit margins 
we find that our clients generally purchase on the basis of total value  rather than minimum cost  considering all of the factors listed above 
while we are subject to the effects of overall market pricing pressure  we believe that there is a fairly broad range of pricing offered by different competitors for each service we provide 
we believe that no one competitor  or set of competitors  sets pricing in our industry 
we find that our unit pricing  as a result of our global delivery model  is generally competitive with other firms who operate with a predominately offshore operating model 
the proportion of work performed at our offshore facilities and at onsite client locations varies from period to period 
effort  in terms of the percentage of hours billed to clients by onsite resources  was and of total hours billed in each of the fiscal years ended march  and  respectively  while the revenue from onsite and offshore resources accounted for and and and  during the fiscal years ended march  and  respectively 
we charge higher rates and incur higher compensation costs and other expenses for work performed at client locations in the united states and the united kingdom as compared to work performed at our global delivery centers in india and sri lanka 
services performed at client locations or at our offices in the united states or the united kingdom generate higher revenue per capita at lower gross margins than similar services performed at our global delivery centers in india and sri lanka 
we manage to a  or better  onsite to offshore service delivery mix and intend to manage to an efficient onsite to offshore service delivery ratio for the foreseeable future 

table of contents costs of revenue and gross profit costs of revenue consist principally of payroll and related fringe benefits  reimbursable and non reimbursable costs  immigration related expenses  fees for subcontractors working on client engagements and share based compensation expense for it professionals including account management personnel 
wage costs in india and sri lanka have historically been significantly lower than wage costs in the united states and europe for comparably skilled it professionals 
however  wages in india and sri lanka are increasing in local currency  which will result in increased costs for it professionals  particularly project managers and other mid level professionals 
we may need to increase the levels of our team member compensation more rapidly than in the past to remain competitive without the ability to make corresponding increases to our billing rates 
compensation increases may reduce our profit margins  make us less competitive in pricing potential projects against those companies with lower cost resources and otherwise harm our business  operating results and financial condition 
we deploy a campus hiring philosophy and encourage internal promotions to minimize the effects of wage inflation pressure and recruiting costs 
additionally  any material appreciation in the indian or sri lankan rupee against the us dollar or uk pound sterling could have a material adverse impact on our cost of services 
our revenue and gross profit are also affected by our ability to efficiently manage and utilize our it professionals  as well as fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates 
we define utilization rate as the total number of days billed in a given period divided by the total available days of our it professionals during that same period  excluding trainees 
we manage employee utilization by continually monitoring project requirements and timetables to efficiently staff our projects and meet our clients needs 
the number of it professionals assigned to a project will vary according to the size  complexity  duration and demands of the project 
an unanticipated termination or reduction of a significant project could cause us to experience a higher than expected number of unassigned it professionals  thereby lowering our utilization rate 
although  we have adopted an eight quarter cash flow hedging program to minimize the effect of the indian rupee movement on our financial condition  these hedges may not be effective or may cause us to forego benefits  especially given the volatility of these currencies 
in addition  to the extent that these hedges do not qualify for hedge accounting  we may have to recognize gains or losses on the aggregate amount of hedges placed earlier than expected 
operating expenses operating expenses consist primarily of payroll and related fringe benefits  commissions  selling  share based compensation and non reimbursable costs  as well as promotion  communications  management  finance  administrative  occupancy  marketing and depreciation and amortization expenses 
in the fiscal years ended march   and  we invested in all aspects of our business  including sales  marketing  it infrastructure  facilities  human resources programs and financial operations 
additionally  any material appreciation in the indian or sri lankan rupee against the us dollar or us pound sterling could have a material adverse impact on our cost of operating expenses 
we have adopted an eight quarter hedging program to mitigate the effect of the indian rupee on our cost of operating expenses  although such hedging program may be ineffective 
although  we have adopted an eight quarter cash flow hedging program to minimize the effect of the indian rupee movement on our financial condition  these hedges may not be effective or may cause us to forego benefits  especially given the volatility of these currencies 
in addition  to the extent that these hedges do not qualify for hedge accounting  we may have to recognize gains or losses on the aggregate amount of hedges placed earlier than expected 
other income expense other income expense includes interest income  interest expense  investment gains and losses and foreign currency transaction gains and losses and disposal of fixed assets 
we generate interest income by 
table of contents investing in money market instruments  short term investments and long term investments 
the functional currencies of our subsidiaries are their local currencies 
foreign currency gains and losses are generated primarily by fluctuations of the indian rupee  sri lankan rupee and uk pound sterling against the uk dollar on intercompany transactions 
we place our cash in liquid investments at highly rated financial institutions 
we believe that our credit policies reflect normal industry terms and business risk 
income tax expense benefit our net income is subject to income tax in those countries in which we perform services and have operations  including india  sri lanka  the united kingdom and the united states 
in previous years  we accumulated net operating loss carry forwards which were used to offset us taxable income into fiscal we have benefited from long term income tax holiday arrangements in both india and sri lanka that are offered to certain export oriented it services firms 
as a result of these net operating losses and tax holiday arrangements  our worldwide profit has been subject to a relatively low effective tax rate as compared to the statutory rates in the countries in which we operate 
the effect of the income tax holidays increased our net income in the fiscal years ended march  and by million and million  respectively 
our effective tax rates were and for the fiscal years ended march  and  respectively 
during the fiscal year ended march   we determined that it was more likely than not that our deferred tax assets would be realized based upon our positive cumulative operating results and our assessment of our expected future results 
as a result  we released our valuation allowance and recognized a discrete income tax benefit of million in our statement of income for the fiscal year ended march  our effective tax rate in future periods will be affected by the geographic distribution of our earnings  as well as the availability of tax holidays in india and sri lanka 
application of critical accounting estimates and risks our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with united states generally accepted accounting principles  or gaap 
preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of revenue and expenses  assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
we consider an accounting estimate to be critical to the preparation of our financial statements when both of the following are present the estimate is complex in nature or requires a high degree of judgment  and the use of different estimates and assumptions could have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements 
we have discussed the development and selection of our critical accounting estimates and related disclosures with the audit committee of our board of directors 
those estimates critical to the preparation of our consolidated financial statements are listed below 
revenue recognition our revenue is derived from a variety of it consulting  technology implementation and application outsourcing services 
our services are performed under both time and material and fixed price arrangements 
all revenue is recognized pursuant to gaap 
revenue is recognized as work is performed and amounts are earned in accordance with the sec staff accounting bulletin  or sab  no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements  as amended by sab no 
 revenue recognition 
we consider amounts to be earned once evidence of an arrangement has been obtained  services are delivered  fees are fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured 
for contracts with fees billed on a time and materials basis  we generally recognize revenue as the service is performed 

table of contents fixed price engagements are accounted for under the percentage of completion method in accordance with the american institute of certified public accountants statement of position  or sop   accounting for performance of construction type and certain production type contracts 
under the percentage of completion method  we estimate the percentage of completion by comparing the actual number of work days performed to date to the estimated total number of days required to complete each engagement 
the use of the percentage of completion method requires significant judgment relative to estimating total contract revenue and costs to completion  including assumptions and estimates relative to the length of time to complete the project  the nature and complexity of the work to be performed and anticipated changes in other engagement related costs 
estimates of total contract revenue and costs to completion are continually monitored during the term of the contract and are subject to revision as the contract progresses 
unforeseen circumstances may arise during an engagement requiring us to revise our original estimates and may cause the estimated profitability to decrease 
when revisions in estimated contract revenue and efforts are determined  such adjustments are recorded in the period in which they are first identified 
valuation and impairment of investments and or marketable securities our investments and or marketable securities are accounted for according to statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities sfas no 

pursuant to sfas no 
 we classify our marketable securities as available for sale or trading securities  and carry them at fair market value 
changes in fair value subsequent to the balance sheet date are recorded in the period they occur 
the difference between amortized cost and fair market value  net of tax effect  for available for sale securities is recorded as a separate component of stockholders equity 
the difference between amortized cost and fair market value for trading securities is reflected in other income  net on our consolidated statement of operations 
investments and or marketable securities classified as available for sale are considered to be impaired when a decline in fair value below cost basis is determined to be other than temporary 
in the event that the cost basis of a security exceeds its fair value  we evaluate  among other factors the duration of the period that  and extent to which  the fair value is less than cost basis  the financial health of the business outlook for the issuer  including industry and sector performance  and operational and financing cash flow factors  overall market conditions and trends  and our intent and ability to hold the investment 
once a decline in fair value is determined to be other than temporary  a write down is recorded through earnings 
assessing the above factors involves inherent uncertainty 
accordingly  write downs  if recorded  could be materially different from the actual market performance of investments and or marketable securities in our portfolio  if  among other things  relevant information related to our investments and or marketable securities was not publicly available or other factors not considered by us would have been relevant to the determination of impairment 
our investments in auction rate securities and the related put option are valued primarily based on an income approach using an estimate of future cash flows because there are currently no active markets or observable market prices 
we have estimated the fair value using a discounted cash flow analysis which considered the following key inputs i the underlying structure and maturity of each security  ii the timing of expected future principal and interest payments  and iii discount rates that are believed to reflect current market conditions and the relevant risk associated with each security 
derivative instruments and hedging activities we enter into forward foreign exchange contracts to mitigate the risk of changes in foreign exchange rates on inter company transactions and forecasted transactions denominated in foreign currencies 
certain of these transactions meet the criteria for hedge accounting as cash flow hedges under sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
changes in the fair values of these hedges are deferred and recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income losses  net of tax 
table of contents until the hedged transactions occur and are then recognized in the statement of income 
changes in the fair value for other derivative contracts and the ineffective portion of hedging instruments are recognized in the statement of income of each period and are included in foreign exchange gains losses  net and other income expense  net  respectively 
we value our derivatives based on market observable inputs including both forward and spot prices for currencies 
any significant change in the forward or spot prices for currencies would have a significant impact on the value of our derivatives 
income taxes the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax regulations in multiple jurisdictions 
we record liabilities for estimated tax obligations in the united states and other tax jurisdictions 
determining the consolidated provision for income tax expense  tax reserves  deferred tax assets and liabilities and related valuation allowance  if any  involves judgment 
we calculate and provide for income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate  including india  sri lanka  the united states  the united kingdom  and the netherlands  and this can involve complex issues which require an extended period of time to resolve 
in the year of any such resolution  additional adjustments may need to be recorded that result in increases or decreases to income 
our overall effective tax rate fluctuates due to a variety of factors  including arm s length prices for our intercompany transactions  changes in the geographic mix or estimated level of annual pretax income  as well as newly enacted tax legislation in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
applicable transfer pricing regulations require that transactions between and among our subsidiaries be conducted at an arm s length price 
on an ongoing basis  we estimate appropriate arm s length prices and use such estimates for our intercompany transactions 
at each financial statement date we evaluate whether a valuation allowance is needed to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
this evaluation considers the weight of all available evidence  including both future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies 
in the event that we determine that we will not be able to realize a recognized deferred tax asset in the future  an adjustment to the valuation allowance would be made resulting in a decrease in income in the period such determination was made 
likewise  should we determine that we will be able to realize all or part of an unrecognized deferred tax asset in the future  an adjustment to the valuation allowance would be made resulting in an increase to income or equity in the case of excess stock option tax benefits 
we have benefited from long term income tax holiday arrangements in both india and sri lanka 
one of our indian subsidiaries is an export oriented company that is entitled to claim a tax exemption for a period of ten years for each software technology park  or stp  it operates 
both of our stp holidays will be completely phased out by march and  at that time  any profits could be fully taxable at the indian statutory rate  which is currently 
during the fiscal year ended march  most of our profits in india were generated from our stps 
although we believe we have complied with  and are eligible for  the stp holidays  it is possible that upon examination the government of india may deem us ineligible for the stp holidays or make adjustments to the profit level 
we have located new development centers in areas designated as special economic zones  or sezs  to secure additional tax exemptions for these operations for a period of ten years  which could extend to years if we meet certain reinvestment requirements 
our sri lankan subsidiary has been granted an income tax holiday by the sri lanka board of investment which expires on march  the tax holiday is contingent upon a certain level of job creation by us during a given timetable 
any inability to meet the agreed upon level or timetable for new job creation would jeopardize the benefits from this holiday arrangement 
primarily as a result of these tax holiday arrangements  our worldwide profit has been subject to a relatively low effective tax rate  and the loss of any of these arrangements would increase our overall effective tax rate 

table of contents it is our intent to reinvest all accumulated earnings from india and sri lanka back into their respective operations to fund growth 
as a component of this strategy  pursuant to accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for income taxes special areas  we do not accrue incremental us taxes on indian  sri lanka  or us earnings as these earnings are considered to be permanently or indefinitely reinvested outside of the united states 
if such earnings were to be repatriated in the future or are no longer deemed to be indefinitely reinvested  we will accrue the applicable amount of taxes associated with such earnings  which would increase our overall effective tax rate 
share based compensation under the fair value recognition provisions of sfas no 
r  share based payment  share based compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the value of the award and is recognized over the vesting period 
determining the fair value of the share based awards at the grant date requires judgment  including estimating the expected term over which stock options will be outstanding before they are exercised  the expected volatility of our stock  the number of share based awards that are expected to be forfeited and due to a recent tax law change in india  the expected exercise proceeds for share based awards subject to the indian fringe benefit tax 
if actual results differ significantly from our estimates  share based compensation expense and our results of operations could be materially impacted 
effective april   a new fringe benefit tax was introduced in india that obligates us to pay  upon the exercise or distribution of shares under a stock based compensation award  a non income related tax on the appreciation of the award from date of grant to the date of total vesting 
we intend to collect the cash amount of the fringe benefit tax from our team members 
however under gaap  the stock based indian fringe benefit tax expense is required to be recorded as an operating expense and the related cash recovery of such tax from our team members is required to be recorded to stockholders equity as proceeds from a stock based compensation award 
our future operating results may experience volatility as a result of the timing of exercise or distribution of shares related to stock based compensation awards to our team members who worked or are working in india 
the amount of stock based indian fringe benefit tax expense recorded during our fiscal year ended march  was immaterial 
we established a stock appreciation rights plan  or sar plan  during the fiscal year ended march  prior to our ipo in august  under the terms of the sar plan  all stock appreciation rights  or sars  were settled in cash and the compensation cost and future liability for these sars were determined using the fair value at the grant date and remeasuring the fair value of the vested sars at the close of each reporting period 
after our ipo  we are obligated under the sar plan to settle all sars in shares of our common stock 
therefore  the sars are now equity classified and are no longer remeasured 
the liability measured as of our ipo date was million and this amount has been reclassified as a component of additional paid in capital subsequent to our ipo

as a percentage of revenue  income from operations increased marginally from in the fiscal year ended march  to in the fiscal year ended march   primarily due to our lower operating expenses as a percentage of revenue  offset by a lower gross margin 
other income other income increased from million in the fiscal year ended march  to million in the fiscal year ended march  the increase was primarily attributed to an increase in interest income of million  from million in the fiscal year ended march  to million in the fiscal year ended march   partially offset by the increase in foreign currency transaction losses of million  primarily due to the effects of a weaker us dollar against the indian rupee and losses from our hedging program in the period 
the increase in interest income was due to an increase in average cash and cash equivalents and our investment balances during the fiscal year ended march  as a result of our ipo  when compared to the fiscal year ended march  income tax expense benefit we had an income tax benefit of million in the fiscal year ended march  compared to an income tax expense of million in the fiscal year ended march  our effective tax rate was an income tax benefit rate of for the fiscal year ended march   which was largely due to the recognition of a discrete income tax benefit of approximately million due to the release of our 
table of contents deferred tax asset valuation allowance in our statement of income during the fiscal year ended march   as compared to an effective tax rate of for the fiscal year ended march  net income net income decreased from million in the fiscal year ended march  to million in the fiscal year ended march  this decrease was driven primarily by the recognition of a discrete income tax benefit due to the release of our deferred tax asset valuation allowance during the fiscal year ended march   which offset an increase in income from operations and other income during the fiscal year ended march  liquidity and capital resources we completed an ipo of our common stock on august  in connection with our ipo  we issued and sold  shares of common stock at a public offering price of per share 
we received net proceeds of million after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions of million and offering costs of million 
we have financed our operations from sales of shares of equity securities  including preferred and common stock and from cash from operations 
we have not borrowed against our existing or preceding credit facilities 
as of march   we had cash and cash equivalents and short term investments of million  of which million was held outside the united states 
we have a million revolving line of credit with a bank 
this facility provides a million sub limit for letters of credit 
the revolving line of credit also includes a foreign exchange line of credit requiring of the notional amount of foreign exchange contracts to be supported by our borrowing base 
advances under our credit facility accrue interest at an annual rate equal to plus the greater of i the prime rate or ii 
our credit facility is secured by certain us assets in favor of the bank and contains financial and reporting covenants and limitations 
we are currently in compliance with all covenants contained in our credit facility and believe that our credit facility provides sufficient flexibility so that we will remain in compliance with its terms 
we currently have a million outstanding letter of credit under the facility to collateralize our office lease in westborough  ma 
as of march   we have no other amounts outstanding under this credit facility 
we are currently renegotiating our credit facility  which expires on june  there were foreign currency derivative contracts with a notional amount of million outstanding at march   some of which we purchased through the bank with whom we have our credit facility and have collateralized under such facility 
in addition  we have purchased the remaining balance of our foreign currency derivative contracts through another bank and have pledged million as restricted cash as security supporting these derivative contracts 
we believe that our available cash and cash equivalents  short term investments and cash flows expected to be generated from operations will be adequate to satisfy our current and planned operations for at least the next twelve months 
our ability to expand and grow our business in accordance with current plans and to meet our long term capital requirements will depend on many factors  including the rate  if any  at which our cash flow increases  our continued intent not to repatriate earnings from india and sri lanka and the availability of public and private debt and equity financing 
any funds held at locations outside the united states are for future operating expenses and expansion of our business  and we have no intention of repatriating those funds 
to the extent we decide to pursue one or more significant strategic acquisitions  we may incur debt or sell additional equity to finance those acquisitions  although we can make no assurance that such financing alternatives will be available  or available in favorable terms 
in november  we entered into an agreement with ubs ubs  the investment firm that had sold us auction rate securities at a par value of million 
under the agreement with ubs  we received the right the put option to sell these auction rate securities back to ubs at par  at our sole discretion  any 
table of contents time during the period from june  through july   and gave ubs the right to purchase these auction rate securities or sell these securities on our behalf at par any time after the execution of the agreement through july  we elected to measure the put option under the fair value option of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 and recorded a gain of million  and recorded a corresponding long term asset 
as a result of entering into an agreement with ubs  we recognized an other than temporary impairment loss of million on the related auction rate security investments 
simultaneously  we transferred these auction rate securities from available for sale to trading investment securities 
the recording of the put option and the recognition of the other than temporary impairment loss did not impact the consolidated statement of operations for the fiscal year ended march  subsequent changes in the fair value of the put option have been offset by the changes in the fair value of the related auction rate securities with no material net impact to the consolidated statement of operations which we expect will continue in the future 
beginning in fiscal  our uk subsidiary entered into an agreement with an unrelated financial institution to sell  without recourse  certain of its european based accounts receivable balances from one client to such third party financial institution 
during the course of fiscal  million of receivables were sold under the terms of the financing agreement 
fees paid pursuant to this financing agreement were immaterial during the current fiscal year 
no amounts were due as of march   but we may elect to utilize this program again in future periods 
however  we cannot provide any assurances that this or any other financing facilities will be available or utilized in the future 
anticipated capital expenditures we are constructing a facility as part of a planned campus on a acre site in hyderabad  india 
we intend to continue the construction and build out of this facility over the next two fiscal years  which will be approximately  square feet  at a total estimated cost of million  of which we anticipate spending approximately million during the fiscal year ending march  through march   we have spent million toward the completion of this facility with approximately million spent during the fiscal year ended march  other capital expenditures during the fiscal year ended march  were approximately million 
we expect other capital expenditures in the normal course of business during the fiscal year ended march  to be approximately million  primarily for leasehold improvements  capital equipment and purchased software

while our board of directors has approved the share purchasing guidelines  the timing of repurchases and the exact number of shares of common stock to be purchased will be determined by our management  at their discretion  and will depend upon market conditions and other factors 
we have funded the program by using our cash on hand and cash generated from operations 
we may extend  suspend or discontinue the program at any time 
during the fiscal year ended march   we purchased  shares of our common stock for an aggregate purchase price of approximately million  representing an average purchase price per share of 
we have recorded repurchased shares as treasury shares and we will hold these shares in treasury until our board of directors designates that these shares be retired or used for other purposes

during our fiscal year ended march   we adopted a foreign currency cash flow hedging program designed to further mitigate the risks of volatility in the indian rupee against the us dollar and uk pound sterling as described below in qualitative and quantitative disclosures about market risk

other than these foreign currency derivative contracts  we have not entered into off balance sheet transactions  arrangements or other relationships with unconsolidated entities or other persons that are likely to affect liquidity or the availability of or requirements for capital resources

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk foreign currency exchange rate risk we are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk in the ordinary course of business 
we have historically entered into  and in the future we may enter into  foreign currency derivative contracts to minimize the impact of foreign currency fluctuations on both foreign currency denominated assets and forecasted expenses 
the purpose of this foreign exchange policy is to protect us from the risk that the recognition of and eventual cash flows related to indian rupee denominated expenses might be affected by changes in exchange rates 
certain of these contracts meet the criteria for hedge accounting as cash flow hedges under sfas  accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
we evaluate our foreign exchange policy on an ongoing basis to assess our ability to address foreign exchange exposures on our balance sheet  income statement and operating cash flows from all foreign currencies  including most significantly the uk pound sterling  indian rupee  and the sri lankan rupee 
during the fiscal year ended march   we adopted a foreign currency hedging program to mitigate the risks of volatility in the indian rupee against the us dollar and us pound sterling 
the us dollar equivalent market value of the outstanding foreign currency derivative contracts as of march  was million 
recently  the us dollar has strengthened materially against the us pound sterling which has had  and may continue to have  a negative impact on our revenue generated in uk pound sterling 
in response to this volatility  we have entered into new hedging transactions designed to hedge our forecasted sales and expenses denominated in the uk pound sterling 
the derivative contracts are less than days in duration and do not meet the criteria for hedge accounting 
such hedges may not be effective in mitigating this currency volatility 
during the fiscal year ended march   we made a one time reclassification of certain intercompany payables of million from short term to long term to further capitalize our uk subsidiary 
from time to time  we may also purchase multiple foreign currency forward contracts designed to hedge fluctuation in foreign currencies  such as the uk pound sterling  against the uk dollar  and multiple foreign currency hedges designed to hedge foreign currency transactions and gains and losses on our intercompany balances 
assuming the amount of expenditures by our indian operations were consistent with fiscal and the timing of the funding of these operations were to remain consistent during our fiscal year ending march   a constant increase or decrease in the exchange rate between the indian rupee and the us dollar during fiscal of would impact our net income by million excluding the effect of foreign currency derivative contracts which would offset approximately of the impact 

table of contents interest rate risk we had no debt outstanding as of march  we do not believe we are exposed to material direct risks associated with changes in interest rates other than with our cash and cash equivalents  short term investments and long term investments 
as of march   we had million in cash and cash equivalents  short term investments and long term investments  the interest income from which is affected by changes in interest rates 
our invested securities primarily consist of government sponsored entity bonds  money market mutual funds  commercial paper  corporate debts and auction rate securities 
our investments in debt securities are classified as either available for sale or trading and are recorded at fair value 
our available for sale and trading investments are sensitive to changes in interest rates 
interest rate changes would result in a change in the net fair value of these financial instruments due to the difference between the market interest rate and the market interest rate at the date of purchase of the financial instrument 
a basis point decrease in market interest rates at march  would impact the net fair value of such interest sensitive financial instruments by million 
concentration of credit risk financial instruments which potentially expose us to concentrations of credit risk primarily consist of cash and cash equivalents  short term investments and long term investments  accounts receivable  derivative contracts  other financial assets and unbilled accounts receivable 
we place our operating cash  investments and derivatives in highly rated financial institutions 
we adhere to a formal investment policy with the primary objective of preservation of principal  which contains credit rating minimums and diversification requirements 
we believe that our credit policies reflect normal industry terms and business risk 
we do not anticipate non performance by the counterparties and  accordingly  do not require collateral 
credit losses and write offs of accounts receivable balances have historically not been material to our financial statements and have not exceeded our expectations 
as widely reported  financial markets in the united states  europe and asia have been experiencing extreme disruption in recent periods  including  among other things  extreme volatility in security prices  severely diminished liquidity and credit availability  rating downgrades of certain investments and declining valuations of others 
while we do not currently require access to credit markets to finance our operations  these economic developments affect our clients in a number of ways 
the current tightening of credit in financial markets adversely affects the ability of our clients to obtain financing for their operations and could result in decreased global it spending which  in turn  could result in delays  reductions in  or cancellation of engagements for our services 
regional and global economic weakness and uncertainty have also resulted in some companies reassessing their spending for technology and it related projects and services 
we are unable to predict the likely duration and severity of the current disruption in financial markets and adverse economic conditions in the united states and other countries 
our revenue and profitability depend on the overall demand for it services from our clients  including discretionary it spending 
as a result of the worldwide economic slowdown  it is extremely difficult for us to forecast future revenue growth based on historical information and trends 
portions of our expenses are fixed and other expenses are tied to expected levels of utilization 
to the extent that we do not achieve anticipated level of revenue growth  our gross profit and net income could be adversely affected until such expenses are reduced to an appropriate level 
in november  we entered into an agreement with ubs  the investment firm that had sold us auction rate securities at a par value of  under the agreement  we received the right the put option to sell these auction rate securities back to ubs at par  at our sole discretion  any time during the period from june  through july   and gave ubs the right to purchase these auction rate securities or sell these securities on our behalf at par any time after the execution of the agreement through july  we elected to measure the put option under the fair value option of sfas no 
 and recorded income of million  and recorded a corresponding long term asset 
as a result of entering into an agreement with ubs  we recognized an other than temporary impairment loss of million on 
table of contents the related auction rate security investments 
simultaneously  we transferred these auction rate securities from available for sale to trading investment securities 
the recording of the put option and the recognition of the other than temporary impairment loss did not impact the consolidated statement of operations for the fiscal year ended march  the value of the put option at march  was million 
we anticipate that any future changes in the fair value of the put option will be offset by the changes in the fair value of the related auction rate securities with no material net impact to the consolidated statement of operations
