item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
if our actual production and sales for any period are less than the corresponding volume of derivative contracts for that period including reductions in production due to operational delays  or if we are unable to perform our activities as planned  we might be forced to satisfy all or a portion of our derivative obligations without the benefit of the cash flow from our sale of the underlying physical commodity  resulting in a substantial diminution of our liquidity 
in addition  our oil and gas financial derivative activities can result in substantial losses 
such losses could occur under various circumstances  including any circumstance in which a counterparty does not perform its obligations under the applicable derivative arrangement  the arrangement is imperfect or our derivative policies and procedures are not followed or do not work as planned 
under the terms of our senior credit facility with keybank national association  the percentage of our total production volumes with respect to which we will be allowed to enter into derivative contracts is limited  and we therefore retain the risk of a price decrease for our remaining production volume 
if oil and natural gas prices continue to decrease or stay at depressed levels  we may be required to take additional write downs of the carrying values of our oil and natural gas properties  potentially triggering earlier than anticipated repayments of any outstanding debt obligations and negatively impacting the trading value of our securities 
there is a risk that we will be required to write down the carrying value of our oil and gas properties  which would reduce our earnings and stockholders equity 
we account for our natural gas and crude oil exploration and development activities using the successful efforts method of accounting 
under this method  costs of productive exploratory wells  developmental dry holes and productive wells and undeveloped leases are capitalized 
oil and gas lease acquisition costs are also capitalized 
exploration costs  including personnel costs  certain geological and geophysical expenses and delay rentals for oil and gas leases are charged to expense as incurred 
exploratory drilling costs are initially capitalized  but charged to expense if and when the well is determined not to have found reserves in commercial quantities 
the capitalized costs of our oil and gas 
table of contents properties may not exceed the estimated future net cash flows from our properties 
if capitalized costs exceed future cash flows  we write down the costs of the properties to our estimate of fair market value 
any such charge will not affect our cash flow from operating activities  but will reduce our earnings and stockholders equity 
additional write downs could occur if oil and gas prices continue to decline or if we have substantial downward adjustments to our estimated proved reserves  increases in our estimates of development costs or deterioration in our drilling results 
because our properties currently serve  and will likely continue to serve  as collateral for advances under our existing and future credit facilities  a write down in the carrying values of our properties could require us to repay debt earlier than we would otherwise be required 
it is likely that the cumulative effect of a write down could also negatively impact the value of our securities  including our common stock 
the application of the successful efforts method of accounting requires managerial judgment to determine the proper classification of wells designated as developmental or exploratory  which will ultimately determine the proper accounting treatment of the costs incurred 
the results from a drilling operation can take considerable time to analyze and the determination that commercial reserves have been discovered requires both judgment and industry experience 
wells may be completed that are assumed to be productive but may actually deliver oil and gas in quantities insufficient to be economic  which may result in the abandonment of the wells at a later date 
wells are drilled that have targeted geologic structures that are both developmental and exploratory in nature  and an allocation of costs is required to properly account for the results 
the evaluation of oil and gas leasehold acquisition costs requires judgment to estimate the fair value of these costs with reference to drilling activity in a given area 
we review our oil and gas properties for impairment annually or whenever events and circumstances indicate a decline in the recoverability of their carrying value 
once incurred  a write down of oil and gas properties is not reversible at a later date even if gas or oil prices increase 
given the complexities associated with oil and gas reserve estimates and the history of price volatility in the oil and gas markets  events may arise that would require us to record an impairment of the book values associated with oil and gas properties 
drilling for and producing oil and natural gas are high risk activities with many uncertainties that could adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
our future success will depend on the success of our exploitation  exploration  development and production activities 
our oil and natural gas exploration and production activities are subject to numerous risks beyond our control  including the risk that drilling will not result in commercially viable oil or natural gas production 
our decisions to purchase  explore  develop or otherwise exploit prospects or properties will depend in part on the evaluation of data obtained through geophysical and geological analyses  production data and engineering studies  the results of which are often inconclusive or subject to varying interpretations 
please read item a 
our estimated reserves are based on many assumptions that may turn out to be inaccurate 
any significant inaccuracies in these reserve estimates or underlying assumptions may materially affect the quantities and present value of our reserves below for a discussion of the uncertainties involved in these processes 
our costs of drilling  completing and operating wells are often uncertain before drilling commences 
overruns in budgeted expenditures are common risks that can make a particular project uneconomical 
further  our future business  financial condition  results of operations  liquidity or ability to finance planned capital expenditures could be materially and adversely affected by any factor that may curtail  delay or cancel drilling  including the following delays imposed by or resulting from compliance with regulatory requirements  pressure or irregularities in geological formations  shortages of or delays in obtaining equipment and qualified personnel  equipment failures or accidents  adverse weather conditions  
table of contents reductions in oil and natural gas prices  oil and natural gas property title problems  and market limitations for oil and natural gas 
our estimated reserves are based on many assumptions that may turn out to be inaccurate 
any significant inaccuracies in these reserve estimates or underlying assumptions may materially affect the quantities and present value of our reserves 
estimates of oil and natural gas reserves are inherently imprecise 
the process of estimating oil and natural gas reserves is complex 
it requires interpretations of available technical data and many assumptions  including assumptions relating to economic factors 
any significant inaccuracies in these interpretations or assumptions could materially affect the estimated quantities and present value of reserves 
to prepare our estimates  we must project production rates and the timing of development expenditures 
we must also analyze available geological  geophysical  production and engineering data 
the extent  quality and reliability of this data can vary 
the process also requires economic assumptions about matters such as oil and natural gas prices  drilling and operating expenses  capital expenditures  taxes and availability of funds 
actual future production  oil and natural gas prices  revenues  taxes  development expenditures  operating expenses and quantities of recoverable oil and natural gas reserves most likely will vary from our estimates 
any significant variance could materially affect the estimated quantities and present value of reserves shown in this report 
in addition  we may adjust estimates of proved reserves to reflect production history  results of exploration and development  prevailing oil and natural gas prices and other factors  many of which are beyond our control 
the present value of future net cash flows from our proved reserves is not necessarily the same as the current market value of our estimated oil and natural gas reserves 
we base the estimated discounted future net cash flows from our proved reserves on prices and costs in effect on the day of estimate 
however  actual future net cash flows from our oil and natural gas properties also will be affected by factors such as actual prices we receive for oil and natural gas  actual cost of development and production expenditures  the amount and timing of actual production  supply of and demand for oil and natural gas  and changes in governmental regulations or taxation 
the timing of both our production and our incurrence of expenses in connection with the development and production of oil and natural gas properties will affect the timing of actual future net cash flows from proved reserves  and thus their actual present value 
in addition  the discount factor we use when calculating discounted future net cash flows may not be the most appropriate discount factor based on interest rates in effect from time to time and risks associated with us or the oil and natural gas industry in general 
prospects that we decide to drill may not yield oil or natural gas in commercially viable quantities 
our prospects are in various stages of evaluation 
there is no way to predict with certainty in advance of drilling and testing whether any particular prospect will yield oil or natural gas in sufficient quantities to recover drilling or completion costs or to be economically viable  particularly in light of the current economic environment 
the use of seismic data and other technologies  and the study of producing fields in the same area  will not enable us to know conclusively before drilling whether oil or natural gas will be present or  if present  whether oil or natural gas will be present in commercially viable quantities 
moreover  the analogies we draw from available data from other wells  more fully explored prospects or producing fields may not be applicable to our drilling prospects 

table of contents we cannot control activities on properties that we do not operate and are unable to control their proper operation and profitability 
we do not operate all of the properties in which we own an interest 
as a result  we have limited ability to exercise influence over  and control the risks associated with  the operations of these properties 
the failure of an operator of our wells to adequately perform operations  an operator s breach of the applicable agreements or an operator s failure to act in ways that are in our best interests could reduce our production and revenues 
the success and timing of our drilling and development activities on properties operated by others therefore depend upon a number of factors outside of our control  including the operator s nature and timing of drilling and operational activities  timing and amount of capital expenditures  expertise and financial resources  the approval of other participants in drilling wells  and selection of suitable technology 
unless we replace our oil and natural gas reserves  our reserves and production will decline  which would adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
producing oil and natural gas reservoirs generally is characterized by declining production rates that vary depending on reservoir characteristics and other factors 
our future oil and natural gas reserves and production  and therefore our cash flow and income  are highly dependent on our success in efficiently developing and exploiting our current reserves and economically finding or acquiring additional recoverable reserves 
we may not be able to develop  find or acquire additional reserves to replace our current and future production at acceptable costs  which would adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
our future acquisitions may yield revenue or production that varies significantly from our projections 
in acquiring producing properties  we will assess the recoverable reserves  future natural gas and oil prices  operating costs  potential liabilities and other factors relating to the properties 
our assessments are necessarily inexact  and their accuracy is inherently uncertain 
our review of a subject property in connection with our acquisition assessment will not reveal all existing or potential problems or permit us to become sufficiently familiar with the property to assess fully its deficiencies and capabilities 
we may not inspect every well  and we may not be able to observe structural and environmental problems even when we do inspect a well 
if problems are identified  the seller may be unwilling or unable to provide effective contractual protection against all or part of those problems 
any acquisition of property interests may not be economically successful  and unsuccessful acquisitions may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and future results of operations 
our development and exploration operations require substantial capital  and we may be unable to obtain needed capital or financing on satisfactory terms  which could lead to a loss of properties and a decline in our oil and natural gas reserves 
the oil and natural gas industry is capital intensive 
we make and expect to continue to make substantial capital expenditures in our business and operations for the exploration for  and development  production and acquisition of  oil and natural gas reserves 
to date  we have financed capital expenditures primarily with proceeds from bank borrowings  cash generated by operations and public stock offerings 
we intend to finance our capital expenditures with the sale of equity  asset sales  cash flow from operations and current and new financing arrangements 
our cash flow from operations and access to capital is subject to a number of variables  including our proved reserves  the level of oil and natural gas we are able to produce from existing wells  
table of contents the prices at which oil and natural gas are sold  and our ability to acquire  locate and produce new reserves 
if our revenues decrease as a result of lower oil and natural gas prices  operating difficulties  declines in reserves or for any other reason  we may have limited ability to obtain the capital necessary to sustain our operations at current levels 
we may need to seek additional financing in the future 
in addition  we may not be able to obtain debt or equity financing on terms favorable to us  or at all 
the failure to obtain additional financing could result in a curtailment of our operations relating to exploration and development of our prospects  which in turn could lead to a possible loss of properties and a decline in our oil and natural gas reserves 
also  our credit facility contains covenants that restrict our ability to  among other things  materially change our business  approve and distribute dividends  enter into transactions with affiliates  create or acquire additional subsidiaries  incur indebtedness  sell assets  make loans to others  make investments  enter into mergers  incur liens  and enter into agreements regarding swap and other derivative transactions 
the unavailability or high cost of drilling rigs  equipment  supplies  personnel and oil field services could adversely affect our ability to execute on a timely basis our exploration and development plans within our budget 
we may  from time to time  encounter difficulty in obtaining  or an increase in the cost of securing  drilling rigs  equipment and supplies 
in addition  larger producers may be more likely to secure access to such equipment by offering more lucrative terms 
if we are unable to acquire access to such resources  or can obtain access only at higher prices  our ability to convert our reserves into cash flow could be delayed and the cost of producing those reserves could increase significantly  which would adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 
we may incur substantial losses and be subject to substantial liability claims as a result of our oil and natural gas operations  and we may not have enough insurance to cover all of the risks that we face 
we maintain insurance coverage against some  but not all  potential losses to protect against the risks we face 
we do not carry business interruption insurance 
we may elect not to carry insurance if our management believes that the cost of available insurance is excessive relative to the risks presented 
in addition  it is not possible to insure fully against pollution and environmental risks 
we are not insured against all risks 
losses and liabilities arising from uninsured and underinsured events could materially and adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
our oil and natural gas exploration and production activities are subject to all of the operating risks associated with drilling for and producing oil and natural gas  including the possibility of environmental hazards  such as uncontrollable flows of oil  natural gas  brine  well fluids  toxic gas or other pollution into the environment  including groundwater and shoreline contamination  abnormally pressured formations  mechanical difficulties  such as stuck oil field drilling and service tools and casing collapses  fires and explosions  personal injuries and death  and natural disasters 
any of these risks could adversely affect our ability to conduct operations or result in substantial losses to us 
if a significant accident or other event occurs and is not fully covered by insurance  then that accident or other event could adversely affect our financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 

table of contents our business may suffer if we lose key personnel 
our operations depend on the continuing efforts of our executive officers and senior management 
our business or prospects could be adversely affected if any of these persons does not continue in their management role with us and we are unable to attract and retain qualified replacements 
additionally  we do not carry key person insurance for any of our executive officers or senior management 
we are subject to complex laws and regulations that can adversely affect the cost  manner or feasibility of doing business 
the exploration  development  production and sale of oil and natural gas are subject to extensive federal  state  and local laws and regulations 
such regulation includes requirements for permits to drill and to conduct other operations and for provision of financial assurances such as bonds covering drilling and well operations 
other activities subject to regulation are the location and spacing of wells  the unitization and pooling of properties  the method of drilling and completing wells  the surface use and restoration of properties upon which wells are drilled  the plugging and abandoning of wells  the disposal of fluids used or other wastes generated in connection with our drilling operations  the marketing  transportation and reporting of production  and the valuation and payment of royalties 
under these laws  we could be subject to claims for personal injury or property damages  including natural resource damages  which may result from the impacts of our operations 
failure to comply with these laws also may result in the suspension or termination of our operations and subject us to administrative  civil and criminal penalties 
moreover  these laws could change in ways that substantially increase our costs of compliance 
any such liabilities  penalties  suspensions  terminations or regulatory changes could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
our operations expose us to substantial costs and liabilities with respect to environmental matters 
our oil and natural gas operations are subject to stringent federal  state and local laws and regulations governing the release of materials into the environment or otherwise relating to environmental protection 
these laws and regulations may require the acquisition of a permit before drilling commences  restrict the types  quantities and concentration of substances that can be released into the environment in connection with our drilling and production activities  limit or prohibit drilling activities on certain lands lying within wilderness  wetlands and other protected areas  and impose substantial liabilities for pollution that may result from our operations 
failure to comply with these laws and regulations may result in the assessment of administrative  civil and criminal penalties  the imposition of investigatory or remedial obligations or injunctive relief 
under existing environmental laws and regulations  we could be held strictly liable for the removal or remediation of previously released materials or property contamination regardless of whether the release resulted from our operations  or our operations were in compliance with all applicable laws at the time they were performed 
changes in environmental laws and regulations occur frequently  and any changes that result in more stringent or costly waste handling  storage  transport  disposal or cleanup requirements could require us to make significant expenditures to maintain compliance  and may otherwise have a material adverse effect on our competitive position  financial condition and results of operations 

table of contents competition in the oil and natural gas industry is intense  which may adversely affect our ability to compete 
we operate in a highly competitive environment for acquiring properties  marketing oil and natural gas and securing trained personnel 
many of our competitors possess and employ financial  technical and personnel resources substantially greater than ours  which can be particularly important in the areas in which we operate 
those companies may be able to pay more for productive oil and natural gas properties and exploratory prospects and to evaluate  bid for and purchase a greater number of properties and prospects than our financial or personnel resources permit 
our ability to acquire additional prospects and to find and develop reserves in the future will depend on our ability to evaluate and select suitable properties and to consummate transactions in a highly competitive environment 
we may not be able to compete successfully in the future in acquiring prospective reserves  developing reserves  marketing hydrocarbons  attracting and retaining quality personnel and raising additional capital 
being a public company has increased our expenses and administrative workload 
we completed our initial public offering in july as a public company  we must comply with various laws and regulations  including the sarbanes oxley act of and related rules of the securities and exchange commission sec  and requirements of nasdaq 
we were not required to comply with all of these laws and requirements before our initial public offering 
complying with these laws and regulations requires the time and attention of our board of directors and management  and increases our expenses 
among other things  we must maintain and evaluate a system of internal controls over financial reporting in compliance with the requirements of section of the sarbanes oxley act and the related rules and regulations of the sec and the public company accounting oversight board  maintain policies relating to disclosure controls and procedures  prepare and distribute periodic reports in compliance with our obligations under federal securities laws  institute a more comprehensive compliance function  including with respect to corporate governance  and involve to a greater degree our outside legal counsel and accountants in the above activities 
in addition  being a public company has made it more expensive for us to obtain director and officer liability insurance 
in the future  we may be required to accept reduced coverage or incur substantially higher costs to obtain this coverage 
these factors could also make it more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified executives and members of our board of directors  particularly directors willing to serve on our audit committee

our common stock has only been publicly traded since our initial public offering on july  the price of our common stock has fluctuated significantly since then 
from july  to march   the closing trading price of our common stock ranged from a low of per share to a high of per share 
we expect our stock to continue to be subject to fluctuations as a result of a variety of factors  including factors beyond our control 
these factors include changes in oil and natural gas prices  variations in quarterly drilling  recompletions  acquisitions and operating results  changes in financial estimates by securities analysts  changes in market valuations of comparable companies  additions or departures of key personnel

future sales of substantial amounts of our common stock  or the perception that sales could occur  could have a material adverse effect on the price of our common stock 
our certificate of incorporation  bylaws and delaware law contain provisions that could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us without the consent of our board of directors and our chairman and other executive officers  which collectively beneficially own approximately of the outstanding shares of our common stock as of march  provisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws will have the effect of delaying or preventing a change of control or changes in our management 
these provisions include the following the ability of the board to issue shares of our common stock and preferred stock without stockholder approval  the ability of our board of directors to make  alter or repeal our bylaws without further stockholder approval  the requirement for advance notice for nominations for directors to our board of directors and for proposing matters that can be acted upon by stockholders at stockholder meetings  and stockholders may not take action by written consent

we have approximately  gross  net acres under lease 
during the third quarter of  we sold approximately  net undeveloped acres in indiana and certain non producing wells  which was a part of our new albany shale exploration projects  for approximately million in proceeds 
total proved reserves decreased approximately mmboe  or  to approximately mmboe at december  when compared to year end  which was primarily a result of the decline in oil prices during the second half of annual production increased over capital expenditures in for developmental drilling and facility improvements in the region were approximately million  which funded the drilling of gross net development wells  all of which were completed and producing as of december  capital expenditures in also funded the recompletion of four gross four net recompletions 
capital expenditures for drilling and facilities development for the lawrence field asp flood project in lawrence county  illinois totaled approximately million  which funded facilities and project development for our pilot program and future larger scale asp plans 
at december   the illinois basin had a development inventory of proven drilling locations and proven recompletions 
development projects include recompletions  infill drilling and continued refinement of secondary recovery operations 
these activities also include increasing reserves and production through 
table of contents aggressive cost control  upgrading lifting equipment  improving gathering systems and surface facilities and performing re stimulations and re fracturing operations 
lawrence field asp flood project we are implementing an alkali surfactant polymer asp flood project in the cypress and bridgeport sandstone reservoirs of our lawrence field acreage 
the lawrence field asp flood project is one of our largest projects 
the lawrence field asp flood project is considered an enhanced oil recovery eor project  which refers to recovery of oil that is not producible by primary or secondary recovery methods 
the lawrence field in lawrence county  illinois  is believed to have produced more than million barrels of oil from separate horizons since its discovery in we currently own and operate square miles approximately  net acres of the lawrence field  and our properties account for approximately of the current total gross production from the field 
the cypress mississippian and the bridgeport pennsylvanian sandstones are the major producing horizons in the field 
to date  approximately of the estimated one billion barrels of original oil in place has been produced 
in the s  s and s  a number of eor projects using surfactant polymer floods were implemented in several fields in the illinois basin by marathon oil corp 
marathon  texaco and exxon in an attempt to recover a portion of the large percentage of the original oil in place that was being bypassed by the secondary recovery waterflood 
these test projects reportedly were able to recover incremental oil reserves of to of the original oil in place 
in  marathon began a surfactant polymer flood project in the lawrence field on the robins lease  a acre lease in the lawrence field within one mile of the site of one of our pilot test locations 
this project was initiated at a time when the price per barrel of oil was below and the technology of combining alkali and surfactant with polymer  which significantly reduces costs of recovery compared with the previous surfactant polymer floods  had not yet been fully developed 
despite the high costs of the surfactant polymer flooding employed by marathon and the low oil prices  the project produced an estimated  incremental barrels  or an estimated the of original oil in place 
while we believe the results of this project are pertinent  there can be no assurance that our lawrence field asp flood project  which uses technology that was not developed at the time of the robins lease flood  will achieve similar results 
asp technology  which uses mechanisms to mobilize bypassed residual oil similar to these previous surfactant polymer floods but at significantly lower costs  has been applied by other companies in several fields around the world resulting in significant incremental recoveries of the original oil in place 
chemicals used in the lawrence field asp flood project are an alkali naoh or naco  a surfactant and a polymer 
the alkali to and surfactant to combination washes residual oil from the reservoir mainly by reducing interfacial tension between the oil and the water 
the polymer to parts per million is added to improve sweep displacement efficiency 
asp technology achieves its incremental recovery by reducing capillary forces that trap oil  improving aerial and vertical sweep efficiency and reducing mobility ratio 
our lawrence field asp flood project will use asp technology to flood our lawrence field wells 
the goal of our lawrence field asp flood project is to duplicate the oil recovery performance of the surfactant polymer floods conducted in the field in the s  but at a significantly lower cost 
we expect this cost reduction to be accomplished by utilizing newer technologies to optimize the synergistic performance of the three chemicals used  and by using alkali in the formula  which would allow us to use a significantly lower concentration of the more costly surfactant 
in  penntex illinois  then known as plains illinois  inc  and the us department of energy conducted a study on the potential of an asp project in the lawrence field  with consulting services provided by an independent engineering firm specializing in the design and implementation of chemical oil recovery systems 

table of contents based on the modeling of the reservoir characteristics and laboratory tests with cores taken in the lawrence field  the evaluation found oil recovery in the field could be increased significantly by installing an asp flood 
similar eor techniques have been successfully demonstrated in fields around the world to recover an additional to of the original oil in place 
however  there can be no assurance that our lawrence field asp flood project will achieve similar results 
in  we engaged a third party consultant to review and update the evaluation on the application of the asp process to the lawrence field 
this evaluation  based on laboratory results  recommended two pilot areas to evaluate the asp process in the bridgeport and cypress sandstones 
the asp pilot test locations are positioned in areas that we believe are representative of variabilities that can be expected in these reservoirs 
based on our consultant s recommendations  we drilled and cored the central producing well in each of the two proposed pilot test areas 
these cores were sent to our consultant for asp chemical system design 
during  our consultant completed its linear and radial core flood analysis on the cypress and bridgeport sandstones  which in the laboratory resulted in an oil recovery rate as high as of the estimated original oil in place in the cypress sandstone  and of the original oil in place in the bridgeport sandstone 
these results were in line with our initial projections 
during the second quarter of  we commenced the asp chemical injection in our two pilot projects 
both of the pilots demonstrated a response to the chemical injection during the third quarter of  as indicated by an increase in both oil production and the oil cut ratio 
each pilot area had individual wells whose oil cut exceeded after the initial response  whereas the oil cuts for both pilots at the time asp injection was initiated were less than 
our lawrence field asp project is not a proved project nor are any of the potential reserves associated with this project considered proved at this time 
our current plans for include approximately million of capital allocated to developing two acre asp flood units 
these plans may be altered pending analysis of our two pilots performance and the oil price environment during the year 
appalachian basin as of december   we own an interest in approximately producing natural gas wells in the appalachian basin  predominantly in pennsylvania 
these wells are characterized as shallow  predominantly drilled on acre spacing at depths less than  feet  natural gas wells which have historically been long life shallow decline reserves 
in addition to our producing wells in the basin  we own proved undeveloped drilling locations with total reserves of bcf  and three locations with proved developed non producing reserves totaling mmcf 
at december   we had approximately  gross  net acres in the appalachian basin under lease  of which  gross  net acres were undeveloped 
reserves at december  increased bcf  or  from due primarily to drilling additions  including marcellus shale exploration  which were partially offset by a decrease in natural gas prices 
annual production increased over capital expenditures in for drilling and facility development in the region were approximately million  which funded the drilling of gross net development wells  all of which were completed and producing as of december  during  the region achieved a drilling success rate 
marcellus shale a large portion of our property in pennsylvania is located in areas where active exploration for the marcellus shale  by companies such as range resources corporation nyse rrc  equitable resources  inc nyse eqt  eog resources  inc nyse eog and atlas energy resources  llc nyse atn  is occurring with encouraging results 
the marcellus shale is a black  organic rich shale formation located at depths between  and  feet and ranges in thickness from to feet on our acreage in southwestern and central pennsylvania 
as of december   we had interests in approximately  gross  net marcellus shale prospective acres in these areas of pennsylvania and we continue to expand our position 

table of contents during  we met our goal of drilling at least one well in each of our main project areas 
capital expenditures in for drilling and facility development totaled million  which funded the drilling of eight gross seven net exploratory wells  of which four gross four net were completed and producing and four gross three net were awaiting completion and expected to be productive 
our exploration activity added approximately bcf to our total proved reserves 
our plans for have allocated approximately million in capital expenditures to our marcellus shale project areas  which will allow us to drill and complete approximately six to eight net horizontal wells by year end 
proved reserves netherland  sewell associates  inc nsai and schlumberger consulting and data services schlumberger  independent petroleum engineering firms  evaluated our reserves on a consolidated basis as of december  schlumberger was contracted to evaluate our proved reserves associated with our marcellus shale exploration  while nsai evaluated the proved reserves of all of our remaining properties

penntex illinois and rex operating epa enforcement matter in september  the united states department of justice us doj and the united states environmental protection agency us epa initiated an enforcement action against penntex illinois and rex operating seeking mandatory injunctive relief and potential civil penalties based on allegations that the companies were violating the clean air act in connection with the release of hydrogen sulfide h 
s gas and other volatile organic compounds voc s in the course of the companies oil producing operations near the towns of bridgeport  illinois and petrolia  illinois 
the companies senior management and representatives of the us epa  us doj  illinois environmental protection agency illinois epa and the agency for toxic substances and disease registry atsdr attended a meeting at the offices of the us epa in chicago  illinois on september   to discuss matters relating to the enforcement action 
this meeting had been preceded by certain monitoring of air emissions in the areas surrounding bridgeport  illinois and petrolia  illinois that the us epa and atsdr had conducted in may as a result of the initial meeting with the government on september   and certain subsequent meetings and communications with the us epa and us doj  penntex illinois and rex operating executed a non binding agreement in principle with the us epa effective october  in the agreement in principle  penntex illinois and rex operating agreed to develop and carry out a written response plan designed to further reduce possible emissions of h 
s and voc s from the companies oil wells and facilities in the lawrence field that are closest to populated areas 
the companies agreed to operate and maintain the control measures described in the response plan in accordance with a written operations and maintenance plan to be developed by the companies and approved by the us epa 
the agreement in principle also required the companies to evaluate the effectiveness of the control measures in the lawrence field installed pursuant to the response plan through a monitoring program  and required them to evaluate the need for additional control measures at other facilities within the lawrence field within days 
the companies also agreed to present to the us epa any recommendations for further action the companies might develop based upon their observations of the effectiveness of the control measures 
the parties each agreed that they would use their best efforts to negotiate a proposed final settlement agreement that would resolve the government s enforcement action  which settlement agreement would be published in the federal register and made subject to public comment before any final approval 
on april   penntex illinois  rex operating and the us epa and us doj executed a comprehensive consent decree in which penntex illinois and rex operating  without any admission of wrongdoing or liability and without any agreement to pay any civil fine or penalty  agreed to install certain control measures and to implement certain operating and maintenance procedures in the lawrence field 
under the terms of the proposed consent decree  penntex illinois and rex operating agreed to establish a monitoring protocol that would be designed to facilitate the reduction of possible emissions of hs and vocs from penntex illinois operations near bridgeport and petrolia 
a notice regarding the proposed consent decree was published in the federal register on april  the published notice of the proposed consent decree solicited public comments on the terms of the consent decree for a day period expiring on may  the united states did not receive any comments on the proposed consent decree during the public comment period 
on june   the united states filed a motion for the approval and entry of the proposed consent decree with the united states district court for the southern district of illinois 
on june   the court granted the united states motion for approval and entry of the proposed consent decree  thereby resolving the enforcement action 
table of contents according to the terms described in the consent decree 
the consent decree does not require us to pay any civil fine or penalty  although it does provide for the possible imposition of specified daily fines and penalties for any violation of the terms and conditions of the consent decree 
as of december   we have substantially met all requirements of the consent decree 
in a letter dated february   the us epa  in consultation with the illinois epa  approved our proposed plan and schedule for implementing our hs control measures in the lawrence field 
throughout  we implemented the operating and maintenance procedures and completed the installation of all control measures in accordance with the schedule approved by the us epa 
penntex illinois and rex operating hs class action litigation penntex illinois and rex operating are defendants in a class action lawsuit that has been filed in the united states district court for the southern district of illinois 
this action was commenced on october   by plaintiffs julia leib and lisa thompson  individually and as putative class representatives on behalf of all persons and non governmental entities that own property or reside on property located in the towns of bridgeport and petrolia  illinois 
the complaint asserts that the operation of oil wells that are controlled owned or operated by penntex illinois and rex operating has resulted in serious contamination of the class area with hs the complaint asserts several causes of action  including violation of the illinois environmental protection act  negligence  private nuisance  trespass  and willful and wanton misconduct 
the complaint was amended in march to add a claim for alleged violation of section a of the resource conservation and recovery act 
the complaint seeks  among other things  injunctive relief under the illinois environmental protection act and illinois common law  compensatory and other damages  punitive damages  and attorneys fees and costs 
in addition  the complaint seeks the creation of a court supervised  defendant financed fund to pay for medical monitoring for the plaintiffs and others in the class area 
penntex illinois and rex operating have filed a joint answer to the amended complaint denying virtually all of the allegations in the amended complaint and asserting affirmative defenses thereto 
on december   the plaintiffs filed a motion for class certification requesting that the court certify the case as a class action 
on january   the court issued a scheduling and discovery order establishing deadlines for completing discovery and briefing relating to the plaintiffs motion for class certification 
the original order provided for an august deadline for the completion of pre certification discovery and the filing of the last brief on class certification issues  however  in august  and again in october  the scheduling and discovery order was amended to extend these deadlines to january the parties to the lawsuit exchanged initial pretrial disclosures as required under the applicable rules  and each side served and responded to pre deposition written discovery 
in addition  the defendants deposed each of the named plaintiffs and each of plaintiffs expert witnesses offered in support of plaintiffs motion for class certification 
the plaintiffs did not elect to depose the defendants expert witnesses offered in support of their opposition to class certification 
the plaintiffs filed an amended motion for class certification on january  penntex illinois and rex operating filed a joint motion opposing class certification on february   and various supplements were filed by both parties after that date 
on december   the district court issued a preliminary ruling on certification  indicating its conclusion that several of the class action prerequisites were met and that it was likely to certify a class to adjudicate two issues relating to the emission of hs in the putative class area  while reserving all remaining issues for subsequent individual adjudications 
the district court denied the plaintiffs motion to certify a class in reference to the plaintiffs medical monitoring claim 
the district court requested that the plaintiffs submit a revised class definition consistent with its order  which was submitted by the plaintiffs on january  on january   the defendants filed an objection to the plaintiffs revised class definition and requested that the district court deny the plaintiffs motion for class certification 
on february   the district court issued an order approving the geographic scope of the plaintiffs revised class definition 
in its order  the district court denied plaintiffs request to include all residents and 
table of contents landowners within the geographic area of the class owning property since october   the date the lawsuit was filed  and limited the class to only current property owners 
to date  the district court has not set a date for the final pre trial conference or a trial date 
on march   penntex illinois and rex operating filed a petition for leave to appeal with the united states court of appeals for the seventh circuit to appeal the class certification order on an interlocutory basis 
we believe that there is no evidence that any hs gas emissions from any of our facilities have caused any damage or injury to any person or property  and we intend to vigorously defend against the claims that have been asserted against penntex illinois and rex operating in this lawsuit 
because this lawsuit is in its initial phase  however  and because it is usually difficult to predict the outcome of litigation  we are unable to express an opinion with respect to the likelihood of an unfavorable outcome or to estimate the amount or the range of potential loss should the outcome be unfavorable to us 
pursuant to the terms of a pollution liability policy with federal insurance company  we have insurance coverage for possible damages relating to claims made in this lawsuit for up to  in addition  in accordance with the terms of the pollution liability policy  federal insurance company has agreed to conduct our defense in this lawsuit at the insurer s expense 
under the terms of a written agreement with us  federal insurance company has agreed to pay a substantial portion of our costs and expenses relating to the defense of this lawsuit  including attorneys fees 
under the terms of our agreement  we are required to pay the costs and expenses relating to the defense in excess of the amounts payable by federal insurance company

table of contents the estimates of reserves in the table above conform to the guidelines of the sec 
estimated recoverable proved reserves have been determined without regard to any economic impact that may result from our financial derivative activities 
these calculations were prepared using standard geological and engineering methods generally accepted by the petroleum industry 
the estimated present value of proved reserves does not give effect to indirect expenses such as debt service and future income tax expense  asset retirement obligations  or to depletion  depreciation and amortization 
the reserve information shown is estimated 
the accuracy of any reserve estimate is a function of the quality of available geological  geophysical  engineering and economic data  the precision of the engineering and geological interpretation  and judgment 
the estimates of reserves  future cash flows and present value are based on various assumptions  and are inherently imprecise 
although we believe these estimates are reasonable  actual future production  cash flows  taxes  development expenditures  operating expenses and quantities of recoverable oil and natural gas reserves may vary substantially from these estimates 
also  the use of a discount factor for reporting purposes may not necessarily represent the most appropriate discount factor  given actual interest rates and risks to which our business or the oil and natural gas industry in general are subject 
because each of the predecessor companies was a flow through entity for state and federal tax purposes  our historical standardized measure does not deduct state or federal taxes 
this differs from our pro forma standardized measure  which deducts state and federal taxes 
non gaap financial measures we include in this report our calculations of ebitdax and pv  which are non gaap financial measures 
below  we provide reconciliations of these non gaap financial measures to their most directly comparable financial measure as calculated and presented in accordance with gaap 
ebitdax ebitdax means  for any period  the sum of net income for such period plus the following expenses  charges or income to the extent deducted from or added to net income in such period interest  income taxes  depreciation  depletion  amortization  unrealized losses from financial derivatives  exploration expenses and other similar non cash charges  minus all non cash income  including but not limited to  income from unrealized financial derivatives  added to net income 
ebitdax  as defined above  is used as a financial measure by our management team and by other users of our financial statements  such as our commercial bank lenders  to analyze such things as our operating performance and return on capital in comparison to those of other companies in our industry  without regard to financial or capital structure  the financial performance of our assets and valuation of the entity without regard to financing methods  capital structure or historical cost basis  our ability to generate cash sufficient to pay interest costs  support our indebtedness and make cash distributions to our stockholders  and the viability of acquisitions and capital expenditure projects and the overall rates of return on alternative investment opportunities 
ebitdax is not a calculation based on gaap financial measures and should not be considered as an alternative to net income loss in measuring our performance  nor used as an exclusive measure of cash flow  because it does not consider the impact of working capital growth  capital expenditures  debt principal reductions  and other sources and uses of cash  which are disclosed in our statements of cash flows 

table of contents we have reported ebitdax because it is a financial measure used by our existing commercial lenders  and we believe this measure is commonly reported and widely used by investors as an indicator of a company s operating performance and ability to incur and service debt 
you should carefully consider the specific items included in our computations of ebitdax 
while we have disclosed our ebitdax to permit a more complete comparative analysis of our operating performance and debt servicing ability relative to other companies  you are cautioned that ebitdax as reported by us may not be comparable in all instances to ebitdax as reported by other companies 
ebitdax amounts may not be fully available for management s discretionary use  due to requirements to conserve funds for capital expenditures  debt service and other commitments 
we believe ebitdax assists our lenders and investors in comparing a company s performance on a consistent basis without regard to certain expenses  which can vary significantly depending upon accounting methods 
because we may borrow money to finance our operations  interest expense is a necessary element of our costs and our ability to generate cash available for distribution 
because we use capital assets  depreciation and amortization are also necessary elements of our costs 
additionally  we are required to pay federal and state taxes  which are necessary elements of our costs 
therefore  any measures that exclude these elements have material limitations 
to compensate for these limitations  we believe it is important to consider both net income determined under gaap and ebitdax to evaluate our performance 
the following table presents a reconciliation of our net income to our ebitdax for each of the periods presented in thousands year ended december  net income loss add back depletion  depreciation  amortization and accretion add back non cash compensation expense add back interest expense add back exploration impairment expense less interest income add back gain loss on disposal of assets add back unrealized gain loss on financial derivatives add back minority interest share of net gain loss less income tax benefit ebitdax from continuing operations add ebitdax from discontinued operations ebitdax 
table of contents pv the following table shows the reconciliation of pv to our pro forma standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows  the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with gaap 
pv represents our estimate of the present value  discounted at per annum  of estimated future cash flows before income tax of our estimated proved reserves 
our estimated future cash flows as of december   and were determined by using reserve quantities of proved reserves and the periods in which they are expected to be developed and produced based on economic conditions prevailing on that date 
the estimated future production is priced at december   and  without escalation  using  and per bbl of oil  respectively  and  and per mmbtu of natural gas  respectively  as adjusted by lease for transportation fees and regional price differentials 
management believes that pv provides useful information to investors because it is widely used by professional analysts and sophisticated investors in evaluating oil and natural gas companies 
because there are many unique factors that can impact an individual company when estimating the amount of future income taxes to be paid  we believe the use of a pre tax measure is valuable for evaluating our company 
pv should not be considered as an alternative to the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows as computed under gaap 
reconciliation of pv to pro forma standardized measure millions a pro forma standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows add present value of future income tax discounted at b add present value of future asset retirement obligations discounted at pv a does not include values of our southwest region properties which are classified as assets held for sale on our balance sheet 
b at december   the tax basis of our assets exceeded the future cash flows of our oil and gas properties  which indicates that no future income taxes will be paid 
impairment testing was performed on our oil and gas properties at year end based on escalating future oil and natural gas prices 
the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows is based on the year end sec commodity prices  which are held constant for the life of the properties 

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with item selected financial and operating data and the consolidated and combined financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this report 
this discussion contains forward looking statements reflecting our current expectations and estimates  and assumptions concerning events and financial trends that may affect our future operating results or financial position 
actual results and the timing of events may differ materially from those contained in these forward looking statements due to a number of factors  including those discussed in the sections entitled cautionary note regarding forward looking statements and item a 
risk factors appearing elsewhere in this report 
all financial and operating data presented are the results of continuing operations unless otherwise noted 
overview of our business we are an independent oil and gas company operating in the illinois basin and the appalachian basin 
we pursue a balanced growth strategy of exploiting our sizeable inventory of lower risk developmental drilling locations  pursuing our higher potential exploration drilling prospects and actively executing our acquisition strategy 
we are headquartered in state college  pennsylvania  and have regional offices in canonsburg pittsburgh  pennsylvania and bridgeport  illinois 
our financial results depend upon many factors  particularly the price of oil and gas 
commodity prices are affected by changes in market demand  which is impacted by overall economic activity  weather  refinery or pipeline capacity constraints  inventory storage levels  basis differentials and other factors 
as a result  we cannot accurately predict future oil and gas prices  and therefore  we cannot determine what effect increases or decreases will have on our capital program  production volumes and future revenues 
in addition to production volumes and commodity prices  finding and developing sufficient amounts of oil and gas reserves at economical costs are critical to our long term success 
on december   we entered into a definitive purchase and sale agreement for the sale of our southwest region assets and expect the sale of these assets to close by the end for the first quarter of for estimated net proceeds of million 
we have reclassified these assets and associated liabilities as held for sale on our consolidated balance sheets and have reported the results of operations under discontinued operations on our consolidated and combined statements of operations 
total revenues for these properties for the years ended december   and were million  million and million  respectively 
total assets held for sale for the years ended december  and were million and million  respectively 
source of our revenues we generate our revenue primarily from the sale of crude oil to refining companies and natural gas to local distribution and pipeline companies 
our operating revenue before the effects of financial derivatives from these operations  and their relative percentages of our total revenue  consisted of the following in thousands of total of total of total revenue from oil sales revenue from natural gas sales other total 
table of contents we have identified the impact of generally volatile commodity prices in the last several years as an important trend that we expect to affect our business in the future 
if commodity prices increase  we would expect not only an increase in revenue  but also the competitive environment for quality drilling prospects  qualified geological and technical personnel and oil field services  including rig availability 
increasing competition in these areas would likely result in higher costs in these areas  and could result in unavailability of drilling rigs  thus affecting the profitability of our future operations 
we may not be able to compete successfully in the future with larger competitors in acquiring prospective reserves  developing reserves  marketing hydrocarbons  attracting and retaining quality personnel and raising additional capital 
in the event of a declining commodity price environment  our revenues would decrease and we would anticipate that the cost of materials and services would decrease as well  although at a slower rate 
decreasing oil or natural gas prices may also make some of our prospects uneconomical to drill 
commodity prices during  based on nymex  ranged from a high of and to a low of and  for oil and natural gas  respectively 
should the challenging price environment continue  it may slow the rate of our expected future growth 
principal components of our cost structure our operating and other expenses consist of the following production and lease operating expenses 
day to day costs incurred to bring hydrocarbons out of the ground and to the market together with the daily costs incurred to maintain our producing properties 
such costs also include workovers  repairs to our oil and gas properties not covered by insurance  and various production taxes that are paid based upon rates set by federal  state  and local taxing authorities 
exploration expense 
geological and geophysical costs  seismic costs  delay rentals and the costs of unsuccessful exploratory wells or dry holes 
general and administrative expense 
overhead  including payroll and benefits for our corporate staff  costs of maintaining our headquarters  costs of managing our production and development operations  audit and other professional fees  and legal compliance are included in general and administrative expense 
general and administrative expense includes non cash stock based compensation expense associated with the adoption of sfas r as part of employee compensation 
interest 
we typically finance a portion of our working capital requirements and acquisitions with borrowings under our senior credit facility 
as a result  we incur substantial interest expense that is affected by both fluctuations in interest rates and our financing decisions 
we may continue to incur significant interest expense as we continue to grow 
depreciation  depletion  amortization and accretion 
the systematic expensing of the capital costs incurred to acquire  explore and develop natural gas and oil 
as a successful efforts company  we capitalize all costs associated with our acquisition and development efforts and all successful exploration efforts  and apportion these costs to each unit of production through depreciation  depletion and amortization expense 
this also includes the systematic  monthly accretion of the future abandonment costs of tangible assets such as platforms  wells  service assets  pipelines  and other facilities 
income taxes 
we are subject to state and federal income taxes but are currently not in a tax paying position for regular federal income taxes  primarily due to the current deductibility of intangible drilling costs idc 
we do pay some state income taxes where our idc deductions do not exceed our taxable income or where state income taxes are determined on another basis 
currently  all of our federal taxes are deferred  however  at some point  we believe we will use all of our net operating loss carryforwards and we believe we will recognize current income tax expense and continue to recognize current tax expense as long as we are generating taxable income 

table of contents how we evaluate our operations our management uses a variety of financial and operational measurements to analyze our performance 
these measurements include ebitdax  lease operating expenses per barrel of oil equivalent boe  growth in our proved reserve base  and general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue 
the following table presents these metrics for continuing operations for each of the three years ended december   and performance measurements years ended december  ebitdax in thousands production cost per boe total proved reserves mmboe g a as a percentage of operating revenue ebitdax ebitdax means  for any period  the sum of net income for such period plus the following expenses  charges or income to the extent deducted from or added to net income in such period interest  income taxes  depreciation  depletion  amortization  unrealized losses from financial derivatives  exploration expenses and other similar non cash charges  minus all non cash income  including but not limited to  income from unrealized financial derivatives  added to net income 
ebitdax  as defined above  is used as a financial measure by our management team and by other users of our financial statements  such as our commercial bank lenders  to analyze such things as our operating performance and return on capital in comparison to those of other companies in our industry  without regard to financial or capital structure  the financial performance of our assets and valuation of the entity  without regard to financing methods  capital structure or historical cost basis  our ability to generate cash sufficient to pay interest costs  support our indebtedness and make cash distributions to our stockholders  and the viability of acquisitions and capital expenditure projects and the overall rates of return on alternative investment opportunities 
production cost per boe production costs are comprised of those expenses which are directly attributable to our producing oil and gas leases  including state and county production taxes  production related insurance  the cost of materials  maintenance  electricity  chemicals  fuel and the wages of our field personnel 
our production costs per boe are higher than those of many of our peers primarily because of the nature of our oil properties  many of which are mature waterflood properties 
as we continue to develop our non proved properties  we believe this metric will decrease on a per unit basis 
our production cost per boe produced in was as compared to in and in growth in our proved reserve base we measure our ability to grow our proved reserves over the amount of our total annual production 
as we produce oil and gas attributable to our proved reserves  our proved reserves decrease each year by that amount of production 
we attempt to replace these produced proved reserves each year through the addition of new proved reserves through our drilling and other property improvement projects and through acquisitions 
our proved reserves have fluctuated since  from mmboe at year end to mmboe at year end to

our reserve replacement ratio for year end was approximately based on an increase in total proved reserves of mmboe  total production for the year of mboe  purchases of reserves of mboe  extensions  discoveries and other additions of mboe  and revisions of previous estimates of mmboe 
our reserve replacement ratio for year end was approximately a negative based on an decrease in total proved reserves of mmboe  total production for the year of mboe  purchases of reserves of mboe  extensions  discoveries and other additions of mmboe  and revisions of previous estimates of negative mmboe 
our proved reserve base decreased in when compared to predominately due to the decline in oil prices at the end of the year 
this primarily impacted our illinois basin  which accounts for of our total production  and of our oil production 
conversely  our proved reserve base in the appalachian basin increased by approximately despite a decrease in natural gas prices 
general and administrative expenses as a percentage of oil and gas revenue our general and administrative expenses include fees for well operating services  marketing  non field level employee compensation and related benefits  office and lease expenses  insurance costs and professional fees  as well as other costs and expenses not directly related to field operations 
our management continually evaluates the level of our general and administrative expenses in relation to our revenue because these expenses have a direct impact on our profitability 
in our general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue increased to from in and from in results of continuing operations general overview operating revenue increased for over this increase is primarily due to higher production with higher average sales prices per boe throughout the year  partially offset by increased realized losses on derivative activity

operating expenses increased million in  or  as compared to operating expenses are primarily composed of production expenses  general and administrative expenses  exploration expenses  impairment of oil and gas properties and depreciation  depletion  amortization and accretion expenses dd a 
these increases were primarily due to non cash impairment expenses of million  an increase in losses on the sale of assets of million  non cash compensation expenses of million and an increase in dd a expenses of approximately million 
the increased dd a expenses and impairment expenses are directly attributable to the decline in year end oil and natural gas prices

other operating revenue for of approximately  increased  or  from we generate other operating revenue from various activities such as revenue from the transportation of natural gas 
production and lease operating expense increased approximately million  or  in from the increase in expense can be partially attributed to a higher cost of conducting business in the oil and natural gas industry  as the cost of durable goods has risen throughout our areas of operation for items such as steel  chemicals and electricity 
also contributing to the increase in expense is the greater number of wells in service in as compared to general and administrative g a expense of approximately million for increased approximately million  or  from the increase in g a expense was primarily due to increased costs associated with consulting fees related to compliance with the sarbanes oxley act of and additional staffing needs in our corporate headquarters and field offices in relation to our growth 
non cash compensation expenses increased from by approximately million to million in  of which approximately million is due to the voluntary cancellation of  stock option awards by members of our board of directors

table of contents assets sfas 
at december   we determined that the carrying value of some of our oil and gas properties was not recoverable and exceeded fair value 
the decrease in our assets fair value was the result of the decrease in oil and natural gas prices at year end as compared to contributing to the increase in impairment expense was the impairment of goodwill of approximately million 
exploration expense of oil and gas properties for increased approximately million from million in this increase is primarily due to geological modeling in our lawrence field asp project and geophysical evaluation and modeling associated with our marcellus shale activities during the year 
depreciation  depletion  amortization and accretion expense of approximately million for increased approximately million  or  from this increase can be primarily explained by the downward revision in the estimated lives of our proved reserves 
we calculate our depletion on a units of production basis  which accelerated in relation to our lower proved reserves base 
interest expense  net of interest income  for was approximately million as compared to million for the decrease of million is primarily due to the decrease in the average balance on our long term debt  lines of credit and other loans and notes payable

production and lease operating expense increased approximately million  or  in from this expense typically increases as we add new wells and make certain improvements to existing wells in production 
this increase was principally due to acquisitions consummated in the final six months of within the illinois basin from tsar energy ii  llc and team energy  llc and its affiliates 
general and administrative expense increased million from to this increase was primarily a result of oil and gas property acquisitions in the illinois basin during the final six months of which resulted in reduced overhead income on wells that we operated for tsar energy ii  llc this overhead income had offset general and administrative expenses 
in october of  we acquired all of the interests of tsar energy ii  llc in these wells  at which time we ceased to recognize the overhead income associated with these wells 
additionally  with the completion of our initial public offering in july  we recognized increases to salary and benefit expenses associated with increased staffing levels

depreciation  depletion  amortization and accretion expense for the year ended december  increased approximately million  or  from million for the same period in this increase was partially due to an increase in production volume resulting from the tsar energy ii  llc and team energy  llc acquisitions in the illinois basin 
the increase is also partially attributed to approximately million of increased depletion and amortization expense realized over the five month period ending december   which resulted from a step up in book basis of assets caused by the acquisition of minority interests from the predecessor companies 
interest expense  net of interest income  for the year ended december  was approximately million as compared to million for the same period in the decrease of  was primarily due to the decrease in the average balance on our long term debt  lines of credit  and other loans and notes payable  which were significantly reduced with the proceeds of our initial public offering that closed on july  gain on disposal of assets for the year ended december  was approximately  as compared to  for the same period in we  from time to time  sell or otherwise dispose of certain fixed assets and wells that are no longer effectively used by us  and a gain or loss may be recognized when such an asset is sold

net income loss before minority interests decreased from a gain of million in to a loss of million in as a result of the factors described above 
capital resources and liquidity our primary financial resource is our base of oil and gas reserves 
we pledge our producing oil and gas properties to a group of banks to secure our senior credit facility 
the banks establish a borrowing base by making an estimate of the collateral value of our oil and gas properties 
we borrow funds on our senior credit facility as needed to supplement our operating cash flow and as a financing source for our capital expenditure program 
our ability to fund our capital expenditure program is dependent upon the level of product prices and the success of our exploration program in replacing our existing oil and gas reserves 
if product prices decrease  our operating cash flow may decrease and the banks may require additional collateral or reduce our borrowing base  thus reducing funds available to fund our capital expenditure program 
the effects of product prices on cash flow can be mitigated through the use of commodity derivatives 
if we are unable to replace our oil and gas reserves through our acquisitions  development or exploration programs  we may also suffer a reduction in our operating cash flow and access to funds under the senior credit facilities 
under extreme circumstances  product price reductions or exploration drilling failures could allow the banks to seek to foreclose on our oil and gas properties  thereby threatening our financial viability 

table of contents our cash flow from operations is driven by commodity prices and production volumes 
prices for oil and gas are driven by  among other things  seasonal influences of weather  national and international economic and political environments and  increasingly  from heightened demand for hydrocarbons from emerging nations 
our working capital is significantly influenced by changes in commodity prices  and significant declines in prices could decrease our exploration and development expenditures 
cash flows from operations have been primarily used to fund exploration and development of our oil and gas interests 
financial condition and cash flows for the years ended december   and the following table summarizes our sources and uses of funds for the periods noted for the years ended december  in thousands cash flows provided by operating activities cash flows used in investing activities cash flows provided by financing activities net increase decrease in cash and cash equivalents net cash provided by operating activities increased by approximately million in when compared to  to million 
in  cash flows increased primarily due to increases in production  which were a result of continued success with our oil and gas well drilling activities and higher realized oil and natural gas prices 
these increases in cash were partially offset by increases in operating costs  particularly lease operating expenses and g a expenses 
the increase in lease operating expenses is attributable to the higher cost of durable goods in the oil and natural gas industry 
the increase in g a expenses was primarily due to increased costs associated with consulting fees related to compliance with sarbanes oxley act of and additional staffing needs in our corporate headquarters and field offices in relation to our growth 
net cash used in investing activities increased by approximately million in when compared to  to million 
in  cash used increased  in part  due to increased development activity of our oil and gas properties 
a significant portion of these expenditures was due to conventional development activities in the illinois basin  where we drilled wells  conventional development activities in the appalachian basin  where we drilled wells  exploratory and development activities in our marcellus shale project areas  where we drilled eight wells and our lawrence field asp flood project  where we commenced operations on our two pilot areas 
also contributing to our increase in cash used were our undeveloped acreage acquisitions in the appalachian basin during the year 
these expenditures were a part of the plan to expand our acreage holdings in areas that are prospective for marcellus shale exploration 
partially offsetting these expenditures was an increase in proceeds from the sale of assets of approximately million  which is primarily attributable to the sale of our new albany shale assets 
net cash provided by financing activities increased by approximately million in when compared to  to million 
in  cash flows provided by financing increased primarily due to net proceeds received from the issuance of common stock and a decrease in the repayment of debt 
we issued common stock in may  which resulted in net proceeds to us that exceeded the net proceeds to us from our initial public offering in by approximately million 
additionally  we had lower debt levels in  subsequently decreasing our net payments of long term debt by approximately million when compared to capital requirements our primary needs for cash are for exploration  development and acquisition of oil and gas properties and repayment of principal and interest on outstanding debt 
during  million of capital was expended on 
table of contents drilling projects  facilities and related equipment and acquisitions to purchase additional interests in producing properties and unproved acreage 
the capital program was funded by net cash flows from operations  proceeds from borrowings and proceeds from our public offering of common stock in may 
the capital budget of million is expected to be funded primarily by cash flows from operations and proceeds from borrowings 
to the extent capital requirements exceed internal cash flows and proceeds from asset sales  debt or equity may be issued to fund these requirements 
we currently believe we have sufficient liquidity and cash flow to meet our obligations for the next twelve months  however  a further drop in oil and gas prices or a reduction in production or reserves could adversely affect our ability to fund capital expenditures and meet our financial obligations 
also  our obligations may change due to acquisitions  divestitures and continued growth 
we may issue additional shares of stock  subordinated notes or other debt securities to fund capital expenditures  acquisitions  to extend maturities or to repay debt 
effects of inflation and changes in price our results of operations and cash flows are affected by changing oil and natural gas prices 
if the price of oil and natural gas increases or decreases  there could be a corresponding increase or decrease in our operating costs  as well as an increase or decrease in revenues 
inflation has had a minimal effect on us 
critical accounting policies and recently adopted accounting pronouncements the preparation of financial statements in conformity with united states generally accepted accounting principles gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingencies at the date of the consolidated financial statements  and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods reported 
actual results could differ from these estimates 
significant estimates include volumes of oil and natural gas reserves used in calculating depletion of proved oil and natural gas properties  future cash flows  asset retirement obligations  impairment when applicable of undeveloped properties  the collectability of outstanding accounts receivable  fair values of financial derivative instruments  contingencies and the results of current and future litigation 
oil and natural gas estimates  which are the basis for units of production depletion  have numerous inherent uncertainties 
the accuracy of any reserve estimates is a function of the quality of available data and of engineering and geological interpretation and judgment 
subsequent drilling results  testing and production may justify revision of such estimates 
accordingly  reserve estimates are often different from the quantities of oil and natural gas that are ultimately recovered 
in addition  reserve estimates are vulnerable to changes in wellhead prices of crude oil and natural gas 
these prices have been volatile in the past and can be expected to be volatile in the future 
the significant estimates are based on current assumptions that may be materially affected by changes in future economic conditions such as the market prices received for sales of oil and natural gas  interest rates  and our ability to generate future income 
future changes in these assumptions may materially affect these significant estimates in the near term 
natural gas and oil reserve quantities our estimate of proved reserves is based on the quantities of oil and natural gas that engineering and geological analyses demonstrate  with reasonable certainty  to be recoverable from established reservoirs in the future under current operating and economic parameters 
for the years ended december  and  netherland sewell and associates  inc nsai and schlumberger consulting and data services schlumberger prepared a consolidated reserve and economic evaluation of our proved oil and gas reserves 
schlumberger evaluated the proved reserves of our marcellus shale properties while nsai evaluated the proved reserves on all of our other properties 

table of contents reserves and their relation to estimated future net cash flows impact our depletion and impairment calculations 
as a result  adjustments to depletion and impairment are made concurrently with changes to reserve estimates 
we prepare our reserve estimates  and the projected cash flows derived from these reserve estimates  in accordance with sec guidelines 
our independent engineering firms adhere to the same guidelines when preparing its reserve reports 
the accuracy of our reserve estimates is a function of many factors  including the quality and quantity of available data  the interpretation of that data  the accuracy of various mandated economic assumptions  and the judgments of the individuals preparing the estimates 
any of the assumptions inherent in these factors could deviate significantly from actual results 
as such  reserve estimates may materially vary from the ultimate quantities of natural gas and oil eventually recovered 
the independent reserve engineer estimates reserves annually on december this annual estimate results in a new dd a rate  which we use for the preceding fourth quarter after adjusting for fourth quarter production 
derivative instruments we use put and call options collars and fixed rate swap contracts to manage price risks in connection with the sale of oil and natural gas 
we also use interest rate swap agreements to manage interest rate risks associated with our variable rate credit facility 
we account for these collar and swap contracts using sfas  accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities sfas 
we have established the fair value of all derivative instruments using estimates determined by our counterparties 
these values are based upon  among other things  future prices  volatility  time to maturity and credit risk 
the values we report in our consolidated financial statements change as these estimates are revised to reflect actual results  changes in market conditions or other factors 
sfas establishes accounting and reporting standards requiring derivative instruments including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts or agreements to be recorded at fair value and included in the consolidated balance sheets as assets or liabilities 
the accounting for changes in fair value of a derivative instrument depends on the intended use of the derivative and the resulting designation  which is established at the inception of a derivative 
for derivative instruments designed as cash flow hedges  changes in fair value  to the extent the hedge is effective  are recognized in other comprehensive income until the hedged item is recognized in earnings 
any changes in fair value resulting from ineffectiveness  as defined by sfas  is recognized immediately in earnings 
for derivative instruments designated as fair value hedges in accordance with sfas  changes in fair value  as well as the offsetting changes in the estimated fair value of the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk  are recognized currently in earnings 
derivative effectiveness is measured annually based on the relative changes in fair value between the derivative contract and the hedged item over time 
for derivatives on oil and natural gas production activity  our evaluations are not documented  and as a result  we record changes on the derivative valuations through earnings 
oil and natural gas property  depreciation and depletion we account for natural gas and oil exploration and production activities under the successful efforts method of accounting 
proved developed natural gas and oil property acquisition costs are capitalized when incurred 
unproved properties with individually significant acquisition costs are assessed quarterly on a property by property basis and any impairment in value is recognized 
if the unproved properties are determined to be productive  the appropriate related costs are transferred to proved natural gas and oil properties 
natural gas and oil exploration costs  other than the costs of drilling exploratory wells  are charged to expense as incurred 
the costs of drilling exploratory wells are capitalized pending determination of whether they have discovered proved commercial reserves 
if proved commercial reserves are not discovered  such drilling costs are expensed 
costs to develop proved reserves  including the costs of all development well and related equipment used in the production of natural gas and oil  are capitalized 

table of contents depletion  depreciation and amortization are calculated using the units of production method on estimated proved developed producing oil and gas reserves at the lease or well level 
in arriving at rates under the units of production method  the quantities of recoverable oil and natural gas are established based on estimates made by our geologists and engineers and independent engineers 
we periodically review our proved reserve estimates and makes changes as needed to depletion  depreciation and amortization expenses to account for new wells drilled  acquisitions  divestitures and other events which may have caused significant changes in our estimated proved developed producing reserves 
the costs of unproved properties are withheld from the depletion base until such time as they are either developed or abandoned 
when proved reserves are assigned or the property is considered to be impaired  the cost of the property or the amount of the impairment is added to costs subject to depletion calculations 
non producing properties consist of undeveloped leasehold cost and costs associated with the purchase of certain proved undeveloped reserves 
undeveloped leasehold cost is transferred to the associated producing properties 
individually significant non producing properties are periodically assessed for impairment of value 
service properties  equipment and other assets are depreciated using the straight line method over their estimated useful lives of to years 
we account for impairment under the provisions of sfas  accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets sfas 
when circumstances indicate that an asset may be impaired  we compare expected undiscounted future cash flows at a producing field to the unamortized capitalized cost of the asset 
if the future undiscounted cash flows  based on our estimate of future natural gas and oil prices  operating costs  anticipated production from proved reserves and other relevant data  are lower than the unamortized capitalized cost  the capitalized cost is reduced to fair value 
fair value is calculated by discounting the future cash flows at an appropriate risk adjusted discount rate 
at december   we recognized approximately million of impairment on certain oil and gas properties in the illinois basin and appalachian basin 
we also recorded million of impairment related to our southwest region properties  which was recognized as expense in our results from discontinued operations 
the impairment of these properties can be attributed to the decline in oil and natural gas prices at december   as compared to expenditures for repairs and maintenance to sustain or increase production from the existing producing reservoir are charged to expense as incurred 
expenditures to recomplete a current well are capitalized pending determination that economic reserves have been added 
if the recompletion is not successful  the expenditures are charged to expense 
significant tangible equipment added or replaced that extends the useful or productive life of the property is capitalized 
expenditures to construct facilities or increase the productive capacity from existing reservoirs are capitalized 
upon the sale or retirement of a proved natural gas or oil property  or an entire interest in unproved leaseholds  the cost and related accumulated depreciation  depletion  and amortization are removed from the property accounts and the resulting gain or loss is recognized 
for sales of a partial interest in unproved leaseholds for cash or cash equivalents  sales proceeds are first applied as a reduction of the original cost of the entire interest in the property  and any remaining proceeds are recognized as a gain 
goodwill and intangible assets in accordance with sfas  goodwill and other intangible assets sfas  no amortization is recorded for goodwill or intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives for acquisitions completed after june  sfas requires that goodwill and non amortizable assets be assessed annually for impairment 
at december   our intangible assets consisted of  of sales agreements that are amortized using the straight line method over an estimated useful life of five years 
these intangible assets resulted from the reorganization transactions see note basis of presentation and principles of consolidation 
for the years ended december    and  we recorded amortization expense of   and  respectively 
amortization expense was recorded only for those periods following the reorganization transactions 

table of contents goodwill and identified intangible assets that have an indefinite useful life are subject to impairment testing  which we conduct annually  or on an interim basis if events or changes in circumstances between annual tests indicate the assets might be impaired 
we perform our annual impairment test for goodwill and identified intangible assets that have an indefinite useful life as of december of each year 
the impairment test involves a comparison of the fair value of each tangible and intangible asset to its carrying value 
if the fair value is less than the carrying value  a further test is required to measure the amount of impairment 
at december   we recorded impairment of goodwill of million  which represented of the prior carrying value 
future abandonment cost we account for future abandonment costs using sfas  asset retirement obligations sfas 
this statement applies to obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long lived assets that result from the acquisition and development of the asset 
sfas requires that the fair value of a liability for a retirement obligation be recognized in the period in which the liability is incurred 
for natural gas and oil properties  this is the period in which the natural gas or oil well is acquired or drilled 
the future abandonment cost is capitalized as part of the carrying amount of our natural gas and oil properties at its discounted fair value 
the liability is then accreted each period until the liability is settled or the natural gas or oil well is sold  at which time the liability is reversed 
according to sfas  if the fair value of a recorded asset retirement obligation changes  a revision is to be recorded to both the asset retirement obligation and the asset retirement cost 
during the fourth quarter of  we recognized an increase of million in the estimated present value of the asset retirement obligations 
the primary factors underlying the fair value revisions were an overall increase in abandonment cost estimates  the effect of changes in inflation and discount rates used in the calculations  and changes to the estimated useful life assumptions 
deferred taxes we are subject to income and other taxes in all areas in which we operate 
when recording income tax expense  certain estimates are required because income tax returns are generally filed several months after the close of a calendar year  tax returns are subject to audit which can take years to complete  and future events often impact the timing of when income tax expenses and benefits are recognized 
we have deferred tax assets relating to tax operating loss carryforwards and other deductible differences 
we routinely evaluate deferred tax assets to determine the likelihood of realization 
a valuation allowance is recognized on deferred tax assets when we believe that certain of these assets are not likely to be realized 
we may be challenged by taxing authorities over the amount and or timing of recognition of revenues and deductions in our various income tax returns 
although we believe that we have adequately provided for all taxes  gains or losses could occur in the future due to changes in estimates or resolution of outstanding tax matters 
contingent liabilities a provision for legal  environmental and other contingent matters is charged to expense when the loss is probable and the cost or range of cost can be reasonably estimated 
judgment is often required to determine when expenses should be recorded for legal  environmental and contingent matters 
in addition  we often must estimate the amount of such losses 
in many cases  our judgment is based on the input of our legal advisors and on the interpretation of laws and regulations  which can be interpreted differently by regulators and or the courts 
we monitor known and potential legal  environmental and other contingent matters and make our best estimate of when to record losses for these matters based on available information 
we have recognized an accrued liability of approximately  at december  for the estimated cost of pending litigation matters 

table of contents accounting standards not yet adopted in december  the fasb issued sfas  noncontrolling interests in consolidated financial statements sfas  which provides direction on reporting minority noncontrolling interests in the consolidated financial statements 
the standards set forth in sfas include clearly identifying and labeling noncontrolling interests in the consolidated statement of equity  separate from the parent s equity  clearly identifying consolidated net income of the parent and the noncontrolling interests on the consolidated statement of income  consistently accounting for changes in the parent ownership interest when the parent preserves its controlling interest  using fair value to measure any retained noncontrolling equity investment of a deconsolidated subsidiary and any resulting gain or loss and providing a level of detail in disclosures that clearly identifies and separates the interests of the parent and the interests of the noncontrolling owners

this statement is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years and interim periods beginning after november   with early application encouraged 
we adopted sfas as of january  adoption did not have a material effect on our financial position and results of operations 
in december  the sec adopted rule changes to modernize its oil and gas reporting disclosures 
the changes are intended to provide investors with a more meaningful and comprehensive understanding of oil and gas reserves 
the updated disclosure requirements are designed to align with current practices and changes in technology that have taken place in the oil and gas industry since the adoption of the original reporting requirements more than years ago 
new disclosure requirements include permitting the use of new technologies to determine proved reserves if those technologies have been demonstrated empirically to lead to reliable conclusions about reserve volumes  enabling companies to additionally disclose their probable and possible reserves to investors currently  the rules limit disclosure to only proved reserves  allowing previously excluded resources  such as oil sands  to 
table of contents be classified as oil and gas reserves  requiring companies to report on the independence and qualifications of a preparer or auditor and requiring companies to file reports when a third party is relied upon to prepare reserve estimates or conduct a reserves audit  and requiring companies to report oil and gas reserves using an average price based upon the prior month period rather than the year end price to maximize the comparability of reserve estimates among companies and mitigate the distortion of the estimates that arises when using a single pricing date 
the new requirements are effective for registration statements filed on or after january   and for annual reports on forms k for fiscal years ending on or after december  we expect the new guidance to change our disclosures  dd a calculations and other fair value measurements 
we are currently evaluating the impact for our form k for the year ending december  and related financial statements 
volatility of oil and natural gas prices our revenues  future rate of growth  results of operations  financial condition and ability to borrow funds or obtain additional capital  as well as the carrying value of our properties  are substantially dependent upon prevailing prices of oil and natural gas 
we account for our natural gas and oil exploration and production activities under the successful efforts method of accounting 
see note summary of significant accounting policies 
to mitigate some of our commodity price risk we engage periodically in certain other limited derivative activities  including price swaps and costless collars  to establish some price floor protection 
for the twelve month periods ended december  and  the net realized loss on oil and natural gas derivatives was approximately million and million  respectively 
the losses are reported as net realized loss on derivatives in the consolidated and combined statements of operations 
for the twelve month period ended december   the net unrealized gain on oil and natural gas derivatives was approximately million  as compared to a net unrealized loss of approximately million on oil and natural gas derivatives for the net unrealized gains and losses are reported as net unrealized gains losses on derivatives in the consolidated and combined statements of operations 
while the use of derivative arrangements limits the downside risk of adverse price movements  it may also limit our ability to benefit from increases in the prices of oil and natural gas 
we enter into the majority of our derivative transactions with two counterparties and have a netting agreement in place with each of these counterparties 
we do not obtain collateral to support the agreements  but monitor the financial viability of counterparties and believe our credit risk is minimal on these transactions 
under these arrangements  payments are received or made based on the differential between a fixed and a variable commodity price 
these agreements are settled in cash at expiration or exchanged for physical delivery contracts 
in the event of nonperformance  we would be exposed again to price risk 
we have additional risk of financial loss because the price received for the product at the actual physical delivery point may differ from the prevailing price at the delivery point required for settlement of the derivative transaction 
moreover  our derivative arrangements generally do not apply to all of our production  and thus provide only partial price protection against declines in commodity prices 
we expect that the amount of our derivatives will vary from time to time

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to various risks  including energy commodity price risk 
we expect energy prices to remain volatile and unpredictable 
if energy prices were to continue at depressed levels for a substantial amount of time or further decline significantly  revenues and cash flows would significantly decline  and our ability to borrow to finance our operations could be adversely impacted 
we have designed our hedging policy to reduce the risk of price volatility for our production in the natural gas and crude oil markets 
our risk management policy provides for the use of derivative instruments to manage these risks 
the types of derivative instruments that we use include swaps and collars 
the volume of derivative instruments that we may use are governed by the risk management policy and can vary from year to year  but under most circumstances will apply to only a portion of our current and anticipated production  and will provide only partial price protection against declines in oil and natural gas prices 
we are exposed to market risk on our open contracts  to the extent of changes in market prices 
table of contents of oil and natural gas 
however  the market risk exposure on these hedged contracts is generally offset by the gain or loss recognized upon the ultimate sale of the commodity that is hedged 
further  if our counterparties should default  this protection might be limited as we might not receive the benefits of the hedges 
we are also exposed to market risk related to adverse changes in interest rates 
our interest rate risk exposure results primarily from fluctuations in short term rates  which are libor and prime rate based  as determined by our lenders  and may result in reductions of earnings or cash flows due to increases in the interest rates we pay on our obligations
