retail operations consist of company operated midas and speedee shops 
real estate activities include the development  ownership and leasing of midas and speedee shops in the us and canada 
supply chain activities include providing value added merchandising services to franchisees in which the company establishes relationships with vendors who distribute products and equipment directly to midas and speedee shops 
point of sale technology operations consist of the ownership  development  sale and leasing of automotive shop management software to midas franchisees and other third party automotive service providers 
outside of north america the company operates on a master franchise basis where the midas and speedee trademarks are licensed to master franchisees that sub franchise midas and speedee shops in their respective territories 
mds management is focused on building shareholder value through the profitable growth of the company 
the two main drivers of profit growth for mds are increases in comparable shop sales and increases in shop count through the sale of additional franchised units 
these two drivers are closely integrated  as the sale of franchises is much easier in an environment where franchised shop sales and profits are growing 
over the past several years the midas system in north america has struggled both in terms of sales and shop profitability 
retail sales at franchised shops in the us declined in each of the last three years as a weakening 
table of contents economy  high gasoline prices and the first reduction in miles driven since combined to erode customer demand 
in addition  demand for exhaust replacement  one of midas historical core categories  has continued to decline 
as a consequence  the midas shop count in north america has decreased as franchisees have left the system 
since  the number of midas shops in north america has fallen by shops  or about 
the current weak economic conditions show no signs of abating  and while the recent decline in new car sales should increase demand for auto repair and maintenance services  consumers lack confidence and remain cautious in their spending as they delay key repairs and maintenance in the near term 
midas retail sales have been especially hard hit in the economically depressed west and southeast regions of the us where over of us midas system shops are located 
growing comparable shop sales mds management believes the key to growing sales in the midas system in north america is to focus on those services that are most critical to the regular maintenance of vehicles brake replacement  fluid replacement and tire replacement 
these services are required of all vehicles at periodic intervals and management believes future success in automotive service requires that a service provider possess expertise  credibility and top of mind awareness in all three categories 
these periodic services will serve as the gateway to forming broader  long term relationships with customers  including factory scheduled maintenance and major repairs 
the company is working in concert with midas franchisees to implement key initiatives in each of these three service categories in order to grow sales as follows 
brakes the midas system has long been a leader in the brake category throughout north america 
the company s strength in brake services dates back nearly years and is backed by the well known midas lifetime guarantee 
while brakes remain the largest and most profitable service category for the midas system  brake sales at retail have declined over the past several years  producing a significant drag on overall system sales performance 
during  retail comparable shop brake sales in the midas system declined in the us  although they increased in canada 
given the overall importance of the brake category to the midas system  improving brake sales in the us is a priority 
the company s efforts to drive retail brake sales starts with ensuring brake product quality across the midas system 
during  the company introduced new mandatory minimum performance standards for midas brake friction to be used by franchisees 
in connection with the improved product quality standards  the company launched its securestop branded brake service  which helps midas differentiate the service provided by the franchisees amongst numerous competitors who rely almost exclusively on price 
during the company is changing its promotional brake strategy from national single price point television advertising to a more locally focused advertising approach 
brake service is very competitive on a local level and management believes the move to more emphasis on local advertising will provide midas franchisees with greater flexibility in addressing local market conditions 
furthermore  it should allow for a more consistent share of voice in brake promotions 
tires in fiscal  midas successfully launched a major retail initiative to significantly expand midas shop sales of tires and related tire services 
in support of this objective  the company formed an alliance with bridgestone firestone to distribute tires directly to midas system shops throughout north america 
as a result  comparable shop sales of tires and related tire services in north america increased significantly in each of the past four years 
most recently  during  comparable shop sales of tires increased in the us and nearly in canada 
despite this multi year success in driving tire sales  tires remain a relatively small component of the midas system overall sales mix less than in the us and in canada for management now believes that achieving a sales mix in tires is both attainable and important to the future growth of the midas system in north america 
the company continues to test a significantly expanded tire program in certain company operated and franchised midas shops 
if this program succeeds  it will serve as a model for shops throughout the midas 
table of contents system 
going forward  the company believes that sales of tires and related tire services will be a significant component of future revenue growth for the midas system 
fluid exchanges in fiscal  the company began the roll out of a series of initiatives designed to build sales in maintenance services as a means to increase repeat customer business 
the program most importantly included the standardization of the midas oil change service and vehicle inspection process  providing all customers with suggested factory maintenance schedules and increasing the midas shop s focus and capabilities in fluid exchange services  which are an increasingly important component of factory scheduled maintenance 
in response to the company s efforts to build maintenance revenues and increase shop visit frequency  comparable shop sales of oil changes in north america increased by more than in on top of a increase in however  revenues from this category still represent less than of midas system sales  and the typical midas shop performs less than six oil changes per day 
while oil change revenue and car count have been growing over the past several years  management believes the midas system has the capacity to significantly increase that number by leveraging the operating knowledge of the speedee system and enhanced local marketing efforts 
growth in car count is important to driving sales growth in the midas system 
mds management believes that while the current economic environment  and the need to develop stronger customer relationships  pose significant challenges for automotive aftermarket service providers  the potential to succeed has never been greater for those existing franchisees that are willing and able to adapt 
growing shop count since fiscal  annual midas shop closings have exceeded annual new shop openings 
the annual shop closing rate during this period of approximately is consistent with other mature retail companies  however the opening rate has lagged 
this reduced opening rate is due to a variety of factors including the increased complexity of the midas shop operating model  a lack of focus on new shop development by the mds management team during many of those years  an over supply of automotive repair centers in general  and a re deployment of capital by mds away from real estate investments 
during this time the company has also diverted many new franchisees that may have opened new shops away from new shop development and instead have helped them buy existing midas shops from existing midas franchisees 
midas is an older franchise system and thus numerous long term franchisees have struggled with the ongoing changes required to adapt to the current automotive aftermarket 
the company has been working diligently to identify those franchisees that are not capable or not willing to adapt to the new environment and has been assisting them in transitioning out of the midas system 
this has caused many new franchisees to purchase existing midas shops rather than to develop new ones 
this transformation has been underway for some time and midas achieved shop transitions in fiscal  a total of shop transitions in  and shop transitions in fiscal during fiscal  approximately of these shops were transitioned to franchisees that were new to the midas system 
the benefits of transitioning midas shops to new franchisees can be seen in the performance of these shops 
sales at shops within the first year after transition have historically far outperformed the sales performance of the broader midas system 
in some cases  the improvement is dramatic with sales rising as much as 
in the next several years the company hopes to accelerate the number of transitions each year and thereby increase the capacity of the midas system as a whole to adapt and thrive in this new business environment 
in addition to transitions  the company believes that the roll out of the midas speedee co brand concept and the acquisition conversion of competing automotive repair centers both provide a significant opportunity to grow the north american franchise system 
a successful test of the new midas speedee co brand concept has the potential to create a new growth platform for the company by substantially enhancing the economics and return on investment of a franchised automotive service shop 
because the automotive service market is both fragmented and saturated  the company believes that unit growth is best achieved through acquisitions and 
table of contents conversions of independents rather than de novo opening of newly constructed sites 
these two opportunities are explained in greater detail below 
the midas speedee co brand opportunity in march  mds acquired the speedee auto service franchise system 
the speedee business model focuses on fluid exchanges and maintenance  providing a high quality auto service experience in a quick service format 
speedee leverages the quick service customer relationship as a gateway to a broader general repair relationship with its customers 
since its acquisition  the speedee system has performed well  generating approximately flat comparable shop sales in fiscal despite the weak economy 
the company believes the acquisition of speedee provides both the midas and speedee franchise systems with a unique opportunity for growth in the future 
by combining into one location midas expertise in general repairs and strong brand awareness with speedee s strength in executing quick lube and fluid exchanges  the company believes it can create a powerful new format focused on satisfying the needs of time pressed consumers seeking value  excellence and a long term auto service relationship 
the company expects that a midas speedee co brand format shop will see customers much earlier in the lifecycle of their vehicle relative to the typical midas shop and will be more able to convert these vehicles into general repair customers relative to the typical speedee shop as the vehicles age 
the resulting higher unit sales volume may produce a higher return on investment for the franchisee by better leveraging shop overhead expenses 
the company launched its first test of the speedee midas co brand concept with three shops during the third quarter of fiscal all three were existing speedee locations in california that added the midas brand to their shop 
a fourth co branded unit  also in california  opened on a de novo basis in october the initial results have been encouraging as the three test units saw comparable shop sales increases of in the third quarter after they were co branded and in the fourth quarter of fiscal the company expects to test co branding at additional speedee locations during the first half of during december of  the company began a test of the co brand concept within existing midas shops 
three midas company operated shops in suburban chicago were remodeled to accommodate the operating requirements of the speedee concept  which generate much higher car throughput than the typical midas shop 
these three test locations officially launched with grand opening promotions during the first quarter of fiscal the results of this test will be critical in determining the issues involved with integrating the speedee model into selected midas locations across the us and canada 
testing of the midas speedee co brand concept across numerous shop formats will be completed during if successful  the new co brand format could provide a platform for accelerating company growth by providing co brand opportunities to existing midas and speedee franchisees  as well as a superior format for de novo shop growth in the future 
acquisitions and conversions the us automotive repair industry is highly fragmented 
this is demonstrated by the fact that midas  as one of the largest automotive maintenance and repair providers in the us with  locations  represents less than of the estimated  automotive repair shops in the us as of december  despite the increase in the number of vehicles on the road in the us over the last years  the number of automotive service outlets in the us has been in decline 
vehicle complexity and the resulting need for highly skilled technicians  training programs and technologically advanced diagnostic equipment  along with the increased cost of real estate  has caused a net decrease of almost  automotive repair outlets in the past years 
more recently  automobile dealerships have been closing in record numbers  causing consumers to seek out alternatives 
the company believes that the acquisition of existing automotive repair shops  as well as the conversion of independent repair facilities to the midas and speedee brands  is the most efficient way to grow the mds system 
this strategy is consistent with the actions of other competitors such as monro muffler brake  whose growth has been primarily the result of acquisitions rather than de novo shop openings 
the implementation of 
table of contents this strategy included the fiscal acquisition of the shop speedee system  as well as the conversion to midas of two independent automotive repair shops 
the company believes that the current economic environment will result in an increase in acquisition and conversion opportunities  as competitors struggle to remain viable during this economic downturn 
fiscal reporting periods fiscal was comprised of weeks  and fiscal years and each were comprised of weeks 
the extra week in fiscal year did not have a material impact on results of operations  because the approximately million in additional revenues were completely offset by a similar amount of additional costs and expenses 
results of operations fiscal compared to fiscal total sales and revenues for fiscal increased million  or  from fiscal to million 
within the retail auto service business  royalty revenues and license fees decreased million  or  from fiscal this decrease primarily reflects a scheduled reduction in the international royalties paid by midas europe to mds of approximately million  weakness in retail sales as total north american comparable shop sales declined and an increase in the number of company operated shops whose royalties are eliminated 
these impacts were partially offset by a million increase in royalties due to the march acquisition of the speedee business

company operated shop occupancy and other expenses increased as a percentage of sales from in fiscal to in fiscal as a result of changes in the composition of the company operated shop portfolio

table of contents replacement part cost of sales increased to of replacement part sales and product royalties from in fiscal the increased cost of replacement part sales relative to revenue was due to the change in the us warranty program beginning in fiscal in which midas no longer collects product royalty revenue from u

in fiscal  an million favorable adjustment was recorded to the us warranty reserve as a result of a change in estimate for the expected redemption rate on warranted brakes and exhaust 
selling  general and administrative expenses in fiscal increased million  or  from fiscal to million 
the increase reflects an incremental million in operating expense for the speedee business  a million increase in outside legal costs  primarily due to two potential class action lawsuits and a million increase in costs incurred to accelerate the transition of shops to new owners 
these areas of increased spending were partially offset by the company s ongoing expense reduction program  which included lower costs for rent in the midas corporate office as a result of a new lease arrangement  as well as lower costs for management bonus compensation due to lower than expected operating results

significant comparable shop sales growth in the new categories of tires of  oil of and other non traditional services of  could not offset a decline in brakes and a decline in exhaust 
the decline in exhaust was anticipated and it was consistent with the long term trend in this business 
however  the company believes it lost market share in the brake category as intense price competition and a softening economy appear to have driven some consumers to lower priced competitors

table of contents critical accounting policies and estimates in preparing the consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  management must make a variety of decisions which impact the reported amounts and related disclosures 
such decisions include the selection of the appropriate accounting principles to be applied  the assumptions on which to base accounting estimates  and the consistent application of those accounting principles 
due to the type of industry in which the company operates and the nature of its business  and the company s recent business transformation process  the following accounting policies are those that management believes are most important to the portrayal of the company s financial condition and results and that require management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
valuation of warranty liabilities customers are provided a written warranty from mds on certain midas products purchased from midas shops in north america  namely brake friction  mufflers  shocks and struts 
the warranty will be honored at any midas shop in north america and is valid for the lifetime of the vehicle  but is voided if the vehicle is sold 
the company maintains a warranty accrual to cover the estimated future liability associated with outstanding warranties 
the company determines the estimated value of outstanding warranty claims based on an estimate of the percentage of all warranted products sold and registered in prior periods at retail that are likely to be redeemed  and an estimate of the cost of redemption of each future warranty claim on a current cost basis 
these estimates are computed using actual historical registration and redemption data as well as actual cost information on current redemptions 
the determination of the number of warranted products sold that are likely to be redeemed requires mds to make significant estimates and assumptions regarding the relationship of historical warranty claim behavior to future warranty claim behavior  warranty claim behavior across product lines and geographical areas  and  the impact of changes in consumer behavior on future warranty claims 
a decrease of one percentage point in the estimated percentage of warranted products likely to be redeemed in the us would have the effect of changing the company s january  outstanding us warranty liability by approximately million 
a change in the estimated current cost of warranty redemptions of one dollar would have the effect of changing the outstanding us warranty liability by million 
as of january   the company changed how the midas warranty obligations are funded in the united states 
from june through december  product royalties received from the company s preferred supply chain vendors were recorded as revenue and substantially offset the cost of warranty claims 
beginning in fiscal  the midas warranty program in the united states is funded directly by midas franchisees 
the franchisees are charged a fee for each warranted product sold to customers 
the fee is charged when the warranty is registered with the company 
the fee billed to franchisees is deferred and is recognized as revenue when the actual warranty is redeemed and included in warranty expense 
this fee is intended to cover the company s cost of the new warranty program  thus revenues under this program will match expenses and the new warranty program will have no impact on the results of operations 
in connection with this change  beginning in midas system franchisees in the united states started receiving rebates on their purchases from the company s preferred supply chain vendors and mds no longer receives product royalties on midas franchisee purchases in the united states 
because the company s us supply chain partners are responsible for the warranty of parts during the first months  mds will not begin to record revenues or expenses under the new program until fiscal as of january   deferred warranty obligations under this new program were million 
the midas warranty program in canada has not changed 
the company continues to receive royalties from certain preferred supply chain vendors based on midas franchisee purchases in canada and records a periodic warranty expense 

table of contents valuation of receivables the company records receivables due from its franchisees and other customers at the time the sale is recorded in accordance with its revenue recognition policies 
these receivables consist of amounts due from the sale of products  royalties due from franchisees and suppliers  rents and other amounts 
the future collectibility of these amounts can be impacted by the company s collection efforts  the financial stability of its customers  and the general economic climate in which it operates 
recent market conditions have increased the inherent uncertainty involved in making these estimates 
any adverse change in these factors could have a significant impact on the collectibility of these assets and could have a material impact on the company s consolidated financial statements 
the company applies a consistent practice of establishing an allowance for accounts that it feels may become uncollectible through reviewing the historical aging of its receivables and by monitoring the financial strength of its franchisees and other customers 
where mds becomes aware of a customer s inability to meet its financial obligations eg  where it is in financial distress or has filed for bankruptcy  the company specifically reserves for the potential bad debt to reduce the net recognized receivable to the amount it reasonably believes will be collected 
the valuation of receivables is performed on a quarterly basis 
pensions the company has non contributory defined benefit pension plans covering certain of its employees 
the company s funding policy for the us plan is to contribute amounts sufficient to meet the minimum funding requirement of the employee retirement income act of  plus any additional amounts the company may deem to be appropriate 
the company accounts for its defined benefit pension plans in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 employers accounting for pensions  and sfas no 
 employers accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans an amendment of fasb statements no 
  and r  which require that amounts recognized in the financial statements be determined on an actuarial basis 
under sfas no 
 the amount recorded as pension assets or liabilities is determined by comparing the projected benefit obligation pbo to the fair value of the plan assets 
amounts recognized in accumulated other comprehensive loss consist of unrecognized actuarial gains  losses  and prior service costs  net of tax 
as of january   the company has recorded accrued pension costs as follows in millions fiscal year prepaid pension asset canadian prepaid reserve accrued pension liability accrued pension costs the million valuation reserve pertains to the partial wind up of the canadian salaried defined benefit pension plan 
as per provincial laws  the asset balance in excess of the projected benefit obligation is not an asset of the company 
to account for its defined benefit pension plans in accordance with sfas no 
 the company must make three main determinations at the end of each fiscal year first  it must determine the actuarial assumption for the discount rate used to reflect the time value of money in the calculation of the projected benefit obligation for the end of the current fiscal year and to determine the net periodic pension cost for the subsequent year 
for guidance in determining this rate  the company looks at rates of return on high quality fixed income investments and periodic published rate ranges 
see note of notes to financial statements for a listing of the discount rates used by year 

table of contents second  the company must determine the actuarial assumption for rates of increase in compensation levels used in the calculation of the accumulated and projected benefit obligations for the end of the current fiscal year and to determine the net periodic pension cost for the subsequent year 
in determining these rates the company looks at its historical and expected rates of annual salary increases 
see note of notes to financial statements for a listing of the rates of increase in compensation levels used by year 
third  the company must determine the expected long term rate of return on assets assumption that is used to determine the expected return on plan assets component of the net periodic pension cost for the subsequent year 
the difference between the actual return on plan assets and the expected return is deferred under sfas no 
and is recognized in net periodic pension cost over a five year period 
see note of notes to financial statements for a listing of the expected long term rates used by year 
the company assumed a long term rate of return on pension assets of in fiscal and  and experienced a loss on plan assets of million in fiscal  and a gain on plan assets of million in fiscal recent market conditions have resulted in an unusually high degree of volatility and increased risks associated with certain investments held by mds pension plans  which could impact the value of investments  net periodic pension costs and future funding requirements after the date of this filing 
the company s pension plan investments are comprised of bond and equity mutual funds and cash reserves 
the pension plans have no investments in alternative investment vehicles such as private equity funds or hedge funds  nor have the plans ever held such investments 
carrying values of goodwill and long lived assets goodwill the company tests the recorded amount of goodwill for recovery on an annual basis in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year 
goodwill is tested more frequently if indicators of impairment exist 
the company continually assesses whether any indicators of impairment exist  which requires a significant amount of judgment 
such indicators may include a sustained significant decline in the company s share price and market capitalization  a decline in the company s expected future cash flows  a significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate  unanticipated competition  the testing for recoverability of a significant asset group within a reporting unit  or slower growth rates  among others 
any adverse change in these factors could have a significant impact on the recoverability of these assets and could have a material impact on the company s consolidated financial statements 
the goodwill impairment test is a two step analysis 
in step one  the fair value of each reporting unit is compared to its book value 
management must apply judgment in determining the estimated fair value of these reporting units 
fair value is determined using a combination of present value techniques and quoted market prices of comparable businesses 
if the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying value  goodwill is not deemed to be impaired for that reporting unit  and no further testing would be necessary 
if the fair value of the reporting unit is less than the carrying value  the company performs step two 
step two uses the calculated fair value of the reporting unit to perform a hypothetical purchase price allocation to the fair value of the assets and liabilities of the reporting unit 
the difference between the fair value of the reporting unit calculated in step one and the fair value of the underlying assets and liabilities of the reporting unit is the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill 
a charge is recorded in the financial statements if the carrying value of the reporting unit s goodwill is greater than its implied fair value 
the determination of fair value of the reporting units and assets and liabilities within the reporting units requires management to make significant estimates and assumptions 
these estimates and assumptions primarily include  but are not limited to  the discount rate  terminal growth rates  earnings before depreciation and amortization  and capital expenditures forecasts 
due to the inherent uncertainty involved in making these estimates  actual results could differ from those estimates 
in both the us and canada  the reporting unit is defined as retail operations  which consists of both franchised and company operated locations 
long lived assets long lived assets include property and equipment  intangible assets  long term prepaid assets and other non current assets 
the company reviews long lived assets held for use for impairment 
table of contents whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable 
events that may indicate long lived assets may not be recoverable include  but are not limited to  a significant decrease in the market price of long lived assets  a significant adverse change in the manner in which the company utilizes a long lived asset  a significant adverse change in the business climate  a recent history of operating or cash flow losses  or a current expectation that it is more likely than not likely that a long lived asset will be sold or disposed of in the future 
for impairment testing purposes  the company groups its long lived assets at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other groups of assets and liabilities the asset group 
if the company determines that a long lived asset or asset group may not be recoverable  it compares the sum of the expected undiscounted future cash flows that the asset or asset group is expected to generate to the asset or asset group s carrying value 
if the sum of the undiscounted future cash flows exceed the carrying amount of the asset or asset group  the asset or asset group is not considered impaired 
however  if the sum of the undiscounted future cash flows is less than the carrying amount of the assets or asset group  a loss is recognized for the difference between the fair value of the asset or asset group and the carrying value of the asset or asset group 
the fair value of the asset or asset group is generally determined by discounting the expected future cash flows using a discount rate that is commensurate with the risk associated with the amount and timing of the expected future cash flows 
due to the inherent uncertainty involved in making these estimates  actual results could differ from those estimates 
deferred income taxes in assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets  management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible 
management considers the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities  projected future taxable income  and tax planning strategies in making this assessment 
any adverse change in these factors could have a significant impact on the realizability of the company s deferred tax assets and could have a material impact on the company s consolidated financial statements 
based upon the level of historical taxable income and projections for future taxable income over the periods in which the deferred tax assets are deductible  management believes it is more likely than not that the company will realize the benefits of these deductible differences at january  in the event that management determines the company would not be able to realize all or part of the net deferred tax assets in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax assets would be charged to income in the period such determination was made 
as of january   the company had recorded a valuation allowance of million against certain state income tax net operating loss carryforwards because the company has determined that it is more likely than not that this portion of these deferred tax assets will not be realized 
however  due to the inherent uncertainty involved in determining the realizability of the company s deferred tax assets  the future realizability could differ from management estimates at january  impact of new accounting standards in september  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standard sfas no 
 fair value measurements  sfas 
sfas defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value in generally accepted accounting principles  and expands disclosures about fair value measurements 
the provisions of this standard apply to other accounting pronouncements that require or permit fair value measurements 
sfas became effective for mds on december  the beginning of fiscal 
the only applicability of this standard for the company was related to its existing interest rate swaps 
the company adopted this provision  which resulted in a  decrease in long term swap liability  a  reduction in deferred income taxes and a  increase in accumulated other comprehensive loss through the end of fiscal the adoption of sfas had no impact on the results of operations or cash provided by operating activities

the company disclaims any intention or obligation to update or revise any forward looking statements  whether as a result of new information  future events  or otherwise 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is subject to certain market risks  including foreign currency and interest rates 
mds uses a variety of practices to manage these market risks  including  when considered appropriate  derivative financial instruments 
the company uses derivative financial instruments only for risk management and does not use them for trading or speculative purposes 
mds is exposed to potential gains or losses from foreign currency fluctuations affecting net investments and earnings denominated in foreign currencies 
historically  the company s primary exposure is to changes in exchange rates for the us dollar versus the canadian dollar 
beginning in fiscal  the company became exposed to changes in exchange rates between the us dollar and the euro for international license fees from europe that were previously fixed and denominated in us dollars 
interest rate risk is managed through variable rate borrowings in combination with swaps to fixed interest rates on a portion of those borrowings 
the company is exposed to credit risk on certain assets  primarily accounts receivable 
the company provides credit to customers in the ordinary course of business and performs ongoing credit evaluations 
concentrations of credit risk with respect to trade receivables are limited due to the large number of customers comprising the company s customer base 
the company believes its allowance for doubtful accounts is sufficient to cover customer credit risk 
the table below provides information about the company s financial instruments that are sensitive to changes in interest rates 
the table presents principal cash flows and related weighted average interest rates by the expected maturity dates 
the actual cash flows for each instrument are denominated and presented in us dollar equivalents in millions  which is the company s reporting currency 
expected maturity date there after total fair value long term debt revolving credit facility variable rate average interest rate the fair value of the company s revolving credit facility is determined as the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the current interest rate for loans of similar terms and comparable credit risk 

table of contents in november  million in senior bank debt was converted from floating rate to fixed rate by locking in libor at for a five year period 
in addition  in march  mds entered into an interest rate swap arrangement to convert an additional million in senior bank debt from floating rate to a fixed rate by locking in libor at for the remaining term of the company s bank agreement october 
this swap effectively replaced a declining balance swap that expired in march under which libor was locked in at for a three year term 
as a consequence  currently million of the company s million in senior bank debt is at fixed rates 
both the november and march swap arrangements have been designated as cash flow hedges and have been evaluated to be highly effective 
as a result  the after tax change in the fair value of these swaps is recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income as a gain or loss on derivative financial instruments 
as of january   the fair value of these instruments was a pre tax loss of approximately million 
the company has no firmly committed sales transactions denominated in foreign currencies
