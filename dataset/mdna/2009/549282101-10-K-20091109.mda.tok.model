item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations management s discussion and analysis of the financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and footnotes for the fiscal years ended august   august   and august  included in item of this report 
overview in fiscal year  we generated revenues primarily by providing quality food to customers at our restaurants located throughout texas and three other states 
these establishments are located in close proximity to retail centers  business developments and residential areas 
in addition to our non franchised restaurant business model  we also provide culinary contract services for organizations that offer on site food service  such as health care facilities  college and universities  as well as businesses and institutions 
the protracted economic slowdown experienced in the united states in fiscal years and has adversely affected disposable consumer income and consumer confidence 
as a result of the declining economic conditions  we have experienced a reduction in our revenues and earnings  resulting primarily from lower customer traffic and to a lesser extent our menu prices 
we believe that this difficult economic environment will continue during fiscal year and expect that our revenues and results of operations will continue to be negatively affected as a result 
in response to rising commodity prices during the first half of fiscal year  we raised menu prices at our restaurants 
during the second half of the fiscal year  however  as the difficult economic environment continued  we lowered menu prices  implemented various discounts and promotions  reduced our capital expenditures and implemented cost control measures to help reduce the impact of declining guest traffic and frequency 
these cost control measures included the closure of four restaurants in fiscal year of the four locations closed  one was a month to month operating lease location that closed due to hurricane ike damages  two were underperforming out of state locations and one was closed after expiration of its lease 
in addition  on october  we announced a cash flow improvement and capital redeployment plan focused on improving cash flow from operations  which included closing underperforming stores 
fiscal review same store restaurant sales declined for fiscal year  compared to fiscal year the negative trend in consumer spending and dining frequency in fiscal year continued throughout fiscal year this traffic decline was partially offset by a higher per person average spend in fiscal year compared to fiscal year during the second half of fiscal we tested and rolled out value priced offerings at attractive menu price points to be more competitive in markets 
we feel these initiatives which included our half off luann on friday and saturday nights in february  monday thru friday luann rewind to  which represented off our then current luann menu price  and our luby s price rewind lowered average spending per customer below the prior year in the last several weeks of fiscal year we have received favorable guest comments from the actions taken in this challenging consumer confidence environment 
over the past quarters  we have experienced a same store sales decline on average of  this decline follows a period of twelve consecutive quarters when we averaged an increase in same store sales of per quarter 
fiscal year profitability was negatively impacted by lower restaurant sales as well as non cash charges related to asset impairments associated with underperforming restaurants the following provides a brief summary of selected expenses food costs  as a percentage of restaurant sales  were flat year over year  significant decreases in labor costs were realized through improved scheduling of our crew employees and lower restaurant management costs  partially offset by a higher average wage rate due to the 
table of contents required federal minimum wage increase  however  as a percentage of restaurant sales  payroll and related costs increased approximately basis points  operating expense dollars declined million as a result of lower utility costs and cost control efforts related to repairs and maintenance  supplies and services as well as partially due to closure of restaurants 
as a percentage of restaurant sales  operating expenses were up approximately basis points  depreciation expense increased significantly as a result of new and existing unit capital expenditures activity in fiscal years and general and administrative expenses as a percentage of total sales increased approximately basis points due primarily to lower sales partially offset by reductions in corporate staffing and other general and administrative expenses  asset impairment charges during the fiscal year totaled million resulting in an after tax reduction in fiscal year net income of approximately per share  and income taxes reflected a valuation allowance charge of million resulting in an after tax reduction in fiscal year net income of approximately per share 
our culinary contract services business continued to grow through the execution of four new location service agreements 
we view this area as a growth business which generally requires less capital investment and more favorable percentage returns on invested capital 
our culinary contract services business generated million in sales during fiscal year compared to million in sales during fiscal year  a increase 
culinary contract services improved its net income in fiscal year compared to fiscal year in fiscal year  we spent million on capital expenditures  which included million in restaurant upgrades such as dining room updates  new restaurant equipment  restroom remodels and the addition of new furniture as well as capital related culinary contract services and future restaurant sites 
we remain committed to our operational procedures  policies and initiatives designed to strengthen and to grow our business 
these programs are focused on customer service  menu innovation  food quality assurance  technological enhancements and staff training and development 
the long term consistent execution of these programs is designed to enhance overall customer satisfaction and increase profitability 
our long term plan continues to focus on expanding our brand and investing in our business 
however  in light of current global economic conditions  our near term focus is on managing capital allocations conservatively and maintaining a healthy balance sheet 
we have taken a prudent approach to our capital allocation in fiscal year for new unit development and store upgrades  and we now expect to reduce our capital expenditures significantly in the current fiscal year 
we do not plan to open new restaurants in fiscal year we believe our operational execution has improved through our commitment to higher operating standards  and we believe that will enhance shareholder value over the long term 
on october   we announced a cash flow improvement and capital redeployment plan the plan focused on improving cash flow from operations  which included closing underperforming stores in the first quarter of fiscal year in conjunction with these store closings  we incurred a non cash pre tax million impairment charge in the fourth quarter of fiscal year the closure of these locations will eliminate negative cash flow incurred from their operations and is estimated to generate approximately million to million in cash from the sale of the properties based on current estimates of individual property values 
see note  subsequent events  in our consolidated financial statements included in item of part ii of this report 

table of contents accounting periods our fiscal year ends on the last wednesday in august 
accordingly  each fiscal year normally consists of four week periods  or accounting periods  accounting for days in the aggregate 
each of the first three quarters of each fiscal year consists of three four week periods  while the fourth quarter normally consists of four four week periods 
fiscal years   and all contained weeks 
comparability between quarters may be affected by the varying lengths of the quarters  as well as the seasonality associated with the restaurant business 
same store sales the restaurant business is highly competitive with respect to food quality  concept  location  price  and service  all of which may have an effect on same store sales 
our same store sales calculation measures the relative performance of a certain group of restaurants 
to qualify for inclusion in this group  a store must have been in operation for consecutive accounting periods 
stores that close on a permanent basis are removed from the group in the fiscal quarter when operations cease at the restaurant  but remain in the same store group for previously reported fiscal quarters 
although management believes this approach leads to more effective year over year comparisons  neither the time frame nor the exact practice may be similar to those used by other restaurant companies 
same store sales decreased for fiscal year  decreased for fiscal year and decreased for fiscal year the following table shows the same store sales change for comparative historical quarters increase decrease fiscal year fiscal year fiscal year q q q q q q q q q q q q same store sales minimum wage increase impact the third of three federal minimum wage increases took effect on july  we expect to experience a compression due to these minimum wage increases  meaning that wages earned by employees within a certain range of the new minimum wage would be adjusted over time as the new minimum wage increases are phased in through calendar year discontinued operations our business plan  as approved in fiscal year and completed in fiscal year  called for the closure of more than locations 
in accordance with the plan  the entire fiscal activity of the applicable stores closed after the inception of the plan has been classified as discontinued operations 
results related to these same locations have also been classified as discontinued operations for all periods presented

the remaining tax benefit recorded for fiscal year is the net of the federal tax benefit and state tax expense based on our effective tax rate applied to the pre tax loss from continuing operations 
the provision for income taxes for fiscal year is the federal and state tax expense based on our effective tax rate for the year without the significant nonrecurring items described above for fiscal year because we had pre tax income in fiscal year and a pre tax loss in fiscal year  we had tax expense in fiscal year compared to a tax benefit in fiscal year discontinued operations the net loss from discontinued operations decreased by approximately  in fiscal year compared to fiscal year  principally due to lease settlement and asset impairment costs associated with discontinued operations in liquidity and capital resources cash and cash equivalents general 
our primary sources of short term and long term liquidity are cash flows from operations and our revolving credit facility 
the current macroeconomic conditions have adversely affected our cash flows from operations 
we have reduced our discretionary capital expenditures but plan to continue the level of capital and repair and maintenance expenditures necessary to keep our restaurants attractive and operating efficiently 
our cash requirements consist principally of capital expenditures for culinary contract services development and construction  restaurant renovations and upgrades and information technology  and working capital primarily for our owned restaurants and culinary contract service agreements 

table of contents the continued decline in our cash flow from operations in fiscal year required us to utilize our revolving credit facility  however  as of august   we had no outstanding balance under this facility 
proceeds from the sale of assets contributed capital for debt repayments 
under the current terms of our new credit facility  dated november   capital expenditures and the amount of borrowings are limited based on our ebitda  as defined in the credit agreement  as amended  governing the revolving credit facility 
based upon our level of past and projected capital requirements  we expect that proceeds from the sale of assets and cash flows from operations  combined with other financing alternatives in place or available  will be sufficient to meet our capital expenditures and working capital requirements during the next twelve months 
as is common in the restaurant industry  we maintain relatively low levels of accounts receivable and inventories  and our vendors grant trade credit for purchases such as food and supplies 
however  high levels of accounts receivable are typical for culinary contract services 
we also continually invest in our business through the addition of new units and refurbishment of existing units  which are reflected as long term assets 
cash and cash equivalents decreased to million from million at the beginning of the fiscal year 
this decrease is primarily due to a decrease in cash provided by operating activities 
we generally reinvest available cash flows from operations to develop new restaurants  enhance existing restaurants and to support culinary contract services 
the following table summarizes our cash flows from operating  investing and financing activities year ended august  august  august  in thousands total cash provided by used in operating activities investing activities financing activities increase decrease in cash and cash equivalents operating activities 
in fiscal year  operating cash flow decreased million to million compared to fiscal year  primarily due to a decline in restaurant sales and profitability 
investing activities 
cash flows used in investing activities were million in fiscal year compared to million in fiscal year  primarily due to decreased purchases of property and equipment and new restaurant construction in progress 
our capital expenditure program includes  among other things  investments in new restaurant and culinary contract service locations  restaurant remodeling  and information technology enhancements 
we used million for purchases of property and equipment in fiscal year compared to million in fiscal year financing activities 
cash provided by financing activities decreased million to zero compared to fiscal year  due to a reduced number of stock option exercises in fiscal year compared to fiscal year status of long term investments and liquidity at august   we held million  par value million  fair value  in auction rate municipal bond securities as long term investments 
these securities are long term bonds with underlying maturities in years through but have historically had short term features intended for the investor s liquidity 
prior to the collapse of the auction rate securities market in february  these bonds were purchased or sold through a dutch auction process in short term intervals of  or days  whereby the interest rate on the security was 
table of contents reset 
the prevailing market auction failures resulted in the long term investments classification and an other than temporary impairment loss of million and million in fiscal years and  respectively 
for additional information  see note  investments  to our consolidated financial statements included in item of part ii of this report 
given our current cash position  liquid cash equivalents  expected proceeds from the sale of assets  expected future cash flow from operations and our available borrowing capacity under our new credit facility  we believe the current and near term illiquidity of the auction rate municipal bonds will not adversely affect management s ability to achieve its operating goals 
status of trade accounts and other receivables  net we monitor our receivables aging and record provisions for uncollectability as appropriate 
credit terms of accounts receivable associated with our culinary contract services business vary from to days based on contract terms 
working capital we had a working capital deficit of million as of august   compared to a working capital deficit of million as of august   primarily due to a million decrease in cash 
we expect to meet our working capital requirements through cash flows from operations  proceeds from property sales and availability under our amended revolving credit facility 
capital expenditures capital expenditures consist of purchases of real estate for future restaurant sites  culinary contract services investments  new units construction  purchases of new and replacement restaurant furniture and equipment  and ongoing remodeling programs 
capital expenditures for fiscal year were approximately million and related to upgrades of existing units  to improvement of our culinary contract services business and to development of future restaurant sites 
we expect to be able to fund all capital expenditures in fiscal year using proceeds from the sale of assets  cash flows from operations and our available credit 
we expect to spend approximately million to million on capital expenditures in fiscal year stock purchases on february   in a privately negotiated block trade  we purchased  shares of common stock for million 
we neither purchased or sold stock in fiscal year debt amended and restated revolving credit facility the new credit facility on november   we entered into an amended and restated revolving credit facility which consisted primarily of the following changes reduced the aggregate amount of the lenders commitments from million to million 
the amounts available under the new credit facility may still be increased by up to million  subject to certain terms and conditions  for a maximum total facility size of million 
changed the maturity date to june  required security interest in selected real estate and other company assets increased interest rate margins from a range of to  subject to an interest rate floor of  to a range of to  subject to a interest rate floor 
the applicable spread continues to be dependent upon the ratio of our debt to ebitda at the most recent determination date  as defined in the credit agreement  as amended

related financial covenants revert back to the amended facility terms as of the first quarter of fiscal year management estimates approximately million to million in related fees and expenses to be incurred associated with the closing of the secured credit facility

we revised the level of spending allowed for capital expenditures by creating a floor of million 
the amount of agreed capital expenditures will be the greater of million in each fiscal year  or the amount of of the preceding fiscal year s ebitda  plus  in either case  all of the unused availability for capital expenditures from the immediately preceding fiscal year 
modified the interest rate margins to a range of to per annum 
the applicable spread under each option continues to be dependent upon the ratio of our debt to ebitda at the most recent determination date 
amended the quarterly commitment fee  which is dependent upon the ratio of our debt to ebitda  to a range of to per annum 
we also will continue to pay quarterly fees with respect to any letters of credit issued and outstanding 
in addition  we were obligated to pay the lenders a one time fee in connection with the closing of the amended facility 
in the original revolving credit facility  we were permitted to invest in any auction rate securities rated aaa by moody s or aaa by s p 
because the ratings of our auction rate securities have dropped below these thresholds  the amended facility now limits these types of investments to a specific list of auction rate securities which we hold 
modified certain financial covenants including the interest coverage ratio from not less than to not less than and the debt to ebitda ratio from not greater than to not greater than 
the amended facility also amends the interest coverage ratio calculation to now include one fifth of the principal balance of the loans in the denominator 
the amended facility contains customary covenants and restrictions on our ability to engage in certain activities  asset sales  letters of credit  and acquisitions  and contains customary events of default 
as of august   we were in compliance with all covenants

we also continue to pay quarterly fees with respect to any letters of credit issued and outstanding 
in addition  we were obligated to pay the lenders a one time fee in connection with the closing of the amended facility 
as of august   we had no loans outstanding and million committed under letters of credit  which were issued as security for the payment of insurance obligations classified as accrued expenses on the balance sheet

the final maturity date of the new credit facility is june  revolving credit facility on july   we entered into a million unsecured revolving credit facility the revolving credit facility with wells fargo bank  national association  as administrative agent  and amegy bank  national association  as syndication agent 
the revolving credit facility may  subject to certain terms and conditions  be increased once by an amount up to million for a maximum total facility size of million 
the revolving credit facility allowed for up to million of the available credit to be extended in the form of letters of credit 
all amounts owed by us under the revolving credit facility were guaranteed by our subsidiaries and must be repaid in full upon the maturity date on june  we amended the revolving credit facility on march   as described above under first amendment to revolving credit facility 
at any time throughout the term of the facility  we had the option to elect one of two bases of interest rates 
one interest rate option was the greater of a the federal funds effective rate plus  or b prime  plus  in either case  an applicable spread that ranges from zero to per annum 
the other interest rate option was the london interbank offered rate plus a spread that ranges from to per annum 
the applicable spread under each option was dependent upon the ratio of our debt to ebitda at the most recent determination date

commitments and contingencies off balance sheet arrangements we have no off balance sheet arrangements 
pending claims certain current and former hourly restaurant employees filed a lawsuit against us in the us district court for the southern district of texas alleging violations of the fair labor standards act with respect to the inclusion of certain employees in a tip pool 
the lawsuit seeks penalties and attorney s fees and was conditionally certified as a collective action in october we intend to vigorously defend our position 
it is not possible at this time to reasonably estimate the possible loss or range of loss  if any 
from time to time  we are subject to various other private lawsuits  administrative proceedings and claims that arise in the ordinary course of our business 
a number of these lawsuits  proceedings and claims may exist at any given time 
these matters typically involve claims from guests  employees and others related to issues common to the restaurant industry 
we currently believe that the final disposition of these types of lawsuits  proceedings and claims will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position  results of operations or liquidity 
it is possible  however  that our future results of operations for a particular quarter or fiscal year could be impacted by changes in circumstances relating to lawsuits  proceedings or claims 
construction activity from time to time  we enter into non cancelable contracts for the construction of our new restaurants 
this construction activity exposes us to the risks inherent in new construction including but not limited to rising material prices  labor shortages  delays in getting required permits and inspections  adverse weather conditions  and injuries sustained by workers

critical accounting policies and estimates our accounting policies are described in note  nature of operations and significant accounting policies  to our consolidated financial statements included in item of part ii of this report 
the consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles 
preparation of the financial statements requires us to make judgments  estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts of assets and liabilities in the financial statements and revenues and expenses during the reporting periods 
management believes the following are critical accounting policies due to the significant  subjective and complex judgments and estimates used when preparing our consolidated financial statements 
management regularly reviews these assumptions and estimates with the finance and audit committee of our board of directors 

table of contents income taxes income taxes are presented in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  as interpreted by financial accounting standards board fasb interpretation no 
sfas 
the estimated future tax effects of temporary differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and amounts reported in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets  as well as operating loss and tax credit carrybacks and carryforwards are recorded 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on differences between financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities temporary differences and are measured using the enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when the differences are expected to reverse 
we periodically review the recoverability of tax assets recorded on the balance sheet and provide valuation allowances as management deems necessary 
if the future consequences of differences between financial reporting bases and tax bases of our assets and liabilities result in a net deferred tax asset  management will evaluate the probability of our ability to realize the future benefits of such asset 
a valuation allowance related to a deferred tax asset is recorded when it is more likely than not that all or some portion of the deferred tax asset will not be realized 
the realization of such net deferred tax will generally depend on whether we will have sufficient taxable income of an appropriate character within the carryforward period permitted by the tax law 
we had deferred tax assets at august  of approximately million 
management has evaluated both positive and negative evidence  including its forecasts of our future taxable income adjusted by varying probability factors  in making a determination as to whether it is more likely than not that all or some portion of the deferred tax asset will be realized 
based on its analysis  management concluded that for fiscal year a valuation allowance of approximately million is necessary in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
the valuation allowance partially offsets our operating loss nol carryovers to future years and our carryover of general business tax credits 
two of the most significant items included in deferred tax assets are net operating loss carryovers and general business tax credits 
both of these items may be carried over up to twenty years in the future for possible utilization in the future 
the benefit of the nol carryover will expire at the end of fiscal year if not utilized by then 
the carryover of the general business credits began in fiscal year and will begin to expire at the end of fiscal year through the end of fiscal year if not utilized by then 
management makes judgments regarding the interpretation of tax laws that might be challenged upon an audit and cause changes to previous estimates of tax liability 
we operate within multiple taxing jurisdictions and are subject to audit in these jurisdictions as well as by the internal revenue service 
in management s opinion  adequate provisions for income taxes have been made for all open tax years 
the potential outcomes of examinations are regularly assessed in determining the adequacy of the provision for income taxes and income tax liabilities 
management believes that adequate provisions have been made for reasonable and foreseeable outcomes related to uncertain tax matters 
there are no audits or reviews with respect to our company currently underway in any jurisdiction for any fiscal years 
impairment of long lived assets we periodically evaluate long lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
we estimate future cash flows expected to result from the use and possible disposition of the asset and will recognize an impairment loss when the sum of the undiscounted estimated future cash flows is less than the carrying amounts of such assets 
the estimates of future cash flows  based on reasonable and supportable assumptions and projections  require management s subjective judgments 
the span of time for which future cash flows are estimated is often lengthy  which increases the sensitivity to assumptions made 
depending on the assumptions and estimates used  the estimated future cash flows projected in the evaluation of long lived assets can vary within a wide range of outcomes 
we consider the likelihood of possible outcomes in determining the best estimate of future cash flows 
the measurement for such an impairment loss is then based on the fair value of the asset as determined by discounted cash flows or appraisals  if available 

table of contents investments investments include available for sale securities  classified as long term and reported at fair value 
securities available for sale consist of auction rate securities 
declines in fair value of available for sale securities are analyzed to determine if the decline is temporary or other than temporary 
temporary unrealized gains and losses on available for sale securities are excluded from earnings and reported in shareholders equity 
other than temporary declines reduce earnings 
any increases in other than temporary declines in fair value will not be realized until the securities are sold 
property held for sale we periodically review long lived assets against our plans to retain or ultimately dispose of properties 
if we decide to dispose of a property  it will be moved to property held for sale and actively marketed 
property held for sale is recorded at amounts not in excess of what management currently expects to receive upon sale  less costs of disposal 
we routinely monitor the estimated value of property held for sale and record adjustments to these values as required 
insurance and claims we self insure a significant portion of risks and associated liabilities under our employee injury  workers compensation and general liability programs 
we maintain insurance coverage with third party carriers to limit our per occurrence claim exposure 
we have recorded accrued liabilities for self insurance based upon analysis of historical data and actuarial estimates  and we review these amounts on a quarterly basis to ensure that the liability is appropriate 
the significant assumptions made by the actuary to estimate self insurance reserves  including incurred but not reported claims  are as follows historical patterns of loss development will continue in the future as they have in the past loss development method  historical trend patterns and loss cost levels will continue in the future as they have in the past bornhuetter ferguson method  and historical claim counts and exposures are used to calculate historical frequency rates and average claim costs are analyzed to get a projected severity frequency and severity method 
the results of these methods are blended by the actuary to provide the reserves estimates 
actual workers compensation and employee injury claims expense may differ from estimated loss provisions 
the ultimate level of claims under the in house safety program are not known  and declines in incidence of claims as well as claims costs experiences or reductions in reserve requirements under the program may not continue in future periods 
share based compensation we adopted the provisions of sfas no 
 share based payments revised sfas r  effective september  among other things  sfas r eliminates the ability to account for stock based compensation using apb and requires that such transactions be recognized as compensation cost in the income statement utilizing the fair values on the date of the grant

inflation it is generally our policy is to maintain stable menu prices without regard to seasonal variations in food costs 
certain increases in costs of food  wages  supplies  transportation and services may require us to increase our menu prices from time to time 
to the extent prevailing market conditions allow  we intend to adjust menu prices to maintain profit margins 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates affecting our variable rate debt 
as of august   the total amount of debt subject to interest rate fluctuations outstanding under our amended revolving credit facility was zero 
although we are not currently using interest rate swaps  we have previously used and may in the future use these instruments to manage cash flow risk on a portion of our variable rate debt 
many ingredients in the products sold in our restaurants are commodities  subject to unpredictable price fluctuations 
we attempt to minimize price volatility by negotiating fixed price contracts for the supply of key ingredients and in some cases by passing increased commodity costs through to the customer by adjusting menu prices or menu offerings 
our ingredients are available from multiple suppliers so we are not dependant on a single vendor for our ingredients
