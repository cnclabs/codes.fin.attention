overview vitran corporation inc vitran or the company is a leading  predominantly non union  provider of freight surface transportation and related logistics services throughout canada and in states in the eastern  central  southwestern and western united states 
its business consists of three operating segments less than truckload services ltl  logistics services  and truckload services 
these services are provided by stand alone business units within their respective regions 
depending on a customer s needs  the units can operate independently or in a complementary manner 
as is more fully described in item business  the ltl segment transports shipments in less than full trailer load quantities through freight service center networks  the logistics segment provides supply chain solutions and freight brokerage services and the truckload segment delivers full trailer loads point to point on a predominantly short haul basis 
vitran s operating results are generally expected to depend on the number and weight of shipments transported  the prices received for the services provided  and the mix of services supplied to clients 
vitran must manage its fixed and variable operating cost infrastructure in the face of fluctuating volumes to realize appropriate margins while maintaining the quality service expected by its customers 
the long term mission of the company is to build a north american transportation infrastructure with national and regional coverage in both canada and the united states offering regional  inter regional  national  and transborder ltl services 
in conjunction with the ltl services  vitran will also focus on logistics service offerings that not only are profitable as stand alone business opportunities  but also increase the utilization of ltl freight service assets where appropriate 
executive summary the year ended december  was a very difficult year for vitran and the entire freight transportation industry in north america 
the economic slowdown in north america persisted throughout the year and got dramatically worse in the fourth quarter as the global credit crisis and economic recession took hold 
price competition in the ltl segment intensified while retail activity levels slowed down impacting the results for the logistics segment and the company finished with earnings before goodwill impairment charges of per diluted share 
in the face of this demanding economic environment  vitran achieved some very significant milestones throughout january the us ltl business unit purchased facilities in kansas city and las vegas  may the us ltl business unit launched a new nationwide information technology operating system  june the logistics segment opened a dedicated  sq 
ft 
facility  the largest in its history  june the canadian ltl business unit relocated its national office to a newly constructed door cross dock facility  august the us ltl business unit successfully integrated the wage and benefit structure for its employees  october the us ltl business unit completed the redundant terminal integration in ohio  michigan  indiana  kentucky  illinois and pennsylvania  and december the company for year ended december  reduced debt by million 
in addition  las vegas la express inc lvla  acquired in november   performed at expected levels for and contributed to a record year for the logistics segment that posted revenue of and income from operations of million 
although  vitran completes its annual assessment of goodwill impairment at september   the company was required to re assess its goodwill for impairment at december  at that moment in time  the company s market capitalization was significantly lower than the carrying value of its net assets thereby indicating impairment of goodwill 
consequently  vitran recorded a pre tax non cash impairment charge of million at december  the assessment of the company s goodwill for impairment is discussed further under critical accounting policies and estimates 
results of operations compared to consolidated results the following table summarizes the consolidated statements of income for the three years ended december in thousands of dollars vs vs revenue operating expenses sg a expenses other expenses income impairment of goodwill depreciation and amortization income loss from operations interest expense  net net income loss vs vs earnings loss per share basic diluted operating ratio revenue increased to million in from million in revenue in the ltl  truckload and most significantly in the logistics segments increased  and respectively 
revenue in the ltl segment was impacted by a increase in fuel surcharge revenue compared to  while the acquisition of lvla on november  contributed to the increase in revenue in the logistics segment 
loss from operations was million in compared to income from operations of million in excluding the goodwill impairment charge  income from operations declined to million in compared to million in an increase in income from operations of in the logistics segment was offset by declines in income from operations at the ltl segment excluding goodwill impairment charge and truckload segment of and  respectively 
the company s consolidated operating ratio increased to in compared to in detailed explanations for the fluctuations in revenue and income from operations are discussed below in segmented results 
selling  general and administrative expenses sg a increased to million in from million in the increase in sg a expenses for the year can primarily be attributed to the acquisition of lvla on november   not included in the annual sg a for the first eleven months of that year  accounting for million of the increase and offset by reductions in variable compensation expense and share based compensation expense of million at the corporate segment 
depreciation and amortization expense for increased slightly compared to including the acquisition of lvla on november  lvla  an asset light business  contributed only an additional million in depreciation and amortization expense for the year 
this was partially offset by depreciation expense attributable to rolling stock purchases that declined by million compared to interest expense  net of interest income  was million for compared to million for the increase can be attributed to million of financing costs that were written off in the fourth quarter of for a substantial bank amendment completed december  the amendment was completed with the company s syndicated lenders and introduced a new pricing grid that starts december   increasing the company s spreads bps on the million of revolving debt and million of term debt 
income tax recovery for was million compared to an expense of million for the tax recovery in compares to an effective tax rate of for the tax recovery can be attributed to a decline in earnings before tax  recognition of a deferred tax asset related to the impairment of goodwill and a decline in the effective tax rate 
the decrease in the effective rate can be attributed to an increase in a higher proportion of income being earned in lower foreign tax jurisdictions  as well as a decline in future tax rates in canada 
on a consolidated basis  the company generated taxable losses in the united states  which have been recognized as future tax assets 
these taxable losses are the result of tax depreciation and amortization on capital assets and goodwill in excess of gaap depreciation and amortization attributable to the company s acquired businesses over the last three years 
management believes the company will generate sufficient taxable income to use these losses in the future 
should the company s earnings before income tax increase in subsequent quarters  the effective tax rate should also increase 
net loss on a gaap basis was million for compared to net income of million in this resulted in gaap basic and diluted loss per share of for the current year compared to earnings per share of and  respectively in excluding the goodwill impairment charge and one time write off of previously deferred financing costs  basic and diluted earnings per share would have been for the current year compared to and in on january   the company adopted sfas statement  which provides a framework for measuring fair value under gaap 
as defined in sfas statement  fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date exit price 
the company utilizes market data or assumptions that the company believes market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability  including assumptions about risk and the risks inherent in the inputs to the valuation technique 
these inputs can be readily observable  market corroborated or generally unobservable 
on january   the company will adopt sfas statement revised  business combinations  for any business acquisitions after january   as required by the statement 
sfas statement r established principles and requirements for how the acquirer i recognizes and measures in its financial statements the identifiable assets acquired  the liabilities assumed and any non controlling interest in the acquiree  ii recognizes and measures the goodwill acquired in the business combination or a gain from a bargain purchase  and iii determines what information to disclose to enable users of the financial statements to evaluate the nature and financial effects of the business combination 
on january   the company adopted the provisions of fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes  with no cumulative effect adjustment recorded at adoption 
the adoption of this standard requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts of tax related assets and liabilities that will impact the effective tax rate of the company 
in addition  the effective tax rate in all periods is the result of the mix of income earned in various tax jurisdictions that apply a broad range of income tax rates 
the income tax expense differs from the tax computed at the federal statutory income tax rate due primarily to state and provincial income taxes and earnings in foreign jurisdictions 
future effective tax rates could be adversely affected if earnings are lower than anticipated in jurisdictions with lower statutory rates  unfavourable changes in tax laws and regulations  or by adverse tax rulings 
segmented results ltl less than truckload the table below provides summary information for the ltl segment for the three years ended december in thousands of dollars vs vs revenue income from operations impairment of goodwill operating ratio number of shipments weight s of lbs revenue per shipment revenue per hundredweight revenue in the ltl segment increased by to million in compared to million in the growth in revenue was driven by an increase in fuel surcharge revenue of million  as the average price of fuel for exceeded offsetting the increase in fuel surcharge revenue was the decline in shipments  tonnage and revenue per hundredweight excluding fuel surcharge of   and  respectively 
although tonnage and revenue per hundredweight excluding fuel surcharge expanded through the first nine months of  in the fourth quarter as the global recession  credit crisis and reduction in operating days impacted shippers  competitive pressures had a negative impact on the annual operating statistics 
the cross border service offering for the year grew but could not abate the overall impact of the economy 
ltl segment activity level measurement  shipments per day  declined monthly from july to october for the first time in the company s history depicting the deteriorating economic environment in north america 
more importantly  for the year  the ltl segment completed a number of important operating initiatives 
in the second quarter  the us ltl business unit completed its new it operating system  the first step in its integration plan  which had led to a slight increase in us inter regional sales activity 
in the third quarter  the second step  the integrated wage and benefit structure  was successfully completed in august  which would result in an annual increase in compensation cost of million 
the third step in the integration plan  the physical integration of service centers  commenced in late august and was completed in october the elimination of the redundant service centers will lead to a reduction of linehaul  pick up and delivery and service centers expenses of approximately million annually and allow the us ltl business unit to start an inter regional sales initiative 
these milestones  although achieved successfully  delayed management s ability to reduce costs while revenue and the economic environment worsened 
in addition to the aforementioned expense savings completed at the end of october  the company further reduced its labour force late in the fourth quarter resulting in additional annual savings of approximately million 
as a result  the ltl segment operating ratio was for compared to in logistics the table below provides summary information for the logistics segment for the three years ended december in thousands of dollars vs vs revenue income from operations operating ratio revenue for the logistics segment increased by to million compared to million in shipments within the brokerage business unit declined by in compared to however  within the supply chain business unit  the addition of lvla acquired november  contributed a full year of revenue in  accounting for million of the segment s increase compared to furthermore  in june of the supply chain business unit commenced a new  square foot dedicated distribution facility that further increased revenue and income from operations for the year 
these two significant additions within the supply chain business unit offset retail industry weakness in and contributed to the record revenue and income from operations of million and million 
as at december   the logistics segment had million square feet under management compared to million square feet under management at december  it is the company s expectation to increase the square footage under management by approximately in truckload the table below provides summary information for the truckload segment for the three years ended december in thousands of dollars vs vs revenue income from operations operating ratio revenue for the truckload segment increased by to million in from million in the revenue increase was attributable to shipments increasing  partially offset by a decline in revenue per shipment of

therefore  the operating ratio was in compared to in results of operations compared to consolidated results revenue increased to million in from million in revenue in the ltl and logistics segments increased and respectively and remained flat in the truckload segment 
the revenue increase in the ltl segment was impacted by the acquisition of pjax on october  income from operations declined to million in from million in an increase in income from operations of in the logistics segment was offset by declines in income from operations in the ltl segment and truckload segment of and  respectively 
the company s consolidated operating ratio increased to in from in detailed explanations for the fluctuations in revenue and income from operations are discussed below in segmented results 
selling  general and administrative expenses sg a increased to million in from million in the increase in sg a expenses for year can be primarily attributed to the acquisition of pjax freight system pjax oct   not included in the annual sg a for the first nine months of that year  as well as the inclusion of las vegas la express inc lvla for one month in december  accounting for million of the variance 
contributing to the remainder of the increase was a million increase in share based compensation expense and average annual wage increases of to across all segments of the company 
with the addition of lvla on november  and the increase in ongoing compensation related expenses  sg a is higher in as compared to depreciation and amortization expense increased to million in compared to million in the increase is primarily attributed to the addition of pjax on october  but also to the increase in capital expenditures over the previous two years 
interest expense net of interest income was million for compared to million for this increase can be attributed to the draw downs on vitran s credit facilities to fund the acquisition of pjax on october  also on july   vitran substantially changed its syndicated credit facilities resulting in a one time write off of million of deferred financing costs attributable to its former syndication agreement 
if not for this write off  interest expense for the year would have been approximately million 
income tax expense for was million compared to million in the effective tax rate was for compared to in the decline in income tax expense is due to a decline in earnings before tax and a decline in the effective tax rate 
the decrease in the effective tax rate can be attributed to a higher proportion of income being earned in lower tax jurisdictions as well as a decline in future tax rates in canada

 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes  with no cumulative effect adjustment recorded at adoption 
the adoption of this standard requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts of tax related assets and liabilities that will impact the effective tax rate of the company

segmented results ltl less than truckload revenue in the ltl segment increased to million in compared to million in this significant growth in revenue was driven primarily by the acquisition of pjax on october  but was also augmented by a increase in the cross border service offering 
the new inter regional service launched in represented in excess of of total ltl revenue 
the canadian business unit posted historical revenue growth rates for despite being impacted by a slowdown in the canadian economy in the fourth quarter of the year 
the us ltl business unit struggled with a sluggish us domestic economy throughout that resulted in a deterioration of regional ltl revenues within all us regions 
the impact of the economic slowdown was most severe in the final month of the year 
the ltl segment  which included a full year of pjax results in  increased shipments  tonnage and revenue per hundredweight compared to by  and  respectively 
however  income from operations decreased to million in compared to million in the aforementioned economic environment resulted in competitive pricing pressure that negatively impacted the operating margin of the segment 
income from operations was significantly impacted in the fourth quarter  particularly the month of december  as income from operations declined million or compared to the same quarter in the ltl segment operating ratio was for compared to in logistics revenue for the logistics segment increased by to million compared to million in shipments within the brokerage business unit declined in compared to however  the supply chain business unit grew revenue and income from operations acquiring new transactional and expanded dedicated contracts in prior to the acquisition of lvla  square footage under management at the supply chain unit was  square feet at december  compared to  square feet at december  furthermore  the additional  square feet under management provided by the addition of lvla for the month of december bolstered revenue and income from operations in the supply chain business unit 
these factors resulted in an increase in income from operations of to million and an operating ratio of in compared to in truckload revenue for the truckload segment increased to million in from million in revenue per mile was flat and shipments increased compared to this was offset by an increase in empty miles of  resulting in a decline in income from operations of to million compared to the operating ratio was in compared to in notes a shipment is a single movement of goods from a point of origin to its final destination as described on a bill of lading document 
weight represents the total pounds shipped by each ltl business unit 
revenue per shipment represents revenue divided by the number of shipments 
revenue per hundredweight is the price obtained for transporting pounds of ltl freight from point to point  calculated by dividing the revenue for an ltl shipment by the hundredweight weight in pounds divided by for a shipment

the transportation industry is highly competitive on the basis of both price and service 
the company competes with regional  inter regional and national ltl carriers  truckload carriers  third party logistics companies and  to a lesser extent  small package carriers  air freight carriers and railroads 
the company competes effectively in its markets by providing high quality and timely service at competitive prices 
the company s business is sensitive to general economic conditions and seasonal fluctuations  although these factors are mitigated somewhat by the variable nature of many of the company s costs 
recessionary economic cycles and downturns in customer business cycles  as well as downturns in the principal regional economies where the company s operations are located  may affect results of operations 
as a result of the economic turmoil and its effects on our market capitalization  vitran had to reduce the carrying value of goodwill and recorded a pre tax non cash impairment charge of million against the goodwill carrying value in december in the trucking industry for a typical year  the second and third quarters usually have the highest business levels  while the first and fourth quarters generally have the lowest business levels 
the fourth quarter holiday season and adverse weather conditions generally experienced in the first quarter of the year  such as heavy snow and ice storms  have a negative impact on operating results 
accordingly  revenue and profitability are generally lowest in the first and fourth quarters 
vitran is dependent on a major railroad for its national ltl service in canada 
any reduction in service by the railroad is likely to increase costs for the company and reduce the reliability  timeliness and overall attractiveness of rail based services 
the company s exposure to credit risk is not significant as it is not dependent on any particular industry or customer 
the company s single largest customer accounted for of revenue in the general manufacturing industry at approximately of total ltl revenue in represents the most significant industry serviced by the company 
labor represents vitran s most significant cost and key to service quality 
the company has a history of positive labor relations that will continue to be important to future success 
the two unionized terminals in canada  representing of the company s labor force  are represented by the international brotherhood of teamsters and the canadian auto workers association 
the collective bargaining agreements between the company and its unionized employees expire on february   and on march   respectively 
the company is dependent on its ability to hire and retain qualified drivers including owner operators 
depending on the driver market  vitran may adjust its compensation packages or operate with fewer drivers  all of which could impact profitability 
furthermore  the company is dependent on certain key management personnel for the successful operation of the business 
loss of key personnel could harm vitran s operations and financial condition 
while diesel fuel expenses represent an important cost component to vitran  the extensive use of owner operators and the ability to share significant fuel increases with customers in the form of a fuel surcharge reduce this risk 
the company is subject to numerous laws and regulations by the dot  environmental protection agency epa  internal revenue service  canada customs regulation agency and various other federal  state  provincial and municipal authorities 
new or more comprehensive laws and regulations including but not limited to fuel emission  driver hours of service  taxation or other mandated regulation could impact profitability 
measures taken by the us and canadian governments to strengthen border security regulations could impact service levels 
vitran s cross border activity represented approximately of the ltl segment revenue in and the company has responded to the new requirements to ensure compliance and safety without jeopardizing the quality of service 
in order to mitigate the exposure to interest rate risk in and for future periods  the company entered into floating to fixed interest rate swap contracts with various expiry dates extending to december  at december   of the company s syndicated credit facility was subject to fixed interest rate derivatives 
of vitran s total debt  is subject to fixed interest rates 
management continues to evaluate the company s need to fix interest rate exposure or unwind current interest rate swap contracts on an ongoing basis 
the company has exposure to foreign currency risk as fluctuations in the us dollar against the canadian dollar can impact the financial results of the company 
management has designated the company s million of us dollar denominated long term debt in canada as a hedge to the foreign currency exposure generated by the company s us operations 
the company s canadian operations realize foreign exchange gains and losses on the us dollar revenue generated against expenses denominated in canadian dollars 
furthermore  the company reports its results in us dollars thereby exposing the results of the company s canadian operations to foreign currency fluctuations 
the company is subject to financial maintenance tests under its term and revolving credit facilities 
these tests require maintenance of certain maximum leverage and minimum interest coverage ratios  among other restrictions  that could limit the availability of capital to fund future growth 
vitran corporation inc is a holding company 
the company s ability to meet its financial obligations is dependant primarily upon the receipt of interest and principal payments on intercompany advances  management fee payments  cash dividends and other payments from the company s subsidiaries together with the proceeds raised through the issuance of debt 
the company operates a highly capital intensive business 
vitran depends on operating leases  lines of credit  secured equipment financing and cash flow from operations to finance the purchase of tractors  trailing fleet  information technology hardware and terminals 
the company invests in new operating equipment and is dependent on the availability of rolling stock 
vitran s investment in rolling stock is a significant part of the annual capital expenditure expense and the supply and price of such equipment may be adversely impacted by new regulations on engines 
vitran is also dependent on the availability and price of terminal facilities 
the company is exposed to insurance and claims expenses 
vitran is exposed to claims resulting from cargo loss  auto liability and workers compensation 
an increase in the number and severity of future claims could have an impact on profitability 
the company has integrated the information technology and operations of its acquired companies and will integrate future acquisitions within its us ltl business unit 
integration initiatives may not realize the anticipated benefits due to operational issues  disruptions and distractions for employees and management  and potential failures in due diligence 
liquidity and capital resources cash flow from operations for the year decreased to million in compared to million in the decline is attributable to a decrease in profitability  as described in the consolidated and segmented results section of the md a  partially offset by the increase in non cash working capital compared to the increase in working capital was the result of a reduction in accounts receivable and a decrease in accounts payable 
the change in accounts receivable  the critical influencer for working capital changes at a transportation company  decreased december  compared to december  due to an approximate decline in the fourth quarter revenue compared to the same period in although revenue declined  the company experienced an increase in average days sales outstanding to days compared to days at december  the escalation in days sales outstanding can be attributed to customers slowing their payment cycle in the tough economic environment 
to match  the company slowed their payments cycle over the last two weeks of the fourth quarter thereby increasing its accounts payable and accrued liabilities 
albeit the company s dso has risen in  we believe this to be a temporary anomaly associated with the lackluster economy 
it is management s intention to return dso to its historical levels of approximately days over the next twelve months if the economic environment returns to normal 
we do not believe there will be a material impact to the financial position or liquidity of the company 
on december   the company substantially amended the terms and conditions of its existing seven bank syndicated credit facilities 
pursuant to this amendment  the company increased its interest rate spreads on currently drawn debt from bps to bps  provided perfected security on certain assets and significantly increased its leverage ratio covenants for the balance of consequently  the company wrote off million of previously capitalized syndication fees and paid an additional million in fees to complete the new amendment 
within the syndicated credit facilities at december   interest bearing debt was million consisting of million of term debt and million drawn under the revolving credit facility 
in addition  the company had million of additional term debt and million of capital leases for a total of million of interest bearing debt outstanding at december  at december   interest bearing debt was million consisting of million of term debt  capital leases of million  million drawn under the revolving credit facility and a note payable of million 
during the year  the company repaid million of term debt and million of capital leases and borrowed million on the revolving credit facility  as well as million of new capital leases 
at december   the company had million of unused credit facilities  net of outstanding letters of credit 
the company generated million in proceeds and a gain on sale of million on the divestiture of surplus facilities in coffeyville  kansas  cedar rapids  iowa and miscellaneous equipment throughout the year 
capital expenditures amounted to million for and were primarily funded out of operating cash flows  new capital leases and the revolving credit facility 
the majority of capital expenditures in were for replacement rolling stock and real estate related expenditures 
the company purchased facilities in kansas city  kansas  las vegas  nevada and completed the construction of its new ltl service center in toronto  ontario 
the table below sets forth the company s capital expenditures for the years ended december   and in thousands of dollars year ended december  real estate and buildings tractors trailing fleet information technology leasehold improvements other equipment total management estimates that cash capital expenditures for the fiscal year will be between million and million 
the company may potentially enter into operating leases to fund the acquisition of specific equipment should the business levels exceed the current equipment capacity of the company 
the company expects to finance its capital requirements with cash flow from operations  new capital or operating leases and  if required  its million of unused credit facilities 
the company has contractual obligations that include long term debt consisting of term debt facilities  revolving credit facilities  capital leases for operating equipment and off balance sheet operating leases primarily consisting of tractor  trailing fleet and real estate leases 
operating leases form an integral part of the company s financial structure and operating methodology as they provide an alternative cost effective and flexible form of financing 
the following table summarizes our significant contractual obligations and commercial commitments as of december  in thousands of dollars payments due by period contractual obligations total thereafter term credit facilities nil revolving credit facilities nil nil nil capital lease obligations nil estimated interest payments nil sub total nil off balance sheet commitments operating leases total contractual obligations the company has estimated its interest obligation on its fixed and variable rate obligations 
for fixed rate debt where variable to fixed interest rate swaps are in place  the fixed interest rate was used to determine the interest obligation until the interest rate swaps mature 
for other fixed rate debt  the fixed rate was used to determine the interest rate obligation 
for variable rate debt the variable rate in place at december  was used to determine the total interest obligation 
in addition to the above noted contractual obligations  as at december   the company utilized the revolving credit facility for standby letters of credit of million 
the letters of credit are used as collateral for self insured retention of insurance claims 
a significant decrease in demand for our services could limit the company s ability to generate cash flow and affect its profitability 
the company s credit agreement contains certain financial maintenance tests that require the company to achieve stated levels of financial performance  which  if not achieved  could cause an acceleration of the payment schedules 
management does not anticipate a significant decline in business levels or financial performance and expects that existing working capital  together with available revolving facilities  will be sufficient to fund operating and capital requirements in as well as service the contractual obligations 
outlook the fiscal year  strategically  was a very rewarding year  albeit  financially  a challenging year for vitran 
the logistics segment added significant contracts expanding its square footage under management from million to million 
the us ltl unit completed its operational integration in the fourth quarter of the year as the north american economy and transportation pricing environment further deteriorated 
in  vitran s ltl segment will be dedicated to expanding its revenue by leveraging its client base across new expanded operating footprint 
the ltl segment will leverage the new u 
s it system and integrated operating infrastructure to deliver improved service to its existing and new customers 
ltl management intends to continue its focus on the ltl transborder business with a view to maintaining an above average year over year revenue growth 
the logistics segment will continue to concentrate on gaining new profitable business that also utilizes the services of the company s ltl infrastructure 
preparations for the new distribution center  commencing the first quarter of  are underway and will expand revenue and income from operations for the year 
truckload segment management will focus on expanding and diversifying its customer base  margin expansion and asset utilization 
on a consolidated basis  the company is now in position to reap the benefits of an improvement in the economic environment should it materialize  however  should the environment worsen  management will continually adjust its strategy and tactics for the betterment of the company  the employees and most importantly  the shareholders 
critical accounting policies and estimates revenue recognition the company s ltl and truckload business units and freight brokerage operations recognize revenue upon the delivery of the related freight and direct shipment costs as incurred 
revenue for the logistics operations is recognized as the management services are provided 
critical revenue related policies and estimates for the company s ltl business unit relate to revenue adjustments and allowance for doubtful accounts 
critical revenue related policies and estimates for the company s logistics and truckload segment include allowance for doubtful accounts 
at december   the allowance for doubtful accounts was million or approximately of total trade receivables 
the company believes that its revenue recognition policies are appropriate and that its revenue related estimates and judgments provide a reasonable approximation of actual revenue earned 
estimated revenue adjustments generally  the pricing assessed by companies in the ltl business is subject to subsequent adjustments due to several factors  including weight and freight classification verifications  shipper bill of lading errors  pricing discounts and other miscellaneous revenue adjustments 
revenue adjustments are evaluated and updated based on revenue levels  current trends and historical experience 
these revenue adjustments are recorded as a reduction in revenue from operations and accrued for in the allowance for doubtful accounts 
allowance for doubtful accounts the company records an allowance for doubtful accounts related to accounts receivable that may potentially be impaired 
the company s allowance is estimated by a percentage of its aged receivables reflecting the current business environment  customer and industry concentrations  and historical experience and an additional allowance for specifically identified accounts that are significantly impaired  but payment may be likely 
a change to these factors could impact the estimated allowance 
the provision for bad debts is recorded in selling  general and administrative expenses 
claims and insurance accruals claims and insurance accruals reflect the estimated ultimate total cost of claims  including amounts for claims incurred but not reported and future claims development  for cargo loss and damage  bodily injury and property damage  workers compensation  long term disability and group health 
in establishing these accrued expenses  management evaluates and monitors each claim individually and claim frequency 
factors such as historical experience  known trends and third party estimates help determine the appropriate reserves for the estimated liability 
changes in severity of previously reported claims  significant changes in the medical costs and legislative changes affecting the administration of the plans could significantly impact the determination of appropriate reserves in future periods 
in canada  the company has a  deductible and in the united states  self insurance retention sir per incident for auto liability  casualty and cargo claims 
in the united states  the company has a  sir per incident for workers compensation and  sir per incident for employee medical 
in addition to estimates within the self insured retention  management makes judgments concerning the coverage limits 
if any claim was to exceed the coverage limits  the company would have to accrue for the excess amount 
the estimate would include evaluation whether a claim may exceed such limits and  if so  by how much 
a claim or group of claims of this nature could have a material adverse effect on the company s results from operations 
currently management is not aware of any claims exceeding the coverage limit 
goodwill and intangible assets the company performs its goodwill impairment test annually and more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that an impairment loss may have occurred 
impairment is tested at the reporting unit level by comparing the reporting unit s carrying amount to its implied fair value 
the methodology used to measure fair value is a discounted cash flow method which is an income approach and a market approach which estimates fair value using market multiples of appropriate financial measures compared to a set of comparable public companies in the transportation and logistics industry 
the fair value methods require certain assumptions for growth in earnings before interest  taxes and depreciation  future tax rates  capital re investment  fair value of the assets and liabilities  and discount rate 
actual impairment of goodwill could differ from these assumptions based on market conditions and other factors 
in the event goodwill is determined to be impaired  a charge to earnings would be required 
as at september   vitran completed its annual goodwill impairment test and concluded that there was no impairment 
one of the indicators of impairment is a sustained decline in the company s share price whereby the market capitalization of the company is less than its book value for an extended period of time 
at december   before recording goodwill impairment charges  the carrying value of vitran s net assets were million compared to the market capitalization of all of the company s outstanding shares which was million 
the market valuation of the company declined during the fourth quarter as vitran s share price on the nasdaq stock market decreased from at september  to at december  these factors and the depressed macroeconomic environment indicated a triggering event had occurred requiring the company  at a reporting unit level  to test for the impairment of goodwill at december  using the income and market approach for estimating the fair value of each reporting unit  management concluded that the goodwill in its ltl segment was impaired and there was no impairment of goodwill in its other reporting units 
therefore  vitran recorded a pre tax non cash goodwill impairment charge of million at december  property and equipment property and equipment are recorded at cost and depreciated on a straight line basis over their estimated useful lives 
management establishes appropriate useful lives for all property and equipment based upon  among other considerations  historical experience  change in equipment manufacturing specifications  the used equipment market and prevailing industry practice 
management continually monitors events and changes in circumstances that could indicate that the carrying amounts of property and equipment may not be recoverable 
when indicators of potential impairment are present  the recoverability of the assets would be assessed from the estimated undiscounted future operating cash flows expected from the use of the assets 
actual recoverability of assets could differ based on different assumptions  estimates or other factors 
in the event that recoverability was impaired  the fair value of the asset would be recorded and an impairment loss would be recognized 
management believes its estimates of useful lives and salvage values have been reasonable as demonstrated by the insignificant amounts of gains and losses on revenue equipment dispositions 
share based compensation under the company s stock option plan  options to purchase common shares of the company may be granted to key employees  officers and directors of the company and its affiliates by the board of directors or by the company s compensation committee 
the company accounts for stock options in accordance with sfas statement r with compensation expense amortized over the vesting period based on the black scholes merton fair value on the grant date 
the assumptions used to value stock options are dividend yield  expected volatility  risk free interest rate  expected life and anticipated forfeiture 
the company does not pay any dividends on its common shares  therefore the dividend yield is zero 
we use the historical method to calculate volatility with the historical period being equal to the expected life of each option 
this calculation is then used to approximate the potential for the share price to increase over the expected life of the option 
the risk free interest rate is based on the government of canada issued bond rate in effect at the time of the grant 
expected life represents the length of time the option is estimated to be outstanding before being exercised or forfeited 
historical information is used to determine the forfeiture rate 
income taxes the company uses the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes 
under the asset and liability method  deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the deferred tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
significant judgment is required in determining whether deferred tax assets will be realized in full or in part 
if it were ever estimated that it is more likely than not that all or some portion of specific deferred tax assets will not be realized  a valuation allowance must be established for the amount of deferred tax assets that is estimated not to be realized 
a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets has not been deemed necessary at december  accordingly  if the facts or financial results were to change  thereby impacting the likelihood of realizing the deferred tax assets  judgment would have to be applied to estimate the amount of valuation allowance required in any given period 
the company adopted fin  accounting for uncertainty in income taxes  on january  with no cumulative effect adjustment recorded at adoption 
fin requires that uncertain tax positions are evaluated in a two step process  whereby the company determines whether it is more likely than not that the tax positions will be sustained based on the technical merits of the position and for those tax positions that meet the more likely than not recognition threshold  the company would recognize the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than fifty percent likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement with the related tax authority 
management judgment is also required regarding a variety of other factors  including the appropriateness of tax strategies  expected future tax consequences  and to the extent tax strategies are challenged by taxing authorities 
we utilize certain income tax planning strategies to reduce our overall cost of income taxes 
it is possible that certain strategies might be disallowed  resulting in an increased liability for income taxes 
significant management judgments are involved in assessing the likelihood of sustaining the strategies and an ultimate result worse than our expectations could adversely affect our results of operations 
in  the company completed audits with the internal revenue service and canada customs and revenue agency without material consequences

item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate sensitivity the company is exposed to the impact of interest rate changes 
the company s exposure to changes in interest rates is limited to borrowings under the term bank facilities and revolving credit facilities that have variable interest rates tied to the libor rate 
as a majority of the company s debt is tied to variable interest rates  we estimate that the fair value of the long term debt approximates the carrying value 
in thousands of dollars payments due by period long term debt total thereafter variable rate term bank facility nil average interest rate libor term bank facility nil nil average interest rate libor revolving bank facility nil nil nil average interest rate libor fixed rate capital lease obligations nil average interest rate total nil the company uses variable to fixed interest rate swaps on its term and revolving credit facilities with a notional amount of million at december  the average pay rate on the swaps is and the average receive rate is the three month libor rate  which is currently 
to value the interest rate swaps  a discounted cash flow model is utilized 
primary inputs into the model that will cause the fair value to fluctuate period to period include the fixed interest rates  the future interest rates  credit risk and the remaining time to maturity of the interest rate swaps 
management s intention is to hold the interest rate swaps to maturity 
the company is exposed to foreign currency risk as fluctuations in the united states dollar against the canadian dollar can impact the financial results of the company
