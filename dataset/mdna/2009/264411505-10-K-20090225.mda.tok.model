item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations business overview we are a self administered and self managed reit that began operations through a related entity in as of december   we owned or jointly controlled industrial  office  healthcare and retail properties including properties under development and excluding all properties developed with the intent to sell  consisting of approximately million square feet  and owned or jointly controlled more than  acres of land with an estimated future development potential of more than million square feet of industrial  office  healthcare and retail properties 
we provide the following services for our properties and for certain properties owned by third parties and joint ventures property leasing  property management  asset management  construction  development  and other tenant related services 

table of contents we also develop or acquire properties with the intent to sell hereafter referred to as build for sale properties 
build for sale properties represent properties where our investment strategy results in a decision to sell the property within a relatively short time after it is placed in service 
build for sale properties are generally identified as such prior to construction commencement and may either be sold or contributed to an unconsolidated entity in which we have an ownership interest or sold outright to third parties 
financial strategy our financing strategy is to actively manage the components of our capital structure and maintain investment grade ratings for our unsecured notes from our credit rating agencies 
additionally  to the extent that market conditions permit  we employ a capital recycling program that utilizes sales of operating real estate assets that no longer fit our strategies to generate proceeds that can be recycled into new properties that better fit our current and long term strategies 
we also seek to maintain a balanced and flexible capital structure by i extending and sequencing the maturity dates of our outstanding debt obligations  ii borrowing primarily at fixed rates by targeting a variable rate component of total debt less than  iii pursuing current and future long term debt financings  iv maintaining fixed charge coverage and other ratios at levels required to maintain investment grade ratings for our unsecured notes  v generating proceeds from the sale of non strategic properties and vi issuing perpetual preferred shares for of our total capital structure 
however  given the current state of the economy and capital markets  our near term focus is on improving liquidity through capital preservation by substantially decreasing acquisitions and development  diligently managing our overhead expenses  reducing dividend payments and actively seeking new sources of capital  including secured indebtedness  to refinance and extend our debt maturities 
in order to strengthen our capital structure we intend to repurchase unsecured debt  on the open market  when favorable pricing is available 
by focusing on strengthening our balance sheet  we expect to be well positioned for future growth as the economy improves 
operational objectives our primary operational objective is to maximize funds from operations ffo by i maintaining and increasing property occupancy and rental rates through the management of our portfolio of existing properties  ii selectively developing and acquiring new properties for rental operations in our existing markets when economic conditions improve  iii using our construction expertise to act as a general contractor or construction manager in our existing markets and other domestic markets on a fee basis  and iv providing a full line of real estate services to our tenants and to third parties 
year in review notwithstanding the overall state of the economy  we were still able to execute several significant transactions throughout the year as discussed below 
however  due to the volatile state of the credit markets  we were forced to limit our development activities 
while the curtailment of development activities  in the short term  will allow us to preserve additional capital  it will also result in a short term decrease in the rate of revenue growth  and proceeds from dispositions of build for sale properties  from what has been achieved historically 
net income available for common shareholders for the year ended december   was million  or 
per share diluted  compared to net income of million  or per share diluted for the year ended the decrease in net income available for common shareholders was driven largely by significant held for rental property sales that took place during as part of our capital recycling program 
access to credit by potential buyers was limited during  therefore  we were not able to continue our capital recycling 
table of contents program in at the levels we achieved in ffo available to common shareholders totaled million for the year ended december   compared to million for the same period in industry analysts and investors use ffo as a supplemental operating performance measure of an equity real estate investment trust reit 
ffo is calculated in accordance with the definition that was adopted by the board of governors of the national association of real estate investment trusts nareit 
ffo  as defined by nareit  represents net income loss determined in accordance with united states generally accepted accounting principles gaap  excluding extraordinary items as defined under gaap and gains or losses from sales of previously depreciated real estate assets  plus certain non cash items such as real estate asset depreciation and amortization  and after similar adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures 
historical cost accounting for real estate assets in accordance with gaap implicitly assumes that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time 
since real estate values instead have historically risen or fallen with market conditions  many industry analysts and investors have considered presentation of operating results for real estate companies that use historical cost accounting to be insufficient by themselves 
thus  nareit created ffo as a supplemental measure of reit operating performance that excludes historical cost depreciation  among other items  from gaap net income 
management believes that the use of ffo  combined with the required primary gaap presentations  improves the understanding of operating results of reits among the investing public and makes comparisons of reit operating results more meaningful 
management believes ffo is a useful measure for reviewing comparative operating results and financial performance although ffo should be reviewed in conjunction with net income which remains the primary measure of performance because by excluding gains or losses related to sales of previously depreciated real estate assets and excluding real estate asset depreciation and amortization  ffo provides a useful comparison of the operating performance of our real estate between periods or as compared to different companies 
the following table summarizes the calculation of ffo for the years ended december   and  respectively in thousands net income available for common shareholders adjustments depreciation and amortization company share of joint venture depreciation and amortization earnings from depreciable property sales wholly owned earnings from depreciable property sales share of joint venture minority interest share of adjustments funds from operations during  we continued to execute within our core areas of competency  while making adjustments due to the general disruption in the us economy 
highlights of our operating activities are as follows in december  we sold acres of land in alexandria  va  to the united states government for the development of an administrative office complex for the us department of the army 
the land sale  for million  is part of an overall million development and construction agreement with the us army corps of engineers that implements the base realignment and closure commission the brac construction contract and will continue through the development will consist of facilities containing more than million square feet  and includes two multi story office towers  two parking garages and a public transportation center 
the total anticipated profit on the overall agreement will be recognized over the course of the contract using the percentage of completion method of accounting 

table of contents during  we sold seven newly developed properties to unconsolidated joint ventures from which we received million of sales and financing proceeds and recognized pre tax gains on sale of million 
we also sold seven build for sale properties to third parties for million of gross proceeds and recognized pre tax gains on sale of million 
we disposed of eight wholly owned held for rental properties for million of gross proceeds and also generated million of gross proceeds  excluding the government contract described above  from the divestiture of non strategic land parcels 
the current state of the economy has limited our ability to access debt and equity capital markets 
management s priorities with regard to uses of capital for development of new properties  therefore  have been re evaluated and new wholly owned development commitments have been significantly curtailed 
as such  the total cost of our wholly owned properties under construction totaled million at december  with million of such costs having been incurred through that date 
our total cost for joint venture properties under construction was million at december  with million of costs incurred through that date 
the occupancy level for our in service held for rental portfolio including joint venture properties decreased from at december  to at december  the decrease was primarily the result of developments which were not fully leased being placed in service during however  occupancy of this portfolio did improve over the last two quarters of the year as we experienced positive net leasing absorption for the year 
we engaged in a number of financing activities during to adapt to  as well as to capitalize on  opportunities provided by the volatility in the credit markets 
highlights of our key financing activities in are as follows in january  we repaid million of senior unsecured notes with an effective interest rate of on their scheduled maturity date 
in february  we issued million of series o cumulative redeemable preferred shares 
in may  we repaid million of senior unsecured notes with an effective interest rate of on their scheduled maturity date 
in may  we issued million of senior unsecured notes due in may after including the effect of forward starting swaps  which were designated as cash flow hedges for this offering  the effective interest rate is 
during the fourth quarter of  we opportunistically repurchased preferred shares on the open market in order to take advantage of significant trading discounts 
in total  we repurchased preferred shares having a redemption value of approximately million for million  which resulted in an approximate million gain on repurchase after considering the charge off of offering costs from those shares 
during the fourth quarter of  we also repurchased certain of our outstanding series of unsecured notes maturing in and on the open market 
we repurchased unsecured notes that had a face value of approximately million  for approximately million  and recognized a gain on extinguishment of these notes of approximately million 

table of contents in order to strengthen our liquidity position going forward and to preserve cash for future debt maturities  the board of directors resolved in january to reduce our annual dividend from per share to per share 
when considering common shares and limited partnership units outstanding as of december   this dividend reduction will generate million in additional available cash annually  when compared to an annual dividend of per share 
key performance indicators our operating results depend primarily upon rental income from our industrial  office  healthcare and retail properties rental operations 
the following discussion highlights the areas of rental operations that we consider critical drivers of future revenues 
all square footage totals and occupancy percentages reflect both wholly owned and joint venture properties 
occupancy analysis as discussed above  our ability to maintain high occupancy rates is a principal driver of maintaining and increasing rental revenue from continuing operations 
the following table sets forth occupancy information regarding our in service portfolio of rental properties including rental properties of unconsolidated joint ventures but excluding all in service build for sale properties as of december  and  respectively in thousands  except percentage data total square feet percent of total square feet percent occupied type industrial office other total the decrease in occupancy at december   as compared to december   is primarily the result of developments which were not fully leased being placed in service during certain of these developments were built with the intention to sell shortly after completion but  due to economic conditions  were not sold and are being held as rental properties for the foreseeable future 
our ongoing ability to maintain favorable occupancy levels may be adversely affected by the impact of workforce reductions triggered by the current economic downturn on current and prospective tenants and such a reduction in the level of occupancy may have an adverse impact on revenues from rental operations 
there are no significant differences in occupancy between wholly owned properties and properties held by unconsolidated subsidiaries 
lease expiration and renewals our ability to maintain and improve occupancy rates primarily depends upon our continuing ability to re lease expiring space 
the following table reflects our in service portfolio lease expiration schedule by property type as of december  the table indicates square footage and annualized net effective rents based on december rental revenue under expiring leases in thousands  except percentage data total portfolio industrial office other year of expiration square feet ann

table of contents we renewed and of our leases up for renewal totaling approximately million and million square feet in and  respectively 
we attained growth in net effective rents on these renewals during excluding the effect of one significant  square foot early lease renewal in certain of our office properties  our growth in net effective rents for would have been  which is more consistent with our growth in net effective rent rate upon renewal of 
our lease renewal percentages over the past three years have remained relatively consistent at a success rate 
the effects of current economic conditions upon our base of existing tenants may adversely affect our ability to continue to achieve this renewal rate 
future development another source of our earnings growth is our wholly owned and joint venture development activities 
we expect to generate future earnings through income upon the sale of these development properties or from rental operations income as the development properties are placed in service and leased 
considering the current state of the economy and the risks presented by constraints on our ability to access capital on favorable terms  if at all  we have reduced the level of our wholly owned new development activities pending improvements in the economy and capital markets and are focused on the lease up of recently completed and under development projects 
we had million square feet of property under development with total estimated costs upon completion of million at december   compared to million square feet of property under development with total estimated costs of billion at december  the square footage and estimated costs include both wholly owned and joint venture development activity at

acquisition and disposition activity gross sales proceeds related to the dispositions of wholly owned held for rental properties were million in  compared to million in proceeds from included the disposition of a portfolio of eight office properties in the cleveland market and a portfolio of twelve industrial properties in the st 
louis market 
dispositions of wholly owned build for sale properties resulted in million in proceeds in  compared to million in this increase was largely a result of million in current year proceeds from seven buildings sold to a owned unconsolidated joint venture with which we have an agreement to sell up to million in build for sale properties over a three year period 

table of contents our share of proceeds from sales of properties within unconsolidated joint ventures  in which we have less than a interest  totaled million in  compared to million in we intend to continue to identify properties for disposition in order to recycle the proceeds into higher yielding assets and to reduce our debt maturities 
we believe that the number of dispositions we execute in will be impacted by the ability of prospective buyers to obtain favorable financing given the current state of the economy and credit markets in particular 
in  we acquired million of income producing properties and million of undeveloped land  compared to million of income producing properties and million of undeveloped land in in  we also continued our expansion into the healthcare real estate market by completing the acquisition of bremner healthcare real estate  a national healthcare development and management firm 
the initial consideration paid to the sellers totaled million and the sellers may be eligible for further contingent payments over the three years following the acquisition date 
results of operations a summary of our operating results and property statistics for each of the years in the three year period ended december   is as follows in thousands  except number of properties and per share data rental operations revenues from continuing operations service operations revenues from continuing operations earnings from continuing rental operations earnings from continuing service operations operating income net income available for common shareholders weighted average common shares outstanding weighted average common shares and potential dilutive securities basic income per common share continuing operations discontinued operations diluted income per common share continuing operations discontinued operations number of in service properties at end of year in service square footage at end of year comparison of year ended december  to year ended december  rental revenue from continuing operations overall  rental revenue from continuing operations increased from million in to million in the following table reconciles rental revenue from continuing operations by reportable segment to our total reported rental revenue from continuing operations for the years ended december  and  respectively in thousands office industrial non reportable segments total the primary reasons for the increase in rental revenue from continuing operations  with specific references to a particular segment when applicable  are summarized below in  we acquired five new properties and placed developments in service 
these acquisitions and developments provided incremental revenues of million and million  respectively 

table of contents acquisitions and developments that were placed in service in provided million and million  respectively  of incremental revenue in we sold eight properties to an unconsolidated joint venture in  resulting in an million reduction in revenues for the year ended december   as compared to the same period in of these properties  seven were sold in the second quarter of and one was sold in the fourth quarter of rental revenue from continuing operations includes lease termination fees 
lease termination fees relate to specific tenants who pay a fee to terminate their lease obligations before the end of the contractual lease term 
lease termination fees decreased from million in to million in equity in earnings of unconsolidated companies equity in earnings represents our ownership share of net income from investments in unconsolidated companies 
these unconsolidated companies generally own and operate rental properties and develop properties 
equity in earnings decreased from million in to million in largely as the result of our million share of additional depreciation expense recognized when two properties owned by unconsolidated companies were removed from held for sale classification 
the additional depreciation expense was partially offset by an increase in gain on building sales in compared to during  our joint ventures sold ten non strategic buildings  with our share of the net gain recognized through equity in earnings totaling million  compared to five joint venture building sales in  with million recorded to equity in earnings for our share of the net gains 
rental expenses and real estate taxes the following table reconciles rental expenses and real estate taxes by reportable segment to our total reported amounts in the statements of operations for the years ended december  and  respectively in thousands rental expenses office industrial non reportable segments total real estate taxes office industrial non reportable segments total of the overall million increase in rental expenses in compared to  million was attributable to properties acquired and developments placed in service from january  through december  this increase was partially offset by a reduction in rental expenses of million resulting from the sale of eight properties to an unconsolidated joint venture in increases in utility costs and snow removal in our existing base of properties also contributed to the increase in rental expenses 
of the overall million increase in real estate taxes in compared to  million was attributable to properties acquired and developments placed in service from january  through december  the remaining increase in real estate taxes was driven by increases in taxes on our existing properties 

table of contents interest expense interest expense from continuing operations increased from million in to million in the increase is primarily the result of interest costs related to development projects that were placed in service in late and where the costs to finance these projects were capitalized during construction 
overall  our weighted average interest rates remained fairly consistent from to  as the weighted average interest rate on our unsecured notes increased from to  while we experienced lower interest rates throughout on our libor based unsecured lines of credit 
depreciation and amortization expense depreciation and amortization increased from million in to million in due to increases in our held for rental asset base from acquisitions and developments placed in service during and as well as the result of recording additional depreciation expense in the amount of million for properties removed from held for sale classification in service operations service operations primarily consist of sales of build for sale properties and the leasing  management  construction and development services for joint venture properties and properties owned by third parties 
these operations are heavily influenced by the current state of the economy  as leasing and management fees are dependent upon occupancy while construction and development services rely on the expansion of business operations of third party property owners 
earnings from service operations increased from million in to million in the increase in earnings from service operations was primarily the result of a million increase in pre tax gains on dispositions of build for sale properties and lower income tax expense in our taxable reit subsidiary 
general and administrative expense general and administrative expense increased from million in to million in general and administrative expenses consist of two components 
the first component is direct expenses that are not attributable to specific assets such as legal fees  audit fees  marketing costs  investor relations expenses and other corporate overhead 
the second component is the unallocated indirect costs determined to be unrelated to the operation of our owned properties and service operations 
those indirect costs not allocated to these operations are charged to general and administrative expenses 
the increase in general and administrative expenses was largely driven by a million decrease in overhead costs allocated to leasing and construction activity based on decreased volume in these areas 
offsetting the decreased allocation of general and administrative expenses to operating activities was a million decrease in total overhead costs in as we focused on overhead reduction opportunities 
impairment charges and other expenses impairment charges and other expenses consist of impairment charges recognized on our long lived assets as well as the write off of previously capitalized costs of potential projects that we determined are no longer likely to be pursued 
the increase from million in to million in was largely the result of a re assessment of our intended use of some of our land holdings  as well as the negative effect of the overall economy on real estate values in certain of our markets 
we recognized non cash impairment charges in on seven of our tracts of undeveloped land totaling million 
additionally  as the result of the economy s negative effect on real estate selling prices  we recognized million of impairment charges on two of our build for sale properties that were under construction at december   as they were expected to sell in the fair values of these assets were calculated either by discounting estimated future cash flows and sales proceeds or were based on comparable transactions 
the remaining million and million of activity in and  respectively  primarily pertained to costs previously capitalized for potential projects that we later determined would not be pursued 

table of contents discontinued operations the results of operations for properties sold during the year to unrelated parties or classified as held for sale at the end of the period are required to be classified as discontinued operations 
the property specific components of earnings that are classified as discontinued operations include rental revenues  rental expenses  real estate taxes  allocated interest expense  depreciation expense and minority interest  as well as the net gain or loss on the disposition of properties 
the operations of buildings are currently classified as discontinued operations 
these properties consist of industrial and office properties 
as a result  we classified net income from operations  net of minority interest  of million  million and million in discontinued operations for the years ended december   and  respectively 
of these properties  eight were sold during  properties were sold during and properties were sold during the gains on disposal of these properties  net of minority interest  of million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively  are also reported in discontinued operations 
comparison of year ended december  to year ended december  rental revenue from continuing operations overall  rental revenue from continuing operations increased from million in to million in the following table reconciles rental revenue from continuing operations by reportable segment to our total reported rental revenue from continuing operations for the years ended december  and  respectively in thousands office industrial non reportable segments total the primary reasons for the increase in rental revenue from continuing operations  with specific references to a particular segment when applicable  are summarized below in  we acquired six new properties and placed development projects in service 
these acquisitions and developments provided incremental revenues of million and million  respectively 
acquisitions and developments that were placed in service in provided million and million  respectively  of incremental revenue in we acquired an additional properties in and later sold them to an unconsolidated joint venture  resulting in a million reduction in revenues for the year ended december   as compared to the same period in of these properties  were sold in the fourth quarter of  seven were sold in the second quarter of and one was sold in the fourth quarter of rental revenue includes lease termination fees 
lease termination fees relate to specific tenants who pay a fee to terminate their lease obligations before the end of the contractual lease term 
lease termination fees increased from million in to million in the remaining increase in rental revenues is primarily the result of an million increase in revenues from reimbursable rental expenses 
this increase is largely offset by a corresponding increase in overall rental expenses 

table of contents equity in earnings of unconsolidated companies equity in earnings represents our ownership share of net income from investments in unconsolidated companies 
these joint ventures generally own and operate rental properties and develop properties 
these earnings decreased from million in to million in during  our joint ventures sold non strategic buildings  with our share of the net gain recorded through equity in earnings totaling million  compared to ten joint venture building sales in  with million recorded to equity in earnings for our share of net gains 
rental expenses and real estate taxes the following table reconciles rental expenses and real estate taxes by reportable segment to our total reported amounts in the statements of operations for the years ended december  and  respectively in thousands rental expenses office industrial non reportable segments total real estate taxes office industrial non reportable segments total our rental expenses increased by million in compared to a million increase in rental expenses attributable to properties acquired and developments placed in service from january  through december  was largely offset by a reduction in rental expenses of million resulting from the contribution of properties to an unconsolidated joint venture in and inclement weather conditions in the first quarter of  an increase in utility rates and volume in the third quarter of due to unseasonably high temperatures and normal inflationary factors triggered the remaining increase in rental expenses 
of the overall million increase in real estate taxes in compared to  million was attributable to properties acquired and developments placed in service from january  through december  the remaining increase in real estate taxes was driven by increases in taxes on our existing properties 
interest expense interest expense from continuing operations remained fairly consistent from to at million in  compared to million in while we maintained higher outstanding borrowings in compared to  these higher borrowings were used to fund our increase in development activities and thus  the increased interest costs from these borrowings were capitalized into project costs rather than expensed 
depreciation and amortization expense depreciation and amortization increased from million in to million in due to increases in our held for rental asset base from acquisitions and developments placed in service during and 
table of contents service operations earnings from service operations decreased slightly from million in to million in during  we generated pre tax gains of million from the sale of build for sale properties compared to million from the sale of nine such properties in partially offsetting this decrease was a million reduction in income taxes on these gains on sale  with the net effect of decreased gains on sale in resulting in a million decrease in earnings from service operations 
increased net general contractor revenues drove a million increase in earnings from service operations from as the result of increased volume and margins and favorable settlement of previously existing warranty reserves 
general and administrative expense general and administrative expense increased from million in to million in there was a million increase in total overhead costs in as the result of our overall growth 
the majority of this increase in the total overhead costs was a result of increased rental and service operations activity and thus  was allocated to rental operations  construction  development and leasing 
approximately million of the increase in total overhead costs was not allocated to operations  which was the primary reason for the overall million increase to general and administrative expense 
critical accounting policies the preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with gaap requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reported period 
our estimates  judgments and assumptions are inherently subjective and based on the existing business and market conditions  and are therefore continually evaluated based upon available information and experience 
note to the consolidated financial statements includes further discussion of our significant accounting policies 
our management has assessed the accounting policies used in the preparation of our financial statements and discussed them with our audit committee and independent auditors 
the following accounting policies are considered critical based upon materiality to the financial statements  degree of judgment involved in estimating reported amounts and sensitivity to changes in industry and economic conditions accounting for joint ventures we analyze our investments in joint ventures under financial accounting standards board fasb interpretation no 
r  consolidation of variable interest entities  to determine if the joint venture is considered a variable interest entity and would require consolidation 
to the extent that our joint ventures do not qualify as variable interest entities  we further assess under the guidelines of emerging issues task force eitf issue no 
 determining whether a general partner  or the general partners as a group  controls a limited partnership or similar entity when the limited partners have certain rights eitf  statement of position  accounting for investments in real estate ventures sop  accounting research bulletin no 
 consolidated financial statements  and statement of financial accounting standard sfas no 
 consolidation of all majority owned subsidiaries  to determine if the venture should be consolidated 
we have equity interests generally ranging from to in unconsolidated joint ventures that develop  own and operate rental properties and hold land for development 
to the extent applicable  we consolidate those joint ventures that are considered to be variable interest entities where we are the primary beneficiary 
for non variable interest entities  we consolidate those joint ventures that we control through majority ownership interests or where we are the managing entity and our partner does not have substantive participating rights 
control is further demonstrated by the ability of the general partner to manage day to day operations  refinance debt and sell the assets of the joint venture without the consent of the limited partner and inability of the limited partner to replace the general partner 
we use the equity method of accounting for those joint ventures where we do not have control over operating and financial policies 
under the equity method of accounting  our investment in each joint venture is included on our balance sheet  however  the assets and liabilities of the joint ventures for which we use the equity method are not included on our balance sheet 

table of contents to the extent that we contribute assets to a joint venture  our investment in the joint venture is recorded at our cost basis in the assets that were contributed to the joint venture 
to the extent that our cost basis is different than the basis reflected at the joint venture level  the basis difference is amortized over the life of the related asset and included in our share of equity in net income of the joint venture 
in accordance with the provisions of sop and sfas no 
 accounting for sales of real estate  we recognize gains on the contribution or sale of real estate to joint ventures  relating solely to the outside partner s interest  to the extent the economic substance of the transaction is a sale 
cost capitalization direct and certain indirect costs  including interest  clearly associated with and incremental to the development  construction  leasing or expansion of real estate investments are capitalized as a cost of the property 
we capitalize interest and direct and indirect project costs associated with the initial construction of a property up to the time the property is substantially complete and ready for its intended use 
we believe the completion of the building shell is the proper basis for determining substantial completion and that this basis is the most widely accepted standard in the real estate industry 
the interest rate used to capitalize interest is based upon our average borrowing rate on existing debt 
we also capitalize direct and indirect costs  including interest costs  on vacant space during extended lease up periods after construction of the building shell has been completed if costs are being incurred to ready the vacant space for its intended use 
if costs and activities incurred to ready the vacant space cease  then cost capitalization is also discontinued until such activities are resumed 
once necessary work has been completed on a vacant space  project costs are no longer capitalized 
we cease capitalization of all project costs on extended lease up periods after the shorter of a one year period after the completion of the building shell or when the property attains occupancy 
in addition  all leasing commissions paid to third parties for new leases or lease renewals are capitalized 
in assessing the amount of indirect costs to be capitalized  we first allocate payroll costs  on a department by department basis  among activities for which capitalization is warranted ie  construction  development and leasing and those for which capitalization is not warranted ie  property management  maintenance  acquisitions and dispositions and general corporate functions 
to the extent the employees of a department split their time between capitalizable and non capitalizable activities  the allocations are made based on estimates of the actual amount of time spent in each activity 
once the payroll costs are allocated  the non payroll costs of each department are allocated among the capitalizable and non capitalizable activities in the same proportion as payroll costs 
to ensure that an appropriate amount of costs are capitalized  the amount of capitalized costs that are allocated to a specific project are limited to amounts using standards we developed 
these standards consist of a percentage of the total development costs of a project and a percentage of the total gross lease amount payable under a specific lease 
these standards are derived after considering the amounts that would be allocated if the personnel in the departments were working at full capacity 
the use of these standards ensures that overhead costs attributable to downtime or to unsuccessful projects or leasing activities are not capitalized 
impairment of real estate assets we evaluate our real estate assets  with the exception of those that are classified as held for sale  for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying amounts may not be recoverable 
if such an evaluation is considered necessary  we compare the carrying amount of that real estate asset  or asset group  with the expected undiscounted cash flows that are directly associated with  and that are expected to arise as a direct result of  the use and eventual disposition of that asset  or asset group 
our estimate of the expected future cash flows used in testing for impairment is based on  among other things  our estimates regarding future market conditions  rental rates  occupancy levels  costs of tenant improvements  leasing commissions and other tenant concessions  assumptions regarding the residual value of our properties at the end of our anticipated holding period and the length of 
table of contents our anticipated holding period and is  therefore  subjective by nature 
these assumptions could differ materially from actual results 
if our strategy changes or if market conditions otherwise dictate a reduction in the holding period and an earlier sale date  an impairment loss could be recognized and such loss could be material 
to the extent the carrying amount of a real estate asset  or asset group  exceeds the associated estimate of undiscounted cash flows  an impairment loss is recorded to reduce the carrying value of the asset to its fair value 
the determination of the fair value of real estate assets is also highly subjective  especially in markets where there is a lack of recent comparable transactions 
real estate assets that are classified as held for sale are reported at the lower of their carrying value or their fair value  less estimated costs to sell 
acquisition of real estate property and related assets in accordance with sfas  business combinations  we allocate the purchase price of acquired properties to net tangible and identified intangible assets based on their respective fair values 
the allocation to tangible assets buildings  tenant improvements and land is based upon management s determination of the value of the property as if it were vacant using discounted cash flow models similar to those used by independent appraisers 
factors considered by management include an estimate of carrying costs during the expected lease up periods considering current market conditions  and costs to execute similar leases 
the purchase price of real estate assets is also allocated among three categories of intangible assets consisting of the above or below market component of in place leases  the value of in place leases and the value of customer relationships 
the value allocable to the above or below market component of an acquired in place lease is determined based upon the present value using an interest rate which reflects the risks associated with the lease of the difference between i the contractual amounts to be paid pursuant to the lease over its remaining term and ii management s estimate of the amounts that would be paid using current fair market rates over the remaining term of the lease 
the amounts allocated to above market leases are included in deferred leasing and other costs in the balance sheet and below market leases are included in other liabilities in the balance sheet  both are amortized to rental income over the remaining terms of the respective leases 
the total amount of intangible assets is further allocated to in place lease values and to customer relationship values  based upon management s assessment of their respective values 
these intangible assets are included in deferred leasing and other costs in the balance sheet and are amortized over the remaining term of the existing lease  or the anticipated life of the customer relationship  as applicable 
valuation of receivables we are subject to tenant defaults and bankruptcies that could affect the collection of outstanding receivables 
in order to mitigate these risks  we perform in house credit reviews and analyses on major existing tenants and all significant prospective tenants before leases are executed 
we have established the following procedures and policies to evaluate the collectibility of outstanding receivables and record allowances we maintain a tenant watch list containing a list of significant tenants for which the payment of receivables and future rent may be at risk 
various factors such as late rent payments  lease or debt instrument defaults  and indications of a deteriorating financial position are considered when determining whether to include a tenant on the watch list 
as a matter of policy  we reserve the entire receivable balance  including straight line rent  of any tenant with an amount outstanding over days 
straight line rent receivables for any tenant on the watch list or any other tenant identified as a potential long term risk  regardless of the status of rent receivables  are reviewed and reserved as necessary 

table of contents construction contracts we recognize income on construction contracts where we serve as a general contractor on the percentage of completion method 
using this method  profits are recorded on the basis of our estimates of the overall profit and percentage of completion of individual contracts 
a portion of the estimated profits is accrued based upon our estimates of the percentage of completion of the construction contract 
cumulative revenues recognized may be less or greater than cumulative costs and profits billed at any point in time during a contract s term 
this revenue recognition method involves inherent risks relating to profit and cost estimates with those risks reduced through approval and monitoring processes 
with regard to critical accounting policies  management has discussed the following with the audit committee criteria for identifying and selecting our critical accounting policies  methodology in applying our critical accounting policies  and impact of the critical accounting policies on our financial statements 
the audit committee has reviewed the critical accounting policies identified by management 
liquidity and capital resources sources of liquidity we expect to meet our short term liquidity requirements over the next twelve months  including payments of dividends and distributions  as well as recurring capital expenditures relating to maintaining our current real estate assets  primarily through working capital and net cash provided by operating activities 
we expect to meet long term liquidity requirements  such as scheduled mortgage and unsecured debt maturities  property acquisitions  financing of development activities and other non recurring capital improvements  primarily from the following sources undistributed cash provided by operating activities  issuance of additional equity  including common and preferred shares  issuance of additional debt securities  including secured debt  proceeds received from real estate dispositions  and transactions with unconsolidated entities 
due to the current disruption in the us economy  we are constantly monitoring the state of the capital markets and actively managing our capital needs  such as development expenditures and commitments 
we will continue to utilize the duke realty limited partnership drlp billion unsecured revolving line of credit to complete development projects currently under construction 
we have virtually halted all new development activity and are focused on the completion and lease up of under construction and recently completed projects 
in january  we announced a reduction in our annual dividend from per share to per share  which will result in approximately million of additional undistributed cash on an annual basis 
we anticipate using multiple sources of capital  including issuances of secured debt in the near future  to meet our long term capital needs 
rental operations we believe our primary source of liquidity  cash flows from rental operations  provides a stable source of cash to fund operational expenses 
we believe that this cash based revenue stream is substantially aligned with revenue recognition except for periodic straight line rental income accruals and amortization of above or below market rents as cash receipts from the leasing of rental properties are generally received in advance of or in a short time following the actual revenue recognition 

table of contents we are subject to a number of risks as a result of the current economic downturn  including reduced occupancy  tenant defaults and bankruptcies  and potential reduction in rental rates upon renewal or re letting of properties  each of which would result in reduced cash flow from operations 
these risks may be heightened as a result of the current economic conditions 
however  we believe that these risks may be mitigated by our relatively strong market presence in most of our markets and the fact that we perform in house credit reviews and analyses on major tenants and all significant leases before they are executed 
debt and equity securities our unsecured lines of credit as of december  are described as follows in thousands description borrowing capacity maturity date outstanding balance at december  unsecured line of credit drlp  january  unsecured line of credit consolidated subsidiary  july  we use the drlp unsecured line of credit to fund development activities  acquire additional rental properties and provide working capital 
this line of credit provides us with an option to obtain borrowings from financial institutions that participate in the line  at rates that may be lower than the stated interest rate  subject to certain restrictions 
the stated rate on the amounts outstanding on the drlp unsecured line of credit as of december  was libor plus 
ranging from to as of december  
we may  at our sole discretion  exercise an option to extend the maturity date to january this line of credit also contains financial covenants that require us to meet financial ratios and defined levels of performance  including those related to fixed charge  variable rate indebtedness  consolidated net worth and debt to net asset value 
as of december   we were in compliance with all covenants under this line of credit 
due to the current volatile state of the credit markets  the borrowing cost of future secured or unsecured debt issuances may be higher  for the foreseeable future  than what has been historically available 
we anticipate that additional issuances  in the near term  will be in the form of secured debt offerings 
in february  we issued million of series o cumulative redeemable preferred shares 
in may  we issued million of senior unsecured notes due in may after taking into account the effect of forward starting swaps  which were designated as cash flow hedges for this offering  the notes had an effective interest rate of 
the indentures and related supplemental indentures governing our outstanding series of notes also require us to comply with financial ratios and other covenants regarding our operations 
we were in compliance with all such covenants  as well as applicable covenants under our unsecured line of credit  as of december  at december   we had on file with the sec an automatic shelf registration statement on form s  relating to the offer and sale  from time to time  of an indeterminate amount of drlp s debt securities including guarantees thereof and the company s common shares  preferred shares  depository shares  warrants  stock purchase contracts and units comprised of one or more of these securities 
from time to time  we expect to issue additional securities under this automatic shelf registration statement to fund the repayment of the credit facility and other long term debt upon maturity 
sale of real estate assets we utilize sales of real estate assets as an additional source of liquidity 
we pursue opportunities to sell real estate assets at favorable prices to capture value created by us as well as to improve the overall quality of our portfolio by recycling sale proceeds into new properties with greater value creation opportunities 
in  our capital recycling program was significantly reduced due to the current state of the economy and the credit markets and it is likely that this trend will continue in 
table of contents transactions with unconsolidated entities transactions with unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures also provide a source of liquidity 
from time to time we will sell properties to an unconsolidated entity  while retaining a continuing interest in that entity  and receive proceeds commensurate to the interest that we do not own 
additionally  unconsolidated entities will from time to time obtain debt financing and will distribute to us  and our partners  all or a portion of the proceeds 
in may  we entered into an unconsolidated joint venture that will acquire up to million of our newly developed build to suit projects over a three year period 
properties will be sold to the joint venture upon completion  lease commencement and satisfaction of other customary conditions 
we will retain a equity interest in the joint venture 
as of december   the joint venture has acquired seven properties from us and we received year to date net sale proceeds and financing distributions of approximately million 
in january  we sold a tract of land to an unconsolidated joint venture in which we hold a equity interest and received a distribution  commensurate to our partner s ownership interest  of approximately million 
in november  that unconsolidated joint venture entered a loan agreement with a consortium of banks and distributed a portion of the loan proceeds to us and our partner  with our share of the distribution totaling million 
uses of liquidity our principal uses of liquidity include the following property investment  recurring leasing capital costs  dividends and distributions to shareholders and unitholders  long term debt maturities  opportunistic repurchases of outstanding debt  and other contractual obligations 
property investment we evaluate development and acquisition opportunities based upon market outlook  supply and long term growth potential 
our ability to make future property investments is dependent upon our continued access to our longer term sources of liquidity including the issuances of debt or equity securities as well as disposing of selected properties 
in light of current economic conditions  management continues to evaluate our investment priorities and we are limiting new development expenditures 
recurring expenditures one of our principal uses of our liquidity is to fund the recurring leasing capital expenditures of our real estate investments 
the following is a summary of our recurring capital expenditures for the years ended december   and  respectively in thousands recurring tenant improvements recurring leasing costs building improvements totals 
table of contents dividends and distributions in order to qualify as a reit for federal income tax purposes  we must currently distribute at least of our taxable income to shareholders 
because depreciation is a non cash expense  cash flow will typically be greater than operating income 
we paid dividends per share of  and for the years ended december   and  respectively 
we expect to continue to distribute taxable earnings to meet the requirements to maintain our reit status 
however  distributions are declared at the discretion of our board of directors and are subject to actual cash available for distribution  our financial condition  capital requirements and such other factors as our board of directors deems relevant 
in january  our board of directors resolved to decrease our annual dividend from per share to per share in order to retain additional cash to help meet our capital needs 
we anticipate retaining additional cash of approximately million per year  when compared to an annual dividend of per share  as the result of this action 
at december  we had six series of preferred shares outstanding 
the annual dividend rates on our preferred shares range between and and are paid in arrears quarterly 
debt maturities debt outstanding at december  totaled billion with a weighted average interest rate of maturing at various dates through we had billion of unsecured debt  million outstanding on our unsecured lines of credit and million of secured debt outstanding at december  scheduled principal amortization and maturities of such debt totaled million for the year ended december  the following is a summary of the scheduled future amortization and maturities of our indebtedness at december  in thousands  except percentage data future repayments weighted average interest rate of future repayments year scheduled amortization maturities total thereafter the balance outstanding on the drlp unsecured line of credit is included in debt maturities for this line of credit may be extended to at our option 
we anticipate generating capital to fund our debt maturities by using undistributed cash generated from rental operations  which will increase as the result of reducing our annual dividends and development expenditures  as well as through raising additional capital which  in the near term  is expected to occur mainly through the issuance of secured debt and through asset dispositions 
opportunistic repurchases of outstanding debt we intend to repurchase  when favorable pricing is available  outstanding unsecured debt maturing over the next three years 

table of contents historical cash flows cash and cash equivalents were million and million at december  and  respectively 
the following highlights significant changes in net cash associated with our operating  investing and financing activities in millions years ended december  net cash provided by operating activities net cash provided by used for investing activities net cash provided by used for financing activities operating activities cash flows from operating activities provide the cash necessary to meet normal operational requirements of our rental operations and service operations activities 
the receipt of rental income from rental operations continues to provide the primary source of our revenues and operating cash flows 
in addition  we develop buildings with the intent to sell them at or soon after completion  which provides another significant source of operating cash flow activity 
highlights of such activity are as follows during the year ended december   we incurred build for sale property development costs of million  compared to million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the decrease is a result of lower activity in our build for sale business 
build for sale projects under construction as of december  had anticipated total costs upon completion of million  of which million has not yet been incurred as of december  we sold build for sale properties in compared to in and nine in  receiving net proceeds of million  million and million  respectively

net cash flows from third party construction contracts increased by million from the increase was largely driven by million in cash proceeds from the sale of a parcel of land to the us department of the army in conjunction with the brac construction contract 
investing activities investing activities are one of the primary uses of our liquidity 
development and acquisition activities typically generate additional rental revenues and provide cash flows for operational requirements 
highlights of significant cash sources and uses are as follows sales of land and depreciated property provided million in net proceeds in  compared to million in and million in we sold portfolios of eight suburban office properties in our cleveland market and twelve industrial properties in our st 
louis market during  which together provided million of the net proceeds received in we received capital distributions as a result of the sale of properties or refinancing from unconsolidated subsidiaries of million in  compared to million in and million in development expenditures for our held for rental portfolio totaled million for the year ended december   compared to million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively

during the fourth quarter of  we opportunistically repurchased preferred shares from all outstanding series in the open market in order to take advantage of the significant discounts at which they were trading 
in total  we repurchased preferred shares having a redemption value of approximately million for million  which resulted in an approximate million gain on repurchase after considering the charge off of offering costs from those shares 
during the fourth quarter of  we also repurchased certain of our outstanding series of unsecured notes maturing in and on the open market 
we repurchased unsecured notes that had a face value of approximately million  for approximately million  and recognized a gain on extinguishment of these notes of approximately million 
credit ratings we are currently assigned investment grade corporate credit ratings on our senior unsecured notes from moody s investors service and standard and poor s ratings group 
our senior unsecured notes have been assigned ratings of bbb and baa by standard and poor s ratings group and moody s investors service  respectively 
our preferred shares carry ratings of bb and baa from standard and poor s ratings group and moody s investors service  respectively 
the ratings of our senior unsecured notes and preferred shares could change based upon  among other things  the impact that prevailing economic conditions may have on our results of operations and financial condition 

table of contents financial instruments we are exposed to capital market risk  such as changes in interest rates 
in order to reduce the volatility relating to interest rate risk  we may enter into interest rate hedging arrangements from time to time 
we do not utilize derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
off balance sheet arrangements investments in unconsolidated companies we have equity interests generally ranging from to in unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures that own and operate rental properties and hold land for development 
our unconsolidated subsidiaries are primarily engaged in the operations and development of industrial  office and retail real estate properties 
we hold interests both in joint ventures that operate real estate for long term investment and rental income operating joint ventures as well as joint ventures that develop properties with the intent to sell within a relatively short period of time after completion and lease up development joint ventures 
the equity method of accounting see critical accounting policies is used for these investments in which we have the ability to exercise significant influence  but not control  over operating and financial policies 
as a result  the assets and liabilities of these joint ventures are not included on our balance sheet 
total assets of our unconsolidated subsidiaries were billion and billion as of december  and  respectively 
our investments in and advances to unconsolidated companies represents approximately and of our total assets as of december  and  respectively 
these investments provide several benefits to us  including increased market share  tenant and property diversification and an additional source of capital to fund real estate projects

table of contents contractual obligations at december   we were subject to certain contractual payment obligations as described in the table below payments due by period in thousands contractual obligations total thereafter long term debt lines of credit share of debt of unconsolidated joint ventures ground leases operating leases development and construction backlog costs future land acquisitions other total contractual obligations our long term debt consists of both secured and unsecured debt and includes both principal and interest 
interest expense for variable rate debt was calculated using the interest rate at december  our unsecured lines of credit consist of an operating line of credit that matures january and the line of credit of a consolidated subsidiary that matures july we may  at our option  extend the term of our operating line of credit by one year 
interest expense for our unsecured lines of credit was calculated using the most recent stated interest rates that were in effect 
our share of unconsolidated joint venture debt includes both principal and interest 
interest expense for variable rate debt was calculated using the interest rate at december  represents estimated remaining costs on the completion of held for rental  build for sale and third party construction projects 
these land acquisitions are subject to the completion of due diligence requirements  resolution of certain contingencies and completion of customary closing conditions 
in most cases  we may withdraw from land purchase contracts and the seller s only recourse is earnest money deposits that we have already paid 
represents other contractual obligations 
related party transactions we provide property management  leasing  construction and other tenant related services to unconsolidated companies in which we have equity interests 
for the years ended december   and  respectively  we earned management fees of million  million and million  leasing fees of million  million and million and construction and development fees of million  million and million from these companies 
we recorded these fees based on contractual terms that approximate market rates for these types of services and we have eliminated our ownership percentages of these fees in the consolidated financial statements 
commitments and contingencies we have guaranteed the repayment of million of economic development bonds issued by various municipalities in connection with certain commercial developments 
we will be required to make payments under our guarantees to the extent that incremental taxes from specified developments are not sufficient to pay the bond debt service 
management does not believe that it is probable that we will be required to make any significant payments in satisfaction of these guarantees 
we also have guaranteed the repayment of secured and unsecured loans of nine of our unconsolidated subsidiaries 
at december   the maximum guarantee exposure for these loans was approximately million 
additionally  we guaranteed million of secured indebtedness related to a property sold to a third party in management believes that the value of the underlying real estate exceeds the associated loan balances and that we will not be required to satisfy these guarantees 
we have entered into agreements  subject to the completion of due diligence requirements  resolution of certain contingencies and completion of customary closing conditions  for the future acquisitions of land totaling million 
in most cases  we may withdraw from land purchase contracts and the seller s only recourse is earnest money deposits that we have already paid 

table of contents in october  we sold or contributed industrial properties and undeveloped land with a fair value of million to a joint venture dugan realty llc in which we have a interest and recognized a net gain of million 
in connection with this transaction  the joint venture partners were given an option to put up to a million interest in the joint venture to us in exchange for our common stock or cash at our option  subject to certain timing and other restrictions 
as a result of this put option  we deferred million of gain on sale of depreciated property and recorded a million liability 
we are subject to various legal proceedings and claims that arise in the ordinary course of business 
in the opinion of management  the amount of any ultimate liability with respect to these actions will not materially affect our consolidated financial statements or results of operations 
recent accounting pronouncements in may  the fasb ratified fasb staff position no 
apb  accounting for convertible debt instruments that may be settled in cash upon conversion including partial cash settlement fsp apb that will require separate accounting for the debt and equity components of convertible instruments 
fsp apb will require that the value assigned to the debt component would be the estimated fair value of a similar bond without the conversion feature  which would result in the debt being recorded at a discount 
the resulting debt discount will be amortized over the period during which the debt is expected to be outstanding ie  through the first optional redemption date as additional non cash interest expense 
fsp apb is effective january  and will be applied retrospectively 
we currently estimate that fsp apb will result in us recognizing additional non cash interest expense of between million and million per annum 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk s we are exposed to interest rate changes primarily as a result of our line of credit and long term debt borrowings 
our interest rate risk management objective is to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to lower overall borrowing costs 
to achieve our objectives  we borrow primarily at fixed rates and may enter into derivative financial instruments such as interest rate swaps  caps and treasury locks in order to mitigate our interest rate risk on a related financial instrument 
we do not enter into derivative or interest rate transactions for speculative purposes 
our two outstanding swaps  that fixed the rates on two of our variable rate loans  were not significant to the financial statements in terms of notional amount or fair value at december  our interest rate risk is monitored using a variety of techniques 
the table below presents the principal amounts in thousands of the expected annual maturities  weighted average interest rates for the average debt outstanding in the specified period  fair values and other terms required to evaluate the expected cash flows and sensitivity to interest rate changes 
thereafter total fair value fixed rate secured debt weighted average interest rate variable rate secured debt weighted average interest rate fixed rate unsecured notes weighted average interest rate unsecured lines of credit rate at december  n a n a n a n a as the table incorporates only those exposures that exist as of december   it does not consider those exposures or positions that could arise after that date 
as a result  our ultimate realized gain or loss with respect to interest rate fluctuations will depend on the exposures that arise during the period  our hedging strategies at that time and interest rates 

table of contents at december  the redemption value of our unsecured notes was billion and we estimated the fair value of those unsecured notes to be billion 
our unsecured notes are thinly traded and our estimate of the fair value of those notes  when compared to the redemption values of those notes  has declined significantly since december  largely as the result of recent comparable trades at significant discounts as well as overall market conditions having the effect of increasing credit spreads 
interest expense on our unsecured lines of credit will be affected by future fluctuations in the libor indices 
the interest rate at such point in the future as we may renew  extend or replace our unsecured lines of credit and other long term debt borrowings will be heavily dependent upon the state of the credit environment
