item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with selected consolidated financial data and the consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this report 
overview incyte is a drug discovery and development company focused on developing proprietary small molecule drugs to treat serious unmet medical needs 
we have a broad pipeline with programs focused primarily in the areas of oncology  inflammation  and diabetes 
our wholly owned pipeline includes the following compounds drug target drug compound indication development status jak incb oral incb topical incb myelofibrosis polycythemia vera essential thrombocythemia rheumatoid arthritis refractory prostate cancer multiple myeloma psoriasis rheumatoid arthritis phase ii phase ii phase ii phase iia phase iia phase iib phase i hsd incb incb type diabetes type diabetes phase iib phase i sheddase incb solid tumors breast cancer phase iia phase ii c met incb solid cancers ind cleared ido incb oncology ind cleared hma incb type diabetes phase iia ccr incb multiple sclerosis phase i ccr incb incb human immunodeficiency virus hiv hiv phase ii phase i we anticipate incurring additional losses for several years as we expand our drug discovery and development programs 
we also expect that losses will fluctuate from quarter to quarter and that such fluctuations may be substantial 
conducting clinical trials for our drug candidates in development is a lengthy  time consuming and expensive process 
we do not expect to generate product sales from our drug discovery and development efforts for several years  if at all 
if we are unable to successfully develop and market pharmaceutical products over the next several years  our business  financial condition and results of operations would be adversely impacted 

table of contents collaborative research and license agreement with pfizer effective in january  we entered a collaborative research and license agreement with pfizer inc pfizer for the pursuit of our ccr antagonist program 
pfizer gained worldwide development and commercialization rights to our portfolio of ccr antagonist compounds 
pfizer s rights extend to the full scope of potential indications  with the exception of multiple sclerosis and autoimmune nephritides  where we retained worldwide rights  along with certain compounds 
we do not have obligations to pfizer on pre clinical development candidates we select for pursuit in these indications 
the agreement will terminate upon the expiration of the last to expire of patent rights licensed under the agreement 
prior to such expiration  either party can terminate the agreement for the uncured material breach of the agreement by the other party or for the insolvency of the other party 
in addition  pfizer may terminate the agreement at any time upon days notice 
we received an upfront nonrefundable  non creditable payment of million in january and are eligible to receive additional future development and milestone payments 
we received a million milestone payment from pfizer in restructuring programs in february  we made the decision to discontinue further development of our information products line  close our palo alto headquarters and focus solely on the discovery and development of novel drugs 
we recorded million in restructuring charges in  including charges related to the closure of our facilities  prior tenant improvements and equipment  a workforce reduction and other items 
the restructuring charge originally included the present value of future lease obligations for two facilities 
in the fourth quarter of  we made a lease termination payment to satisfy our remaining lease obligation with respect to one of the facilities 
the lease obligation for the second facility extends through march as a result of the long term nature of the remaining lease obligation  we will be recording a charge each period through the march termination date of the lease related to increases in the fair value of the lease obligations in accordance with the provisions of financial accounting standards board fasb statement no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities  which total approximately million at december  the cash impact in from restructuring related charges was million 
critical accounting policies and significant estimates the preparation of financial statements requires us to make estimates  assumptions and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates 
we base our estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form our basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from those estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements investments  revenue recognition  research and development costs  valuation of long lived assets  restructuring charges  and stock compensation 

table of contents investments 
we account for investments in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities 
we carry our investments at their respective fair values 
we periodically evaluate the fair values of our investments to determine whether any declines in the fair value of investments represent an other than temporary impairment 
this evaluation consists of a review of several factors  including the length of time and extent that a security has been in an unrealized loss position  the existence of an event that would impair the issuer s future repayment potential  the near term prospects for recovery of the market value of a security and our intent and ability to hold the security until the market values recover  which may be maturity 
if management determines that such an impairment exists  we would recognize an impairment charge 
because we may determine that market or business conditions may lead us to sell a short term investment or marketable security prior to maturity  we classify our short term investments and marketable securities as available for sale 
investments in securities that are classified as available for sale and have readily determinable fair values are measured at fair market value in the balance sheets  and unrealized holding gains and losses for these investments are reported as a separate component of stockholders equity until realized 
we classify those marketable securities that may be used in operations within one year as short term investments 
those marketable securities in which we have both the ability to hold until maturity and have a maturity date beyond one year from our most recent consolidated balance sheet date are classified as long term marketable securities 
revenue recognition 
revenues are recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  the price is fixed and determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured 
we have entered into various types of agreements for access to our information databases and use of our intellectual property 
revenues are deferred for fees received before earned or until no further obligations exist 
we exercise judgment in determining that collectibility is reasonably assured or that services have been delivered in accordance with the arrangement 
we assess whether the fee is fixed or determinable based on the payment terms associated with the transaction and whether the sales price is subject to refund or adjustment 
we assess collectibility based primarily on the customer s payment history and on the creditworthiness of the customer 
revenues from ongoing database agreements are recognized evenly over the access period 
revenues from licenses to our intellectual property are recognized when earned under the terms of the related agreements 
royalty revenues are recognized upon the sale of products or services to third parties by the licensee or other agreed upon terms 
we estimate royalty revenues based on previous period royalties received and information provided by the third party licensee 
we exercise judgment in determining whether the information provided by licensees is sufficiently reliable for us to base our royalty revenue recognition thereon 
under agreements involving multiple products  services and or rights to use assets  the multiple elements are divided into separate units of accounting when certain criteria are met  including whether the delivered items have stand alone value to the customer and whether there is objective and reliable evidence of the fair value of the undelivered items 
when separate units of accounting exist  consideration is allocated among the separate elements based on their respective fair values 
the determination of fair value of each element is based on objective evidence from historical sales of the individual elements by us to other customers 
if such evidence of fair value for each undelivered element of the arrangement does not exist  all revenue from the arrangement is deferred until such time that evidence of fair value for each undelivered element does exist or until all elements of the arrangement are delivered 
when elements are specifically tied to a separate earnings process  revenue is recognized when the specific performance obligation tied to the element is completed 
when revenues for an element are not specifically tied to a separate earnings process  they are recognized ratably over the term of the agreement 
in connection with our collaborative research and license agreement with pfizer  we received an upfront non refundable payment of million in january the million upfront fee was recorded as deferred revenue and was recognized on a straight line basis over two years  our estimated 
table of contents performance period under the agreement 
in february and october  pfizer purchased  for a total of million  a convertible subordinated note due and a convertible subordinated note due collectively  the pfizer notes 
as the pfizer notes are non interest bearing  they have been discounted to their net present value 
the difference between the cash received and the present value of the pfizer notes  plus the related beneficial conversion feature  totals million for each note  which represented additional consideration from pfizer under the agreement 
we have accounted for this additional consideration as deferred revenue and have recognized it over our estimated performance period under the agreement 
we recognized contract revenues for research services provided by our full time equivalents to pfizer in the periods in which the services were performed 
we received a million milestone payment from pfizer in the second quarter of all milestone payments will be recognized as revenue upon the achievement of the associated milestone 
research and development costs 
in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas  accounting for research and development costs  it is our policy to expense research and development costs as incurred 
we often contract with clinical research organizations cros to facilitate  coordinate and perform agreed upon research and development of a new drug 
to ensure that research and development costs are expensed as incurred  we record monthly accruals for clinical trials and preclinical testing costs based on the work performed under the contract 
these cro contracts typically call for the payment of fees for services at the initiation of the contract and or upon the achievement of certain clinical trial milestones 
in the event that we prepay cro fees  we record the prepayment as a prepaid asset and amortize the asset into research and development expense over the period of time the contracted research and development services are performed in accordance with eitf  accounting for nonrefundable advance payments for goods or services to be used in future research and development activities 
most professional fees  including project and clinical management  data management  monitoring  and medical writing fees are incurred throughout the contract period 
these professional fees are expensed based on their percentage of completion at a particular date 
our cro contracts generally include pass through fees 
pass through fees include  but are not limited to  regulatory expenses  investigator fees  travel costs  and other miscellaneous costs  including shipping and printing fees 
we expense the costs of pass through fees under our cro contracts as they are incurred  based on the best information available to us at the time 
the estimates of the pass through fees incurred are based on the amount of work completed for the clinical trial and are monitored through correspondence with the cros  internal reviews and a review of contractual terms 
the factors utilized to derive the estimates include the number of patients enrolled  duration of the clinical trial  estimated patient attrition  screening rate and length of the dosing regimen 
cro fees incurred to set up the clinical trial are expensed during the setup period 
valuation of long lived assets 
we assess the impairment of long lived assets  which includes property and equipment as well as intangible and other assets  whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
factors we consider important that could indicate the need for an impairment review include the following significant changes in the strategy of our overall business  significant underperformance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results  significant changes in the manner of use of the acquired assets  significant negative industry or economic trends  significant decline in our stock price for a sustained period  and our market capitalization relative to net book value 
when we determine that the carrying value of long lived assets may not be recoverable based upon the existence of one or more of the above indicators of impairment  in accordance with fasb statement 
table of contents no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets sfas  we perform an undiscounted cash flow analysis to determine if impairment exists 
if impairment exists  we measure the impairment based on the difference between the asset s carrying amount and its fair value 
restructuring charges 
costs associated with restructuring activities initiated after december   are accounted for in accordance with fasb statement no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities sfas 
costs associated with restructuring activities initiated prior to december  have been recorded in accordance with emerging issues task force eitf issue no 
 liability recognition for certain employee termination benefits and other costs to exit an activity including certain costs incurred in a restructuring eitf and staff accounting bulletin no 
 restructuring and impairment charges sab 
restructuring costs resulting from the acquisition of maxia pharmaceuticals  inc maxia have been recorded in accordance with eitf issue no 
 recognition of liabilities in connection with a purchase business combination eitf 
the restructuring charges are comprised primarily of costs to exit facilities  reduce our workforce  write off fixed assets  and pay for outside services incurred in the restructuring 
the workforce reduction charge is determined based on the estimated severance and fringe benefit charge for identified employees 
in calculating the cost to exit the facilities  we estimate for each location the amount to be paid in lease termination payments  the future lease and operating costs to be paid until the lease is terminated  the amount  if any  of sublease receipts and real estate broker fees 
this requires us to estimate the timing and costs of each lease to be terminated  the amount of operating costs  and the timing and rate at which we might be able to sublease the site 
to form our estimates for these costs  we perform an assessment of the affected facilities and consider the current market conditions for each site 
we also estimate our credit adjusted risk free interest rate in order to discount our projected lease payments in accordance with sfas estimates are also used in our calculation of the estimated realizable value on equipment that is being held for sale 
these estimates are formed based on recent history of sales of similar equipment and market conditions 
our assumptions on either the lease termination payments  operating costs until terminated  the offsetting sublease receipts and estimated realizable value of fixed assets held for sale may turn out to be incorrect and our actual cost may be materially different from our estimates 
our estimates of future liabilities may change  requiring us to record additional restructuring charges or reduce the amount of liabilities recorded 
at the end of each reporting period  we evaluate the remaining accrued balances to ensure their adequacy  that no excess accruals are retained and the utilization of the provisions are for their intended purposes in accordance with developed exit plans 
we periodically evaluate current available information and adjust our restructuring reserve as necessary 
we also make adjustments related to accrued professional fees to adjust estimated amounts to actual 
stock compensation 
effective january   we adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 
revised sfas r  share based payment  which revised statement of financial accounting standards sfas  accounting for stock based compensation 
sfas r requires all share based payment transactions with employees  including grants of employee stock options  to be recognized as compensation expense over the requisite service period based on their relative fair values 
sfas r requires significant judgment and the use of estimates  particularly surrounding black scholes assumptions such as stock price volatility and expected option lives  as well as expected option forfeiture rates  to value equity based compensation 
sfas r requires the recognition of the fair value of stock compensation in the statement of operations 
under the provisions of sfas r  we recorded million  million and million of stock compensation expense for the years ended december   and respectively

the increase in clinical research and outside services from to is due primarily from the growth and advancement of our clinical pipeline 
the decrease in occupancy and all other costs from to was primarily the result of decreased depreciation costs 
research and development expenses may fluctuate from period to period depending upon the stage of certain projects and the level of preclinical and clinical trial related activities 
many factors can affect the cost and timing of our clinical trials  including inconclusive results requiring additional clinical trials  slow patient enrollment  the need to enroll additional patient cohorts  adverse side effects among patients  the availability of supplies for our clinical trials and real or perceived lack of effectiveness or safety of our investigational drugs in our clinical trials 
in addition  the development of all of our product candidates will be subject to extensive governmental regulation 
these factors make it difficult for us to predict the timing and costs of the further development and approval of our products

apb requires that the liability and equity components of 
table of contents convertible debt instruments that may be settled in cash upon conversion including partial cash settlement be separately accounted for in a manner that reflects an issuer s nonconvertible debt borrowing rate 
fsp no 
apb is effective for us as of january  we do not expect the adoption of apb to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in june  the fasb issued eitf  determining whether an instrument or embedded feature is indexed to an entity s own stock eitf 
eitf provides guidance in assessing whether an equity linked financial instrument or embedded feature is indexed to an entity s own stock for purposes of determining whether the appropriate accounting treatment falls under the scope of sfas  accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities and or eitf  accounting for derivative financial instruments indexed to  and potentially settled in  a company s own stock 
eitf is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after december  and early application is not permitted

liquidity and capital resources in millions december cash  cash equivalents  and short term and long term marketable securities working capital year ended december cash provided by used in operating activities investing activities financing activities capital expenditures included in investing activities above sources and uses of cash 
due to our significant research and development expenditures  we have not been profitable and have generated operating losses since we were incorporated in through and in through as such  we have funded our research and development operations through sales of equity securities  the issuance of convertible notes  cash received from customers  and collaborative arrangements 
as of december   approximately million of marketable securities were classified as long term assets on the consolidated balance sheet as they had been in an unrealized loss position for longer than six months and we have the intent and ability to hold them until the carrying value recovers  which may be longer than one year 
at december   we had available cash  cash equivalents  and short term and long term marketable securities of million 
our cash and marketable securities balances are held in a variety of interest bearing instruments including money market accounts  obligations of us government agencies  high grade corporate bonds  and asset backed and mortgage backed securities 
available cash is invested in accordance with our investment policy s primary objectives of liquidity  safety of principal and diversity of investments 
recent distress in the financial markets has had an adverse impact on financial market activities including  among other things  extreme volatility in security prices  severely diminished liquidity and credit availability  rating downgrades of certain investments and declining valuations of others 
we have assessed the implications of these factors on our current business and determined that there had not been a significant impact to our financial position  results of operations or liquidity during cash used in operating activities 
the million increase in cash used in operating activities from to was due primarily to the increase in our net loss 
the million increase in cash used in operating activities from to was due primarily to the million nonrefundable upfront fee received from pfizer in january 
table of contents cash provided by investing activities 
our investing activities  other than purchases  sales and maturities of marketable securities  have consisted predominantly of capital expenditures and sales and purchases of long term investments 
in the future  net cash used by investing activities may fluctuate significantly from period to period due to the timing of strategic equity investments  acquisitions  including possible earn out payments to former maxia stockholders  capital expenditures and maturities sales and purchases of marketable securities 
cash provided by used in financing activities 
during  we received net proceeds of million from the issuance of common stock 
in addition  we received million of proceeds from issuance of common stock under our stock plans and employee stock purchase plan 
during  in connection with the collaborative research and license agreement  pfizer purchased a million pfizer note 
in addition  we received million of proceeds from issuance of common stock under our stock plans and employee stock purchase plan 
during  we issued a total of million of senior notes  which resulted in cash proceeds of approximately million 
in addition  we redeemed million of the notes during in connection with the collaborative research and license agreement  pfizer purchased a million pfizer note in february the following summarizes our significant contractual obligations as of december  and the effect those obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flow in future periods in millions total less than year years years over years contractual obligations principal on convertible subordinated debt principal on convertible senior debt interest on convertible subordinated debt interest on convertible senior debt non cancelable operating lease obligations related to current operations related to vacated space total contractual obligations the amounts and timing of payments related to vacated facilities may vary based on negotiated timing of lease terminations 
we have entered into sublease agreements for our vacated space with scheduled payments to us of million less than year and million years  these scheduled payments are not reflected in the above table 
the table above excludes certain commitments that are contingent upon future events 
the most significant of these contractual commitments that we consider to be contingent obligations are summarized below 
commitments related to our acquisition of maxia are considered contingent commitments as future events must occur to cause these commitments to be enforceable 
we completed our acquisition of maxia in february under the merger agreement  former maxia stockholders have the right to receive certain earn out amounts of up to a potential aggregate amount of million upon the occurrence of certain research and development milestones set forth in the merger agreement 
twenty percent of each earn out payment  if earned  will be paid in cash and the remaining eighty percent will be paid in shares of our common stock such that an aggregate of million in cash and million in our common stock based upon the then fair value could potentially be paid pursuant to the earn out milestones 
the milestones are set to occur as maxia products enter various stages of human clinical trials and may be earned at any time prior to the tenth anniversary of the consummation of the merger 
in any event  no more than  shares of our common stock may be issued to former maxia stockholders in the aggregate pursuant to the merger agreement 
none of these milestones has been achieved as of december  
table of contents we have entered into and may in the future seek to license additional rights relating to technologies in connection with our drug discovery and development programs 
under these licenses  we may be required to pay up front fees  milestone payments  and royalties on sales of future products 
we believe that our cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities will be adequate to satisfy our capital needs for at least the next twelve months 
our cash requirements depend on numerous factors  including our expenditures in connection with potential repayments of our senior notes  convertible subordinated notes due  and the pfizer notes  expenditures in connection with our drug discovery and development programs  expenditures in connection with litigation or other legal proceedings  competing technological and market developments  the cost of filing  prosecuting  defending and enforcing patent claims and other intellectual property rights  our receipt of any milestone or other payments under any collaborative agreements we may enter into  including the agreement with pfizer  and expenditures in connection with alliances and license agreements 
changes in our research and development plans or other changes affecting our operating expenses may result in changes in the timing and amount of expenditures of our capital resources 
we expect that future revenues generated from information products  including licensing of intellectual property  will continue to decline as we focus on drug discovery and development programs  and in  will not represent a significant source of cash inflow for us 
we intend to continue to evaluate options to repurchase or refinance our outstanding convertible notes that mature in february repurchases might occur through cash purchases and or exchanges for other securities in open market transactions  privately negotiated transactions or otherwise 
such repurchases or exchanges  if any  will depend on prevailing market conditions  our liquidity requirements  contractual restrictions and other factors 
the amounts involved in any such transactions  individually or in the aggregate  may be material 
any issuance of equity securities in exchange for our outstanding convertible notes may be dilutive to our stockholders 
until we can generate a sufficient amount of product revenues to finance our cash requirements  which we may never do  we expect to finance future cash needs primarily through public or private equity offerings  debt financings  borrowings or strategic collaborations 
the sale of equity or additional convertible debt securities in the future may be dilutive to our stockholders  and may provide for rights  preferences or privileges senior to those of our holders of common stock 
debt financing arrangements may require us to pledge certain assets or enter into covenants that could restrict our operations or our ability to incur further indebtedness 
we do not know whether additional funding will be available on acceptable terms  if at all 
recently  the credit markets and the financial services industry have been experiencing a period of unprecedented turmoil and upheaval characterized by the bankruptcy  failure  collapse or sale of various financial institutions and an unprecedented level of intervention from the united states federal government 
these events have generally made equity and debt financing difficult to obtain 
if we are not able to secure additional funding when needed  we may have to scale back our operations  delay or eliminate one or more of our research or development programs  or attempt to obtain funds by entering into an agreement with a collaborative partner that would result in terms that are not favorable to us or relinquishing our rights in certain of our proprietary technologies or drug candidates 
off balance sheet arrangements we have no material off balance sheet arrangements other than those that are discussed under contractual obligations 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our investments in marketable securities  which are composed primarily of investment grade corporate bonds  us government agency debt securities  mortgage and asset backed securities and money market funds  are subject to default  changes in credit rating and changes in market value 
these investments are also subject to interest rate risk and will decrease in value if market rate interest rates increase 
as of december   cash  cash equivalents and short term and long term marketable securities were million 
due to the nature of these investments  if market interest rates were to increase immediately and uniformly by from levels as of december  the decline in fair value would not be material
