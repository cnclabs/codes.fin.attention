item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
overview and strategic plan founded in  modine manufacturing company is a worldwide leader in thermal management systems and components  bringing heating and cooling technology and solutions to diversified global markets 
we operate on five continents  in countries  with approximately  employees worldwide 
our products are in automobiles  light  medium and heavy duty vehicles  commercial heating  ventilation and air conditioning hvac equipment  refrigeration systems  off highway and industrial equipment  and fuel cell applications 
our broad product offerings include heat transfer modules and packages  radiators  oil coolers  charge air coolers  vehicular air conditioning  building hvac equipment  and exhaust gas recirculation egr coolers 

table of contents consolidated strategy our goal is to grow profitably as a leading global provider of thermal management technology to a broad range of niche highway  off highway and industrial end markets 
we expect to achieve this goal over the long term through both organic growth and through selective acquisitions 
in order to reach our goal  our strategy is diversification by geography and by end market 
we focus on development of new products and technologies for diverse end markets  a rigorous strategic planning and corporate development process  and operational and financial discipline for improved profitability and long term stability 
development of new products and technologies for increasingly diverse end markets our heritage and a current competitive strength is our ability to develop new products and technologies for current and potential customers and for new  emerging markets 
we own three global  state of the art technology centers  dedicated to the development and testing of products and technologies 
the centers are located in racine  wisconsin in the us  in bonlanden  germany  and in asan city  south korea which is currently held for sale 
our reputation for providing quality products and technologies has been a company strength valued by customers  and has led to a history with few product warranty issues 
in fiscal we spent million representing approximately percent of sg a expenses on our product and technology research and development efforts 
we continue to benefit from relationships with customers who recognize the value of having us participate directly in product design  development and validation 
this has resulted and should continue to result in strong  longer term customer relationships with companies that value partnerships with their suppliers 
in the past several years  our product lines have been under price pressure from increased global competition  primarily from asia and other low cost areas 
at the same time  many of our products containing higher technology have helped us better manage demands from customers for lower prices 
many of our technologies are proprietary  difficult to replicate and are patent protected 
we have been granted and or acquired approximately  patents on our technologies over the life of the company and work diligently to protect our intellectual property 
strategic planning and corporate development we employ both a short term and longer term three to five year strategic planning process enabling us to continually assess our opportunities  competitive threats  and economic market challenges 
we focus on strengthening our competitive position through strategic  global business development activities 
we continuously look for and take advantage of opportunities to advance our position as a global leader  both by expanding our geographic footprint and by expanding into new end markets all with a focus on thermal management technologies 
this process allows us to identify product gaps in the marketplace  develop new products and make additional investments to fill those gaps 
an example of our success from this process has been our expansion activities into niche hvac and refrigeration markets in our commercial products segment 
operational and financial discipline we operate in an increasingly competitive global marketplace  therefore  we must manage our business with a disciplined focus on increasing productivity and reducing waste 
we historically operated with a small plant philosophy prior to our recent repositioning activities  but the competitiveness of the global market place requires us to move toward a greater manufacturing scale in order to create a more competitive cost base 
as costs for materials and purchased parts rise from time to time due to global increases in the metals commodity markets  we seek low cost country sourcing when appropriate and enter into contracts with some of our customers which provide for these rising costs to be passed through to them on a lag basis 
in addition  we have utilized futures contracts from time to time related to various forecasted commodity purchases to reduce our exposure to changes in these commodity prices 
we follow a rigorous financial process for investment and returns  intended to enable increased profitability and cash flows over the long term with particular emphasis on working capital improvement and prioritization of capital for investment and disposals driving past and current improvement in global cash and debt management and access to sufficient credit 
this focus helps us identify and take action on underperforming assets in our portfolio  such as our electronics cooling business  which was sold during fiscal our executive management incentive compensation in fiscal is based on working capital and gross margin improvement that drives our singular focus for alignment with shareholders interests when it comes to our capital allocation and asset management decisions 
in addition  we maintain a long term incentive compensation plan for officers and certain key employees which is used to attract  retain and motivate key employees who directly impact the performance of the company over a time frame greater than a year 
this plan is comprised of stock options  retention restricted stock awards and performance stock awards which are based on a mix of earnings per share growth and growth in our stock price relative to the market 

table of contents consolidated market conditions and trends fiscal sales volumes declined significantly as a result of the weakening global economy 
the instability in the global financial and economic markets has created a significant downturn in our vehicular markets 
the original equipment manufacturer oem market place which we serve is extremely competitive and our customers are demanding that we continue to provide high quality products in combination with annual price decreases 
at the same time  we experience from time to time increases in the costs of our purchased parts and raw materials particularly aluminum  copper  steel  and stainless steel nickel 
the combination of these factors impacts our profitability 
in some cases  material increases are subject to pass through to some of our customers on a lag basis 
this lag period can average up to a year  based on the agreements we have with an individual customer 
in addition to our negotiations to pass material costs on to our customers  our strategy to mitigate growing cost pressures is to accelerate new product development and geographic expansion into new and existing niche markets 
we continue to focus on developing new and expanded proprietary technology that is of more value in the marketplace such as our next generation aluminum radiators and egr coolers 
our response to current market conditions in response to the near term conditions facing the company  we have implemented the following strategies to mitigate the effects these pressures have on our margins and our goals for profitable growth and return targets o manufacturing realignment 
during fiscal  we announced the closure of four manufacturing facilities in the us during fiscal  we announced the closure of three additional manufacturing facilities in the us camdenton  missouri  pemberville  ohio  and logansport  indiana  and our t bingen  germany manufacturing facility 
we also have invested in four new plants in low cost countries changzhou  china  nuevo laredo  mexico  gy ngy s  hungary  and chennai  india 
during fiscal  we implemented a significant reduction of direct costs in our manufacturing facilities and percent reduction of indirect costs in our manufacturing facilities 
when the manufacturing realignment process is completed  we will compete for new business from a much improved cost competitive position with increased asset utilization 
this process should benefit the company at both the gross and operating margin level and help us win incremental profitable business 
o portfolio rationalization 
during fiscal  we announced the establishment of globally focused product groups of engine products  powertrain cooling products  and passenger thermal management products which support our regional segments of original equipment asia  original equipment europe  original equipment north america  and south america 
the company is assessing its product lines globally and its regional businesses in order to assess the competitive position and attractiveness of these products and businesses 
the goal of this process is to identify products or businesses which should be divested or exited as they do not meet required financial metrics 
an example of this portfolio rationalization process is the may  sale of our electronics cooling business for million 
during fiscal  we implemented an action plan to phase out of automotive powertrain cooling ptc within north america and module automotive ptc within europe 
we also announced the intended divestiture of our south korean hvac business 
o capital allocation 
our business is capital intensive  requiring a significant amount of investment in the new technologies and products which the company supports 
we recently introduced an enhanced capital allocation process designed to allocate capital spending to the segments and programs that will provide the highest return on our investment 
all business units are measured using specific performance standards and they must earn the right to obtain capital to fund growth through their performance 
during fiscal  our capital expenditures will be limited to million  which is significantly below our recent historical rates 
o selling  general and administrative cost containment 
the company has a target of reducing its overall sg a  and has implemented an initiative to streamline key business processes within its administrative functions 
during fiscal  we completed a global workforce reduction focusing on the realignment of our corporate and regional headquarters 
sg a costs decreased million  or percent  during fiscal through our sg a cost containment initiatives 

table of contents segment information strategy  market conditions and trends each of our business segments is managed at the regional vice president or managing director level and has separate financial results reviewed by our chief operating decision makers 
these results are used in evaluating the performance of each business segment  and in making decisions on the allocation of resources among our various businesses 
our chief operating decision makers evaluate segment performance with an emphasis on gross margin  and secondarily based on operating income of each segment  which includes certain allocations of corporate sg a expenses 
original equipment europe percent of fiscal revenues our european operation is primarily engaged in providing powertrain and engine cooling systems as well as vehicular climate control components to various end markets  including automotive  heavy duty and industrial  commercial vehicle  bus and off highway oems 
these systems include cooling modules  radiators  charge air coolers  oil cooling products  egr products  retarder and transmission cooling components  and hvac condensers 
competitors include behr gmbh co 
ag  valeo  titanx  denso corporation  akg  and a variety of other companies 
while the first half of fiscal represented a continuation of the positive performance from fiscal  the second half of the fiscal year was heavily impacted by the rapidly shrinking vehicular markets in europe 
among all the markets served  the commercial vehicle market was hit the hardest 
to offset these adverse market conditions  management has enacted several measures to cut operating costs and improve cash generation 
plant direct and indirect headcount as well as overall sg a costs have been adjusted  enabled by the portfolio rationalization and the phase out of certain product lines 
the overall headcount reduction achieved in the region is expected to approximate percent by mid fiscal in addition  management has taken and is taking further steps to increase revenue by renegotiating certain aspects of current and future customer agreements such as terms and conditions  serial and service pricing and prorating of tooling and capital investment 
further marked steps have been or are being taken to generate cashflow from reduction of working capital beyond those related to volume declines 
we continue our focus on various lean manufacturing initiatives  low cost country sourcing as well as the adjustment of our manufacturing footprint 
our new hungarian facility has become operational and started shipments in october the phase out of our facility in t bingen  germany is substantially complete 
we expect our european business to benefit from the output of our technology initiatives  which will contribute to establishing technological differentiation in the market place and thus provide leverage for new customer agreements 
the business currently benefits from more stable energy and material prices  although these benefits are typically offset by material pass through agreements on a time lag 
at the same time  we expect to continue to see price reduction demands from our customers along with continuous and ongoing increased customer service expectations and competition from low cost countries 
the business has been successful in winning additional program awards that are scheduled to begin production in the time frame 
going forward  we expect to see further opportunities in connection with the potential for competitors leaving the market 
original equipment north america percent of fiscal revenues our original equipment north america segment includes products and technologies that are found on vehicles made by commercial vehicle oems  including class trucks  school buses  transit buses  motor homes and motor coaches 
it also serves the automotive  heavy duty  and industrial markets  including agricultural  construction and industrial markets  eg lift trucks  compressors and power generation 
the majority of our north american business is derived from commercial vehicle customers 
the environmental protection agency emissions mandates january  and the upcoming january  create cyclicality in the class heavy truck commercial vehicle build rates due to pre buy activity which occurs prior to these emission law changes 
the expected cyclical downturn in this market after the january  emissions law change has been adversely impacted by the current economic concerns credit crisis  high oil and diesel prices  and depressed housing market which have reduced the demand for class trucks used to haul freight 
as a result  we currently do not anticipate any substantial pre buy activity prior to the january  emissions law change 
while the january  emissions change and economic concerns created a downturn in build rates  the change did provide an opportunity for us as more of our components are required to be included on each new vehicle to meet the new standards 

table of contents our north american automotive business includes certain programs with general motors corporation and chrysler llc 
the global recession has had a dramatic impact on these customers  which has led to their recent chapter bankruptcy filings 
our north american automotive presence is limited to a few select programs  and our exposure to this market is relatively insignificant 
as a result  we do not have a material receivable balance at risk with either general motors corporation or chrysler llc 
our projections for fiscal include an anticipated two month shut down delay for our programs with general motors corporation and chrysler llc 
a positive trend in our north american heavy duty and industrial businesses is increased emission standards for agricultural and construction equipment  which is driving increased demand for our components such as egr coolers 
the overall strategy for this business segment includes the following components first  our strategy is to reposition the segment  including reassessing our manufacturing footprint  improving sourcing of raw materials and purchased parts  and other programs intended to increase efficiency and right size capacity 
during fiscal  we announced the closure of three north american manufacturing facilities within this segment  consolidating the business into other existing locations 
these closures are expected to be completed by the end of fiscal in addition  we are beginning to manufacture products in our recently completed nuevo laredo  mexico facility 
second  we are focused on reducing lead times to bring new products to market and offering a wider product breadth  while at the same time rationalizing the existing product lines that do not meet required financial metrics 
third  we are focused on pursuing only selected new business opportunities that meet our minimum targeted rates of return which will enable profitable growth to the company 
commercial products percent of fiscal revenues our commercial products business provides a variety of niche products in north america  europe  asia and south africa that are used by engineers  contractors and building owners in applications such as warehouses  repair garages  greenhouses  residential garages  schools  computer rooms  manufacturing facilities  banks  pharmaceutical companies  stadiums and retail stores 
we manufacture coils copper tube aluminum fin coils  stainless steel tube aluminum fin coils and all aluminum microchannel coils for heating  refrigeration  air conditioning and vehicular applications 
we also manufacture heating products for commercial applications  including gas  electric  oil and hydronic unit heaters  low intensity infrared and large roof mounted direct and indirect fired makeup air units 
our cooling products for commercial applications include single packaged vertical units and unit ventilators used in school room applications  computer room air conditioning units  air and water cooled chillers  ceiling cassettes  and roof top cooling units used in a variety of commercial building applications 
revenues have decreased due to reduced market demand  primarily in north america 
margins in this business have improved primarily from improved manufacturing efficiencies and reduced sg a expenses 
economic conditions  such as demand for new commercial construction and school renovations  are drivers of demand for the heating and cooling products 
south america percent of fiscal revenues our south america segment provides heat exchanger products to a variety of markets in the domestic brazilian market as well as for export to north america and europe 
this business provides products to the on highway commercial vehicle markets  off highway markets including construction and agricultural applications  automotive oems and industrial applications  primarily for power generation systems 
this business also provides products to the brazilian  north american and european aftermarkets for both automotive and commercial applications 
we manufacture radiators  charge air coolers  oil coolers  auxiliary coolers transmission  hydraulic  and power steering  engine cooling modules and hvac system modules 

table of contents the brazilian agriculture and commercial vehicle markets have remained relatively strong despite the global economic downturn 
in addition  the aftermarket sales under the radiadores visconde brand have continued to improve 
we recently made capital investments in bar plate technology for our brazilian operations that will continue to help fuel growth in the region as well as support operations in north america and europe 
original equipment asia percent of fiscal revenues our asian operation is primarily engaged in providing powertrain cooling systems and engine products to various industrial end markets  with the greatest percentage for commercial light truck applications 
these products are sold primarily to south korean oems who export a significant portion of vehicles to other countries 
our largest customers are hyundai motor company and kia motors corporation 
competitors include korens  behr gmbh  tata toyo  akg  t 
radco  zhenjiang yinlin machinery co  and others 
a significant trend in our asian business is our customers emphasis on lower price over better technology  evidenced by significant price reduction demands from hyundai motor and kia motors  two of our key customers 
the substantial depreciation of the korean won has intensified pricing pressure on the engine and off highway business within korea 
this has enhanced local korean suppliers ability to compete with us directly on pricing 
this pricing environment requires a low cost manufacturing profile and continued operating efficiencies in order to maintain a profitable business environment 
many components that we have supplied in this region are becoming part of a module  which increases the amount of our content on an engine 
our strategy in this business segment is to control and reduce costs  secure new business  further diversify our product offering and customer base  and continue to focus on building manufacturing capabilities in china and india to serve the region  including korea  within the engine and ptc segments in a more cost competitive manner 
construction is completed on our new manufacturing facilities in chennai  india  and changzhou  china 
we are currently shipping low volumes of production from these locations 
several new products are scheduled to begin production from both of these new facilities over the next fiscal year 
fuel cell percent of fiscal revenues our fuel cell business supports the highly complex thermal management needs of fuel cell systems which increasingly are viewed as alternatives to oil based fuel 
these fuel cell systems are used in stationary power applications  micro chp combined heat and power  vehicle engine applications  and hydrogen fuel processing 
although the market for fuel cell based systems is still in its relative infancy  in the past year we entered into our first licensing agreement with respect to solid oxide fuel cell technology and have begun developing products in support of the micro chp market 
in october  we entered into an agreement with bloom energy to license our thermal management technology 
in addition to licensing this technology to bloom energy  we also are providing certain transitional services to bloom energy  including the sale of products  through december with respect to the micro chp market  fuel cell based systems are expected to emerge  initially in europe  over the next several years as a direct replacement for the small boilers found in homes using hydronic heating systems 
in addition to efficient production of hot water for heat  the device is designed to produce electricity to supplement the electrical needs of the home  with off peak electricity sold back to the grid 
we are continuing to work with ceres power  a uk based developer of these systems  to expand the company s presence in this residential market 
outlook the global recession has had an adverse impact on our sales volumes in fiscal  and this trend is expected to continue into fiscal currently  our expectation for fiscal includes relatively flat volume assumptions for continuing programs when compared with the fourth quarter of fiscal  which included sales revenues of million  down percent from the fourth quarter of fiscal however  our results in fiscal are expected to be positively impacted by new program launches globally  including several egr launches in our joplin  missouri facility in support of the january  emissions law change in the us 
table of contents while sales volumes are expected to remain depressed in fiscal  we will continue to take further actions to reduce our manufacturing and sg a costs in response to the reduced volume levels 
in addition  we will continue our focus on improving cash flow and liquidity through working capital management  reduced capital expenditures and divestiture of non strategic assets  including our south korean based hvac business 
we believe that through these cost reduction and cash management activities  we will maintain adequate liquidity  remain in compliance with our debt covenants  and sufficiently manage the business through the global recession 
consolidated results of operations continuing operations fiscal sales volumes declined significantly as a result of the weakening global economy 
the instability in the global financial and economic markets has created a significant downturn in the company s vehicular markets 
the company recorded goodwill and long lived asset impairment charges during the fiscal year along with restructuring charges primarily related to workforce reductions 
prior to april  the majority of our subsidiaries outside the united states reported operating results with a one month lag 
this reporting lag was eliminated during the first quarter of fiscal the fiscal and information was revised to reflect this change for comparability 
the following table presents consolidated results from continuing operations on a comparative basis for the years ended march   and years ended march dollars in millions s of sales s of sales s of sales net sales cost of sales gross profit selling  general and administrative expenses restructuring charges impairment of goodwill and long lived assets loss income from operations interest expense other expense income net loss earnings from continuing operations before income taxes provision for income taxes loss earnings from continuing operations year ended march  compared to year ended march  net sales decreased million  or percent  to billion in fiscal from billion in fiscal driven by overall sales volume deterioration as a result of the weakening global economy 
automotive and medium heavy duty truck sales are down approximately percent and percent  respectively  within the original equipment europe segment 
gross profit decreased million  or percent  to million in fiscal from million in fiscal gross margin decreased from percent in fiscal to percent in fiscal this decrease is primarily related to underabsorption of fixed costs in our manufacturing facilities based on the depressed sales volumes and a shift in our product mix toward lower margin products in europe 
lower material costs and a reduction of direct and indirect manufacturing costs in our facilities  comprised of workforce reductions and other indirect cost reduction activities  partially offset this decrease 

table of contents sg a expenses decreased million  or percent  to million in fiscal from million in fiscal  but increased as a percentage of sales from percent to percent 
the overall reduction of sg a is due to the positive impact of our sg a containment efforts 
these were partially offset by a million increase in repositioning costs included in sg a as the company realigns the corporate and regional headquarters 
restructuring charges increased million primarily related to a workforce reduction at the corporate headquarters in racine  wisconsin and throughout the european facilities including the european headquarters in bonlanden  germany 
during fiscal  asset impairment charges of million were recorded including a goodwill impairment charge of million in the original equipment europe segment  a long lived asset impairment charge of million recorded in the original equipment north america segment  and a long lived asset impairment charge of million recorded in the original equipment europe segment 
the decrease in gross profit combined with the restructuring and impairment charges contributed to the million decrease in operating income from fiscal to fiscal interest expense increased million from fiscal to fiscal related to an increase in outstanding debt during the year and an increase in interest rates in conjunction with the amendment of our primary debt agreements in february borrowings increased during fiscal to finance capital expenditures of million 
the provision for income taxes decreased million  or percent  to million in fiscal from million in fiscal the decrease in the provision for income taxes was due to overall losses in tax jurisdictions outside of the us as compared with earnings recorded in fiscal a valuation allowance of million was recorded against net deferred tax assets in tax jurisdictions where it was more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
year ended march  compared to year ended march  net sales increased million  or percent  to billion in fiscal from billion in fiscal the increase in revenues was a combination of favorable impact of changing foreign currency exchange rates and organic growth 
revenues were driven by strong volumes in the original equipment europe  south america and commercial products segments  which were offset by declines in the original equipment north america segment primarily in the truck market following the january  emissions law change 
gross profit decreased million  or percent  to million in fiscal from million in fiscal in addition  gross margin decreased from percent in fiscal to percent in fiscal the decrease in gross profit and gross margin was primarily driven by the impact of the decrease in north american truck volumes  manufacturing inefficiencies experienced as part of plant closures and consolidations  and pricing pressures from customers 
in addition  repositioning costs of million were recorded in gross profit during fiscal  as the company continued to reposition its global manufacturing footprint 
sg a expenses increased million  or percent  to million in fiscal from million in fiscal  but decreased as a percentage of sales to percent from percent 
the net increase in sg a was primarily due to ongoing expansion in the original equipment asia segment 
restructuring charges were consistent from fiscal to fiscal  and related primarily to severance costs incurred under our announced restructuring plans 
during fiscal  asset impairment charges of million were recorded including a goodwill impairment charge of million in the original equipment north america segment  a long lived asset impairment charge of million recorded in the original equipment north america segment  a long lived asset impairment charge of million recorded in the original equipment europe segment  and a long lived asset impairment charge of million recorded in the commercial products segment 
the decrease in gross profit combined with the impairment charges contributed to the million decrease in operating income from fiscal to fiscal interest expense increased million from fiscal to fiscal related to an increase in outstanding debt during the year 
borrowings increased during fiscal to finance capital expenditures of million and an increase in working capital 
the provision for income taxes increased million  or percent  to million in fiscal from million in fiscal the increase in the provision for income taxes was due to a valuation allowance of million recorded against net deferred tax assets in the us tax jurisdiction 
due to the then current market conditions and projections of operating results in these tax jurisdictions  the company determined that it was more likely than not that the us deferred tax assets would not be realized 
the effective income tax rate differed from the us statutory income tax rate of percent primarily due to the impact of the valuation allowance recorded during the year 

table of contents discontinued operations during fiscal  the company announced the intended divestiture of the south korea based hvac business 
the company has obtained approval from the board of directors to sell the business and is actively marketing it to interested parties 
the sale is intended to be completed within the next fiscal year and has been presented as held for sale and as a discontinued operation in the consolidated financial statements for all periods presented 
on may   the company announced it would explore strategic alternatives for its electronics cooling business and presented it as held for sale and as a discontinued operation in the consolidated financial statements for all periods presented

during fiscal  net sales decreased million  or percent  primarily on a million decline in underlying vehicular sales volumes  partially offset by an million favorable impact of foreign currency exchange rate changes 
the decline in gross margin from fiscal to fiscal was due to a change in mix of sales toward lower margin products  as well as customer price reductions which we were not entirely able to offset with purchasing savings and performance improvements in our manufacturing facilities 
the decrease in gross margin from fiscal to fiscal was largely related to the underabsorption of fixed manufacturing costs with the declining sales volumes and changing mix of products toward lower margin business 
repositioning costs of million were included in cost of sales related to the closure of the t bingen  germany facility 
sg a expenses were consistent over the past three years yet fluctuated as a percentage of sales 
restructuring charges of million were recorded as the result of a reduction in workforce throughout the european facilities including at the european headquarters in bonlanden  germany 
an impairment charge of million was recorded in fiscal at the t bingen  germany manufacturing facility in conjunction with the announced closure of this facility 
a goodwill impairment charge of million was recorded in fiscal which represents an impairment of the full amount of goodwill recorded within the segment 
this impairment is based on a declining outlook for the segment which is the result of declining sales volumes and lower gross margin related to the underabsorption of fixed manufacturing costs and the change in product mix

during fiscal  the company reported cash flows from operating activities of million  which is million greater than the million reported in the prior year 
while operating results decreased year over year  these decreases were more than offset by the improvement in our working capital balances 
the most significant working capital improvement was in accounts receivable with days sales outstanding improving days to days through the active  customer supported management of accounts receivable payment terms 
outstanding indebtedness increased million to million at march  from the march  balance of million 
operating cash flows were not sufficient to fully fund capital expenditures during fiscal requiring an increase in outstanding indebtedness 
meanwhile  our cash balances increased million from million at march  to million at march we have million available for future borrowings under the revolving credit facility 
in addition to this revolving credit facility  unused lines of credit also exist in europe and brazil totaling million at march  in the aggregate  total available lines of credit of million exist at march  on may   modine holding gmbh and modine europe gmbh  each a subsidiary of the company  entered into a million euro million us equivalent credit facility agreement 
under the terms of our us revolving credit facility  the availability under this facility has been reduced by million upon entering into the new foreign credit facility 
the availability of these funds is subject to our ability to remain in compliance with the financial covenants and limitations in our respective debt agreements 
we believe that our internally generated operating cash flows  working capital management efforts  asset disposition opportunities and existing cash balances  together with access to available external borrowings  will be sufficient to satisfy future operating costs and capital expenditures 
debt covenants our debt agreements required us to maintain specified financial ratios and placed certain limitations on dividend payments and the repurchase of our common stock 
at december   we were in violation of our quarterly interest expense coverage and leverage ratio covenants which constituted defaults under the debt agreements 
on february   we entered into a waiver and amendment with our primary lenders and note holders which waived these defaults which existed at december  and amended our covenants as further discussed below 
under the amended debt agreements  we granted a security interest in certain assets  accepted other restrictive covenants  and agreed to pay higher interest costs 
the existing quarterly interest expense coverage and leverage ratios were temporarily replaced with minimum adjusted ebitda levels 
adjusted ebitda is defined as our loss earnings from continuing operations before interest expense and provision for income taxes  adjusted to exclude unusual  non recurring or extraordinary non cash charges and million of cash restructuring and repositioning charges  and further adjusted to add back depreciation and amortization expense 
adjusted ebitda does not represent  and should not be considered  an alternative to loss earnings from continuing operations as determined by generally accepted accounting principles gaap  and our calculation may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies 

table of contents the following presents the minimum adjusted ebitda level requirements which we are required to comply with beginning in the fourth quarter of fiscal for the quarter ended march  million for the two consecutive quarters ended june  million for the three consecutive quarters ended september  million for the four consecutive quarters ended december  million for the four consecutive quarters ended march  million our adjusted ebitda for the quarter ended march  was million which exceeded the minimum adjusted ebitda requirement by million 
the following table presents a calculation of adjusted ebitda dollars in thousands quarter ended march  loss from continuing operations consolidated interest expense provision for income taxes depreciation and amortization expense a non cash charges b restructuring and repositioning charges c adjusted ebitda a depreciation and amortization expense represents total depreciation and amortization from continuing operations less accelerated depreciation which has been included in non cash charges described in footnote b below 
b non cash charges are comprised of long lived asset impairments  non cash restructuring and repositioning charges  exchange gains or losses on intercompany loans and non cash charges which are unusual  non recurring or extraordinary  as follows dollars in thousands long lived asset impairments non cash restructuring and repositioning charges exchange losses on intercompany loans provision for uncollectible notes receivable supplemental executive retirement plan settlement non cash charges c restructuring and repositioning charges represent cash restructuring and repositioning costs incurred in conjunction with the restructuring activities announced on or after january  see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion on these activities 
in addition to the minimum adjusted ebitda covenant  we are not permitted to incur capital expenditures greater than million for the fourth quarter of fiscal  greater than million for fiscal year  and greater than million for all fiscal years thereafter 
we were in compliance with the capital expenditure limitation in the fourth quarter of fiscal  and expect to remain in compliance with this covenant in fiscal and beyond 

table of contents the interest expense coverage and leverage ratio covenants will become effective during the fourth quarter of fiscal based on the following ratios interest expense coverage leverage ratio ratio covenant not covenant not permitted permitted to be less than to be greater than fiscal quarter ending march  to to fiscal quarter ending june  to to fiscal quarter ending september  to to fiscal quarter ending december  to to fiscal quarters ending march  and june  to to all fiscal quarters ending thereafter to to we expect to remain in compliance with the minimum adjusted ebitda levels through the third quarter of fiscal as the million of excess adjusted ebitda reported in the fourth quarter of fiscal will positively impact the next three quarters based on the cumulative nature of this covenant 
we are closely monitoring our expected ability to remain in compliance with the minimum adjusted ebitda covenant  interest expense coverage ratio covenant and leverage ratio covenant in the fourth quarter of fiscal based on the sensitivity of these covenants to changes in our future financial results 
the economic downturn has made it difficult to project our future financial results based on uncertainty around the extent and timing of the global recession 
in contemplation of this uncertainty  we are closely monitoring our actual monthly results and projected results for fiscal and have identified potential action items under the four point recovery plan which we will implement  if needed  to remain in compliance with the financial covenants 
we expect to remain in compliance with the minimum adjusted ebitda covenant  interest expense coverage ratio covenant and leverage ratio covenant in the fourth quarter of fiscal based on our projected financial results for fiscal and the additional action items available to us 
if we are unable to meet these covenants  our ability to access available lines of credit could be limited  our liquidity could be adversely affected and our debt obligations could be accelerated 
these circumstances could have a material adverse effect on our future results of operations  financial position and liquidity

research and development we focus our research and development r d efforts on solutions that meet the most current and pressing heat transfer needs of original equipment manufacturers and other customers within the commercial vehicle  construction  agricultural and commercial hvac industries and  more selectively  within the automotive industry 
our products and systems typically are aimed at solving difficult and complex heat transfer challenges requiring advanced thermal management 
the typical demands are for products and systems that are lighter weight  more compact  more efficient and more durable in nature to meet ever increasing customer standards as customers work to ensure compliance with increasingly stringent global emissions requirements 
our company s heritage provides a depth and breadth of expertise in thermal management which  combined with our global manufacturing presence  standardized processes  and state of the art technical centers and wind tunnels  enables us to rapidly bring customized solutions to customers at the best value 
our investment in r d in fiscal was million  or percent of sales  compared to million  or percent of sales  in fiscal this level of investment reflects the company s continued commitment to r d in an ever changing market  balanced with a near term focus on preserving cash and liquidity through more selective capital investment in order to weather the current global recession 
consistent with the streamlining in late fiscal of the company s product portfolio  our current research is focused primarily on company sponsored development in the areas of powertrain cooling  engine products and commercial products 
recent r d projects have included waste heat recovery systems developed for a major us based engine manufacturer in conjunction with the us department of energy to help engine and truck manufacturers meet ever increasing demands for emissions reduction  while simultaneously improving powertrain efficiency and  thus  fuel economy  next generation aluminum radiators for the commercial vehicle  agricultural and constructions markets  and egr technology  which enables our customers to efficiently meet tighter regulatory emissions standards 
through our proactive r d  we are developing new technologies designed to keep our customers within federal and international guidelines and regulations well into the future 
in late fiscal  we also formed an advance solutions research team which is focused on identifying external research projects which complement strategic internal research initiatives and can be supported by either government or customer funding in order to further leverage the company s significant thermal technology expertise and capability 
modine has been granted more than  worldwide patents over the life of the company 
modine is focused on the long term commercialization of our intellectual property and research  and believes that these investments will result in new and next generation products and technologies 
critical accounting policies the following critical accounting policies reflect the more significant judgments and estimates used in preparing the financial statements 
application of these policies results in accounting estimates that have the greatest potential for a significant impact on modine s financial statements 
the following discussion of these judgments and estimates is intended to supplement the summary of significant accounting policies presented in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 

table of contents revenue recognition the company recognizes revenue  including agreed upon commodity price increases  as products are shipped to customers and the risks and rewards of ownership are transferred to our customers 
the revenue is recorded net of applicable provisions for sales rebates  volume incentives  and returns and allowances 
at the time of revenue recognition  the company also provides an estimate of potential bad debts and warranty expense 
the company bases these estimates on historical experience  current business trends and current economic conditions 
the company recognizes revenue from various licensing agreements when earned except in those cases where collection is uncertain  or the amount cannot reasonably be estimated until formal accounting reports are received from the licensee 
contractual commodity price increases may also be included in revenue 
price increases agreed upon in advance are recognized as revenue when the products are shipped to our customers 
in certain situations  the price increases are recognized as revenue at the time products are shipped in accordance with the contractual arrangements with our customers  but are offset by appropriate provisions for estimated commodity price increases which may ultimately not be collected 
these provisions are established based on historical experience  current business trends and current economic conditions 
there was no provision for estimated commodity price increases at march  and impairment of long lived and amortized intangible assets the company performs impairment evaluations of its long lived assets  including property  plant and equipment  intangible assets with finite lives and equity investments  whenever business conditions or events indicate that those assets may be impaired 
the company considers factors such as operating losses  declining outlooks and market capitalization when evaluating the necessity for an impairment analysis 
when the estimated future undiscounted cash flows to be generated by the assets are less than the carrying value of the long lived assets  or the decline in value is considered to be other than temporary  the assets are written down to fair market value and a charge is recorded to current operations 
fair market value is estimated in various ways depending on the nature of the assets under review 
this value can be based on appraised value  estimated salvage value  sales price under negotiation or estimated cancellation charges  as applicable 
the company recorded long lived asset impairment charges of million and million during fiscal and  respectively 
the most significant long lived assets that have been subject to impairment evaluations during fiscal and are the company s net property  plant and equipment  which totaled million at march  within property  plant and equipment  the most significant assets evaluated are buildings and improvements  and machinery and equipment 
the company evaluates impairment at the lowest level of separately identifiable cash flows  which is generally at the manufacturing plant level 
the company monitors its manufacturing plant performance to determine whether indicators exist that would require an impairment evaluation for the facility 
this includes significant adverse changes in plant profitability metrics  substantial changes in the mix of customer programs manufactured in the plant  consisting of new program launches  reductions  and phase outs  and shifting of programs to other facilities under the company s manufacturing realignment strategy 
when such indicators are present  the company performs an impairment evaluation by comparing the estimated future undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated in the manufacturing facility to the net book value of the long lived assets within that facility 
the undiscounted cash flows are estimated based on the expected future cash flows to be generated by the manufacturing facility over the remaining useful life of the machinery and equipment within that facility 
when the estimated future undiscounted cash flows are less than the net book value of the long lived assets  such assets are written down to fair market value  which is generally estimated based on appraisals or estimated salvage value 
the majority of the long lived asset impairment charges during fiscal and have been recorded within the company s original equipment europe and original equipment north america segments 
these segments have experienced the most significant adverse impact of sales volume declines and changing mix of programs within the manufacturing facilities 
in addition  these segments had program phase outs and cancellations  many of which were in the automotive markets 
further unanticipated adverse changes in these segments could result in the need to perform additional impairment evaluations in the future 
the company s four point recovery plan is designed to attain a more competitive cost base and improve the company s longer term competitiveness  and this plan reduces the risk of potential long lived asset impairment charges in the future 
the manufacturing realignment strategy of this plan is designed to improve the utilization of the company s facilities  with fewer facilities  but operating at higher capacities 
the portfolio rationalization strategy of this plan is designed to identify products where the company can earn a sufficient return on its investment  and divest or exit products which do not meet required financial metrics 
recent portfolio rationalization actions include a phase out of automotive powertrain cooling within north america and module automotive powertrain cooling within europe 
these strategies create better facility utilization and greater profitability in product mix  which are designed to allow the manufacturing facilities to withstand more significant adverse changes before an impairment charge is necessary 
impairment of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets impairment tests are conducted at least annually unless business events or other conditions exist which would require a more frequent evaluation 
the company considers factors such as operating losses  declining outlooks and market capitalization when evaluating the necessity for an impairment analysis 
the annual review of goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives for impairment is conducted in the third quarter 
the recoverability of goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives is determined by estimating the future discounted cash flows of the reporting unit to which the goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives relates 
the rate used in determining discounted cash flows is a rate corresponding to our cost of capital  adjusted for risk where appropriate 
in determining the estimated future cash flows  current and future levels of income are considered as well as business trends and market conditions 
to the extent that book value exceeds the fair value  an impairment is recognized 
during fiscal it was determined that the original equipment europe segment goodwill was fully impaired  necessitating a charge of million 
during fiscal it was determined that the original equipment north america segment goodwill was fully impaired  necessitating a charge of million 
at march  the company had goodwill of million recorded which was primarily comprised of million within the south america segment and million within the commercial products segment 
the south america and commercial products segments reported operating income of million and million  respectively  for fiscal which were both improvements over their prior year results 
despite the current global economic conditions  these segments have reported and continue to forecast strong financial results 
the future discounted cash flows of these segments continue to substantially exceed their carrying value indicating that the goodwill recorded in these segments is fully realizable at march  if  in future periods  these segments experience a significant unanticipated economic downturn in the markets in which they operate  this would require an impairment review 
warranty estimated costs related to product warranties are accrued at the time of the sale and recorded in cost of sales 
estimated costs are based on the best information available  which includes using statistical and analytical analysis of both historical and current claim data 
original estimates  accrued at the time of sale  are adjusted when it becomes probable that expected claims will differ materially from these initial estimates 

table of contents tooling costs pre production tooling costs incurred by the company in manufacturing products under various customer programs are capitalized as a component of property  plant and equipment  net of any customer reimbursements  when the company retains title to the tooling 
these costs are amortized over the program life or three years  whichever is shorter  and recorded in cost of sales in the consolidated statements of operations 
for customer owned tooling costs incurred by the company  a receivable is recorded when the customer has guaranteed reimbursement to the company 
the reimbursement period may vary by program and customer 
no significant arrangements existed during the years ended march  and where customer owned tooling costs were not accompanied by guaranteed reimbursements 
pensions and postretirement benefits plans the calculation of the expense and liabilities of modine s pension and postretirement plans is dependent upon various assumptions 
the most significant assumptions include the discount rate  long term expected return on plan assets  and future trends in health care costs 
the selection of assumptions is based on historical trends and known economic and market conditions at the time of valuation 
in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  actual results that differ from these assumptions are accumulated and amortized over future periods 
these differences may impact future pension or postretirement benefit expenses and liabilities 
the company replaced the existing defined benefit pension plan with a defined contribution plan for salaried paid employees hired on or after january  the modine salaried employee pension plan was modified so that no service performed after march  would be counted when calculating an employee s years of credited service under the pension plan formula 
during fiscal  the plan was modified so that no increases in annual earnings after december  would be included in calculating the average annual portion under the pension plan formula 
we believe the defined contribution plan will  in general  allow the company a greater degree of flexibility in managing retirement benefit costs on a long term basis 
for the following discussion regarding sensitivity of assumptions  all amounts presented are in reference to the domestic pension plans since the domestic plans comprise percent of the company s total benefit plan assets and the large majority of the company s pension plan expense 
to determine the expected rate of return  modine considers such factors as a the actual return earned on plan assets  b historical rates of returns on the various asset classes in the plan portfolio  c projections of returns on those asset classes  d the amount of active management of the assets  e capital market conditions and economic forecasts  and f administrative expenses covered by the plan assets 
the long term rate of return utilized in fiscal and fiscal was and percent  respectively 
for fiscal  the company has assumed a rate of percent 
the impact of a basis point decrease in the expected rate of return on assets would result in a million increase in fiscal pension expense 
the discount rate reflects rates available on long term  high quality fixed income corporate bonds  reset annually on the measurement date of march for fiscal  the company will use a discount rate of percent  reflecting an increase from percent in fiscal the company based this decision on a yield curve that was created following an analysis of the projected cash flows from the affected plans 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information 
changing modine s discount rate by basis points would impact the fiscal domestic pension expense by approximately million 
a key determinant in the amount of the postretirement benefit obligation and expense is the health care cost trend rate 
the health care trend rate for fiscal year was percent  and the company expects this to be percent for fiscal this rate is projected to decline gradually to percent in fiscal year and remain at that level thereafter 
an annual cap that was established for most retiree health care and life insurance plans between fiscal and limits modine s liability 
beginning in february  the company discontinued providing postretirement benefits for salaried and non union employees hired on or after that date 
furthermore  effective january   the plan was modified to eliminate coverage for retired participants that are medicare eligible 
a one percent increase in the health care trend rate would result in an increase in postretirement expense of approximately  and an increase in postretirement benefit obligations of approximately  a basis point decrease in the postretirement discount rate would result in an increase in benefit expense of approximately  other loss reserves the company has a number of other loss exposures  such as environmental and product liability claims  litigation  self insurance reserves  recoverability of deferred income tax benefits  and accounts receivable loss reserves 
establishing loss reserves for these matters requires the use of estimates and judgment to determine the risk exposure and ultimate potential liability 
the company estimates these reserve requirements by using consistent and suitable methodologies for the particular type of loss reserve being calculated

recent substantial strengthening of the us dollar to other foreign currencies  especially the euro and real  has led to a devaluing of the company s foreign results 
this devaluation is evident in the company s unfavorable currency translation adjustments of million recorded in fiscal in fiscal  the company experienced a general weakening of the us dollar to these foreign currencies  which resulted in a favorable currency translation adjustment of million 
as of march  and  the company s foreign subsidiaries had net current assets defined as current assets less current liabilities subject to foreign currency translation risk of million and million  respectively 
the potential decrease in the net current assets from a hypothetical percent adverse change in quoted foreign currency exchange rates would be approximately million 
this sensitivity analysis presented assumes a parallel shift in foreign currency exchange rates 
exchange rates rarely move in the same direction relative to the dollar 
this assumption may overstate the impact of changing exchange rates on individual assets and liabilities denominated in a foreign currency 
the company has  from time to time  certain foreign denominated  long term debt obligations and long term inter company loans that are sensitive to foreign currency exchange rates 
as of march  there were no third party foreign denominated  long term debt obligations 
at march   the company had an inter company loan totaling million to its wholly owned subsidiary  modine brazil that matures on may  on june   the company entered into a zero cost collar that expired on march  to hedge the foreign exchange exposure on the principal amount of the loans 
this collar was settled on march  for a loss of million reais million us equivalent 
on march   the company entered into a purchased option contract that expired on april  to hedge the foreign exchange exposure on million of the inter company loan 
the derivative instruments are not treated as hedges  and accordingly  transaction gains or losses on the derivatives are being recorded in other income net in the consolidated statement of operations and acts to offset any currency movement on the outstanding loan receivable 
the company settled this derivative instrument on february  for cash proceeds of million 
modine brazil paid million on this inter company loan in february the company also has other inter company loans outstanding at march  as follows million loan to its wholly owned subsidiary  modine thermal systems india  that matures on april   and million between two loans to its wholly owned subsidiary  modine thermal systems co changzhou  china  with various maturity dates through june 
table of contents these inter company loans are sensitive to movement in foreign exchange rates  and the company does not have any derivative instruments which hedges this exposure 
interest rate risk modine s interest rate risk policies are designed to reduce the potential volatility of earnings that could arise from changes in interest rates 
the company generally utilizes a mixture of debt maturities together with both fixed rate and floating rate debt to manage its exposure to interest rate variations related to its borrowings 
the domestic revolving credit facility is based on a variable interest rate of london interbank offered rate libor plus basis points 
the company is subject to future fluctuations in libor which would affect the variable interest rate on the revolving credit facility and create variability in interest expense 
a basis point increase in libor would increase interest expense by million based on the march  revolving credit facility balance 
the company has  from time to time  entered into interest rate derivates to manage variability in interest rates 
these interest rate derivatives have been treated as cash flow hedges of forecasted transactions and  accordingly  derivative gains or losses are reflected as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss income and are amortized to interest expense over the respective lives of the borrowings 
during the years ended march  and  million of expense was recorded in the consolidated statement of operations related to the amortization of interest rate derivative losses 
at march   million of net unrealized losses remain deferred in accumulated other comprehensive loss income 
the following table presents the future principal cash flows and weighted average interest rates by expected maturity dates 
the fair value of the long term debt is estimated by discounting the future cash flows at rates offered to the company for similar debt instruments of comparable maturities 
the book value of the debt approximates fair value  with the exception of the million fixed rate notes  which have a fair value of approximately million at march  as of march   long term debt matures as follows years ending march expected maturity date dollars in thousands f f f f f thereafter total fixed rate us dollars average interest rate variable rate us dollars average interest rate credit risk credit risk is the possibility of loss from a customer s failure to make payment according to contract terms 
the company s principal credit risk consists of outstanding trade receivables 
prior to granting credit  each customer is evaluated  taking into consideration the borrower s financial condition  past payment experience and credit information 
after credit is granted the company actively monitors the customer s financial condition and developing business news 
approximately percent of the trade receivables balance at march  was concentrated in the company s top ten customers 
modine s history of incurring credit losses from customers has not been material  and the company does not expect that trend to change 
however  the current economic uncertainty  especially within the global automotive and commercial vehicle markets  makes it difficult to predict future financial conditions of significant customers within these markets 
deterioration in the financial condition of a significant customer could have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations and liquidity 
the recent adverse events in the global financial markets have also increased credit risks on investments to which modine is exposed or where modine has an interest 
the company manages these credit risks through its focus on the following cash and investments cash deposits and short term investments are reviewed to ensure banks have credit ratings acceptable to the company and that all short term investments are maintained in secured or guaranteed instruments 
the company s holdings in cash and investments were considered stable and secure at march   
table of contents pension assets the company has retained outside advisors to assist in the management of the assets in the company s defined benefit plans 
in making investment decisions  the company has been guided by an established risk management protocol under which the focus is on protection of the plan assets against downside risk 
the company monitors investments in its pension plans to ensure that these plans provide good diversification  investment teams and portfolio managers are adhering to the company s investment policies and directives  and exposure to high risk securities and other similar assets is limited 
the company believes it has good investment policies and controls and proactive investment advisors 
despite our efforts to protect against downside risk  the assets within these plans have decreased based upon declining market valuations and volatility  and insurance the company monitors its insurance providers to ensure that they have acceptable financial ratings  and no concerns have been identified through this review 
economic risk economic risk is the possibility of loss resulting from economic instability in certain areas of the world or significant downturns in markets that the company supplies 
the company sells a broad range of products that provide thermal solutions to a diverse group of customers operating primarily in the automotive  truck  heavy equipment and commercial heating and air conditioning markets 
the recent adverse events in the global financial markets have created a significant downturn in the company s vehicular markets and to a lesser extent in its commercial heating and air conditioning markets 
the current economic uncertainty makes it difficult to predict future conditions within these markets 
a sustained economic downturn in any of these markets could have a material adverse effect on the future results of operations or the company s liquidity and potentially result in the impairment of related assets 
the company is responding to these market conditions through its continued implementation of its four point recovery plan as follows manufacturing realignment aligning the manufacturing footprint to maximize asset utilization and improve the company s cost competitive position  portfolio rationalization identifying products or businesses which should be divested or exited as they do not meet required financial metrics  sg a expense reduction reducing sg a expenses and sg a expenses as a percentage of sales through diligent cost containment actions  and capital allocation discipline allocating capital spending to operating segments and business programs that will provide the highest return on investment 
with respect to international instability  the company continues to monitor economic conditions in the us and elsewhere 
during fiscal there was substantial strengthening of the us dollar 
the euro and brazilian real weakened against the dollar by percent and percent  respectively 
the chinese renminbi strengthened almost percent against the us dollar in fiscal and just over percent in fiscal as modine expands its global presence  we also encounter risks imposed by potential trade restrictions  including tariffs  embargoes and the like 
we continue to pursue non speculative opportunities to mitigate these economic risks  and capitalize  when possible  on changing market conditions 
the company pursues new market opportunities after careful consideration of the potential associated risks and benefits 
successes in new markets are dependent upon the company s ability to commercialize its investments 
current examples of new and emerging markets for modine include those related to exhaust gas recirculation and co modine s investment in these areas is subject to the risks associated with business integration  technological success  customers and market acceptance  and modine s ability to meet the demands of its customers as these markets emerge 
future recovery from the global recession or continued economic growth in china are expected to put production pressure on certain of the company s suppliers of raw materials 
in particular  there are a limited number of suppliers of copper  steel and aluminum fin stock serving a more robust market 
the company is exposed to the risk of supply of certain raw materials not being able to meet customer demand and of increased prices being charged by raw material suppliers 
in addition to the purchase of raw materials  the company purchases parts from suppliers that use the company s tooling to create the part 
in most instances  the company does not have duplicate tooling for the manufacture of its purchased parts 
as a result  the company is exposed to the risk of a supplier of such parts being unable to provide the quantity or quality of parts that the company requires 
even in situations where suppliers are manufacturing parts without the use of company tooling  the company faces the challenge of obtaining high quality parts from suppliers 
the company has implemented a supplier risk management program that utilizes industry sources to identify and mitigate high risk supplier situations 

table of contents in addition to the above risks on the supply side  the company is also exposed to risks associated with demands by its customers for decreases in the price of the company s products 
the company attempts to offsets this risk with firm agreements with its customers whenever possible but these agreements generally carry annual price down provisions as well 
the company operates in diversified markets as a strategy for offsetting the risk associated with a downturn in any one or more of the markets it serves 
however  the risks associated with any market downturn  including the current global economic downturn  is still present 
commodity price risk the company is dependent upon the supply of certain raw materials and supplies in the production process and has  from time to time  entered into firm purchase commitments for copper  aluminum  nickel  and natural gas 
the company utilizes an aluminum hedging strategy from time to time by entering into fixed price contracts to help offset changing commodity prices 
the company utilizes collars from time to time for certain forecasted copper purchases  and also enters into forward contracts for certain forecasted nickel purchases 
the company does maintain agreements with certain customers to pass through certain material price fluctuations in order to mitigate the commodity price risk 
the majority of these agreements contain provisions in which the pass through of the price fluctuations can lag behind the actual fluctuations by a quarter or longer 
hedging and foreign currency exchange contracts the company uses derivative financial instruments in a limited way as a tool to manage certain financial risks 
their use is restricted primarily to hedging assets and obligations already held by modine  and they are used to protect cash flows rather than generate income or engage in speculative activity 
leveraged derivatives are prohibited by company policy 
commodity derivatives the company enters into futures contracts from time to time related to certain of the company s forecasted purchases of aluminum and natural gas 
the company s strategy in entering into these contracts is to reduce its exposure to changing purchase prices for future purchase of these commodities 
these contracts have been designated as cash flow hedges by the company 
accordingly  unrealized gains and losses on these contracts are deferred as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss income  and recognized as a component of earnings at the same time that the underlying purchases of aluminum and natural gas impact earnings 
during the years ended march  and  million and million of expense  respectively  was recorded in the consolidated statement of operations related to the settlement of certain futures contracts 
at march   million of unrealized losses remain deferred in accumulated other comprehensive loss income  and will be realized as a component of cost of sales over the next nine months 
the company also enters into futures contracts from time to time related to certain of the company s forecasted purchases of copper and nickel 
the company s strategy in entering into these contracts is to reduce its exposure to changing purchase prices for future purchases of these commodities 
the company has not designated these contracts as hedges  therefore gains and losses on these contracts are recorded directly in the consolidated statements of operations 
at march  and  million of expense and million of income  respectively  was recorded in cost of sales related to these futures contracts 
foreign exchange contracts modine maintains a foreign exchange risk management strategy that uses derivative financial instruments in a limited way to mitigate foreign currency exchange risk 
modine periodically enters into foreign currency exchange contracts to hedge specific foreign currency denominated transactions 
generally  these contracts have terms of or fewer days 
the effect of this practice is to minimize the impact of foreign exchange rate movements on modine s earnings 
modine s foreign currency exchange contracts do not subject it to significant risk due to exchange rate movements because gains and losses on these contracts offset gains and losses on the assets and liabilities being hedged 

table of contents as of march   the company had no outstanding forward foreign exchange contracts 
non us dollar financing transactions through inter company loans or local borrowings in the corresponding currency generally are effective as hedges of long term investments 
the company has a number of investments in wholly owned foreign subsidiaries and non consolidated foreign joint ventures 
the net assets of these subsidiaries are exposed to currency exchange rate volatility 
from time to time  the company uses non derivative financial instruments to hedge  or offset  this exposure 
interest rate derivatives as further noted above under the section entitled interest rate risk  the company has  from time to time  entered into interest rate derivates to manage the variability in interest rates 
these interest rate derivatives have been treated as cash flow hedges of forecasted transactions and  accordingly  derivative gains or losses are reflected as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss income and are amortized to interest expense over the respective lives of the borrowings 
counterparty risks the company manages counterparty risks by ensuring that counterparties to derivative instruments have credit rating acceptable to the company 
at march   all counterparties had a sufficient long term credit rating
