overview and background we are a full service real estate operating company that owns  acquires  develops and manages office  retail and multi family properties on a nationwide basis 
we conduct our business through our operating partnership  of which we own at december  we have control over the major decisions of the operating partnership 
critical accounting policies and estimates accounting estimates 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements  and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses for the relevant reporting periods 
certain accounting policies are considered to be critical accounting estimates  as these policies require us to make assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the estimate is made and changes in the accounting estimate are reasonably likely to occur from period to period 
we believe the following accounting policies reflect the more significant estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements 
for a summary of significant accounting policies  see note to our financial statements  included elsewhere in this report 
investments in real estate 
the price that we pay to acquire a property is impacted by many factors including the condition of the buildings and improvements  the occupancy of the building  the existence of above and below market tenant leases  the creditworthiness of the tenants  favorable or unfavorable financing  above or below market ground leases and numerous other factors 
accordingly  we are required to make subjective assessments to allocate the purchase price paid to acquire investments in real estate among the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on our estimate of the fair values of such assets and liabilities 
this includes determining the value of the buildings and improvements  land  any ground leases  tenant improvements  in place tenant leases  tenant relationships  the value or negative value of above or below market leases and any debt assumed from the seller or loans made by the seller to us 
each of these estimates requires a great deal of judgment and some of the estimates involve complex calculations 
our calculation methodology is summarized in note to our consolidated financial statements 
these allocation assessments have a direct impact on our results of operations because if we were to allocate more value to land there would be no depreciation with respect to such amount or if we were to allocate more value to the buildings as opposed to allocating to the value of tenant leases  this amount would be recognized as an expense over a much longer period of time  since the amounts allocated to buildings are depreciated over the estimated lives of the buildings whereas amounts allocated to tenant leases are amortized over the terms of the leases 
additionally  the amortization of value or negative value assigned to non market rate leases is recorded as an adjustment to rental revenue as compared to amortization of the value of in place leases and tenant relationships  which is included in depreciation and amortization in our consolidated statements of operations 
we are required to make subjective assessments as to the useful lives of our properties for purposes of determining the amount of depreciation to record on an annual basis with respect to our investments in real estate 
these assessments have a direct impact on our net income because if we were to shorten the expected useful lives of our investments in real estate we would depreciate such investments over fewer years  resulting in more depreciation expense and lower net income on an annual basis 

table of contents we evaluate a property for potential impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the current book value of the property may not be recoverable 
in the event that these periodic assessments result in a determination that the carrying amount of a property exceeds the sum of the undiscounted cash flows excluding interest that are expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the property  we would recognize an impairment loss to the extent the carrying amount exceeded the estimated fair value of the property 
estimates of expected future net cash flows are inherently uncertain and are based on assumptions dependent upon future and current market conditions and events that affect the ultimate value of the property 
these estimates require us to make assumptions relating to  among other things  future rental rates  tenant allowances  operating expenditures  property taxes  capital improvements  occupancy levels  and the estimated proceeds generated from the future sale of the property 
we use the equity method of accounting to account for investments in real estate entities over which we have significant influence  but not control over major decisions 
in these situations  the unit of account for measurement purposes is the equity investment and not the real estate 
accordingly  if our joint venture investments meet the other than temporary criteria of accounting principle board opinion no 
the equity method of accounting for investments in common stock  we would recognize an impairment loss to the extent the carrying amount exceeded the estimated fair value of our investment 
with respect to condominium units held for sale  we would recognize an impairment loss to the extent the carrying amount exceeded the estimated fair value less costs to sell the project 
estimates of fair value are often based on expected future net cash flows  which are inherently uncertain and are based on assumptions dependent upon future and current market conditions and events that affect the ultimate value of the project 
these estimates require us to make assumptions relating to  among other things  sales absorption rates  selling prices and discount rates 
revenue recognition 
leases with tenants are accounted for as operating leases 
rental income is recognized as earned based upon the contractual terms of the leases with tenants 
minimum annual rents are recognized on a straight line basis over the lease term regardless of when the payments are made 
the deferred rents asset on our balance sheets represents the aggregate excess rental revenue recognized on a straight line basis over the cash received under the applicable lease provisions 
our leases generally contain provisions that require tenants to reimburse us for a portion of property operating expenses and real estate related taxes associated with the property 
these reimbursements are recognized as revenues in the period the related expenses are incurred 
real estate commissions on leases we charge to third party owners of rental properties are generally recorded as income after we satisfy all obligations under the commission agreement 
a typical commission agreement provides that we earn of the lease commission upon the execution of the lease agreement by the tenant 
the remaining of the lease commission is earned at a later date  usually upon tenant occupancy 
the existence of any significant future contingencies will delay recognition of commission revenue until those contingencies are satisfied 
in addition  we eliminate lease commissions we charge on our ownership share of rental properties 
investment advisory  property management and development services fees are recognized when earned under the provisions of the related agreements 
we have one high rise condominium project for which we use the percentage of completion accounting method to recognize revenues and costs 
revenues and costs for projects are recognized using the percentage of completion method of accounting when construction is beyond the preliminary stage  the buyer is committed to the extent of being unable to require a refund except for non delivery of the unit  sufficient units in the project have been sold to ensure that the property will not revert to rental property  the sales proceeds are collectible and the aggregate sales proceeds and the costs of the project can be reasonably estimated 
revenues are recognized on the individual project s aggregate value of units which have closed and units for which the home buyers have signed binding agreements of sale and are based on the percentage of total estimated construction costs that have been incurred 
the total estimated costs of the project are allocated to these units on a relative sales value basis 
total estimated revenues and construction costs are reviewed periodically  and any change is applied to current and future periods 

table of contents allowances for uncollectible current tenant receivables and unbilled deferred rents receivable 
tenant receivables and unbilled deferred rent receivables are carried net of the allowances for estimated uncollectible tenant receivables and unbilled deferred rent 
our determination of the adequacy of these allowances requires significant judgments and estimates 
unbilled deferred rents receivable represents the amount that the cumulative straight line rental revenue recorded to date exceeds cash rents billed to date under the lease agreements 
given the longer term nature of these types of receivables  our determination of the adequacy of the allowance for unbilled deferred rents receivables is based primarily on historical loss experience 
we evaluate the allowance for unbilled deferred rents receivable using a specific identification methodology for our company s significant tenants  assessing a tenant s financial condition and the tenant s ability to meet its lease obligations 
in addition  the allowance includes a reserve based upon our historical experience and current and anticipated future economic conditions that are not associated with any specific tenant 
depreciable lives of leasing costs 
we incur certain capital costs in connection with leasing our properties 
these costs consist primarily of lease commissions and tenant improvements 
lease costs are amortized on the straight line method over the shorter of the estimated useful life of the asset or the estimated remaining term of the lease  ranging from one to years 
we reevaluate the remaining useful life of these costs as the creditworthiness of our tenants changes 
if we determine that the estimated remaining life of the respective lease has changed  we adjust the amortization period and  therefore  the amortization or depreciation expense recorded each period may fluctuate 
if we experience increased levels of amortization or depreciation expense due to changes in the estimated useful lives of leasing costs  our results of operations may be adversely affected 
income taxes 
we are subject to federal income taxes in the united states  and also in states and local jurisdictions in which we operate 
we account for income taxes according to statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
sfas requires the recognition of deferred tax assets  net of applicable reserves  related to net operating loss carryforwards and certain temporary differences 
the standard requires recognition of a future tax benefit to the extent that realization of such benefit is more likely than not 
otherwise  a valuation allowance is applied 
in accordance with the criteria of sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies  we record tax contingencies when the exposure item becomes probable and reasonably estimable 
we assess the tax uncertainties on a quarterly basis and maintain the required tax reserves until the underlying issue is resolved or upon the expiration of the statute of limitations 
our estimate of potential outcome of any uncertain tax issue is highly judgmental and we believe we have adequately provided for any reasonable and foreseeable outcomes related to uncertain tax matters 
in july  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
fin  accounting for uncertainty in income taxes  an interpretation of fasb statement no 
 accounting for income taxes  which was effective for our company on january  fin clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in tax positions and requires that we recognize the impact of a tax position in our financial statements if that position would more likely than not be sustained on audit  based on the technical merits of the position 
we recorded the cumulative effect of this change in accounting principle as an adjustment to opening retained earnings at january  factors that may influence future results of operations the following is a summary of the more significant factors we believe may affect our results of operations 
for a more detailed discussion regarding the factors that you should consider before making a decision to acquire shares of our common stock  see the information under the caption risk factors elsewhere in this report 
rental income 
the amount of net rental income generated by our properties depends principally on our ability to maintain the occupancy rates of currently leased space  to lease currently available space as well as space in newly developed or redeveloped properties and space available from unscheduled lease terminations 
the amount of rental income we generate also depends on our ability to maintain or increase rental rates in the submarkets where our properties are located 

table of contents los angeles  philadelphia  austin  and houston submarket information 
a significant portion of our income is derived from properties located in los angeles  philadelphia  austin and houston 
the market conditions in these submarkets have a significant impact on our results of operations 
information regarding significant tenants conrail 
a significant amount of space at our two commerce square property has historically been leased to conrail 
approximately half or  square feet of this lease expired in june and the remaining half expires in june conrail currently subleases substantially all of its space to a number of subtenants 
while we have entered into agreements with many of the subtenants for direct leases once their sublease term expires  the rental rates are lower than paid by the current tenant 
as a result  our aggregate revenues from this property are lower following the expiration of the conrail lease in and we currently expect aggregate revenues from the property to further decrease following the final conrail expiration in june we have entered into direct leases for  square feet of the conrail space 
the lease terms range from months to months 
because of these direct leases  we believe we have mitigated some of the risks associated with the conrail tenant concentration 
development and redevelopment activities 
we believe that our development activities present growth opportunities for us over the next several years 
we continually evaluate the size  timing and scope of our development and redevelopment initiatives and  as necessary  sales activity to reflect the economic conditions and the real estate fundamentals that exist in our submarkets 
however  we may not be able to lease committed development or redevelopment properties at expected rental rates or within projected time frames or complete projects on schedule or within budgeted amounts 
the occurrence of one or more of these events could adversely affect our financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
we currently own interests in four development projects  and tpg calstrs includes four redevelopment properties and two development sites 
as of december   we had incurred  on a consolidated basis  approximately million of predevelopment and infrastructure costs that are reflected in land improvements development properties on our balance sheet and million is reflected in construction in progress related to our development projects 
to the extent that we  or joint ventures we are a partner in  do not proceed with projects as planned  development and or redevelopment costs would need to be evaluated for impairment

our management believes that our company will have sufficient capital to satisfy our liquidity needs over the next months through working capital and net cash provided by operations 
we expect to meet our long term liquidity requirements  including property and undeveloped land acquisitions and additional future development and redevelopment activity  through cash flow from operations  additional secured and unsecured long term borrowings  dispositions of non strategic assets  and the potential issuance of common units of our operating partnership or additional debt  common or preferred equity securities  including convertible securities 
we do not have any present intent to reserve funds to retire existing debt upon maturity 
we will instead seek to refinance this debt at maturity or retire the long term debt through the issuance of securities  as market conditions permit 
there can be no assurances that such debt refinancing will be available at the time of such maturities on acceptable terms  if at all  and our cost of capital could increase as a result of any such debt refinancings 
additionally  existing stockholders could experience substantial dilution in the event we are required to issue additional equity capital 
as of december   we have unfunded capital commitments to our joint venture with calstrs of million  the thomas high performance green fund  an investment fund formed by us  calstrs and other institutional investors  of million  and the ubs north american property fund  an investment fund formed by us and ubs wealth management north american property fund limited  of million 
with respect to our joint venture with calstrs  we are not obligated to fund our share of the capital commitment for the acquisition of any new project  but we are obligated to fund to implement tenant improvements and other capital improvements for projects that were acquired prior to june  we estimate 
table of contents we will fund up to million in our requirement to fund all or a portion of our commitments to the thomas high performance green fund and the ubs north american property fund is subject to our identifying properties to acquire that are mutually acceptable to us  and our partners 
our cash requirements for the green fund could be reduced by contributions by us to the fund of assets in which we have an interest 
we intend to declare and pay annual dividends on our common stock 
the dividend declared for the first quarter of  payable in april   is for per share  compared with previous quarterly dividend payments of per share 
the availability of funds to pay dividends is impacted by property level restrictions on cash flows 
two commerce square is subject to debt financing with lock box arrangements 
funds generated by two commerce square cannot be distributed to us under the terms of the lock box arrangements established for the existing lenders for the property 
in addition  all of our properties held in our joint venture with calstrs are subject to debt financing with a lockbox arrangements 
with respect to our joint venture properties  we do not control decision making with respect to these properties  and may not be able to obtain monies from these properties even if funds are available for distribution to us 
in addition  we may enter future financing arrangements that contain restrictions on our use of cash generated from our properties 
development and redevelopment projects we currently own interests in four development projects three of which are discussed below  and our joint venture with calstrs includes four redevelopment properties and two development sites 
we have substantially completed construction and received certificates of occupancy for all of the units at murano  a unit high rise residential condominium project in downtown philadelphia 
we had closed sales on units and parking spaces as of december  and had an additional units and parking spaces under contract of sale 
under the percentage of completion method of accounting  we recognized a gain on sale of approximately million for the year ended december  murano is classified as condominium units held for sale on our balance sheet as of december  due to deteriorating market conditions  in the second half of  we recorded an million impairment charge 
during the third quarter  we completed the core and shell construction of two office buildings totaling approximately  square feet at four points centre 
as of december   we have included these two buildings in our operating portfolio classification 
we anticipate seeking to mitigate our development risk on all of our development projects by obtaining significant pre leasing and guaranteed maximum cost construction contracts 
there can be no assurance we will be able to successfully implement these risk mitigation measures 
the amount and timing of costs associated with our development and redevelopment projects is inherently uncertain due to market and economic conditions 
we presently intend to fund development and redevelopment expenditures primarily through construction or refurbishment financing 
in  we refinanced the loan for city national plaza  which provides proceeds to cover the estimated future redevelopment costs for this property 
construction of the murano was financed in part with a construction loan up to million 
repayment of this loan is being made with proceeds from the sales of condominium units 
the loan has a balance of million as of december  and we had additional borrowing capacity of million 
the office building development at four points is financed in part with a construction loan up to million 
presently  we have not obtained construction financing for the development at campus el segundo 
if we finance these development projects through construction loans and are unable to obtain permanent financing on advantageous terms or at all  we would need to fund these obligations from cash flow from operations or seek alternative capital sources 
if unsuccessful  this could adversely impact our financial condition and results of operations and impair our ability to satisfy our debt service obligations 
if we are successful in obtaining construction or refurbishment financing and permanent financing  we anticipate that the corresponding interest costs would represent both a significant use of our cash flow and a material component of our results of operations 

table of contents we are also involved in managing two entitlement projects  which are discussed below we are presently entitling approximately acres in los angeles  california  for office  production facility  residential and retail uses 
the project  called metro studio lankershim  will include approximately million square feet

tenant improvements and leasing costs may also fluctuate depending upon other factors  including the type of property involved  the existing tenant base  terms of leases  types of leases  the involvement of leasing agents and overall market conditions

inflation substantially all of our office leases provide for tenants to reimburse us for increases in real estate taxes and operating expenses related to the leased space at the applicable property 
in addition  many of the leases provide for increases in fixed base rent 
we believe that inflationary increases may be partially offset by the contractual rent increases and expense reimbursements as described above 
we have one multi family residential rental property and are substantially complete with construction on murano  a high rise residential condominium tower in philadelphia 
the existing residential property is located in the philadelphia central business district and subject to short term leases 
inflationary increases can often be offset by increased rental rates  however  a weak economic environment may restrict our ability to raise rental rates 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk a primary market risk faced by our company is interest rate risk 
our strategy is to match as closely as possible the expected holding periods and income streams of our assets with the terms of our debt 
in general  we intend to use floating rate debt on assets with higher growth prospects and less stability to their income streams 
correspondingly  with respect to stabilized assets with lower growth rates  we will generally use longer term fixed rate debt 
as of december   our company had million of outstanding consolidated floating rate debt 
the unconsolidated real estate entities have total debt of billion  of which billion bears interest at floating rates 
as of december   interest rate caps have been purchased for billion of the unconsolidated floating rate loans 

table of contents our fixed and variable rate long term debt at december   before any maturity extension options  consisted of the following in thousands year of maturity fixed rate variable rate total thereafter total weighted average interest rate we utilize sensitivity analyses to assess the potential effect of our variable rate debt 
at december   our variable rate long term debt represents of our total long term debt 
if interest rates were to increase by basis points  or by approximately of the weighted average variable rate at december   the net impact with respect to our consolidated debt would be increased costs of million per year 
our estimates of the fair value of financial instruments at december  and  respectively  were determined by performing discounted cash flow analyses using an appropriate market discount rate 
considerable judgment is necessary to interpret market data and develop estimated fair value 
the use of different market assumptions or estimation methods may have a material effect on the estimated fair value amounts 
as of december  and  the estimated fair value of our mortgage and other secured loans and unsecured loan aggregates million and million  respectively  compared to the aggregate carrying value of million and million  respectively
