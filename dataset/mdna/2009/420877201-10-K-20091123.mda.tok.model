company history the company began operations in as the haynes stellite works  which was purchased by union carbide and carbon corporation in in  the operations were sold to cabot corporation 
in  haynes was incorporated as a stand alone corporation in delaware  and in haynes was sold by cabot corporation to morgan lewis githens ahn inc  a private investment firm 
the blackstone group  a private investment firm  purchased haynes from morgan lewis githens ahn inc in haynes encountered liquidity difficulties throughout fiscal and the first half of fiscal due to concurrent downcycles in its largest markets  and rising raw material and energy costs  the company could not generate sufficient cash to both satisfy its debt service obligations and fund operations 
on march   haynes and its us subsidiaries and affiliates as of that date filed voluntary petitions for reorganization relief under chapter of the us bankruptcy code 
on august   haynes emerged from bankruptcy pursuant to a court approved plan of reorganization 
in november  haynes acquired certain assets of the branford wire company  including a facility that manufactured both stainless steel wire and high performance alloy wire 
the company primarily produces high performance alloy wire  but continues to produce stainless steel wire on a limited basis at the haynes wire company  in mountain home  north carolina 
on march   the company completed an equity offering  which resulted in the issuance of  shares of its common stock 
simultaneously the company listed its common stock on the nasdaq global market 
products the global specialty alloy market consists of three primary sectors stainless steel  general purpose nickel alloys and high performance nickel and cobalt based alloys 
the company believes that the high performance alloy sector represents less than of the total alloy market 
the company competes exclusively in the high performance nickel and cobalt based alloy sectors  which includes hta products and cra products 
in fiscal  and  hta products accounted for approximately  and of the company s net revenues  respectively  and sales of the company s cra products 
table of contents accounted for approximately  and of the company s net revenues  respectively 
these percentages are based on data which include revenue associated with sales by the company to its foreign subsidiaries  but exclude revenue associated with sales by foreign subsidiaries to their customers 
management believes  however  that the effect of including revenue data associated with sales by its foreign subsidiaries would not materially change the percentages presented in this section 
high temperature resistant alloys 
hta products are used primarily in manufacturing components for the hot sections of gas turbine engines 
stringent safety and performance standards in the aerospace industry result in development lead times typically as long as eight to ten years in the introduction of new aerospace related market applications for hta products 
however  once a particular new alloy is shown to possess the properties required for a specific application in the aerospace market  it tends to remain in use for extended periods 
hta products are also used in gas turbine engines produced for use in applications such as naval and commercial vessels  electric power generation  power sources for offshore drilling platforms  gas pipeline booster stations and emergency standby power stations 
the following table sets forth information with respect to the company s significant high temperature resistant alloys  applications and features new hta development is discussed below under patents and trademarks alloy and year introduced end markets and applications features haynes hr alloy waste incineration cpi boiler tube shields good resistance to sulfidation at high temperatures haynes alloy aero seal rings high strength  low expansion and good fabricability haynes hr alloy lbgt cooling shrouds good strength to cost ratio as compared to competing alloys haynes alloy aero lbgt ducting  combustors excellent combination of strength  stability  oxidation resistance and fabricability haynes alloy aero honeycomb seals excellent combination of oxidation resistance and fabricating among nickel based alloys haynes alloy aero burner cans  after burner components high strength  oxidation resistant cobalt base alloys haynes alloy aero cpi ducting  tanks  vessels  weld overlays good fabricability and general corrosion resistance haynes alloy aero lbgt ducting  combustors good combination of strength  stability  oxidation resistance and fabricability haynes alloy aero lbgt components for gas turbine hot gas exhaust pan good ductility and high strength at temperatures up to f haynes alloy aero ducting  vanes  nozzles weldable high strength alloy with good fabricability hastelloy x alloy aero lbgt burner cans  transition ducts good high temperature strength at relatively low cost haynes ti a alloy aero aircraft hydraulic and fuel systems components light weight  high strength titanium based alloy haynes alloy aero gas turbine parts  bearings  and various industrial applications excellent strength  good oxidation  resistance to f aero refers to the aerospace industry  lbgt refers to the land based gas turbines industry  cpi refers to the chemical processing industry 
represents a patented product or product which the company believes has limited or no significant competition 
corrosion resistant alloys 
cra products are used in a variety of applications  such as chemical processing  power plant emissions control  hazardous waste treatment  sour gas production and 
table of contents pharmaceutical vessels 
historically  the chemical processing market has represented the largest end user sector for cra products 
due to maintenance  safety and environmental considerations  the company believes this market continues to represent an area of potential long term growth 
unlike aerospace applications within the hta product market  the development of new market applications for cra products generally does not require long lead times 
the following table sets forth information with respect to certain of the company s significant corrosion resistant alloys  applications and features new cra development is discussed below under patents and trademarks alloy and year introduced end markets and applications features hastelloy c alloy cpi tanks  mixers  piping versatile alloy with good resistance to uniform corrosion hastelloy b alloy cpi acetic acid plants better fabrication characteristics compared to other nickel molybdenum alloys hastelloy d alloy cpi plate heat exchangers corrosion resistance to hot sulfuric acid ultimet alloy cpi pumps  valves wear and corrosion resistant nickel based alloy hastelloy c alloy cpi fgd tanks  mixers  piping resistance to localized corrosion and pitting hastelloy g alloy cpi tanks  mixers  piping lower cost alloy with good corrosion resistance in phosphoric acid hastelloy g alloy cpi tanks  heat exchangers  piping improved corrosion resistance to phosphoric acid with excellent resistance to corrosion in highly oxidizing media hastelloy c alloy cpi fgd oil land gas tanks  mixers  piping broad resistance to many environments cpi refers to the chemical processing industry  fgd refers to the flue gas desulphurization industry 
represents a patented product or a product to which the company believes has limited or no significant competition 
patents and trademarks the company currently maintains a total of approximately us patents and approximately foreign counterpart patents and applications targeted at countries with significant or potential markets for the patented products and continues to develop  manufacture and test high performance nickel and cobalt based alloys 
since fiscal  the company s technical programs have yielded six new proprietary alloys  four of which are currently commercially available and two of which are being scaled up to be brought to market 
of the alloys which are being commercialized  two alloys saw advancement in the process during fiscal first  haynes alloy  which management believes will have significant commercial potential for the company in the long term  is the subject of a patent application filed in fiscal haynes alloy has excellent formability  fabricability and forgeability 
the commercial launch of haynes alloy occurred in october and  since that time  there have been approximately customer tests and evaluations of this product for the hot sections of gas turbines in the aerospace and land based gas turbine markets  as well as for automotive and other high temperature applications 
the company will continue to actively promote haynes alloy through customer engineering visits and technical presentations and papers 
in addition  commercialization of hastelloy c hs alloy also continued in fiscal the company has been providing customers with samples of this alloy and making technical presentations since testing and evaluation of the alloy is ongoing with special emphasis on applications for the oil and gas market 
it is important to note  however  that both of these alloys are in the 
table of contents early stages of commercialization and pounds sold to date are very low compared to the company s other proprietary alloys  furthermore  pounds in the next three to five years are expected to remain at low levels 
the company believes that the alloys particularly haynes alloy are significantly further along the commercialization curve when compared to historical trends for other proprietary alloys introduced by the company 
in addition to haynes alloy and hastelloy c hs alloy  commercialization is also ongoing for hastelloy hybrid bc alloy 
hastelloy hybrid bc alloy  a cra with potential applications in the chemical processing industry  has resistance to hydrochloric and sulfuric acid 
in addition to the commercialization of the above alloys  the company continues to scale up new alloys not yet ready to begin the commercialization process 
us patent applications were filed in fiscal and for the haynes ns alloy and haynes hr alloy  respectively 
both of these new materials are believed to have significant  medium to long term commercial potential 
haynes ns alloy is a new alloy with extraordinary high temperature strength in sheet form  which has applications in the aerospace  land based gas turbine and automotive markets 
data generation and fabrication trials continued through  with test marketing initiated in early haynes hr alloy is an hta with superior resistance to oxidation with scale up continuing and test marketing to be initiated in fiscal patents or other proprietary rights are an important element of the company s business 
the company s strategy is to file patent applications in the us and any other country that represents an important potential commercial market to the company 
in addition  the company seeks to protect its technology which is important to the development of the company s business 
the company also relies upon trade secret rights to protect its technologies and its development of new applications and alloys 
the company protects its trade secrets in part through confidentiality and proprietary information agreements with its customers 
trademarks on the names of many of the company s alloys have also been applied for or granted in the us and certain foreign countries 
while the company believes its patents are important to its competitive position  significant barriers to entry continue to exist beyond the expiration of any patent period 
these barriers to entry and production include the unique equipment required to produce this material and the exacting process required to achieve the desired metallurgical properties 
these processing requirements include such items as specific annealing temperature  processing speeds and reduction per rolling pass 
management believes that the current alloy development program and these noted barriers to entry reduce the impact of patent expirations on the company 
end markets the company estimates that the global specialty alloy market  including stainless steels  general purpose nickel alloys and high performance nickel and cobalt based alloys  represents total production volume of approximately billion pounds per annum 
of this total market  the company competes in the high performance nickel and cobalt based alloy sector  which is estimated to represent approximately million pounds of production per annum 
the high performance alloy market demands diverse  specialty alloys suitable for use in precision manufacturing 
given the technologically advanced nature of the products  strict requirements of the end users and higher growth end markets  the company believes the high performance alloy sector provides greater growth potential  higher profit margins and greater means for service  product and price differentiation than stainless steels and general purpose nickel alloys 
while stainless steel and general purpose nickel alloy is generally sold in bulk through third party distributors  the company s products are sold in smaller sized orders which are customized and typically handled on a direct to customer basis 
aerospace 
the company has manufactured hta products for the aerospace market since the late s  and has developed numerous proprietary alloys for this market 
customers in the aerospace market tend to be the most demanding with respect to meeting specifications within very low tolerances and 
table of contents achieving new product performance standards 
stringent safety standards and continuous efforts to reduce equipment weight require close coordination between the company and its customers in the selection and development of hta products 
as a result  sales to aerospace customers tend to be made through the company s direct sales force 
demand for the company s products in the aerospace market is based on the new and replacement market for jet engines and the maintenance needs of operators of commercial and military aircraft 
the hot sections of jet engines are subjected to substantial wear and tear and accordingly require periodic maintenance  replacement and overhaul 
the company views the maintenance  replacement and overhaul business as an area of continuing long term growth 
chemical processing 
the chemical processing market represents a large base of customers with diverse cra applications driven by demand for key end use markets such as automobiles  housing  health care  agriculture  and metals production 
cra products supplied by the company have been used in the chemical processing market since the early s 
demand for the company s products in this market is driven by the level of maintenance  repair and expansion requirements of existing chemical processing facilities  as well as the construction of new facilities 
the company believes the extensive worldwide network of company owned service and sales centers  as well as its network of independent distributors and sales agents who supplement the company s direct sales efforts outside of the us  provide a competitive advantage in marketing its cra products in the chemical processing market 
land based gas turbines 
demand for the company s products in this market is driven by the construction of cogeneration facilities such as base load for electric utilities or as backup sources to fossil fuel fired utilities during times of peak demand 
demand for the company s alloys in the land based gas turbine markets has also been driven by concerns regarding lowering emissions from generating facilities powered by fossil fuels 
land based gas turbine generating facilities have gained acceptance as clean  low cost alternatives to fossil fuel fired electric generating facilities 
land based gas turbines are also used in power barges with mobility and as temporary base load generating units for countries that have numerous islands and a large coastline 
demand is also generated by mechanical drive units used for oil and gas production and pipeline transportation  as well as microturbines that are used as back up sources of power generation for hospitals and shopping malls 
with a service center in china and sales centers in india and singapore  the company is well positioned to take advantage of the long term growth potential in those areas in demand for power generation 
other markets 
other markets to which the company sells its hta products and cra products include flue gas desulphurization or fgd  oil and gas  waste incineration  industrial heat treating  automotive and instrumentation 
the fgd market has been driven by both legislated and self imposed standards for lowering emissions from fossil fuel fired electric generating facilities 
with the completion of the company s recent capital projects  the company anticipates increasing its participation in the fgd market due to the increased production capacity and the improved cost structure which resulted from the completion of the capital projects 
the company also sells its products for use in the oil and gas market  primarily in connection with sour gas production 
in addition  incineration of municipal  biological  industrial and hazardous waste products typically produces very corrosive conditions that demand high performance alloys 
markets capable of providing growth are being driven by increasing performance  reliability and service life requirements for products used in these markets which could provide further applications for the company s products 
sales and marketing and distribution the company sells its products primarily through its direct sales organization  which operates from total locations in the us  europe  asia and india  of which are service and or sales centers 
all of the company s service and or sales centers are operated either directly by the company or though its wholly owned subsidiaries 
approximately of the company s net revenues in fiscal were generated by the company s direct sales organization 
the remaining of the company s fiscal net revenues 
table of contents was generated by a network of independent distributors and sales agents who supplement the company s direct sales in the us  europe and asia  some of whom have been associated with the company for over years 
going forward  the company expects its direct sales force to continue to generate approximately of its total sales 
providing technical assistance to customers is an important part of the company s marketing strategy 
the company provides performance analyses of its products and those of its competitors for its customers 
these analyses enable the company to evaluate the performance of its products and to make recommendations as to the use of those products in appropriate applications  enabling the products to be included as part of the technical specifications used in the production of customers products 
the company s market development professionals are assisted by its engineering and technology staff in directing the sales force to new opportunities 
management believes the company s combination of direct sales  technical marketing  engineering and customer support provides an advantage over other manufacturers in the high performance alloy industry 
this activity allows the company to obtain direct insight into customers alloy needs and to develop proprietary alloys that provide solutions to customers problems 
the company continues to focus on growing its business in foreign markets 
in recent years  the company opened a service and sales center in china  the first service and sales center operated by any manufacturer of nickel and cobalt based alloys in china  a second sales office in china  and sales centers in singapore  india and italy 
although sales to china in fiscal were approximately million  compared to million in fiscal  for the long term  management continues to view china as an expanding market opportunity for the company 
that is why the company continues to evaluate the possibility of opening a second service center in china  although global economic conditions may continue to delay this decision 
while the company is making concentrated efforts to expand foreign sales  the majority of its revenue continues to be provided by sales to us customers 
the company continues to pursue opportunities to expand this market 
the company s domestic expansion effort includes  but is not limited to  continued expansion of ancillary product forms  the continued development of new high performance alloys  the utilization of external conversion resources to expand and improve the quality of mill produced product  the addition of equipment in us service and sales centers to improve the company s ability to provide a product closer to the form required by the customer and the continued effort through the technical expertise of the company to find solutions to customer challenges 
the following table sets forth the approximate percentage of the company s fiscal net revenues generated through each of the company s distribution channels 
domestic foreign total company mill direct service and sales centers independent distributors sales agents total the company s top twenty customers accounted for approximately  and of the company s net revenues in fiscal  and  respectively 
no customer or group of affiliated customers of the company accounted for more than of the company s net revenues in fiscal  or net revenues and net income loss in fiscal  and were generated primarily by the company s us operations 
sales to domestic customers comprised approximately  and of the company s net revenues in fiscal  and  respectively 
in addition  the majority of the company s operating costs are incurred in the us  as all of its manufacturing facilities are located in the 
table of contents us it is expected that net revenues and net income will continue to be highly dependent on the company s domestic sales and manufacturing facilities in the us the company s foreign and export sales were approximately million  million  and million for fiscal  and  respectively 
additional information concerning foreign operations and export sales is set forth in note to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this form k 
manufacturing process high performance alloys require a lengthier  more complex production process and are more difficult to manufacture than lower performance alloys  such as stainless steel 
the alloying elements in high performance alloys must be highly refined during melting  and the manufacturing process must be tightly controlled to produce precise chemical properties 
the resulting alloyed material is more difficult to process because  by design  it is more resistant to deformation 
consequently  high performance alloys require that a greater force be applied when hot or cold working and are less susceptible to reduction or thinning when rolling or forging 
this results in more cycles of rolling  annealing and pickling compared to a lower performance alloy to achieve proper dimensions 
certain alloys may undergo as many as distinct stages of melting  remelting  annealing  forging  rolling and pickling before they achieve the specifications required by a customer 
the company manufactures its high performance alloys in various forms  including sheet  plate  billet ingot  tubular  wire and other forms 
the manufacturing process begins with raw materials being combined  melted and refined in a precise manner to produce the chemical composition specified for each high performance alloy 
for most high performance alloys  this molten material is cast into electrodes and additionally refined through electroslag remelting 
the resulting ingots are then forged or rolled to an intermediate shape and size depending upon the intended final product form 
intermediate shapes destined for flat products are then sent through a series of hot and cold rolling  annealing and pickling operations before being cut to final size 
the argon oxygen decarburization gas controls in the company s primary melt facility remove carbon and other undesirable elements  thereby allowing more tightly controlled chemistries  which in turn produce more consistent properties in the high performance alloys 
the argon oxygen decarburization gas control system also allows for statistical process control monitoring in real time to improve product quality 
the company has a four high steckel rolling mill for use in hot rolling high performance alloys  created specifically for that purpose 
the four high steckel rolling mill was installed in and is one of only two such mills in the high performance alloy industry 
the mill is capable of generating approximately million pounds of separating force and rolling a plate up to inches wide 
the mill includes integrated computer controls with automatic gauge control and programmed rolling schedules  two coiling steckel furnaces and five heating furnaces 
computer controlled rolling schedules for each of the hundreds of combinations of product shapes and sizes the company produces allow the mill to roll numerous widths and gauges to exact specifications without stoppages or changeovers 
the company also operates a three high rolling mill and a two high rolling mill  each of which is capable of custom processing much smaller quantities of material than the four high steckel rolling mill 
these mills provide the company with significant flexibility in running smaller batches of varied products in response to customer requirements 
the company believes the flexibility provided by the three high and two high mills provides the company an advantage over its major competitors in obtaining smaller specialty orders 
investments in plant and equipment will allow the company to increase capacity  reduce unplanned equipment outages  produce higher quality products at reduced costs and improve working capital management 
the company spent million in fiscal  million in fiscal and million 
table of contents in fiscal on plant and equipment upgrades 
the significant investments over the last several years were the result of under investment in prior years  as well as increases in customer demand and quality requirements 
the principal benefits of these investments are improved machine reliability  improved product quality  increased processing efficiency  increased capacity  reduced maintenance costs and reduced risk of unplanned outages 
the company recently announced plans to spend approximately million in fiscal through fiscal on new strategic initiatives  including approximately million to restructure  consolidate and enhance capabilities of its service center operations  approximately million on upgrades to its four high steckel rolling mill and supporting equipment and approximately million on other equipment purchases and upgrades 
these projects are expected to reduce operating costs  improve delivery performance and decrease cycle time 
in addition  the company anticipates that it will continue to spend approximately million per year on routine capital maintenance projects 
in fiscal capital spending is targeted at approximately million  with the focus on recurring equipment requirements of approximately million and approximately million on the upgrade of the four high steckel rolling mill 
the million service center restructuring is still in the planning phases and it is not known at this time what portion will be spent in fiscal management does not anticipate prolonged equipment outages as a result of upgrades in fiscal backlog the company defines backlog to include firm commitments from customers for delivery of product at established prices 
approximately of the orders in the backlog at any given time include prices that are subject to adjustment based on changes in raw material costs 
historically  approximately of the company s backlog orders have shipped within six months and approximately have shipped within months 
the backlog figures do not reflect that portion of the company s business conducted at its service and sales centers on a spot or just in time basis 
consolidated backlog at fiscal quarter end in millions st quarter nd quarter rd quarter th quarter raw materials in fiscal  nickel  a major component of many of the company s products  accounted for approximately of raw material costs  or approximately of total cost of sales 
each pound of high performance alloy contains  on average  nickel 
other raw materials include cobalt  chromium  molybdenum and tungsten 
melt materials consist of virgin raw material  purchased scrap and internally produced scrap 
the average nickel price per pound for cash buyers for the day period ended on the last day of the period presented  as reported by the london metals exchange for september   and  was  and  respectively 
while the price of nickel at september  was slightly lower than the same time in  the range of nickel prices throughout the two respective years varied greatly with average nickel prices in fiscal approximately half of average nickel prices in fiscal prices for other raw materials which are significant in the manufacture of the company s products  such as molybdenum  cobalt and chromium  were also lower in fiscal than fiscal 
table of contents since most of the company s products are produced pursuant to specific orders  the company purchases materials against known production schedules 
the materials are purchased from several different suppliers through various arrangements including annual contracts and spot purchases  and involve a variety of pricing mechanisms 
because the company maintains a policy of pricing its products at the time of order placement  the company attempts to establish selling prices with reference to known costs of materials  thereby reducing the risk associated with changes in the cost of raw materials 
however  to the extent that the price of nickel fluctuates rapidly  there may be an unfavorable effect on the company s gross profit margins 
the company periodically purchases material forward with certain suppliers 
research and technical support the company s technology facilities are located at the kokomo headquarters and consist of  square feet of offices and laboratories  as well as an additional  square feet of paved storage area 
the company has six fully equipped technology testing laboratories  including a mechanical test lab  a metallographic lab  an electron microscopy lab  a corrosion lab  a high temperature lab and a welding lab 
these facilities also contain a reduced scale  fully equipped melt shop and process lab 
as of september   the technology  engineering and technological testing staff consisted of persons  of whom have engineering or science degrees  including with doctoral degrees  with the majority of degrees in the field of metallurgical engineering 
research and technical support costs primarily relate to efforts to develop new proprietary alloys and in the development of new applications for already existing alloys 
the company spent approximately million  million and million for research and technical support activities for fiscal  and  respectively 
during fiscal  research and development projects were focused on new alloy development  new product form development and new alloy concept validation  all relating to products for the aerospace  land based gas turbine  chemical processing and oil and gas industries 
in addition  significant projects were conducted to generate technical data in support of major market application opportunities in areas such as renewable energy  fuel cell systems  biotechnology including toxic waste incineration and pharmaceutical manufacturing  and power generation 
competition the high performance alloy market is a highly competitive market in which eight to ten producers participate in various product forms 
the company s primary competitors in flat rolled products include special metals corporation  a subsidiary of precision cast parts  allegheny technologies  inc and krupp vdm gmbh  a subsidiary of thyssen krupp stainless 
the company faces strong competition from domestic and foreign manufacturers of both high performance alloys similar to those the company produces and other competing metals 
the company may face additional competition in the future to the extent new materials are developed  such as plastics or ceramics that may be substituted for the company s products 
the company also believes that it will face increased competition from non us entities in the next five to ten years  especially from competitors located in eastern europe and asia 
additionally  in recent years the company has benefited from a weak us dollar  which makes the goods of foreign competitors more expensive to import into the us in the event that the us dollar strengthens  the company may face increased competition in the us from foreign competitors 
starting in the fourth quarter of fiscal and continuing through fiscal  the company experienced strong price competition from competitors who produce both stainless steel and high performance alloys due primarily to weakness in the stainless market 
historically  the company experienced similar price competition in the s and in the early s  when demand in the stainless market weakened 
increased competition has required the company to continue lowering prices  which 
table of contents has contributed to the reduction in the company s gross profit margin and net income 
there continues to be significant uncertainty as to when the stainless market will improve 
certain financial analysts have predicted that the stainless market could begin to see some improvement starting in calendar if that happens  pricing competition in the high performance alloy industry should begin to ease 
the company continues to respond to the competition by increasing emphasis on service centers  offering value added services  improving its cost structure  and striving to improve delivery times and reliability 
at this time  however  continued weakness in the economy continues to generate intense competitive pricing pressure 
employees as of september   the company employed approximately full time employees worldwide 
all eligible hourly employees at the kokomo plant and the lebanon  indiana service and sales center approximately in the aggregate are covered by a collective bargaining agreement 
in july  the company entered into a new collective bargaining agreement with the united steelworkers of america  which will expire in june management believes that current relations with the union are satisfactory 
none of the employees of the company s arcadia  louisiana  mountain home  north carolina  european or asian operations are represented by a labor union 
environmental matters the company s facilities and operations are subject to various foreign  federal  state and local laws and regulations relating to the protection of human health and the environment  including those governing the discharge of pollutants into the environment and the storage  handling  use  treatment and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes 
violations of these laws and regulations can result in the imposition of substantial penalties and can require facilities improvements 
in addition  the company may be required in the future to comply with additional regulations pertaining to the emission of hazardous air pollutants under the clean air act 
however  since these regulations have not been proposed or promulgated  the company cannot predict the cost  if any  associated with compliance with such regulations 
expenses related to environmental compliance were approximately million for fiscal and are expected to be approximately million for fiscal although there can be no assurance  based upon current information available to the company  the company does not expect that costs of environmental contingencies  individually or in the aggregate  will have a material adverse effect on the company s financial condition  results of operations or liquidity 
the company s facilities are subject to periodic inspection by various regulatory authorities  who from time to time have issued findings of violations of governing laws  regulations and permits 
in the past five years  the company has paid administrative fines  none of which have had a material effect on the company s financial condition  for alleged violations relating to environmental matters  including the handling and storage of hazardous wastes  requirements relating to its title v air permit  requirements relating to the handling of polychlorinated biphenyls and violations of record keeping and notification requirements relating to industrial waste water discharge 
capital expenditures of approximately million were made for pollution control improvements during fiscal  with additional expenditures of approximately million for similar improvements planned for fiscal the company has received permits from the indiana department of environmental management  or idem  to close and to provide post closure monitoring and care for certain areas at the kokomo facility previously used for the storage and disposal of wastes  some of which are classified as hazardous under applicable regulations 
closure certification was received in fiscal for the south landfill at the kokomo facility and post closure monitoring and care is ongoing there 
closure certification was received in fiscal for the north landfill at the kokomo facility and post closure monitoring and care are permitted and ongoing there 
in fiscal  idem issued a single post closure permit applicable to both the north and south landfills  which contains monitoring and post closure care requirements 
in addition  idem required that a resource conservation and recovery act  or rcra  facility investigation  or rfi  
table of contents be conducted in order to further evaluate one area of concern and one solid waste management unit 
the rfi commenced in fiscal and is ongoing 
based on preliminary results  the company has determined that additional testing and further source remediation are necessary 
the company has also received permits from the north carolina department of environment and natural resources  or ncdenr  to close and provide post closure monitoring and care for the hazardous waste lagoon at its mountain home  north carolina facility 
the lagoon area has been closed and is currently undergoing post closure monitoring and care 
the company is required to monitor groundwater and to continue post closure maintenance of the former disposal areas at each site 
as a result  the company is aware of elevated levels of certain contaminants in the groundwater and additional corrective action by the company could be required 
nitric acid leaks were discovered at the arcadia  louisiana location in fiscal analytical results were received in march  and the site assessment was provided to the louisiana department of environmental quality ldeq in may 
remediation of the leaks  including the purchase of new equipment  was substantially complete in fiscal a preliminary assessment of the ldeq authorized the company s proposed remedial actions 
ldeq approved the final remediation plan in february a summary report of remedial actions and testing results was submitted to ldeq in july  and the company is awaiting ldeq s response 
the company is unable to estimate the costs of any further corrective action at these sites  if required 
accordingly  the company can not assure you that the costs of any future corrective action at these or any other current former sites would not have a material effect on the company s financial condition  results of operations or liquidity 
additionally  it is possible that the company could be required to undertake other corrective action commitments for any other solid waste management unit existing or determined to exist at its facilities 
as a condition of the post closure permits  the company must provide and maintain assurances to idem and ncdenr of the company s capability to satisfy closure and post closure groundwater monitoring requirements  including possible future corrective action as necessary 
the company provides these required assurances through a statutory financial assurance test as provided by indiana and north carolina law 
the company may also incur liability for alleged environmental damages associated with the off site transportation and disposal of hazardous substances 
the company s operations generate hazardous substances  and  while a large percentage of these substances are reclaimed or recycled  the company also accumulates hazardous substances at each of its facilities for subsequent transportation and disposal off site by third parties 
generators of hazardous substances which are transported to disposal sites where environmental problems are alleged to exist are subject to claims under the comprehensive environmental response  compensation and liability act of  or cercla  and state counterparts 
cercla imposes strict  joint and several liabilities for investigatory and cleanup costs upon hazardous substance generators  site owners and operators and other potentially responsible parties 
the company may have generated hazardous substances disposed of at other sites potentially subject to cercla or equivalent state law remedial action 
thus  there can be no assurance that the company will not be named as a potentially responsible party at sites in the future or that the costs associated with those sites would not have a material adverse effect on the company s financial condition  results of operations of liquidity

risk factors risks related to our business our revenues may fluctuate widely based upon changes in demand for our customers products 
our business has been materially adversely affected by the global recession 
worldwide economic conditions may remain depressed  or could worsen  in the foreseeable future 
these conditions have had and may continue to have a material adverse effect on demand for our customers products and  in turn  on demand for our products 
demand for our products is dependent upon and derived from the level of demand for the machinery  parts and equipment produced by our customers  which are principally manufacturers and fabricators of machinery  parts and equipment for highly specialized applications 
historically  certain of the markets in which we compete have experienced unpredictable  wide demand fluctuations 
because of the comparatively high level of fixed costs associated with our manufacturing processes  significant declines in those markets have had a disproportionately adverse impact on our operating results 
since we became an independent company in  we have  in several instances  experienced substantial year to year declines in net revenues  primarily as a result of decreases in demand in the industries to which our products are sold 
in    and  our net revenues  when compared to the immediately preceding year  declined by approximately    and  respectively 
we may experience similar fluctuations in our net revenues in the future 
additionally  demand is likely to continue to be subject to substantial year to year fluctuations as a consequence of industry cyclicality  as well as other factors  and such fluctuations may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operation 
profitability in the high performance alloy industry is highly sensitive to changes in sales volumes 
the high performance alloy industry is characterized by high capital investment and high fixed costs 
the cost of raw materials is the primary variable cost in the manufacture of our high performance alloys and  in fiscal  represented approximately of our total cost of sales 
other manufacturing costs  such as labor  energy  maintenance and supplies  often thought of as variable  have a significant fixed element 
profitability is  therefore  very sensitive to changes in volume  and relatively small changes in volume can result in significant variations in earnings 
our ability to effectively utilize our manufacturing assets depends greatly upon continuing demand in our end markets  successfully increasing our market share and continued acceptance of our new products into the marketplace 
any failure to effectively utilize our manufacturing assets may negatively impact our gross margin and net income 
we are subject to risks associated with global economic and political uncertainties we are susceptible to macroeconomic downturns in the united states and abroad that may affect the general economic climate and our performance and the demand of our customers 
the continuing turmoil in the global financial system has had  and may continue to have  an impact on our business and our financial condition 
in addition to the impact that the global financial crisis has already had  we may face significant challenges if conditions in the financial markets do not improve or worsen 
in addition  we are subject to various domestic and international risks and uncertainties  including changing social conditions and uncertainties relating to the current and future political climate 
changes in governmental policies particularly those that would limit or reduce defense spending could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and may reduce our customers demand for our products and or depress pricing of those products used in the defense industry or which have other military applications  resulting in a material adverse impact on our business  prospects  results of operations  revenues and cash flows 
furthermore  any actual armed hostilities  and any future terrorist attacks in the us or abroad  could also have an adverse impact on the us economy  global financial markets and our business 
the 
table of contents effects may include  among other things  a decrease in demand in the aerospace industry due to reduced air travel  as well as reduced demand in the other industries we serve 
depending upon the severity  scope and duration of these effects  the impact on our financial position  results of operations  and cash flows could be material 
we operate in cyclical markets 
a significant portion of our revenues are derived from the highly cyclical aerospace  power generation and chemical processing markets 
our sales to the aerospace industry constituted of our total sales in fiscal our land based gas turbine and chemical processing sales constituted and  respectively  of our total sales in fiscal the commercial aerospace industry is historically driven by demand from commercial airlines for new aircraft 
the us and international commercial aviations industries continue to face challenges arising from the global economic climate  competitive pressures and fuel costs 
demand for commercial aircraft is influenced by industry profitability  trends in airline passenger traffic  the state of us and world economies  the ability of aircraft purchasers to obtain required financing and numerous other factors  including the effects of terrorism and health and safety concerns 
the military aerospace cycle is highly dependent on us and foreign government funding  however  it is also driven by the effects of terrorism  a changing global political environment  us foreign policy  the retirement of older aircraft and technological improvements to new engines that increase reliability 
accordingly  the timing  duration and severity of cyclical upturns and downturns cannot be forecast with certainty 
downturns or reductions in demand could have a material adverse effect on our business 
the land based gas turbine market is also cyclical in nature 
demand for power generation products is global and is affected by the state of the us and world economies  the availability of financing to power generation project sponsors and the political environments of numerous countries 
the availability of fuels and related prices also have a large impact on demand 
reductions in demand for our products sold into the land based gas turbine industry may have a material adverse effect on our business 
we also sell products into the chemical processing industry  which is also cyclical in nature 
customer demand for our products in this market may fluctuate widely depending on us and world economic conditions  the availability of financing  and the general economic strength of the end use customers in this market 
cyclical declines or sustained weakness in this market could have a material adverse effect on our business 
aerospace demand is dependent on primarily two manufacturers 
a significant portion of our aerospace products are sold to fabricators and are ultimately used in the production of new commercial aircraft 
there are only two primary manufacturers of large commercial aircraft in the world  the boeing company and airbus 
a significant portion of our aerospace sales are dependent on the number of new aircraft built by these two manufacturers  which is in turn dependent on a number of factors over which we have little or no control 
those factors include demand for new aircraft from around the globe and factors that impact manufacturing capabilities  such as the availability of raw materials and manufactured components  changes in the regulatory environment and labor relations between the aircraft manufacturers and their work forces 
a significant interruption or slow down in the number of new aircraft built by the aircraft manufacturers could have a material adverse effect on our business 
our operations are dependent on production levels at our kokomo facility 
our principal assets are located at our primary integrated production facility in kokomo  indiana and at our production facilities in arcadia  louisiana and in mountain home  north carolina 
the arcadia and mountain home plants rely to a significant extent upon feedstock produced at the kokomo facility 

table of contents any production failures  shutdowns or other significant problems at the kokomo facility could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
we believe that we maintain adequate property damage insurance to provide for reconstruction of damaged equipment  as well as business interruption insurance to mitigate losses resulting from any production shutdown caused by an insured loss  however  there can be no assurance that such insurance will be adequate to cover such losses which may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition 
in addition  from time to time we schedule planned outages on the equipment at our kokomo facility for maintenance and upgrades 
these projects are subject to a variety of risks and uncertainties  including a variety of market  operational and labor related factors  many of which may be beyond our control 
should a planned shut down on a significant piece of equipment last materially longer than originally planned  there could be a material adverse effect on our operating results 
during periods of lower demand in other alloy markets  some of our competitors may use their available capacity to produce higher volumes of high performance alloys  which leads to increased competition in the high performance alloy market 
we have experienced increasing competition since the third quarter of fiscal from competitors who produce both stainless steel and high performance alloys 
due to continued slowness in the stainless steel market  we believe these competitors increased their production levels and sales activity in high performance alloys to keep capacity in their mills as full as possible  while offering very competitive prices and delivery times 
while competition should soften as the stainless market improves  based on the current economic environment there is significant uncertainty as to when that may occur and the possibility exists that the stainless market may remain weak 
although we continue to respond to the competition by increasing emphasis on service centers  offering value added services  improving cost structure  and striving to improve delivery times and reliability  continued weakness in the economy is likely to lead to increasing levels of competition 
increased competition has required the company to lower prices  which has contributed to the reduction in the company s gross profit margin 
in addition  as a result of the competition in our markets  we have made significant price concessions to our customers from time to time  and we expect customer pressure for further price concessions to continue 
maintenance of our market share will depend  in part  on our ability to sustain a cost structure that enables us to be cost competitive 
if we are unable to adjust our costs relative to our pricing  our profitability will suffer 
our effectiveness in managing our cost structure will be a key determinate of future profitability and competitiveness 
rapid fluctuations in the price of nickel may materially adversely affect our operating results 
to the extent that we are unable to adjust to rapid fluctuations the price of nickel  there may be a negative effect on our gross profit margins 
in fiscal  nickel  a major component of many of our products  accounted for approximately of our raw material costs  or approximately of our total costs of sales 
we enter into several different types of sales contracts with our customers  some of which allow us to pass on increases in nickel prices to our customers 
in other cases  we price our products at the time of order  which allows us to establish prices with reference to known costs of our nickel inventory  but which does not allow us to offset an unexpected rise in the price of nickel 
we may not be able to successfully offset rapid increases in the price of nickel or other raw materials in the future 
in the event that raw material price increases occur that we are unable to pass on to our customers  our cash flows or results of operations would be materially adversely affected 
alternatively  as happened in fiscal  our results of operations may also be negatively impacted if both customer demand and nickel prices rapidly fall at the same time 
in those circumstances  we may experience higher per pound manufacturing costs due to the recognition of higher nickel costs from inventory which flows through cost of goods sold 

table of contents fluctuation in energy costs and raw material costs may have a negative impact on our performance and financial condition 
during fiscal and fiscal  our raw material and energy costs experienced significant fluctuations 
nickel  cobalt and molybdenum  the primary raw materials used to manufacture our products  all experienced significant fluctuations in price 
in addition  the company uses natural gas in the manufacturing process to reheat material for purposes of annealing and forming 
continuing fluctuations in raw material and energy costs could have a material adverse effect on our cash flows or results of operations 
failure to successfully develop  commercialize  market and sell new applications and new products could adversely affect our business 
we believe that our proprietary alloys and metallurgical manufacturing expertise provide us with a competitive advantage over other high performance alloy producers 
our ability to maintain this competitive advantage depends on our ability to continue to offer products that have equal or better performance characteristics than competing products at competitive prices 
our future growth will depend  in part  on our ability to address the increasingly demanding needs of our customers by enhancing the properties of our existing alloys  by timely developing new applications for our existing products  and by timely developing  commercializing  marketing and selling new products 
if we are not successful in these efforts  or our new products and product enhancements do not adequately meet the requirements of the marketplace and achieve market acceptance  our revenues  cash flows and results of operations could be negatively affected 
we may be adversely affected by environmental  health and safety laws  regulations  costs and other liabilities 
we are subject to various foreign  federal  state and local environmental  health and safety laws and regulations  including those governing the discharge of pollutants into the environment  the storage  handling  use  treatment and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes and the health and safety of our employees 
under these laws and regulations  we may be held liable for all costs arising out of any release of hazardous substances on  under or from any of our current or former properties or any off site location to which we sent or arranged to be sent wastes for disposal or treatment  and such costs may be material 
we could also be held liable for any and all consequences arising out of human exposure to such substances or other hazardous substances that may be attributable to our products or other environmental damage 
in addition  some of these laws and regulations require our facilities to operate under permits that are subject to renewal or modification 
these laws  regulations and permits can require expensive pollution control equipment or operational changes to limit actual or potential impacts to the environment 
violations of these laws  regulations or permits can also result in the imposition of substantial penalties  permit revocations and or facility shutdowns 
we have received permits from the environmental regulatory authorities in indiana and north carolina to close and to provide post closure monitoring and care for certain areas of our kokomo and mountain home facilities that were used for the storage and disposal of wastes  some of which are classified as hazardous under applicable regulations 
we are required to monitor groundwater and to continue post closure maintenance of the former disposal areas at each site 
as a result  we are aware of elevated levels of certain contaminants in the groundwater and additional corrective action could be required 
additionally  it is possible that we could be required to undertake other corrective action for any other solid waste management unit existing or determined to exist at our facilities 
we are unable to estimate the costs of any further corrective action  if required 
accordingly  we cannot assure you that the costs of future corrective action at these or any other current or former sites will not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations or liquidity 

table of contents we may also incur liability for alleged environmental damages associated with the off site transportation and disposal of hazardous substances 
our operations generate hazardous substances  many of which we accumulate at our facilities for subsequent transportation and disposal off site or recycling by third parties 
generators of hazardous substances which are transported to disposal sites where environmental problems are alleged to exist are subject to liability under cercla and state counterparts 
in addition  we may have generated hazardous substances disposed of at sites which are subject to cercla or equivalent state law remedial action 
cercla imposes strict  joint and several liabilities for investigatory and cleanup costs upon hazardous substance generators  site owners and operators and other potentially responsible parties regardless of fault 
we cannot assure you that we will not be named as a potentially responsible party at sites in the future or that the costs associated with current or future additional sites would not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations or liquidity 
environmental laws are complex  change frequently and have tended to become increasingly stringent over time 
while we have budgeted for future capital and operating expenditures to comply with environmental laws  we cannot assure you that environmental laws will not change or become more stringent in the future 
therefore  we cannot assure you that our costs of complying with current and future environmental  health and safety laws and regulations  and our liabilities arising from past or future releases of  or exposure to  hazardous substances will not materially adversely affect our business  results of operations or financial condition 
see business environmental matters 
we could be required to make additional contributions to our defined benefit pension plans as a result of adverse changes in interest rates and the capital markets 
our estimates of liabilities and expenses for pension benefits incorporate significant assumptions  including the rate used to discount the future estimated liability  the long term rate of return on plan assets and several assumptions relating to the employee workforce salary increases  retirement age and mortality 
we currently expect that we will be required to make future minimum contributions to our defined benefit pension plans 
a decline in the value of plan investments in the future  an increase in costs or liabilities or unfavorable changes in laws or regulations that govern pension plan funding could materially change the timing and amount of required pension funding 
a requirement to fund any deficit created in the future could have a material adverse effect on our operations and financial condition 
if we are unable to recruit  hire and retain skilled and experienced personnel  our ability to effectively manage and expand our business will be harmed 
our success largely depends on the skills  experience and efforts of our officers and other key employees who may terminate their employment at any time 
the loss of any of our senior management team could harm our business 
the announcement of the loss of one of our key employees could negatively affect our stock price 
our ability to retain our skilled workforce and our success in attracting and hiring new skilled employees will be a critical factor in determining whether we will be successful in the future 
we face challenges in hiring  training  managing and retaining employees in certain areas including metallurgical researchers  equipment technicians  and sales and marketing staff 
if we are unable to recruit  hire and retain skilled employees  our new product and alloy development and commercialization could be delayed  and our marketing and sales efforts could be hindered  which would adversely impact our competitiveness and financial results 
the risks inherent in our international operations may adversely impact our revenues  results of operations and financial condition 
we anticipate we will continue to derive a significant portion of our revenues from operations in international markets 
as we continue to expand internationally  we will need to hire  train and retain qualified personnel for our direct sales efforts and retain distributors and train their personnel in countries 
table of contents where language  cultural or regulatory impediments may exist 
we cannot ensure that distributors  regulators or other government agencies will continue to accept our products  services and business practices 
in addition  we purchase raw materials on the international market 
the sale and shipment of our products and services across international borders  as well as the purchase of raw materials from international sources  subject us to the trade regulations of various jurisdictions 
compliance with such regulations is costly 
any failure to comply with applicable legal and regulatory obligations could impact us in a variety of ways that include  but are not limited to  significant criminal  civil and administrative penalties  including imprisonment of individuals  fines and penalties  denial of export privileges  seizure of shipments and restrictions on certain business activities 
failure to comply with applicable legal and regulatory obligations could result in the disruption of our shipping  sales and service activities 
our international sales operations expose us and our representatives  agents and distributors to risks inherent in operating in foreign jurisdictions  including our ability to obtain  and the costs associated with obtaining  us export licenses and other required export or import licenses or approvals  changes in duties and tariffs  taxes  trade restrictions  license obligations and other non tariff barriers to trade  burdens of complying with the foreign corrupt practices act and a wide variety of foreign laws and regulations  business practices or laws favoring local companies  fluctuations in foreign currencies  restrictive trade policies of foreign governments  longer payment cycles and difficulties collecting receivables through foreign legal systems  difficulties in enforcing or defending agreements and intellectual property rights  and foreign political or economic conditions 
we cannot assure you that one or more of these factors will not harm our business 
any material decrease in our international revenues or inability to expand our international operations would adversely impact our revenues  results of operations and financial condition 
although a collective bargaining agreement is in place for certain employees  union or labor disputes could still disrupt the manufacturing process 
all eligible hourly employees at the kokomo plant and the lebanon  indiana service and sales center approximately in the aggregate as of september  are covered by a collective bargaining agreement 
in fiscal  the collective bargaining agreement was extended until june even though a collective bargaining agreement is in place  it is still possible that union or labor disputes could disrupt our manufacturing process 
we intend to renegotiate the collective bargaining agreement in fiscal prior to the expiration of the agreement currently in place 
management believes that current relations with the union are satisfactory 
we cannot assure you  however  that the renegotiation of the collective bargaining agreement in will not lead to a labor stoppage 
specifically  if the collective bargaining agreement is terminated after its expiration  the union may authorize a strike 
a strike by the employees covered by the collective bargaining agreement could have a material adverse effect on our operating results 
product liability and product warranty risks could adversely affect our operating results 
we produce many critical parts for commercial and military aircraft and for land based gas turbines 
failure of our parts could give rise to substantial product liability and other damage claims 
we maintain 
table of contents insurance addressing this risk  but there can be no assurance that the insurance coverage will be adequate or will continue to be available on terms acceptable to us 
additionally  we manufacture our parts to strict contractually established specifications using complex manufacturing processes 
if we fail to meet the contractual requirements for a part  we may be subject to warranty costs to repair or replace the part itself and additional costs related to the investigation and inspection of non complying parts 
these costs are generally not insured 
risks related to shares of our common stock our stock price is subject to fluctuations as a result of being traded on a public exchange which may not be related to our performance 
the stock market has been highly volatile 
as a result  the market price of our common stock is likely to be similarly volatile  and investors in our common stock may experience a decrease in the value of their stock  including decreases unrelated to our operating performance or prospects 
the price of our common stock could be subject to wide fluctuations in response to a number of factors  including those listed elsewhere in this risk factors section and others such as our operating performance and the performance of other similar companies and companies deemed to be similar  fluctuations in the market price of nickel  raw materials or energy  market conditions in the end markets into which our customers sell their products  principally aerospace  power generation and chemical processing  announcements of technological innovations or new products and services by us or our competitors  the operating and stock price performance of other companies that investors may deem comparable to us  announcements by us of acquisitions  alliances  joint development efforts or corporate partnerships in the high temperature resistant alloy and corrosion resistant alloy markets  market conditions in the technology  manufacturing or other growth sectors  and rumors relating to us or our competitors 
payment of dividends will depend on our future financial condition and performance 
although our board of directors currently intends to continue the payment of regular quarterly cash dividends on shares of our common stock  the timing and amount of future dividends will depend on the board s assessment of our operations  financial condition  projected liabilities  contractual restrictions  restrictions imposed by applicable law and other factors 
we cannot guarantee that we will continue to declare dividends at the same or similar rates 
provisions of our certificate of incorporation and by laws could discourage potential acquisition proposals and could deter or prevent a change in control 
some provisions in our certificate of incorporation and by laws  as well as delaware statutes  may have the effect of delaying  deferring or preventing a change in control 
these provisions  including those regulating the nomination of directors  may make it more difficult for other persons  without the approval of our board of directors  to launch takeover attempts that a stockholder might consider to be in his or her best interest 
these provisions could limit the price that some investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock

item legal proceedings the company is subject to extensive federal  state and local laws and regulations 
future developments and increasingly stringent regulations could require us to make additional unforeseen expenditures for these matters 
the company is regularly involved in litigation  both as a plaintiff and as a defendant  relating to its business and operations 
such litigation includes federal and state eeoc administrative actions and litigation and administrative actions relating to environmental matters 
for more information see item business environmental matters 
litigation and administrative actions may result in substantial costs and may divert management s attention and resources  and the level of future expenditures for legal matters cannot be determined with any degree of certainty 
nonetheless  based on the facts presently known  management does not believe that expenditures for legal proceedings will have a material effect on its financial position  results of operations or liquidity 
the company is currently  and has in the past  been subject to claims involving personal injuries allegedly relating to its products 
for example  the company is presently involved in two actions involving welding rod related injuries  both of which were filed against numerous manufacturers  including the company  in december in the us district court eastern division and february in california state court  respectively  alleging that the welding related products of the defendant manufacturers harmed the users of such products through the inhalation of welding fumes containing manganese 
the company believes that it has defenses to these allegations and  that if the company were found liable  the cases would not have a material effect on its financial position  results of operations or liquidity 
in addition to these cases  the company has in the past been named a defendant in several other lawsuits  including filed in the state of california  alleging that its welding related products harmed the users of such products through the inhalation of welding fumes containing manganese 
the company has since been voluntarily dismissed from all of these lawsuits on the basis of the release and discharge of claims contained in the confirmation order issued in connection with the company s emergence from chapter reorganization 
while the company contests such lawsuits vigorously  and may have applicable insurance  there are several risks and uncertainties that may affect its liability for claims relating to exposure to welding fumes and manganese 
for instance  in recent cases  at least two courts in cases not involving haynes have refused to dismiss claims relating to inhalation of welding fumes containing manganese based upon a bankruptcy discharge order 
although the company believes the facts of these cases are distinguishable from the facts of its cases  it cannot assure you that any or all claims against the company will be dismissed based upon the confirmation order  particularly claims premised  in part or in full  upon actual or alleged exposure on or after the date of the confirmation order 
it is also possible that the company will be named in additional suits alleging welding rod injuries 
should such litigation occur  it is possible that the aggregate claims for damages  if the company is found liable  could have a material adverse effect on its financial condition  results of operations or liquidity

capital spending capital spending in fiscal was million  compared to an original target of approximately million 
the company evaluated planned spending  postponing certain projects and spending until such time as financial conditions improve 
in light of the significant capital expenditures in recent years to upgrade operations  increase capacity and reduce unplanned downtime  management does not believe that the postponement of capital projects in fiscal will have a material unfavorable impact on operations in the short or long term 
the company recently announced plans to spend approximately million over the next five years on new strategic initiatives which focus on improving the capability of the company s production assets 
the company is finalizing plans to spend approximately million over the course of fiscal and to restructure  consolidate and enhance capabilities at its service center operations to improve the return on assets of service center operations 
additionally  the company plans to spend approximately million or million per year on upgrades to its four high steckel rolling mill and supporting equipment  and approximately million or per year on other equipment purchases and upgrades 
these projects are expected to improve quality  reduce operating costs  improve delivery performance and decrease cycle time 
the company anticipates that it will continue to spend 
table of contents approximately million per year on routine capital maintenance projects 
this will approximate capital spending of million over the next five years 
in fiscal capital spending is targeted at approximately million  with the focus on recurring equipment requirements of approximately million and approximately million on the upgrade of the four high steckel rolling mill 
the million service center restructuring is still in the planning phases and it is not known at this time what portion will be spent in fiscal management does not anticipate prolonged equipment outages as a result of upgrades in fiscal outlook general as a result of continued low demand and the challenging economy  the company expects that revenues for at least the first two quarters of fiscal  will be below the revenues of the fourth quarter of fiscal management believes that the company s performance through the first two quarters of fiscal will range from break even to small losses in each quarter 
it is expected that the weakest results will occur in the first quarter of fiscal  because typically this quarter is impacted by fewer ship days and extended customer shutdowns 
management expects results for fiscal to be negatively impacted by continued reduced absorption of fixed manufacturing cost  which inflates cost of goods sold per pound  and the competitive environment  which puts downward pressure on prices 
however  a portion of this reduced absorption is expected to be offset by lower spending from the cost saving initiatives undertaken in fiscal the company continues to adjust production schedules  reduce costs and manage cash flow  while still moving forward with initiatives that are important to its long term success 
the company also reduced inventories substantially in fiscal and intends to hold inventory levels stable through fiscal as a result of recent equipment upgrades  service center value added capabilities and its favorable liquidity position  the company believes it is well positioned to deal with the challenges of the downturn and ultimately manage the upturn more effectively than in prior periods 
backlog a reduction in economic activity and the increasingly competitive environment manifests itself  in part  as a reduction in the company s backlog 
backlog dollars declined by approximately from june  to september  backlog pounds increased slightly by approximately in that same period  while backlog average selling price dropped by 
backlog dollars declined by approximately from september  to september  backlog pounds declined by approximately and backlog average selling price declined by approximately during the period 
the major contributing factors to the year to year decline in backlog were a reduction in pounds and pricing  resulting from decreased activity in the company s end markets and increased price competition discussed below 
the period to period decline in backlog is related to average selling price and is specific to the continued competitive environment 
a reduction in backlog is typically indicative of a reduction in revenue in the future 
based on order entry for the past eight months  including october  management expects that backlog will decline from last year and quarter over quarter in the first quarter of fiscal  before stabilizing at some point in the second quarter of fiscal competition in the fourth quarter  the company continued to experience strong price competition from competitors who produce both stainless steel and high performance alloys due primarily to the continued weakness in both the high performance alloy market and in the stainless market 
increased competition has required the company to continue lowering prices  which has contributed to the reduction in the 
table of contents company s gross profit margin and net income 
there continues to be significant uncertainty as to when the stainless and high performance alloys markets will improve  however  there are indications that those markets may begin to improve in calendar if that happens  pricing competition in the high performance alloy industry should begin to ease in future quarters 
the company continues to respond to the competition by increasing emphasis on service centers  offering value added services  improving its cost structure  and striving to improve delivery times and reliability 
however  continued weakness in the economy continues to generate intense competitive pricing pressure 
quarter over quarter gross profit margin trend gross profit margin and gross profit margin percentage declined each quarter starting in the third quarter of fiscal through the third quarter of fiscal  but each increased in the fourth quarter of fiscal gross profit margin in the fourth quarter of fiscal was million  compared to million in the third quarter of fiscal the gross profit margin percentage was in the fourth quarter of fiscal compared to in the third quarter of fiscal the improvement in gross profit margin from quarter to quarter was primarily due to a reduction in cost of goods sold per pound 
cost of goods sold per pound decreased as a result of reduced per pound manufacturing costs resulting primarily from i a significant reduction in the amount of higher cost raw material from inventory  which impacted costs of goods sold in the first  second and third quarters of fiscal  ii manufacturing staffing reductions started in the second quarter of fiscal which continued through the fourth quarter of fiscal  iii operating efficiencies attributable to equipment upgrades  particularly upgrades in the sheet finishing operations and iv initiation of lean manufacturing techniques 
these favorable items were partially offset by i a reduction in revenue of million between quarters  and ii reduced absorption of fixed manufacturing costs primarily due to lower production of sheet product 
subsequent events in the first quarter of fiscal  the company declared the first quarterly cash dividend in its history 
on november   the company announced that the board of directors has initiated a regular quarterly cash dividend of per outstanding share of the company s common stock 
the dividend is payable december  to stockholders of record at the close of business on december  the dividend cash pay out based on current shares outstanding will be approximately million per quarter  or approximately million on an annualized basis 
the company also announced that the salary reduction of to for all salaried employees will be lifted effective january

the company s financial performance in fiscal is reflective of the global recession and the corresponding caution being exhibited by the company s customers 
aggregated demand in the company s markets started declining in mid fiscal and continued through the course of fiscal  as reflected by decreases in net revenues  volume and pricing in fiscal as compared to fiscal this decline in demand began with the economic slowdown that started in calendar and was magnified by the economic recession 
competition continued to increase through the year  which correspondingly reduced earnings in fiscal as compared to fiscal management expects that this decline in volume and revenue will continue  based on the current levels of order entry  through at least the first and second quarters of fiscal going into fiscal  overall economic weakness  the competitive environment and the cautious approach of the company s customers to restocking will make improving revenue difficult 

table of contents aerospace sales continued to decline through fiscal although the order book for both boeing and airbus continues to be sizable  weak demand and the push out of delivery schedules for aircraft  including the dreamliner and the a  are having an unfavorable effect on order entry and backlog 
in addition  the reduction in passenger traffic and air cargo traffic has also unfavorably affected the mro portion of the aerospace business 
based on these factors  as well as current backlog  management believes that aerospace revenues and pounds shipped are likely to be lower in fiscal as compared to fiscal the commercial oem portion of the business is likely to be most affected  especially through the first and second quarters of fiscal  while mro business may be less affected because of the required maintenance schedules for engines currently in use 
sales to the chemical processing industry decreased year over year  primarily as a result of the economic slowdown which impacted volume and price  and is reflective of historical trends 
pounds shipped to the chemical processing market in the fourth quarter of fiscal were higher than the comparable quarter of the prior year and also higher than the third quarter of fiscal  which reflects quarterly fluctuations in this market as a result of sporadic project business 
management believes the reduced sales and backlog are a longer term trend resulting from the economic recession 
sales to the land based gas turbine market in fiscal decreased by approximately from the previous year 
based on the current economic environment and the company s backlog  it is anticipated that volumes for fiscal will be lower than fiscal  although the amount of the decline is uncertain 
management believes  subject to global economic conditions  long term demand after fiscal in the land based gas turbine market will rebound  due to higher activity in power generation  oil and gas production  and alternative power systems 
in addition  land based gas turbines are favored in electric generating facilities due to low capital cost at installation  flexibility in use of alternative fuels and fewer so emissions than the traditional fossil fuel fired facilities 
although the business environment is competitive  the company continues its efforts to expand volumes sold into the industries which make up the other markets category 
the industries in this category focus on upgrading overall quality  improving product performance through increased efficiency  prolonging product life  and lowering long term costs 
companies in these industries are looking to achieve these goals through the use of advanced materials which supports the increased use of high performance alloys in an expanding number of applications 
management intends to continue to invest in growing smaller markets included in this category because of the significant long term opportunities 
these markets include both the traditional other markets categories such as flue gas desulfurization  automotive  oil and gas  and heat treating plus emerging markets in the biopharmaceutical industry  the energy market for fuel cells and the market for turbine components for higher temperature operations

critical accounting policies and estimates overview management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations discusses the company s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
on an on going basis  management evaluates its estimates and judgments  including those related to bad debts  inventories  income taxes  asset impairments  retirement benefits  matters related to product liability lawsuits and environmental matters 
the process of determining significant estimates is fact specific and takes into account factors such as historical experience  current and expected economic conditions  product mix  pension asset mix and  in some cases  actuarial techniques  and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
the results of this process form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
the company routinely reevaluates these significant factors and makes adjustments where facts and circumstances dictate 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the company s accounting policies are more fully described in note in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in item of this form k 
the company has identified certain critical accounting policies  which are described below 
the following listing of policies is not intended to be a comprehensive list of all of the company s accounting policies 
in many cases  the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by generally accepted accounting principles  with no need for management s judgment in their application 
there are also areas in which management s judgment in selecting any available alternative would not produce a materially different result 

table of contents revenue recognition revenue is recognized when collectability is reasonably assured and when title passes to the customer which is generally at the time of shipment fob shipping point or at a foreign port for certain export customers 
allowances for sales returns are recorded as a component of net revenues in the periods in which the related sales are recognized 
management determines this allowance based on historical experience 
should returns increase above historical experience  additional allowances may be required 
pension and postretirement benefits the company has defined benefit pension and postretirement plans covering most of its current and former employees 
significant elements in determining the assets or liabilities and related income or expense for these plans are the expected return on plan assets if any  the discount rate used to value future payment streams  expected trends in health care costs  and other actuarial assumptions 
annually  the company evaluates the significant assumptions to be used to value its pension and postretirement plan assets and liabilities based on current market conditions and expectations of future costs 
if actual results are less favorable than those projected by management  additional expense may be required in future periods 
the company believes the expected rate of return on plan assets of is a reasonable assumption on a long term perspective based on its asset allocation of equity  fixed income and other 
the company s assumption for expected rate of return for plan assets for equity  fixed income  and real estate other are  and  respectively 
this position is supported through a review of investment criteria  and consideration of historical returns over a several year period 
in the short term  substantial decreases in plan assets will result in higher plan funding contribution levels and higher pension expenses 
a decrease of basis points in the expected long term rate of return on plan assets would result in an increase in annual pension expense of about  to the extent that the actual return on plan assets during the year exceeds or falls short of the assumed long term rate of return  an asset gain or loss is created 
gains and losses are generally amortized over a year period 
as an example  each million in asset loss created by unfavorable investment performance results in seven annual payments contributions of approximately  depending upon the precise effective interest rate in the valuation and the timing of the contribution 
salaried employees hired after december  and hourly employees hired after june  are not covered by the pension plan  however  they are eligible for an enhanced matching program of the defined contribution plan k 
effective december   the us pension plan was amended to freeze benefits for all non union employees in the us effective september   the us pension plan was amended to freeze benefits for fourteen members of the plan 
impairment of long lived assets  goodwill and other intangible assets the company reviews long lived assets for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
recoverability of long lived assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of the asset to the undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset 
if the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its estimated future cash flows  an impairment charge is recognized in the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the fair value of the asset 
the company reviews goodwill for impairment annually or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of goodwill may be impaired 
recoverability of goodwill is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount to the fair value 
if the carrying amount exceeds its fair value  an impairment charge is recognized to the extent that the implied fair value exceeds its carrying amount 
the implied fair value of goodwill is the residual fair value  if any  after allocating the fair value to all of the assets recognized and unrecognized and all of the liabilities 
the fair value is generally determined using a combination of a market value approach using quoted market prices and an income 
table of contents approach using discounted cash flow projections 
changes in the market value and cash flow projections of the company could have significant impact on whether or not goodwill is impaired and the amount of the impairment 
assumptions and estimates with respect to estimated future cash flows used in the evaluation are subject to a high degree of judgment and complexity 
the company reviewed goodwill and trademarks for impairment as of december   and concluded no impairment adjustment was necessary 
during the second quarter of fiscal  the company determined that the weakening of the us economy and the global credit crisis resulted in a reduction of the company s market capitalization below its total shareholder s equity value for a sustained period of time  which is an indication that goodwill may be impaired 
as a result  the company performed an interim step one goodwill impairment analysis as of february  which indicated impairment 
with the assistance of a third party valuation specialist  the company first determined the fair value of its one reporting unit using two valuation methodologies a the income approach  which uses discounted cash flow projections  and b the market value approach  which uses quoted market prices 
the valuation methodologies and the underlying financial information that are used to determine fair value require significant judgments to be made by management 
these judgments include  but are not limited to  long term projections of future financial performance  terminal growth rate and the selection of an appropriate discount rate used to calculate the present value of the estimated future cash flows of the company 
the long term projections used in the valuation were developed as a part of the company s annual budgeting and forecasting process 
the discount rate used in the valuation was selected based upon an analysis of comparable companies and included adjustments made to account for specific attributes of the company such as size and industry 
in connection with the second step of the goodwill impairment test  the company compared the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill to the carrying value of that goodwill and determined that the carrying value of the company s one reporting unit exceeded its fair value 
as a result  the company recorded a non cash charge of  for goodwill impairment in the second quarter of fiscal the company reviewed trademarks for impairment as of december   february   june  and again at august  and concluded no impairment adjustment was necessary

the company will assess  on an ongoing basis  the probability of whether the performance criteria will be achieved 
the company will recognize compensation expense over the performance period if it is deemed probable that the goal will be achieved 
the fair value of the company s restricted stock is determined based upon the closing price of the company s common stock on the grant date 
the plan provides for the adjustment of the number of shares covered by an outstanding grant and the maximum number of shares for which restricted stock may be granted in the event of a stock split  extraordinary dividend or distribution or similar recapitalization event 
stock option plans the company has two stock option plans that authorize the granting of non qualified stock options to certain key employees and non employee directors for the purchase of a maximum of  shares of the company s common stock 
the original option plan was adopted in august pursuant to the plan 
table of contents of reorganization and provides for the grant of options to purchase up to  shares of the company s common stock 
in january  the company s board of directors adopted a second option plan that provides for options to purchase up to  shares of the company s common stock 
each plan provides for the adjustment of the maximum number of shares for which options may be granted in the event of a stock split  extraordinary dividend or distribution or similar recapitalization event 
unless the compensation committee determines otherwise  options granted under the option plans are exercisable for a period of ten years from the date of grant and vest per year over three years from the grant date

additionally  under the modified prospective method of adoption  the company recognizes compensation expense for the portion of outstanding awards on the adoption date for which the requisite service period has not yet been rendered based on the grant date fair value of those awards 
the amount of compensation cost is measured based upon the grant date fair value

this guidance also requires deferred tax assets be reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
the determination of whether or not a valuation allowance is needed is based upon an evaluation of both positive and negative evidence 
in its evaluation of the need for a valuation allowance  the company assesses prudent and feasible tax planning strategies 
the ultimate amount of deferred tax assets realized could be different from those recorded  as influenced by potential changes in enacted tax laws and the availability of future taxable income

changes in interest rates affect the company s interest expense on variable rate debt
