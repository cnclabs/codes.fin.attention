recent developments  future objectives and challenges gpu business our gpu business is comprised primarily of our geforce products that support desktop and notebook pcs  plus memory products 
during fiscal year  we launched several new gpus in the geforce family  including the geforce gt  the geforce gx  and the geforce gtx 
we also launched the geforce gtx and gpu products  which represent the second generation of our unified architecture and  based on a variety of benchmarks and resolutions  deliver approximately percent more gaming performance than our geforce ultra gpu 
we also launched the geforce gtx and geforce gtx which were designed based on compute unified device architecture  or cuda  technology 
the geforce gtx is among the world s fastest dual gpu solutions featuring the power of two geforce gtx gpus on a single card 
the geforce gtx is among the world s most powerful single gpu solution and works efficiently in complex directx environments with extreme hd resolutions 
we also shipped notebook products from the geforce m series  which includes the geforce gm and the geforce gm to meet the performance demands of today s visual computing applications 
the geforce gm is over percent faster than our previous product in its segment  while the geforce gm is percent faster than our previous mainstream gpu 
in fiscal year  we completed our acquisition of ageia technologies  inc  or ageia  an industry leader in gaming physics technology 
we believe that the combination of the gpu and physics engine brands results in an enhanced visual experience for the gaming world 
subsequent to our acquisition of ageia  we launched the geforce gtx  geforce gt  and geforce gt gpus  which provide support for our physx physics engine and cuda parallel processing across a wide range of price segments 
our share of the standalone desktop gpu category decreased from to in fiscal year  according to the december and december pc graphics report from mercury research  respectively 
our share of the standalone notebook category decreased from to  according to the december and december pc graphics report from mercury research  respectively  due to increased competition in the marketplace 
during fiscal year  our revenue from desktop gpu products declined approximately compared to fiscal year this decline was driven primarily as a result of a decline of over in the number of units of desktop gpu products that we sold  while average selling prices of our desktop gpu products were flat to slightly lower in fiscal year when compared to fiscal year we believe that some portion of the decline in our desktop gpu unit sales reflects a shift in consumer preference towards notebook pcs and away from desktop pcs  and that the overall global economic recessionary climate also contributed to the decline 
as such  we noted that unit sales of our notebook gpu products increased over during fiscal year when compared to fiscal year however  the overall global economic recessionary climate contributed to a significant decline in the demand for total graphics during the fourth quarter of fiscal year if consumer preferences towards notebook pcs  and away from desktop pcs  continue or escalate  we may see further declines in sales of our desktop gpu products 
in addition  if the global economic climate does not recover during fiscal year  or deteriorates further  we may see consumer preferences move towards lower priced notebook pcs  which may negatively impact sales of our notebook pc products 
professional solutions business our psb is comprised of our quadro professional workstation products and other professional graphics products  including our nvidia tesla high performance computing products 
during fiscal year  we launched several new quadro solutions  including the quadro fx m professional  and the quadro plex d series  a dedicated desk side visual computing system  or vcs  system that also can be configured using two quadro plex d systems for a u configuration 
we also launched five new quadro fx notebook gpus that spanned from ultra high performance to ultra mobility  as well as the quadro cx accelerator for adobe s creative suite  or adobe cs  content creation software 
during fiscal year  we also launched the tesla c computing processor and the tesla s computing system 
tesla is a new family of gpu computing products that delivers processing capabilities for high performance computing applications  and marks our entry into the high performance computing industry 
the tesla family also consists of the c gpu computing processor  the d deskside supercomputer and the s u computing server 
we believe we are in an era of gpu computing  where our compute unified device architecture  or cuda  parallel processing architecture can accelerate compute intensive applications by significant multiples over that of a cpu alone 
nvidia cuda is a general purpose parallel computing architecture that leverages the parallel compute engine in our graphics processing units to solve many complex computational problems in a fraction of the time required on a cpu 
in order to program using the cuda architecture  developers can  today  use c  one of the most widely used high level programming languages  which can then be run at great performance on a cuda enabled processor 
we expect other languages to be supported in the future  including fortran and c 
with cuda  we are able to speed up general purpose compute intensive applications like we do for d graphics processing 
developers are able to speed up algorithms in areas ranging from nano molecular dynamics to image processing  medical image reconstruction and derivatives modeling for financial risk analysis 
many pc oems now offer high performance computing solutions with tesla for use by customers around the world 
researchers use cuda to accelerate their time to discovery  and popular off the shelf software packages are now cuda accelerated 
we have achieved a leading position in the professional graphics category by providing innovative gpu technology  software  and tools that integrate the capabilities of our gpu with a broad array of visualization products 
mcp business our mcp business is comprised of nvidia nforce core logic and nvidia geforce mgpu products 
our nvidia nforce and geforce mgpu families of products address the core logic market 
during fiscal year  we announced a new technology named hybrid sli  which combines a powerful yet energy efficient engine with our multi gpu sli technology 
during fiscal year  we shipped hybrid sli directx  or dx  mgpus the geforce gpu series 
we also extended the reach of sli technology into the performance category with the launch of our overclockable nvidia nforce i ultra sli mcp for intel processors 
we also launched sli for intel broomfield cpu platforms 
in fiscal year  we also launched the geforce m mgpu along with apple  inc  or apple  for their new lineup of mac notebooks 
the geforce m integrates three complex chips the northbridge  the input output network processor  and the geforce gpu into a single chip and  as a result  significantly improves performance over intel integrated graphics 
apple s macbook and macbook air notebook computers come standard with the geforce m 
apple s macbook pro notebook computer comes standard with the hybrid combination of two geforce gpus a geforce m for maximum battery life and a geforce m gt for high performance mode 
we also launched the geforce and mgpus for intel desktop pcs 
these new mgpus set a new price performance standard for integrated graphics by combining the power of three different chips into one highly compact and efficient gpu 
additionally  in fiscal year  we announced the nvidia ion platform  which combines the geforce gpu with the intel atom cpu 
the combination enables netbooks  small form factor and all in one pcs to play rich media and popular games in high definition 
consumer products business our cpb is comprised of our tegra and goforce mobile brands and products that support netbooks  pmps  pdas  cellular phones and other handheld devices 
this business also includes license  royalty  other revenue and associated costs related to video game consoles and other digital consumer electronics devices 
during fiscal year  we launched the nvidia tegra apx computer on a chip 
in february  we announced the nvidia tegra apx computer on a chip and that we have worked closely with google inc  or google  and the open handset alliance to utilize android  an open mobile phone software stack  with the nvidia tegra series 
during fiscal year  we also launched the nvidia tegra and products  which are small  advanced  highly integrated visual computer on a chip products 
these products feature enhanced multimedia functionality and deliver many times the power efficiency of competing products 
we also introduced geforce d vision  a high definition d stereo solution for the home 
d vision is a combination of high tech wireless glasses  a high power infrared emitter and advanced software that transforms hundreds of pc games into full stereoscopic d 
restructuring charges on september   we announced a workforce reduction to allow for continued investment in strategic growth areas  which was completed in the third quarter of fiscal year as a result  we eliminated approximately positions worldwide  or about of our global workforce 
during fiscal year  expenses associated with the workforce reduction  which were comprised primarily of severance and benefits payments to these employees  totaled million 
we anticipate that the expected decrease in operating expenses from this action will be offset by continued investment in strategic growth areas 
product defect our products are complex and may contain defects or experience failures due to any number of issues in design  fabrication  packaging  materials and or use within a system 
if any of our products or technologies contains a defect  compatibility issue or other error  we may have to invest additional research and development efforts to find and correct the issue 
such efforts could divert our management s and engineers attention from the development of new products and technologies and could increase our operating costs and reduce our gross margin 
in addition  an error or defect in new products or releases or related software drivers after commencement of commercial shipments could result in failure to achieve market acceptance or loss of design wins 
also  we may be required to reimburse customers  including for customers costs to repair or replace the products in the field 
a product recall or a significant number of product returns could be expensive  damage our reputation and could result in the shifting of business to our competitors 
costs associated with correcting defects  errors  bugs or other issues could be significant and could materially harm our financial results 
in july  we recorded a million charge against cost of revenue to cover anticipated customer warranty  repair  return  replacement and other associated costs arising from a weak die packaging material set in certain versions of our previous generation mcp and gpu products used in notebook systems 
all of our newly manufactured products and all of our products that are currently shipping in volume have a different material set that we believe is more robust 
the previous generation mcp and gpu products that are impacted were included in a number of notebook products that were shipped and sold in significant quantities 
certain notebook configurations of these mcp and gpu products are failing in the field at higher than normal rates 
while we have not been able to determine a root cause for these failures  testing suggests a weak material set of die package combination  system thermal management designs  and customer use patterns are contributing factors 
we have worked with our customers to develop and have made available for download a software driver to cause the system fan to begin operation at the powering up of the system and reduce the thermal stress on these chips 
we have also recommended to our customers that they consider changing the thermal management of the mcp and gpu products in their notebook system designs 
we intend to fully support our customers in their repair and replacement of these impacted mcp and gpu products that fail  and their other efforts to mitigate the consequences of these failures 
we continue to engage in discussions with our supply chain regarding reimbursement to us for some or all of the costs we have incurred and may incur in the future relating to the weak material set 
we also continue to seek to access our insurance coverage  which provided us with million in related reimbursement during fiscal year however  there can be no assurance that we will recover any additional reimbursement 
we continue to not see any abnormal failure rates in any systems using nvidia products other than certain notebook configurations 
however  we are continuing to test and otherwise investigate other products 
there can be no assurance that we will not discover defects in other mcp or gpu products 
in september  october and november  several putative class action lawsuits were filed against us  asserting various claims related to the impacted mcp and gpu products 
please refer to note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements in part iv  item of this form k for further information regarding this litigation 
common stock at the annual meeting of stockholders held on june   our stockholders approved an increase in our authorized number of shares of common stock to  the par value of our common stock remained unchanged at per share 
dependence on pc market we derive and expect to continue to derive the majority of our revenue from the sale or license of products for use in the desktop pc and notebook pc markets  including professional workstations 
a reduction in sales of pcs  or a reduction in the growth rate of pc sales  may reduce demand for our products 
changes in demand for our products could be large and sudden 
during fiscal year  sales of our desktop gpu products decreased approximately compared to fiscal year these decreases were primarily due to the standalone desktop and standalone notebook gpu market segment decline as reported in the pc graphics december report from mercury research 
since pc manufacturers often build inventories during periods of anticipated growth  they may be left with excess inventories if growth slows or if they incorrectly forecast product transitions 
in these cases  pc manufacturers may abruptly suspend substantially all purchases of additional inventory from suppliers like us until their excess inventory has been absorbed  which would have a negative impact on our financial results 
seasonality our industry is largely focused on the consumer products market 
historically  we have seen stronger revenue in the second half of our fiscal year than in the first half of our fiscal year  primarily due to back to school and holiday demand 
this seasonal trend did not occur in fiscal year revenue in the second half of fiscal year declined by when compared to revenue from the first half of fiscal year the current recessionary economic environment has created substantial uncertainty in our business 
there can be no assurance that the historical seasonal trend will resume in the future 
subsequent event tender offer on february   we announced that our board of directors approved a cash tender offer for certain employee stock options 
the tender offer commenced on february  and expired at midnight pacific time on march  the tender offer applied to outstanding stock options held by employees with an exercise price equal to or greater than per share 
none of the non employee members of our board of directors or our officers who file reports under section a of the securities exchange act of  including our former chief financial officer  marvin d 
burkett  were eligible to participate in the offer 
all eligible options with exercise prices less than per share  but not less than per share were eligible to receive a cash payment of per option in exchange for the cancellation of the eligible option 
all eligible options with exercise prices greater than per share were eligible to receive a cash payment of per option in exchange for the cancellation of the eligible option 
we use equity to promote employee retention and provide an incentive vehicle valued by employees that is also aligned to stockholder interest 
however  our stock price has declined significantly over the past year  and all of our eligible options are out of the money ie  have exercise prices above our stock price 
therefore  we provided an incentive to employees with an opportunity to obtain cash payment for their eligible options 
also  the tender offer is expected to increase the number of shares available for issuance under our equity incentive plan to the extent eligible options were tendered in this tender offer 
the tender offer is also expected to reduce the potential dilution to our stockholders that is represented by outstanding stock options  which become additional outstanding shares of our common stock upon exercise 
as of january   there were approximately million options eligible to participate in the tender offer 
if all these options were tendered and accepted in the offer  the aggregate cash purchase price for these options would be approximately million 
as a result of the tender offer  we may incur a non recurring charge of up to approximately million if all of the unvested eligible options are tendered 
this charge would be reflected in our financial results for the first fiscal quarter of fiscal year and represents stock based compensation expense  consisting of the remaining unamortized stock based compensation expense associated with the unvested portion of the eligible options tendered in the offer  stock based compensation expense resulting from amounts paid in excess of the fair value of the underlying options  if any  plus associated payroll taxes and professional fees 
we are currently tallying information on the number of options tendered under the offer to determine the actual aggregate cash to be paid in exchange for the cancellation of the eligible options and the non recurring charge to be incurred pertaining to the unvested eligible options that have been tendered 
critical accounting policies and estimates management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue  cost of revenue  expenses and related disclosure of contingencies 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to revenue recognition  cash equivalents and marketable securities  accounts receivable  inventories  income taxes  goodwill  stock based compensation  warranty liabilities  litigation  investigation and settlement costs and other contingencies 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
our management has discussed the development and selection of these critical accounting policies and estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors  or board 
the audit committee has reviewed our disclosures relating to our critical accounting policies and estimates in this annual report on form k 
revenue recognition product revenue we recognize revenue from product sales when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  the product has been delivered  the price is fixed and determinable  and collection is reasonably assured 
for most sales  we use a binding purchase order and in certain cases we use a contractual agreement as evidence of an arrangement 
we consider delivery to occur upon shipment provided title and risk of loss have passed to the customer based on the shipping terms 
at the point of sale  we assess whether the arrangement fee is fixed and determinable and whether collection is reasonably assured 
if we determine that collection of a fee is not reasonably assured  we defer the fee and recognize revenue at the time collection becomes reasonably assured  which is generally upon receipt of payment 
our policy on sales to certain distributors  with rights of return  is to defer recognition of revenue and related cost of revenue until the distributors resell the product 
we record estimated reductions to revenue for customer programs at the time revenue is recognized 
our customer programs primarily involve rebates  which are designed to serve as sales incentives to purchasers of our products 
we account for rebates in accordance with emerging issues task force issue  or eitf  accounting for consideration given by a vendor to a customer including a reseller of the vendor s products and  as such  we accrue for of the potential rebates and do not apply a breakage factor 
rebates typically expire six months from the date of the original sale  unless we reasonably believe that the customer intends to claim the rebate 
unclaimed rebates are reversed to revenue upon expiration of the rebate 
our customer programs also include marketing development funds  or mdfs 
we account for mdfs as either a reduction of revenue or an operating expense in accordance with eitf mdfs represent monies paid to retailers  system builders  original equipment manufacturers  distributors and add in card partners that are earmarked for market segment development and expansion and typically are designed to support our partners activities while also promoting our products 
depending on market conditions  we may take actions to increase amounts offered under customer programs  possibly resulting in an incremental reduction of revenue at the time such programs are offered 
we also record a reduction to revenue by establishing a sales return allowance for estimated product returns at the time revenue is recognized  based primarily on historical return rates 
however  if product returns for a particular fiscal period exceed historical return rates we may determine that additional sales return allowances are required to properly reflect our estimated exposure for product returns 
license and development revenue for license arrangements that require significant customization of our intellectual property components  we generally recognize this license revenue using the percentage of completion method of accounting over the period that services are performed 
for all license and service arrangements accounted for under the percentage of completion method  we determine progress to completion based on actual direct labor hours incurred to date as a percentage of the estimated total direct labor hours required to complete the project 
we periodically evaluate the actual status of each project to ensure that the estimates to complete each contract remain accurate 
a provision for estimated losses on contracts is made in the period in which the loss becomes probable and can be reasonably estimated 
costs incurred in advance of revenue recognized are recorded as deferred costs on uncompleted contracts 
if the amount billed exceeds the amount of revenue recognized  the excess amount is recorded as deferred revenue 
revenue recognized in any period is dependent on our progress toward completion of projects in progress 
significant management judgment and discretion are used to estimate total direct labor hours 
any changes in or deviations from these estimates could have a material effect on the amount of revenue we recognize in any period 
accounts receivable we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts receivable for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
management determines this allowance  which consists of an amount identified for specific customer issues as well as an amount based on overall estimated exposure 
our accounts receivable are highly concentrated and make us vulnerable to adverse changes in our customers businesses  and to downturns in the industry and the worldwide economy 
for example  one customer accounted for approximately of our accounts receivable balance at january   and we continue to work directly with more foreign customers and it may be difficult to collect accounts receivable from them 
our overall estimated exposure excludes significant amounts that are covered by credit insurance and letters of credit 
if the financial condition of our customers  the financial institutions providing letters of credit  or our credit insurance carrier were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required that could adversely affect our operating results 
this risk is heightened during periods when economic conditions worsen  such as the current period when the worldwide economy is experiencing a downturn 
the current financial turmoil affecting the banking system and financial markets and the possibility that financial institutions may consolidate or go out of business have resulted in a tightening in the credit markets  a low level of liquidity in many financial markets  and extreme volatility in fixed income  credit  currency and equity markets 
there could be a number of follow on effects from the credit crisis on our business  including inability of customers  including channel partners  to obtain credit to finance purchases of our products and or customer  insolvencies and failure of financial institutions  which may negatively impact our financial results 
furthermore  there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain credit insurance in the future 
our current credit insurance agreement expires on december  as of january   our allowance for doubtful accounts receivable was million and our gross accounts receivable balance was million 
of the million  million was covered by credit insurance and million was covered by letters of credit 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required and we may have to record additional reserves or write offs on certain sales transactions in the future 
factors impacting the allowance include the level of gross receivables  the financial condition of our customers and the extent to which balances are covered by credit insurance or letters of credit 
as a percentage of our gross accounts receivable balance  our allowance for doubtful accounts receivable has ranged between and during fiscal years and  respectively 
as of january   our allowance for doubtful accounts receivable represented the high end of this range  at of our gross accounts receivable balance 
inventories inventory cost is computed on an adjusted standard basis  which approximates actual cost on an average or first in  first out basis 
we write down our inventory for estimated lower of cost or market  obsolescence or unmarketable inventory equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated market value based upon assumptions about future demand  future product purchase commitments  estimated manufacturing yield levels and market conditions 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  or if our future product purchase commitments to our suppliers exceed our forecasted future demand for such products  additional future inventory write downs may be required that could adversely affect our operating results 
for example  during the fourth quarter of fiscal year  we recorded new inventory write downs of approximately million  which was approximately five to ten times higher than the level of inventory reserves we recorded during the first three quarters of fiscal year  reflecting a significant decline in our forecasted future demand for the related products 
this increased level of inventory reserves had a negative impact on our gross margin and our results of operations 
if actual market conditions are more favorable  we may have higher gross margins when products are sold  however  sales to date of such products have not had a significant impact on our gross margin 
inventory reserves once established are not reversed until the related inventory has been sold or scrapped 
as of january   our inventory reserve was million 
as a percentage of our gross inventory balance  our inventory reserve has ranged between and during fiscal years and as of january   our inventory reserve represented the high end of this range at of our gross inventory balance 
warranty liabilities cost of revenue includes the estimated cost of product warranties that are calculated at the point of revenue recognition 
under limited circumstances  we may offer an extended limited warranty to customers for certain products 
our products are complex and may contain defects or experience failures due to any number of issues in design  fabrication  packaging  materials and or use within a system 
if any of our products or technologies contains a defect  compatibility issue or other error  we may have to invest additional research and development efforts to find and correct the issue 
such efforts could divert our management s and engineers attention from the development of new products and technologies and could increase our operating costs and reduce our gross margin 
in addition  an error or defect in new products or releases or related software drivers after commencement of commercial shipments could result in failure to achieve market acceptance or loss of design wins 
also  we may be required to reimburse customers  including our customers costs to repair or replace products in the field 
a product recall or a significant number of product returns could be expensive  damage our reputation and could result in the shifting of business to our competitors 
costs associated with correcting defects  errors  bugs or other issues could be significant and could materially harm our financial results 
in july  we recorded a million charge against cost of revenue to cover anticipated customer warranty  repair  return  replacement and other associated costs arising from a weak die packaging material set in certain versions of our previous generation mcp and gpu products used in notebook systems 
the mcp and gpu products that are impacted were included in a number of notebook products that were shipped and sold in significant quantities 
certain notebook configurations of these mcp and gpu products are failing in the field at higher than normal rates 
while we have not been able to determine a root cause for these failures  testing suggests a weak material set of die package combination  system thermal management designs  and customer use patterns are contributing factors 
we intend to fully support our customers in their repair and replacement of these impacted mcp and gpu products that fail  and their other efforts to mitigate the consequences of these failures 
we continue to not see any abnormal failure rates in any systems using nvidia products other than certain notebook configurations 
however  we are continuing to test and otherwise investigate other products 
there can be no assurance that we will not discover defects in other mcp or gpu products 
determining the amount of the million charge related to this issue required management to make estimates and judgments based on historical experience  test data and various other assumptions including estimated field failure rates that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
the results of these judgments formed the basis for our estimate of the total charge to cover anticipated customer warranty  repair  return and replacement and other associated costs 
however  if actual repair  return  replacement and other associated costs and or actual field failure rates exceed our estimates  we may be required to record additional reserves  which would increase our cost of revenue and materially harm our financial results 
income taxes statement of financial accounting standards no 
 or sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  establishes financial accounting and reporting standards for the effect of income taxes 
in accordance with sfas no 
 we recognize federal  state and foreign current tax liabilities or assets based on our estimate of taxes payable or refundable in the current fiscal year by tax jurisdiction 
we also recognize federal  state and foreign deferred tax assets or liabilities  as appropriate  for our estimate of future tax effects attributable to temporary differences and carryforwards  and we record a valuation allowance to reduce any deferred tax assets by the amount of any tax benefits that  based on available evidence and judgment  are not expected to be realized 
united states income tax has not been provided on earnings of our non us subsidiaries to the extent that such earnings are considered to be permanently reinvested 
our calculation of current and deferred tax assets and liabilities is based on certain estimates and judgments and involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws 
our estimates of current and deferred tax assets and liabilities may change based  in part  on added certainty or finality to an anticipated outcome  changes in accounting standards or tax laws in the united states  or foreign jurisdictions where we operate  or changes in other facts or circumstances 
in addition  we recognize liabilities for potential united states and foreign income tax contingencies based on our estimate of whether  and the extent to which  additional taxes may be due 
if we determine that payment of these amounts is unnecessary or if the recorded tax liability is less than our current assessment  we may be required to recognize an income tax benefit or additional income tax expense in our financial statements  accordingly 
as of january   we had a valuation allowance of million 
of the total valuation allowance  million relates to state tax attributes acquired in certain acquisitions for which realization of the related deferred tax assets was determined not likely to be realized due  in part  to potential utilization limitations as a result of stock ownership changes  and million relates to state and foreign deferred tax assets that management determined not likely to be realized due  in part  to projections of future taxable income 
to the extent realization of the deferred tax assets related to certain acquisitions becomes more likely than not  recognition of these acquired tax benefits would be reported as a reduction to income tax expense in accordance with the recent accounting pronouncement  statement of financial accounting standards no 
r  or sfas no 
r  business combinations  issued by the fasb in december we would also recognize an income tax benefit during the period that the realization of the deferred tax assets related to state or foreign tax benefits of million becomes more likely than not 
in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
r  or sfas no 
r  share based payment  our deferred tax assets do not include the excess tax benefit related to stock based compensation that are a component of our federal and state net operating loss and research tax credit carryforwards in the amount of million as of january  consistent with prior years  the excess tax benefit reflected in our net operating loss and research tax credit carryforwards will be accounted for as a credit to stockholders equity  if and when realized 
in determining if and when excess tax benefits have been realized  we have elected to do a with and without approach with respect to such excess tax benefits 
we have also elected to ignore the indirect tax effects of stock based compensation deductions for financial and accounting reporting purposes  and specifically to recognize the full effect of the research tax credit in income from continuing operations 
on january   we adopted fasb interpretation no 
 or fin  accounting for uncertainty in income taxes  issued in july fin applies to all tax positions related to income taxes subject to sfas no 
under fin we recognize the benefit from a tax position only if it is more likely than not that the position would be sustained upon audit based solely on the technical merits of the tax position 
the cumulative effect of adoption of fin did not result in a material adjustment to our tax liability for unrecognized income tax benefits 
our policy to include interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as a component of income tax expense did not change as a result of implementing the fin please refer to note of these notes to the consolidated financial statements in part iv  item of this form k for additional information 
goodwill our impairment review process compares the fair value of the reporting unit in which the goodwill resides to its carrying value 
we determined that our reporting units are equivalent to our operating segments or components of an operating segment for the purposes of completing our statement of financial accounting standards no 
 or sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  impairment test 
we utilize a two step approach to testing goodwill for impairment 
the first step tests for possible impairment by applying a fair value based test 
in computing fair value of our reporting units  we use estimates of future revenues  costs and cash flows from such units 
the second step  if necessary  measures the amount of such impairment by applying fair value based tests to individual assets and liabilities 
goodwill is subject to our annual impairment test during the fourth quarter of our fiscal year  or earlier if indicators of potential impairment exist  using a fair value based approach 
we completed our most recent annual impairment test during the fourth quarter of fiscal year and concluded that there was no impairment 
this assessment is based upon a discounted cash flow analysis and analysis of our market capitalization 
the estimate of cash flow is based upon  among other things  certain assumptions about expected future operating performance such as revenue growth rates and operating margins used to calculate projected future cash flows  risk adjusted discount rates  future economic and market conditions  and determination of appropriate market comparables 
our estimates of discounted cash flows may differ from actual cash flows due to  among other things  economic conditions  changes to our business model or changes in operating performance 
additionally  certain estimates of discounted cash flows involve businesses with limited financial history and developing revenue models  which increase the risk of differences between the projected and actual performance 
significant differences between these estimates and actual cash flows could materially affect our future financial results 
these factors increase the risk of differences between projected and actual performance that could impact future estimates of fair value of all reporting units 
in addition  determining the number of reporting units and the fair value of a reporting unit requires us to make judgments and involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions 
we also make judgments and assumptions in allocating assets and liabilities to each of our reporting units 
we base our fair value estimates on assumptions we believe to be reasonable but that are unpredictable and inherently uncertain 
the long term financial forecast represents the best estimate that we have at this time and we believe that its underlying assumptions are reasonable 
however  actual performance in the near term and longer term could be materially different from these forecasts  which could impact future estimates of fair value of our reporting units and may result in a charge to earnings in future periods due to the potential for a write down of goodwill in connection with such tests 
cash equivalents and marketable securities fair value in the current market environment  the assessment of the fair value of debt instruments can be difficult and subjective 
the volume of trading activity of certain debt instruments has declined  and the rapid changes occurring in today s financial markets can lead to changes in the fair value of financial instruments in relatively short periods of time 
statement of financial accounting standards no 
 or sfas no 
 fair value measurements  establishes three levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair value 
please refer to note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements in part iv  item of this form k 
we measure our cash equivalents and marketable securities at fair value 
the fair values of our financial assets and liabilities are determined using quoted market prices of identical assets or quoted market prices of similar assets from active markets 
level valuations are obtained from real time quotes for transactions in active exchange markets involving identical assets 
level valuations are obtained from quoted market prices in active markets involving similar assets 
level valuations are based on unobservable inputs to the valuation methodology and include our own data about assumptions market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability based on the best information available under the circumstances 
each level of input has different levels of subjectivity and difficulty involved in determining fair value 
while most of our cash equivalents and marketable securities are valued based on level inputs  the valuation of our holdings of the reserve international liquidity fund  ltd  or international reserve fund are classified as a level input due to the inherent subjectivity and the significant judgment involved in its valuation 
total financial assets at fair value classified within level were of total assets on our consolidated balance sheet as of january  other than temporary impairment we account for our investment instruments in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 or sfas no 
 accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities 
all of our cash equivalents and marketable securities are treated as available for sale under sfas no 
all of our available for sale investments are subject to a periodic impairment review 
investments are considered to be impaired when a decline in fair value is judged to be other than temporary when the resulting fair value is significantly below cost basis and or the significant decline has lasted for an extended period of time 
the evaluation that we use to determine whether a marketable security is impaired is based on the specific facts and circumstances present at the time of assessment  which include the consideration of general market conditions  the duration and extent to which fair value is below cost  and our intent and ability to hold an investment for a sufficient period of time to allow for recovery in value 
we also consider specific adverse conditions related to the financial health of and business outlook for an investee  including industry and sector performance  changes in technology  operational and financing cash flow factors  and changes in an investee s credit rating 
investments that we identify as having an indicator of impairment are subject to further analysis to determine if the investment is other than temporarily impaired  in which case we write down the investment to its estimated fair value 
during fiscal year  we recorded other than temporary impairment charges of million 
these charges include million related to what we believe is an other than temporary impairment of our investment in the money market funds held by the international reserve fund  million related to a decline in the value of publicly traded equity securities and million related to debt securities held by us that were issued by companies that have filed for bankruptcy as of january  stock based compensation effective january   we adopted the provisions of sfas no 
r  which establishes accounting for stock based awards exchanged for employee services 
accordingly  stock based compensation cost is measured at grant date  based on the fair value of the awards  and is recognized as expense over the requisite employee service period 
stock based compensation expense recognized during fiscal years  and was million  million and million  respectively  which consisted of stock based compensation expense related to stock options and our employee stock purchase plan 
please refer to note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements in part iv  item of this form k for further information 
we elected to adopt the modified prospective application method as provided by sfas no 
r  beginning january  we recognize stock based compensation expense using the straight line attribution method 
we estimate the value of employee stock options on the date of grant using a binomial model 
the determination of fair value of share based payment awards on the date of grant using an option pricing model is affected by our stock price as well as assumptions regarding a number of highly complex and subjective variables 
these variables include  but are not limited to  the expected stock price volatility over the term of the awards  actual and projected employee stock option exercise behaviors  vesting schedules  death and disability probabilities  expected volatility and risk free interest 
our management determined that the use of implied volatility is expected to be more reflective of market conditions and  therefore  could reasonably be expected to be a better indicator of our expected volatility than historical volatility 
the risk free interest rate assumption is based upon observed interest rates appropriate for the term of our employee stock options 
the dividend yield assumption is based on the history and expectation of dividend payouts 
we began segregating options into groups for employees with relatively homogeneous exercise behavior in order to calculate the best estimate of fair value using the binomial valuation model 
using the binomial model  the fair value of the stock options granted under our stock option plans have been estimated using the following assumptions during the year ended january  weighted average expected life of stock options in years risk free interest rate volatility dividend yield for our employee stock purchase plan we continue to use the black scholes model 
the fair value of the shares issued under the employee stock purchase plan has been estimated using the following assumptions during year ended january  weighted average expected life of stock options in years risk free interest rate volatility dividend yield sfas no 
r also requires forfeitures to be estimated at the time of grant and revised  if necessary  in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates 
forfeitures were estimated based on historical experience 
if factors change and we employ different assumptions in the application of sfas no 
r in future periods  the compensation expense that we record under sfas no 
r may differ significantly from what we have recorded in the current period 
litigation  investigation and settlement costs from time to time  we are involved in legal actions and or investigations by regulatory bodies 
we are aggressively defending our current litigation matters for which we are responsible 
however  there are many uncertainties associated with any litigation or investigations  and we cannot be certain that these actions or other third party claims against us will be resolved without costly litigation  fines and or substantial settlement payments 
if that occurs  our business  financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 
if information becomes available that causes us to determine that a loss in any of our pending litigation  investigations or settlements is probable  and we can reasonably estimate the loss associated with such events  we will record the loss in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
however  the actual liability in any such litigation or investigations may be materially different from our estimates  which could require us to record additional costs

fiscal year vs 
fiscal year revenue was billion for fiscal year  compared to billion for fiscal year  which represents a decrease of 
for the first quarter of fiscal  we expect revenue to remain flat or improve slightly when compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal year a discussion of our revenue results for each of our operating segments is as follows gpu business 
gpu business revenue decreased by to billion for fiscal year  compared to billion for fiscal year this decrease resulted from decreased sales of our desktop gpu and memory products  offset by increased sales of our notebook gpu products 
sales of our desktop gpu and memory products decreased approximately and  respectively  in fiscal year when compared to fiscal year these decreases were primarily due to a decline in the standalone desktop market segment as reported in the december pc graphics report from mercury research  driven by a combination of market migration from desktop pcs towards notebook pcs and an overall market shift in the mix of products towards lower priced products 
this overall market decline translated into a decline of over in the number of units of desktop gpu products that we sold in fiscal year compared to fiscal year the decline in desktop gpu revenue also reflects the impact of a slight average sales price regression in our products and a decline in our share position during the middle portion of fiscal year as a result of increased competition 
memory sales declined as a result of a decline in sales of our high end desktop gpu products 
sales of our notebook gpu products increased approximately in fiscal year when compared to fiscal year  due to higher unit sales aided by a market move toward notebook pcs over desktop pcs  offset by a slight decline in average selling prices 
additionally  the overall global economic recessionary climate contributed to a significant decline in the demand for total graphics during the fourth quarter of fiscal year psb 
psb revenue increased by to million for fiscal year  compared to million for fiscal year our nvidia professional workstation product sales increased due to an overall unit increase of approximately in shipments of boards and chips as compared to fiscal year  due to strong demand and our transition from previous generations of nvidia quadro professional workstation products to geforce based and geforce based products 
sales of nvidia quadro cx for adobe s cs software  which we launched in the third quarter of fiscal year  also contributed towards the increase in sales in fiscal year mcp business 
mcp business revenue decreased by to million for fiscal year  compared to million for fiscal year this decrease was due to a decline of approximately in sales of our amd based platform products resulting from increased competition in amd based products  offset by an increase of approximately in sales of our intel based platform products 
the increase in intel based product sales was driven by sales of our geforce m mgpu  which we launched in october along with apple inc  or apple  for their new lineup of mac notebooks  and our new geforce and mgpus for intel desktop pcs 
cpb 
cpb revenue decreased by to million for fiscal year  compared to million for fiscal year the decline in cpb revenue is primarily driven by a combination of a decrease in revenue from our cell phone products and a decrease in revenue from sony computer entertainment  or sce 
the decrease in revenue from our cell phone products resulted from our shift from marketing and developing legacy products to achieving design wins and marketing our newer tegra products 
the decrease in our revenue from sce resulted from a decline in license revenue and a decline in royalty revenue that was caused by a lower number of units shipped as well as by a step down in the per unit royalty rate during the year due to achievement of a unit based milestone in our agreement with sce 
fiscal year vs 
fiscal year revenue was billion for fiscal year  compared to billion for fiscal year  which represents an increase of 
a discussion of our revenue results for each of our operating segments is as follows gpu business 
gpu business revenue increased by to billion in fiscal year  compared to billion in fiscal year this improvement was primarily due to increased sales of our desktop gpu products and notebook gpu products 
sales of our desktop gpu products increased by approximately compared to fiscal year  primarily due to growth of the standalone desktop market as reported in the december pc graphics report from mercury research 
our leadership position in the standalone desktop market was driven by our geforce based products 
sales of our notebook gpu products increased by approximately compared to fiscal year notebook gpu revenue growth was primarily due to share gains in the standalone notebook category as reported in the december pc graphics report from mercury research 
our share gains in the standalone notebook category were primarily a result of shipments of products used in notebook pc design wins related to intel s santa rosa platform used in notebooks 
psb 
psb revenue increased by to million in fiscal year  compared to million in fiscal year our professional workstation product sales increased due to an overall increase in shipments of boards and chips 
this increase in shipments was primarily driven by our transition from previous generations of nvidia quadro professional workstation products to geforce based products 
mcp business 
mcp business revenue increased by to million in fiscal year  compared to million in fiscal year the increase resulted from an approximate increase in sales of our intel based platform products as compared to fiscal year we began ramping up shipments of our intel based platform products after the third quarter of fiscal year this increase was offset by a decline in sales of our amd based platform products and sales of products related to our acquisition of uli electronics  inc in february cpb 
cpb revenue increased by to million in fiscal year  compared to million in fiscal year the overall increase in cpb revenue is primarily due to increased royalties from sony computer entertainment  or sce  but was offset by decreases in revenue from our cell phone products and our contractual development arrangements with sce 
concentration of revenue we generated  and of our total revenue for fiscal years  and  respectively  from sales to customers outside the united states and other americas 
revenue by geographic region is allocated to individual countries based on the location to which the products are initially billed even if the foreign contract equipment manufacturers  or cems  add in board and motherboard manufacturers revenue is attributable to end customers in a different location 
revenue from significant customers  those representing approximately or more of total revenue for the respective periods  is summarized as follows year ended january  january  january  revenue customer a customer b gross profit and gross margin gross profit consists of total revenue  net of allowances  less cost of revenue 
cost of revenue consists primarily of the cost of semiconductors purchased from subcontractors  including wafer fabrication  assembly  testing and packaging  manufacturing support costs  including labor and overhead associated with such purchases  final test yield fallout  inventory and warranty provisions  and shipping costs 
cost of revenue also includes development costs for license and service arrangements 
gross margin is the percentage of gross profit to revenue 
our gross margin was  and for fiscal years  and  respectively 
our gross margin is significantly impacted by the mix of products we sell 
product mix is often difficult to estimate with accuracy 
therefore  if we experience product transition or competitive challenges  if we achieve significant revenue growth in our lower margin product lines  or if we are unable to earn as much revenue as we expect from higher margin product lines  our gross margin may be negatively impacted 
we will continue to focus on improving our gross margin by delivering cost effective product architectures  enhancing business processes and delivering profitable growth 
a discussion of our gross margin results for each of our operating segments is as follows fiscal year vs 
fiscal year our gross margin declined to in fiscal year from for fiscal year the gross margin for fiscal year includes the impact of a million charge against cost of revenue to cover anticipated customer warranty  repair  return  replacement and associated costs arising from a weak die packaging material set in certain versions of our previous generation mcp and gpu products used in notebook systems offset by allocated insurance claim proceeds of million from an insurance provider 
this warranty charge had an adverse impact of approximately on our gross margin for fiscal year additionally  inventory reserves taken during fiscal year were approximately million higher compared to fiscal year  reflecting a significant decline in our forecasted future demand for the related products and having a negative impact on our gross margin 
gpu business 
the gross margin of our gpu business decreased during fiscal year as compared to fiscal year this decrease was due to a charge against cost of revenue to cover anticipated customer warranty  repair  return  replacement and associated costs arising from a weak die packaging material set in certain versions of our previous generation gpu products used in notebook systems  the negative impact of inventory reserves taken during the fourth quarter of fiscal year  and average sales price regression in our geforce based and previous generations of desktop products resulting from increased competition 
the average sales price regression was also driven by a combination of market migration from desktop pcs towards notebook pcs and an overall market shift in the mix of products towards lower priced products 
psb 
the gross margin of our psb increased slightly during fiscal year as compared to fiscal year this increase was primarily due to increased sales of our geforce based nvidia quadro products  which began selling in the fourth quarter of fiscal year  and geforce based nvidia quadro products  which generally have higher gross margins than our previous generations of nvidia quadro products 
mcp business 
the gross margin of our mcp business decreased during fiscal year as compared to fiscal year  due to decline in the margins of our amd and intel based products 
during fiscal year  gross margins declined primarily due to a charge against cost of revenue to cover anticipated customer warranty  repair  return  replacement and associated costs arising from a weak die packaging material set in certain versions of our previous generation mcp products used in notebook systems 
cpb 
the gross margin of our cpb increased during fiscal year as compared to fiscal year this increase was primarily due to changes in the product mix in our cpb product lines 
we experienced greater revenue decline in our lower margin cell phone and other handheld devices product lines as compared to higher margin sce transactions in the current year 
fiscal year vs 
fiscal year gpu business 
the gross margin of our gpu business increased during fiscal year as compared to fiscal year this increase was primarily due to increased sales of our geforce series gpus  which began selling in the third quarter of fiscal year our geforce series gpus generally have higher gross margins than our previous generations of gpus 
additionally  the more favorable costs of memory purchases during fiscal year  positively impacted our gross margin 
psb 
the gross margin of our psb increased during fiscal year as compared to fiscal year this increase was primarily due to increased sales of our geforce based nvidia quadro products  which began selling in the fourth quarter of fiscal year and generally have higher gross margins than our previous generations of nvidia quadro products 
mcp business 
the gross margin of our mcp business increased during fiscal year as compared to fiscal year this increase was primarily due to a shift in product mix towards intel based platform products  which began to ramp up shipments after the third quarter of fiscal year  and inventory reserves that we recorded as a charge to cost of revenue during the first quarter of fiscal year of approximately million related to certain nvidia nforce purchase commitments that we believed had exceeded future demand 
cpb 
the gross margin of our cpb decreased during fiscal year as compared to fiscal year this decrease was primarily due to a drop in gross profit realized from sales of our high end feature cellular phone and other handheld devices 
however  increased royalties from sce during fiscal year  offset the decreases

in order to remain competitive  we anticipate that we will continue to devote substantial resources to research and development 
research and development expenses are likely to fluctuate from time to time to the extent we make periodic incremental investments in research and development and these investments may be independent of our level of revenue 
sales  general and administrative fiscal year vs 
fiscal year sales  general and administrative expenses were million and million during fiscal years and  respectively  an increase of million  or

 accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities 
all of the cash equivalents and marketable securities are treated as available for sale under sfas no 
investments in both fixed rate and floating rate interest earning instruments carry a degree of interest rate risk 
fixed rate debt securities may have their market value adversely impacted due to a rise in interest rates  while floating rate securities may produce less income than expected if interest rates fall

we may suffer losses in principal if we are forced to sell securities that decline in market value due to changes in interest rates 
however  because any debt securities we hold are classified as available for sale  no gains or losses are realized in our statement of operations due to changes in interest rates unless such securities are sold prior to maturity or unless declines in market values are determined to be other than temporary

this was our portion of a payout of approximately of the total assets of the fund 
each shareholder s percentage of this distribution was determined by dividing the shareholder s total unfunded redeemed shares by the aggregate unfunded redeemed shares of the fund  which was then used to calculate the shareholder s pro rata portion of this distribution 
we expect to receive the proceeds of our remaining investment in the international reserve fund  excluding the million that we have recorded as an other than temporary impairment  by no later than october  when all of the underlying securities held by the international reserve fund are scheduled to have matured 
however  redemptions from the international reserve fund are currently subject to pending litigation  which could cause further delay in receipt of our funds 
our accounts receivable are highly concentrated and make us vulnerable to adverse changes in our customers businesses  and to downturns in the industry and the worldwide economy 
one customer accounted for approximately of our accounts receivable balance at january  while we strive to limit our exposure to uncollectible accounts receivable using a combination of credit insurance and letters of credit  difficulties in collecting accounts receivable could materially and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 
these difficulties are heightened during periods when economic conditions worsen 
we continue to work directly with more foreign customers and it may be difficult to collect accounts receivable from them 
we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
this allowance consists of an amount identified for specific customers and an amount based on overall estimated exposure 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment in their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required  we may be required to defer revenue recognition on sales to affected customers  and we may be required to pay higher credit insurance premiums  any of which could adversely affect our operating results 
in the future  we may have to record additional reserves or write offs and or defer revenue on certain sales transactions which could negatively impact our financial results 
cash tender offer on february   we announced that our board of directors approved a cash tender offer for certain employee stock options 
the tender offer commenced on february  and expired at midnight pacific time on march  the tender offer applied to outstanding stock options held by employees with an exercise price equal to or greater than per share 
none of the non employee members of our board of directors or our officers who file reports under section a of the securities exchange act of  including our former chief financial officer  marvin d 
burkett  were eligible to participate in the offer 
all eligible options with exercise prices less than per share  but not less than per share were eligible to receive a cash payment of per option in exchange for the cancellation of the eligible option 
all eligible options with exercise prices greater than per share were eligible to receive a cash payment of per option in exchange for the cancellation of the eligible option 
please refer to note for further discussion regarding the cash tender offer for certain employee stock options that our board of directors approved in february stock repurchase program during fiscal year  we announced that our board of directors  or board  had authorized a stock repurchase program to repurchase shares of our common stock  subject to certain specifications  up to an aggregate maximum amount of million 
during fiscal year  the board further approved an increase of million to the original stock repurchase program 
in fiscal year  we announced a stock repurchase program under which we may purchase up to an additional billion of our common stock over a three year period through may on august   we announced that our board further authorized an additional increase of billion to the stock repurchase program 
as a result of these increases  we have an ongoing authorization from the board  subject to certain specifications  to repurchase shares of our common stock up to an aggregate maximum amount of billion through may the repurchases will be made from time to time in the open market  in privately negotiated transactions  or in structured stock repurchase programs  and may be made in one or more larger repurchases  in compliance with the securities exchange act of  or the exchange act  rule b  subject to market conditions  applicable legal requirements  and other factors 
the program does not obligate nvidia to acquire any particular amount of common stock and the program may be suspended at any time at our discretion 
as part of our share repurchase program  we have entered into  and we may continue to enter into  structured share repurchase transactions with financial institutions 
these agreements generally require that we make an up front payment in exchange for the right to receive a fixed number of shares of our common stock upon execution of the agreement  and a potential incremental number of shares of our common stock  within a pre determined range  at the end of the term of the agreement 
during the three months ended january   we did not enter into any structured share repurchase transactions or otherwise purchase any shares of our common stock 
during fiscal year  we entered into structured share repurchase transactions to repurchase million shares for million  which we recorded on the trade date of the transactions 
through fiscal year  we have repurchased an aggregate of million shares under our stock repurchase program for a total cost of billion 
as of january   we are authorized  subject to certain specifications  to repurchase shares of our common stock up to an additional amount of billion through may operating capital and capital expenditure requirements 
we believe that our existing cash balances and anticipated cash flows from operations will be sufficient to meet our operating  acquisition and capital requirements for at least the next twelve months 
however  there is no assurance that we will not need to raise additional equity or debt financing within this time frame 
additional financing may not be available on favorable terms or at all and may be dilutive to our then current stockholders 
we also may require additional capital for other purposes not presently contemplated 
if we are unable to obtain sufficient capital  we could be required to curtail capital equipment purchases or research and development expenditures  which could harm our business 
factors that could affect our cash used or generated from operations and  as a result  our need to seek additional borrowings or capital include decreased demand and market acceptance for our products and or our customers products  inability to successfully develop and produce in volume production our next generation products  competitive pressures resulting in lower than expected average selling prices  and new product announcements or product introductions by our competitors 
we expect to spend approximately million to million for capital expenditures during fiscal year  primarily for property development  leasehold improvements  software licenses  emulation equipment  computers and engineering workstations 
in addition  we may continue to use cash in connection with the acquisition of new businesses or assets 
for additional factors see item a 
risk factors risks related to our business and industry our revenue may fluctuate while our operating expenses are relatively fixed  which makes our results difficult to predict and could cause our results to fall short of expectations 
dfx asset purchase on december   nvidia corporation and one of our indirect subsidiaries entered into an asset purchase agreement  or apa  which closed on april   to purchase certain graphics chip assets from dfx 
under the terms of the apa  the cash consideration due at the closing was million  less million that was loaned to dfx pursuant to a credit agreement dated december  the asset purchase agreement also provided  subject to the other provisions thereof  that if dfx properly certified that all its debts and other liabilities had been provided for  then we would have been obligated to pay dfx one million shares  which due to subsequent stock splits now totals six million shares  of nvidia common stock 
if dfx could not make such a certification  but instead properly certified that its debts and liabilities could be satisfied for less than million  then dfx could have elected to receive a cash payment equal to the amount of such debts and liabilities and a reduced number of shares of our common stock  with such reduction calculated by dividing the cash payment by per share 
if dfx could not certify that all of its debts and liabilities had been provided for  or could not be satisfied  for less than million  we would not be obligated under the agreement to pay any additional consideration for the assets 
in october  dfx filed for chapter bankruptcy protection in the united states bankruptcy court for the northern district of california 
in march  we were served with a complaint filed by the trustee appointed by the bankruptcy court which sought  among other things  payments from us as additional purchase price related to our purchase of certain assets of dfx 
in early november  after several months of mediation  nvidia and the official committee of unsecured creditors  or the creditors committee  agreed to a plan of liquidation of dfx  which included a conditional settlement of the trustee s claims against us 
this conditional settlement was subject to a confirmation process through a vote of creditors and the review and approval of the bankruptcy court 
the conditional settlement called for a payment by nvidia of approximately million to the dfx estate 
under the settlement  million related to various administrative expenses and trustee fees  and million related to the satisfaction of debts and liabilities owed to the general unsecured creditors of dfx 
accordingly  during the three month period ended october   we recorded million as a charge to settlement costs and million as additional purchase price for dfx 
the trustee advised that he intended to object to the settlement 
the conditional settlement never progressed substantially through the confirmation process 
on december   the bankruptcy court scheduled a trial for one portion of the trustee s case against nvidia 
on january   nvidia terminated the settlement agreement on grounds that the bankruptcy court had failed to proceed toward confirmation of the creditors committee s plan 
a non jury trial began on march  on valuation issues in the trustee s constructive fraudulent transfer claims against nvidia 
specifically  the bankruptcy court tried four questions what did dfx transfer to nvidia in the apa  of what was transferred  what qualifies as property subject to the bankruptcy court s avoidance powers under the uniform fraudulent transfer act and relevant bankruptcy code provisions  what is the fair market value of the property identified in answer to question  and was the million that nvidia paid reasonably equivalent to the fair market value of that property the parties completed post trial briefing on may  on april   the bankruptcy court issued its memorandum decision after trial  in which it provided a detailed summary of the trial proceedings and the parties contentions and evidence and concluded that the creditors of dfx were not injured by the transaction 
this decision did not entirely dispose of the trustee s action  however  as the trustee s claims for successor liability and intentional fraudulent conveyance were still pending 
on june   nvidia filed a motion for summary judgment to convert the memorandum decision after trial to a final judgment 
that motion was granted in its entirety and judgment was entered in nvidia s favor on september  the trustee filed a notice of appeal from that judgment on september   and on september   nvidia exercised its election to have the appeal heard by the united states district court  where the appeal is pending 
while the conditional settlement reached in november never progressed through the confirmation process  the trustee s case still remains pending appeal 
as such  we have not reversed the accrual of million million as a charge to settlement costs and million as additional purchase price for dfx that we recorded during the three months ended october   pending resolution of the appeal of the trustee s case 
we do not believe the resolution of this matter will have a material impact on our results of operations or financial position

product defect our products are complex and may contain defects or experience failures due to any number of issues in design  fabrication  packaging  materials and or use within a system 
if any of our products or technologies contains a defect  compatibility issue or other error  we may have to invest additional research and development efforts to find and correct the issue 
such efforts could divert our management s and engineers attention from the development of new products and technologies and could increase our operating costs and reduce our gross margin 
in addition  an error or defect in new products or releases or related software drivers after commencement of commercial shipments could result in failure to achieve market acceptance or loss of design wins 
also  we may be required to reimburse customers  including for customers costs to repair or replace the products in the field 
a product recall or a significant number of product returns could be expensive  damage our reputation and could result in the shifting of business to our competitors 
costs associated with correcting defects  errors  bugs or other issues could be significant and could materially harm our financial results 
in july  we recorded a million charge against cost of revenue to cover anticipated customer warranty  repair  return  replacement and other associated costs arising from a weak die packaging material set in certain versions of our previous generation mcp and gpu products used in notebook systems 
all of our newly manufactured products and all of our products that are currently shipping in volume have a different material set that we believe is more robust 
the previous generation mcp and gpu products that are impacted were included in a number of notebook products that were shipped and sold in significant quantities 
certain notebook configurations of these mcp and gpu products are failing in the field at higher than normal rates 
while we have not been able to determine a root cause for these failures  testing suggests a weak material set of die package combination  system thermal management designs  and customer use patterns are contributing factors 
we have worked with our customers to develop and have made available for download a software driver to cause the system fan to begin operation at the powering up of the system and reduce the thermal stress on these chips 
we have also recommended to our customers that they consider changing the thermal management of the mcp and gpu products in their notebook system designs 
we intend to fully support our customers in their repair and replacement of these impacted mcp and gpu products that fail  and their other efforts to mitigate the consequences of these failures 
we continue to engage in discussions with our supply chain regarding reimbursement to us for some or all of the costs we have incurred and may incur in the future relating to the weak material set 
we also continue to seek to access our insurance coverage  which provided us with million in related reimbursement during fiscal year however  there can be no assurance that we will recover any additional reimbursement 
we continue to not see any abnormal failure rates in any systems using nvidia products other than certain notebook configurations 
however  we are continuing to test and otherwise investigate other products 
there can be no assurance that we will not discover defects in other mcp or gpu products 
determining the amount of the million charge related to this issue required management to make estimates and judgments based on historical experience  test data and various other assumptions including estimated field failure rates that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
the results of these judgments formed the basis for our estimate of the total charge to cover anticipated customer warranty  repair  return and replacement and other associated costs 
however  if actual repair  return  replacement and other associated costs and or actual field failure rates exceed our estimates  we may be required to record additional reserves  which would increase our cost of revenue and materially harm our financial results 
in september  october and november  several putative class action lawsuits were filed against us  asserting various claims related to the impacted mcp and gpu products 
please refer to note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements in part iv  item of this form k for further information regarding this litigation

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk investment and interest rate risk as of january  and january   we had billion and billion  respectively  in cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities 
we invest in a variety of financial instruments  consisting principally of cash and cash equivalents  asset backed securities  commercial paper  mortgage backed securities issued by government sponsored enterprises  equity securities  money market funds and debt securities of corporations  municipalities and the united states government and its agencies 
as of january   we did not have any investments in auction rate preferred securities 
our investments are denominated in united states dollars 
we account for our investment instruments in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 or sfas no 
 accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities 
all of the cash equivalents and marketable securities are treated as available for sale under sfas no 
investments in both fixed rate and floating rate interest earning instruments carry a degree of interest rate risk 
fixed rate securities may have their market value adversely impacted due to a rise in interest rates  while floating rate securities may produce less income than expected if interest rates fall 
due in part to these factors  our future investment income may fall short of expectations due to changes in interest rates or if the decline in fair value of our publicly traded debt or equity investments is judged to be other than temporary 
we may suffer losses in principal if we are forced to sell securities that decline in securities market value due to changes in interest rates 
however  because any debt securities we hold are classified as available for sale  no gains or losses are realized in our consolidated statements of operations due to changes in interest rates unless such securities are sold prior to maturity or unless declines in value are determined to be other than temporary 
these securities are reported at fair value with the related unrealized gains and losses included in accumulated other comprehensive income loss  a component of stockholders equity  net of tax 
as of january   we performed a sensitivity analysis on our floating and fixed rate financial investments 
according to our analysis  parallel shifts in the yield curve of both plus or minus would result in changes in fair market values for these investments of approximately million 
the current financial turmoil affecting the banking system and financial markets and the possibility that financial institutions may consolidate or go out of business have resulted in a tightening in the credit markets  a low level of liquidity in many financial markets  and extreme volatility in fixed income  credit  currency and equity markets 
there could be a number of follow on effects from the credit crisis on our business  including insolvency of key suppliers resulting in product delays  inability of customers  including channel partners  to obtain credit to finance purchases of our products and or customer  including channel partner  insolvencies  and failure of financial institutions  which may negatively impact our treasury operations 
other income and expense could also vary materially from expectations depending on gains or losses realized on the sale or exchange of financial instruments  impairment charges related to debt securities as well as equity and other investments  interest rates  and cash  cash equivalent and marketable securities balances 
the current volatility in the financial markets and overall economic uncertainty increases the risk that the actual amounts realized in the future on our financial instruments could differ significantly from the fair values currently assigned to them 
for instance  we recorded other than temporary impairment charges of million during fiscal year these charges include million related to what we believe is an other than temporary impairment of our investment in the money market funds held by the reserve international liquidity fund  ltd  or international reserve fund  million related to a decline in the value of publicly traded equity securities and million related to debt securities held by us that were issued by companies that have filed for bankruptcy as of january  please refer to note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements in part iv  item of this form k for further details 
as of january   our investments in government agencies and government sponsored enterprises represented approximately of our total investment portfolio  while the financial sector accounted for approximately of our total investment portfolio 
substantially all of our investments are with a a or better rated securities with the substantial majority of the securities rated aa aa or better 
if the fair value of our investments in these sectors was to decline by  it would result in changes in fair market values for these investments by approximately million 
exchange rate risk we consider our direct exposure to foreign exchange rate fluctuations to be minimal 
gains or losses from foreign currency remeasurement are included in other income expense  net in our consolidated financial statements and to date have not been significant 
the impact of foreign currency transaction loss included in determining net income loss for fiscal years  and was million  million and million  respectively 
currently  sales and arrangements with third party manufacturers provide for pricing and payment in united states dollars  and  therefore  are not subject to exchange rate fluctuations 
increases in the value of the united states dollar relative to other currencies would make our products more expensive  which could negatively impact our ability to compete 
conversely  decreases in the value of the united states dollar relative to other currencies could result in our suppliers raising their prices in order to continue doing business with us 
fluctuations in currency exchange rates could harm our business in the future 
we may enter into certain transactions such as forward contracts which are designed to reduce the future potential impact resulting from changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
there were no forward exchange contracts outstanding at january
