critical accounting policies and estimates the company s results of operations and financial position are determined based upon the application of the company s accounting policies  as discussed in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
certain of the company s accounting policies represent a selection among acceptable alternatives under generally accepted accounting principles in the united states gaap 
in evaluating the company s transactions  management assesses all relevant gaap and chooses the accounting policy that most accurately reflects the nature of the transactions 
management has not determined how reported amounts would differ based on the application of different accounting policies 
management has also not determined the likelihood that materially different amounts could be reported under different conditions or using different assumptions 
the application of accounting policies requires the use of judgment and estimates 
as it relates to the company  estimates and forecasts are required to determine sales returns and reserves  rebate reserves  allowances for doubtful accounts  reserves for excess and obsolete inventory  investments in unconsolidated 
table of contents affiliates  the valuation of goodwill and other intangible assets  the allocation of purchase price for acquisitions  workers compensation liabilities  employee benefit related liabilities  income taxes  any impairments of assets  forecasted transactions to be hedged  litigation reserves  and contingencies 
these matters that are subject to judgments and estimation are inherently uncertain  and different amounts could be reported using different assumptions and estimates 
management uses its best estimates and judgments in determining the appropriate amount to reflect in the consolidated financial statements  using historical experience and all available information 
the company also uses outside experts where appropriate 
the company applies estimation methodologies consistently from year to year 
the company believes the following are the critical accounting policies which could have the most significant effect on the company s reported results and require subjective or complex judgments by management 
revenue recognition the company recognizes revenue when it is realized or realizable and earned 
revenue is considered realized or realizable and earned upon delivery of the product  provided that an agreement of sale exists  the sales price is fixed or determinable and collection is reasonably assured 
in the case of certain products where the company maintains consigned inventory at customer locations  revenue is recognized at the time the company is notified that the customer has used the inventory 
the company s sales terms are standard terms within the medical device industry  with title and risk of loss transferring upon delivery to the customer  limited right of return  and no unusual provisions or conditions 
when the company recognizes revenue from the sale of its products  an estimate of various sales returns and allowances is recorded which reduces product sales and accounts receivable 
these adjustments include estimates for rebates  returns  and other sales allowances 
these provisions are estimated and recorded at the time of sale based upon historical payment experience  historical relationship to revenues  estimated customer inventory levels  and current contract sales terms with direct and indirect customers 
if the historical data and inventory estimates used to calculate these provisions do not approximate future activity  the company s financial position  results of operations  and cash flows could be impacted 
the company s estimates are subject to inherent limitations of estimates that are based on third party data  as certain third party information was itself in the form of estimates  and reflect other limitations 
the company s primary sales adjustment relates to distributor rebates which are given to the company s united states distributors and represents the difference between the company s sales price to the distributor at the company s distributor list price and the negotiated price to be paid by the end customer 
this distributor rebate is recorded by the company as a reduction to sales and a reduction to the distributor s accounts receivable at the time of sale to a distributor 
the company validates the distributor rebate accrual quarterly through a review of the inventory reports obtained from the largest distributors 
this customer inventory information is used to verify the estimated liability for future distributor rebate claims based on historical rebates and contract rates 
the company continually monitors current pricing trends and distributor inventory levels to ensure the liability for future distributor rebates is fairly stated 
the company also offers volume rebates to certain gpos and customers based upon target sales levels 
these volume rebates are recorded as a reduction to sales and an obligation to the gpo 
the provision for volume rebates is estimated based on customers contracted rebate programs and historical experience of rebates paid 
the company continually monitors its customer rebate programs to ensure that the liability for accrued rebates is fairly stated 
product returns are not significant because returns are generally not allowed unless the product is damaged at time of receipt 
an allowance for return of damaged products is established based on historical experience and recorded as a reduction of sales 

table of contents allowance for doubtful accounts the company records allowances for doubtful accounts based on customer specific analysis and general matters such as current assessments of past due balances and economic conditions 
additional allowances for doubtful accounts may be required if there is deterioration in past due balances  if economic conditions are less favorable than the company has anticipated  or for customer specific circumstances  such as financial difficulty 
the allowance for doubtful accounts was million and million at december  and  respectively 
excess and obsolete inventory the company records allowances for excess and obsolete inventory based on historical and estimated future demand and market conditions 
additional inventory allowances may be required if future demand or market conditions are less favorable than the company has estimated 
inventory reserves result from inventory which is obsolete  nearing its expiration date generally triggered at six months prior to expiration  is damaged  or slow moving defined as quantities in excess of a two year supply 
the allowance for excess and obsolete inventory was million and million at december  and  respectively 
patent costs the company expenses legal costs incurred for patent preparation and applications 
the company capitalizes certain legal costs related to the defense and enforcement of issued patents and trademarks 
these capitalized legal costs are amortized over the life of the related patent or trademark 
such legal costs are periodically reviewed for impairment and recoverability 
impairment of long lived assets the company evaluates the carrying value of goodwill in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year 
in evaluating goodwill  the company completes the two step goodwill impairment test as required by sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas 
the company identifies its reporting units and determines the carrying value of each reporting unit by assigning the assets and liabilities  including existing goodwill  to those reporting units 
the fair value of the reporting unit is estimated based on the market capitalization and a market revenue multiple 
if the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value  the company will perform the second step of the impairment test to measure the amount of impairment loss  if any 
the second step of the goodwill impairment test compares the implied fair value of a reporting unit s goodwill with its carrying value 
since the adoption of sfas  the company has not performed the second step of the impairment test as the fair value of each reporting unit has exceeded its respective carrying value 
additionally  in accordance with sfas and sfas  management reviews the carrying amounts of other intangible and long lived tangible assets whenever events and circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts of an asset may not be recoverable 
impairment indicators include  among other conditions  cash flow deficits  historic or anticipated declines in revenue or operating profit  and adverse legal or regulatory developments 
if it is determined that such indicators are present and the review indicates that the assets will not be fully recoverable  based on undiscounted estimated cash flows over the remaining amortization periods  their carrying values are reduced to estimated fair market value 
estimated fair market value is determined primarily using the anticipated cash flows discounted at a rate commensurate with the risk involved 
for the purposes of identifying and measuring impairment  long lived assets are grouped with other assets and liabilities at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities 

table of contents investments in unconsolidated affiliates investments in unconsolidated affiliates are long term  strategic equity investments in companies that are in various stages of development

 accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities sfas 
these investments are carried at fair market value  with unrealized gains and losses reported in stockholders equity as accumulated other comprehensive loss income

other investments in unconsolidated affiliates are accounted for under the cost or the equity method of accounting  as appropriate 
the company accounts for investments in limited partnerships or limited liability corporations  whereby the company owns a minimum of of the investee s outstanding voting stock  under the equity method of accounting 
these investments are recorded at the amount of the company s investment and adjusted each period for the company s share of the investee s income or loss and dividends paid 
as investments accounted for under the cost method do not have readily determinable fair value  the company only estimates fair value if there are identified events or changes in circumstances that could have a significant adverse effect on the investment s fair value 
when the fair value of an available for sale investment declines below cost  management uses the following criteria to determine if such a decline should be considered other than temporary and result in a recognized loss the duration and extent to which the market value has been less than cost  the financial condition and near term prospects of the investee  the reasons for the decline in market value  the investee s performance against product development milestones  and the company s ability and intent to hold the investment for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in market value

 accounting for income taxes sfas 
under these guidelines  deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in the company s financial statements or tax returns 
the company evaluates quarterly the realizability of its deferred tax assets by assessing its valuation allowance and by adjusting the amount of such allowance  if necessary 
the factors used to assess the likelihood of realization are the company s forecast of future taxable income and available tax planning strategies that could be implemented to realize the net deferred tax assets 
failure to achieve forecasted taxable income in the applicable taxing jurisdictions could affect the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets and could result in an increase in the company s effective tax rate on future earnings

fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date 
in determining fair value  the company uses various valuation approaches  including market  income and or cost approaches  and considers the principal or most advantageous market in which it would transact and assumptions that market participants would use when pricing the asset or liability 
upon adoption of sfas  the company applied the following fair value hierarchy level quoted market prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities 
level inputs  other than quoted prices in active markets  that are observable  either directly or indirectly 
level unobservable inputs that are not corroborated by market data 
in certain cases  the inputs used to measure fair value may fall into different levels of the fair value hierarchy 
in such cases  the level in the fair value hierarchy within which the fair value measurement in its entirety falls has been determined based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety 
when possible  the company looks to active and observable markets to price identical assets or liabilities 
when identical assets or liabilities are not traded in active markets  the company looks to market observable data for similar assets and liabilities 
if observable market prices are unavailable or impracticable to obtain  the company must use alternative valuation techniques to derive a fair value measurement 
the company has procedures to independently verify and test valuations received from third parties 
the financial assets and liabilities that the company records at fair value include investments in marketable securities  residual interests in securitizations  and derivative instruments 
investments in marketable securities bank of america columbia strategic cash fund the company holds an investment in the bank of america columbia strategic cash fund  a private placement money market mutual fund  which was closed to new subscriptions or redemptions in december  resulting in the company s inability to immediately redeem its investments for cash 
the fair value of the company s remaining investment in this fund was estimated based on the net asset value of the fund 
as of december   the net asset value of the fund was of par 
the fair value of the underlying securities held by the fund was determined based on quoted market prices or broker quotes  when possible 
in the absence of observable market quotations  the underlying securities were valued based on alternative valuation techniques using inputs that may not be observable 

table of contents in these cases  the fair value was based on available information believed to be reliable  which may be affected by conditions in the financial markets 
different market participants may reach different opinions as to the value of any particular security based on their varying market outlooks  the market information available to them  and the particular circumstances of their portfolios 
a decrease in the net asset value of  or basis points  would result in a decrease of approximately million in the investment fair value

the company estimates the fair value of the residual interest using the net carrying amount of the accounts receivables less the discount paid on the sale of the receivables 
this amount is calculated using future expected credit losses and calculated contractual rebates to distributors to determine the future expected cash flows  which generally approximate fair value given the securitized portfolio s short term weighted average life 
reserves for credit losses included in the allowance for doubtful accounts are adjusted based on management s assessment of recovery 
the united states securitization program was terminated in august and all receivables sold under this facility were repurchased by the company

the company s calculated var at december  and with a maturity of up to one year  was million and million  respectively

it does not represent the maximum possible loss or any expected loss that may occur 
actual future gains or losses may differ from and could be significantly greater than these estimates based upon actual fluctuations in market rates  operating exposures and the timing thereof  and changes in the company s portfolio of derivatives during the measured periods 
in addition  the assumption within the var model is that changes in currency exchange rates are adverse  which may not be the case
