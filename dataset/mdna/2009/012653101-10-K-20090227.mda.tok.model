risk factors 
you should consider carefully the following risks when reading the information  including the financial information  contained in this annual report on form k 
adverse conditions in the global economy and the volatility and disruption of financial markets could negatively impact our customers and suppliers and therefore have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
the global economic downturn may reduce customer demand or inhibit our ability to produce our products  negatively impacting our operating results 
our business and operating results have been and will continue to be affected by the global recession  including the credit market crisis  declining consumer and business confidence  fluctuating commodity prices  volatile exchange rates  and other challenges currently affecting the global economy 
our customers may experience deterioration of their businesses  cash flow shortages  and difficulty obtaining financing 
as a result  existing or potential customers may delay or cancel plans to purchase products and may not be able to fulfill their obligations in a timely fashion 
further  suppliers may be experiencing similar conditions  which could impact their ability to fulfill their obligations to us 
if the global recession continues for significant future periods or deteriorates significantly  our results of operations  financial condition and cash flows could be materially adversely affected 
volatility and disruption of financial markets could affect access to credit 
the current difficult economic market environment is causing contraction in the availability of credit in the marketplace 
this could potentially reduce our sources of liquidity and our customers sources of liquidity 
our inability to pass through increases in costs and expenses for raw materials and energy  on a timely basis or at all  could have a material adverse effect on the margins of our products 
our raw material and energy costs can be volatile and may increase significantly 
increases are primarily driven by significantly tighter market conditions and major increases in pricing of basic building blocks for our products such as crude oil  chlorine and metals  including molybdenum  which is used in the refinery catalysts business 
we generally attempt to pass changes in the prices of raw materials and energy to our customers  but we may be unable to or be delayed in doing so 
our inability to pass through price increases or any limitation or delay in our passing through price increases could adversely affect our margins 
in addition to raising prices  raw material suppliers may extend lead times or limit supplies 
constraints on the supply or delivery of critical raw materials could disrupt production and adversely affect the performance of our business 
we face competition from other specialty chemical companies  which places downward pressure on the prices and margins of our products 
we operate in a highly competitive marketplace  competing against a number of domestic and foreign specialty chemical producers 
competition is based on several key criteria  including product performance and quality  product price  product availability and security of supply  responsiveness of product development in cooperation with customers and customer service 
some of our competitors are larger than we are and may have greater financial resources 
these competitors may also be able to maintain significantly greater operating and financial flexibility than we do 
as a result  these competitors may be better able to withstand changes in conditions within our industry  changes in the prices of raw materials and energy and in general economic conditions 
additionally  competitors pricing decisions could compel us to decrease our prices  which could affect our margins and profitability adversely 
our ability to maintain or increase our profitability is  and will continue to be  dependent upon our ability to offset decreases in the prices and margins of our products by improving production efficiency and volume  shifting to higher margin chemical products and improving existing products through innovation and research and development 
if we are unable to do so or to otherwise maintain our competitive position  we could lose market share to our competitors 
downturns in our customers cyclical industries could adversely affect our sales and profitability 
downturns in the businesses that use our specialty chemicals will adversely affect our sales 
many of our customers are in industries  including the electronics  building and construction  and automotive industries  that are cyclical in nature and sensitive to changes in general economic conditions 
historically  downturns in general economic conditions have resulted in diminished product demand  excess manufacturing capacity and lower average selling prices  and we may experience similar problems in the future 
a decline in economic conditions in our customers cyclical industries may have a material adverse effect on our sales and profitability 
our results are subject to fluctuation because of irregularities in the demand for our hpc catalysts and certain of our agrichemicals 
our hpc catalysts are used by petroleum refiners in their processing units to reduce the quantity of sulfur and other impurities in petroleum products 
the effectiveness of hpc catalysts diminishes with use  requiring the hpc catalysts to be replaced  on average  once every one to three years 
the sales of our hpc catalysts  therefore  are largely dependent on the useful life cycle of the hpc catalysts in the processing units and may vary materially by quarter 
in addition  the timing and profitability of hpc catalysts sales can have a significant impact on revenue and profit in any one quarter 
sales of our agrichemicals are also subject to fluctuation as demand varies depending on climate and other environmental conditions  which may prevent farming for extended periods 
in addition  crop pricing and when farms alternate from one crop to another crop in a particular year  can also alter sales of agrichemicals 

table of contents albemarle corporation and subsidiaries changes in our customers products can reduce the demand for our specialty chemicals 
our customers use our specialty chemicals for a broad range of applications 
changes in our customers products or processes may enable our customers to reduce consumption of the specialty chemicals that we produce or make our specialty chemicals unnecessary 
customers may also find alternative materials or processes that no longer require our products 
for example  many of our flame retardants are incorporated into resin systems to enhance the flame retardancy of a particular polymer 
should a customer decide to use a different polymer due to price  performance or other considerations  we may not be able to supply a product that meets the customer s new requirements 
consequently  it is important that we develop new products to replace the sales of products that mature and decline in use 
our business  results of operations  cash flows and margins could be materially adversely affected if we are unable to manage successfully the maturation of our existing products and the introduction of new products 
our research and development efforts may not succeed and our competitors may develop more effective or successful products 
the specialty chemicals industry is subject to periodic technological change and ongoing product improvements 
in order to maintain our margins and remain competitive  we must successfully develop  manufacture and market new or improved products 
as a result  we must commit substantial resources each year to research and development 
ongoing investments in research and development for future products could result in higher costs without a proportional increase in revenues 
additionally  for any new product program  there is a risk of technical or market failure in which case we may not be able to develop the new commercial products needed to maintain our competitive position or we may need to commit additional resources to new product development programs 
moreover  new products may have lower margins than the products they replace 
we also expect competition to increase as our competitors develop and introduce new and enhanced products 
for example  our fine chemicals segment is experiencing increased competition from large scale producers of pharmachemicals  particularly from asian sources 
in our catalysts segment  our petroleum refinery customers are processing crude oil feedstocks of declining quality  while at the same time operating under increasingly stringent regulations requiring the gasoline  diesel and other fuels they produce to contain fewer impurities  including sulfur 
as a result  our petroleum refining customers are demanding more effective and efficient catalysts products 
as new products enter the market  our products may become obsolete or competitors products may be marketed more effectively than our products 
if we fail to develop new products  maintain or improve our margins with our new products or keep pace with technological developments  our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows will suffer 
our inability to protect our intellectual property rights could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
protection of our proprietary processes  methods and compounds and other technology is important to our business 
we generally rely on patent  trade secret  trademark and copyright laws of the us and certain other countries in which our products are produced or sold  as well as licenses and nondisclosure and confidentiality agreements  to protect our intellectual property rights 
the patent  trade secret  trademark and copyright laws of some countries may not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the us failure to protect our intellectual property rights may result in the loss of valuable proprietary technologies 
additionally  some of our technologies are not covered by any patent or patent application and  even if a patent application has been filed  it may not result in an issued patent 
if patents are issued to us  those patents may not provide meaningful protection against competitors or against competitive technologies 
we cannot assure you that our intellectual property rights will not be challenged  invalidated  circumvented or rendered unenforceable 
we could face patent infringement claims from our competitors or others alleging that our processes or products infringe on their proprietary technologies 
if we are found to be infringing on the proprietary technology of others  we may be liable for damages  and we may be required to change our processes  to redesign our products partially or completely  to pay to use the technology of others or to stop using certain technologies or producing the infringing product entirely 
even if we ultimately prevail in an infringement suit  the existence of the suit could prompt customers to switch to products that are not the subject of infringement suits 
we may not prevail in any intellectual property litigation and such litigation may result in significant legal costs or otherwise impede our ability to produce and distribute key products 
we also rely upon unpatented proprietary manufacturing expertise  continuing technological innovation and other trade secrets to develop and maintain our competitive position 
while we generally enter into confidentiality agreements with our employees and third parties to protect our intellectual property  we cannot assure you that our confidentiality agreements will not be breached  that they will provide meaningful protection for our trade secrets and proprietary manufacturing expertise or that adequate remedies will be available in the event of an unauthorized use or disclosure of our trade secrets or manufacturing expertise 

table of contents albemarle corporation and subsidiaries our substantial international operations subject us to risks of doing business in foreign countries  which could adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we conduct a substantial portion of our business outside of the united states 
we and our joint ventures currently have approximately facilities located outside the united states  including facilities and offices located in austria  australia  belgium  brazil  france  germany  italy  japan  jordan  korea  the netherlands  the people s republic of china  russia  saudi arabia  singapore  united arab emirates and the united kingdom 
we expect sales from international markets to continue to represent a significant portion of our net sales and the net sales of our joint ventures 
accordingly  our business is subject to risks related to the differing legal  political  social and regulatory requirements and economic conditions of many jurisdictions 
risks inherent in international operations include the following fluctuations in exchange rates may affect product demand and may adversely affect the profitability in us dollars of products and services we provide in international markets where payment for our products and services is made in the local currency  transportation and other shipping costs may increase  intellectual property rights may be more difficult to enforce  foreign countries may impose additional withholding taxes or otherwise tax our foreign income  or adopt other restrictions on foreign trade or investment  including currency exchange controls  unexpected adverse changes in foreign laws or regulatory requirements may occur  agreements may be difficult to enforce and receivables difficult to collect  compliance with a variety of foreign laws and regulations may be burdensome  unexpected adverse changes in export duties  quotas and tariffs and difficulties in obtaining export licenses  general economic conditions in the countries in which we operate could have an adverse effect on our earnings from operations in those countries  foreign operations may experience staffing difficulties and labor disputes  foreign governments may nationalize private enterprises  and our business and profitability in a particular country could be affected by political or economic repercussions on a domestic  country specific or global level from terrorist activities and the response to such activities 
in addition  certain of our joint ventures operate in high risk regions of the world such as the middle east and south america 
unanticipated events  such as geopolitical changes  could result in a write down of our investment in the affected joint venture 
our success as a global business will depend  in part  upon our ability to succeed in differing legal  regulatory  economic  social and political conditions by developing  implementing and maintaining policies and strategies that are effective in each location where we and our joint ventures do business 
we are exposed to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates  which may adversely affect our operating results and net income 
we conduct our business and incur costs in the local currency of most of the countries in which we operate 
the financial condition and results of operations of each foreign operating subsidiary and joint venture are reported in the relevant local currency and then translated to us dollars at the applicable currency exchange rate for inclusion in our consolidated financial statements 
changes in exchange rates between these foreign currencies and the us dollar will affect the recorded levels of our assets and liabilities as foreign assets and liabilities that are translated into us dollars for presentation in our financial statements as well as our net sales  cost of goods sold and operating margins and could result in exchange losses 
the primary currencies for which we have foreign currency rate exposure are the european union euro  japanese yen  british pound sterling  brazilian real  korean won and the us dollar in certain of its foreign locations 
exchange rates between these currencies and the us dollar in recent years have fluctuated significantly and may do so in the future 
significant changes in these foreign currencies relative to the us dollar could also have an adverse effect on our ability to meet interest and principal payments on any foreign currency denominated debt outstanding 
in addition to currency translation risks  we incur currency transaction risks whenever one of our operating subsidiaries or joint ventures enters into either a purchase or a sales transaction using a different currency from the currency in which it receives revenues 
our operating results and net income may be affected by any volatility in currency exchange rates and our ability to manage effectively our currency transaction and translation risks 

table of contents albemarle corporation and subsidiaries we incur substantial costs in order to comply with extensive environmental  health and safety laws and regulations 
in the jurisdictions in which we operate  we are subject to numerous federal  state and local environmental  health and safety laws and regulations  including those governing the discharge of pollutants into the air and water  the management and disposal of hazardous substances and wastes and the cleanup of contaminated properties 
ongoing compliance with such laws and regulations is an important consideration for us and we incur substantial capital and operating costs in our compliance efforts 
environmental laws have become increasingly strict in recent years 
we expect this trend to continue and anticipate that compliance will continue to require increased capital expenditures and operating costs 
violations of environmental  health and safety laws and regulations may subject us to fines  penalties and other liabilities and may require us to change certain business practices 
if we violate environmental  health and safety laws or regulations  in addition to being required to correct such violations  we can be held liable in administrative  civil or criminal proceedings for substantial fines and other sanctions could be imposed that could disrupt or limit our operations 
liabilities associated with the investigation and cleanup of hazardous substances  as well as personal injury  property damages or natural resource damages arising from the release of  or exposure to  such hazardous substances  may be imposed in many situations without regard to violations of laws or regulations or other fault  and may also be imposed jointly and severally so that a responsible party may be held liable for more than its share of the losses involved  or even the entire loss 
such liabilities may also be imposed on many different entities with a relationship to the hazardous substances at issue  including  for example  entities that formerly owned or operated the property affected by the hazardous substances and entities that arranged for the disposal of the hazardous substances at the affected property  as well as entities that currently own or operate such property 
such liabilities can be difficult to identify and the extent of any such liabilities can be difficult to predict 
we use  and in the past have used  hazardous substances at many of our facilities  and we have in the past  and may in the future  be subject to claims relating to exposure to hazardous materials and the associated liabilities may be material 
we also have generated  and continue to generate  hazardous wastes at a number of our facilities 
some of our facilities also have lengthy histories of manufacturing or other activities that have resulted in site contamination 
we have also given contractual indemnities for environmental conditions relating to facilities we no longer own or operate 
the nature of our business  including historical operations at our current and former facilities  exposes us to risks of liability under these laws and regulations due to the production  storage  use  transportation and sale of materials that can cause contamination or personal injury if released into the environment 
additional information may arise in the future concerning the nature or extent of our liability with respect to identified sites  and additional sites may be identified for which we are alleged to be liable  that could cause us to materially increase our environmental accrual or the upper range of the costs we believe we could reasonably incur for such matters 
contractual indemnities may be ineffective in protecting us from environmental liabilities 
at several of our properties where hazardous substances are known to exist including some sites where hazardous substances are being investigated or remediated  we believe we are entitled to contractual indemnification from one or more former owners or operators  however  in the event we make a claim  the indemnifier may disagree with us 
if our contractual indemnity is not upheld  our accrual and or our costs for the investigation and cleanup of hazardous substances could increase materially 
regulation  or the threat of regulation  of some of our products could have an adverse effect on our sales and profitability 
we manufacture or market a number of products that are or have been the subject of attention by regulatory authorities and environmental interest groups 
for example  for many years we have marketed methyl bromide  a chemical that is particularly effective as a soil fumigant 
in recent years  the market for methyl bromide has changed significantly  driven by the montreal protocol of and related regulation prompted by findings regarding the chemical s potential to deplete the ozone layer 
completion of the phase out of methyl bromide as a fumigant took effect january  with continued use for critical uses allowed on an annual basis until feasible alternatives are available 
recently  there has been increased scrutiny by regulatory authorities  legislative bodies and environmental interest groups in various countries in the world of certain brominated flame retardants 
we manufacture a broad range of brominated flame retardant products  which are used in a variety of applications 
concern about the impact of some of our products on human health or the environment may lead to regulation  or reaction in our markets independent of regulation  that could reduce or eliminate markets for such products 
in the us  a number of state legislatures are considering draft legislation  which would impose limitations on  or prohibit the use of  certain brominated flame retardants for specific applications 
for example  in  the state of washington passed a law that bans the use of decabromodiphenyl ether as a flame retardant in mattresses after january  and in televisions  computers and residential upholstered furniture after january  if a safer and technically feasible alternative is discovered 
the washington state department of ecology published a draft report in november that concluded that such alternatives exist 
the state of maine passed a bill that bans the use of decabromodiphenyl ether as a flame retardant in mattresses  mattress pads and textiles used in residential furniture after january  and in the casings of televisions and computers after january  similar bills are currently under consideration in a number of other states  and we expect additional states to consider similar measures in the future 

table of contents albemarle corporation and subsidiaries additionally  agencies in the european union continue to evaluate the risks to human health and the environment associated with certain brominated flame retardants  including decabromodiphenyl ether  hexabromocyclododecane and tetrabromobisphenol a 
we manufacture each of these brominated flame retardants 
the only brominated flame retardant that we currently sell that has been banned for specified applications to date is decabromodiphenyl ether  which was banned for limited applications in the states of washington and maine as described above 
norway restricted decabromodiphenyl ether in april  except for certain transportation applications 
on april  the european court of justice annulled the exemption of decabromodiphenyl ether from the rohs directive  ruling that the european commission had followed an incorrect procedure when adopting the exemption 
as a consequence  the use of decabromodiphenyl ether in electrical and electronic equipment was banned in the european union effective july  in  approximately of our net sales were derived from decabromodiphenyl ether 
none of these legislative restrictions has caused or is expected to cause a significant adverse effect on our profitability 
additional government regulations  including limitations or bans on the use of brominated flame retardants  would likely result in a decline in our net sales of brominated flame retardants and have an adverse effect on our sales and profitability 
in addition  the threat of additional regulation or concern about the impact of brominated flame retardants on human health or the environment could lead to a negative reaction in our markets that could reduce or eliminate our markets for these products  which could have an adverse effect on our sales and profitability 
we could be subject to damages based on claims brought against us by our customers or lose customers as a result of the failure of our products to meet certain quality specifications 
our products provide important performance attributes to our customers products 
if a product fails to perform in a manner consistent with quality specifications or has a shorter useful life than guaranteed  a customer could seek replacement of the product or damages for costs incurred as a result of the product failing to perform as guaranteed 
these risks apply to our refinery catalysts in particular because  in certain instances  we sell our refinery catalysts under agreements that contain limited performance and life cycle guarantees 
a successful claim or series of claims against us could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations and could result in a loss of one or more customers 
we will need a significant amount of cash to service our indebtedness and our ability to generate cash depends on many factors beyond our control 
our ability to generate sufficient cash flow from operations to make scheduled payments on our debt depends on a range of economic  competitive and business factors  many of which are outside our control 
based on an average interest rate of and outstanding borrowings at february  of million  our annual interest expense would be approximately million 
a hypothetical change approximately basis points in the average interest rate applicable to our total borrowings would change our annualized interest expense by approximately million 
our business may not generate sufficient cash flow from operations to service our debt obligations  particularly if currently anticipated cost savings and operating improvements are not realized on schedule or at all 
if we are unable to service our debt obligations  we may need to refinance all or a portion of our indebtedness on or before maturity  reduce or delay capital expenditures  sell assets or raise additional equity 
we may not be able to refinance any of our indebtedness  sell assets or raise additional equity on commercially reasonable terms or at all  which could cause us to default on our obligations and impair our liquidity 
our inability to generate sufficient cash flow to satisfy our debt obligations  or to refinance our obligations on commercially reasonable terms  could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition 
conditions in the global credit markets have been volatile in recent months 
continued volatility and more stringent credit standards could impact our ability to refinance our obligations on commercially reasonable terms and could result in a material adverse effect on our business or financial condition 
while current conditions in the global credit markets have affected some borrowers ability to raise additional capital or to refinance existing obligations  to date  the volatility in the global credit markets has had limited impact on us 
we exchanged and extended the maturity of our senior credit agreement in early  before the current volatility manifested 
as a result  currently  we do not have any significant obligation maturity before  when our march credit agreement matures 
existing availability under existing committed credit facilities are expected to be sufficient for our working capital and capital expenditure needs 
restrictive covenants in our debt instruments may adversely affect our business 
our march credit agreement and the indenture governing the senior notes contain restrictive covenants 
these covenants provide constraints on our financial flexibility 
the failure to comply with the covenants in our march credit agreement  the indenture governing the senior notes and the agreements governing other indebtedness  including indebtedness incurred in the future  
table of contents albemarle corporation and subsidiaries could result in an event of default  which  if not cured or waived  could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
see financial condition and liquidity long term debt in item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations on page notably  while we have agreed upon rates and terms under our march credit agreement  there is a risk that our banks might require us to renegotiate certain terms of our credit agreement should we need to raise additional debt for acquisitions or general corporate needs 
a downgrading of the ratings on our debt or an increase in interest rates will cause our debt service obligations to increase 
borrowings under our march credit agreement bear interest at floating rates 
the rates are subject to adjustment based on the ratings of our senior unsecured long term debt by standard poor s ratings services  or s p  and moody s investors services  or moody s 
s p has rated our senior unsecured long term debt as bbb and moody s has rated our senior unsecured long term debt as baa s p and or moody s may  in the future  downgrade our ratings 
the downgrading of our ratings or an increase in benchmark interest rates would result in an increase of our interest expense on borrowings under our march credit agreement 
in addition  the downgrading of our ratings could adversely affect our future ability to obtain funding or materially increase the cost of any additional funding 
these rating services have maintained our ratings outlook as stable  however  any of the events described above could negatively affect our ratings outlook 
our business is subject to hazards common to chemical businesses  any of which could interrupt our production and adversely affect our results of operations 
our business is subject to hazards common to chemical manufacturing  storage  handling and transportation  including explosions  fires  inclement weather  natural disasters  mechanical failure  unscheduled downtime  transportation interruptions  remediation  chemical spills  discharges or releases of toxic or hazardous substances or gases and other risks 
these hazards can cause personal injury and loss of life  severe damage to  or destruction of  property and equipment and environmental contamination 
in addition  the occurrence of material operating problems at our facilities due to any of these hazards may diminish our ability to meet our output goals 
accordingly  these hazards  and their consequences could have a material adverse effect on our operations as a whole  including our results of operations and cash flows  both during and after the period of operational difficulties 
weather related matters could impact our results of operations 
in and again in the third quarter of  major hurricanes caused significant disruption to the operations on the us gulf coast for many of our customers and our suppliers of certain raw materials  which had an adverse impact on volume and cost for some of our products 
if similar weather related matters occur in the future  it could negatively affect our results of operations at our sites in this region 
the insurance that we maintain may not fully cover all potential exposures 
we maintain property  business interruption and casualty insurance but such insurance may not cover all risks associated with the hazards of our business and is subject to limitations  including deductibles and maximum liabilities covered 
we may incur losses beyond the limits  or outside the coverage  of our insurance policies  including liabilities for environmental remediation 
in addition  from time to time  various types of insurance for companies in the specialty chemical industry have not been available on commercially acceptable terms or  in some cases  have not been available at all 
we are potentially at risk if one or more of our insurance carriers fails 
additionally  severe disruptions in the domestic and global financial markets could adversely impact the ratings and survival of some insurers 
future downgrades in the ratings of enough insurers could adversely impact both the availability of appropriate insurance coverage and its cost 
in the future  we may not be able to obtain coverage at current levels  and our premiums may increase significantly on coverage that we maintain 
we may incur significant charges in the event we close all or part of a manufacturing plant or facility 
we periodically assess our manufacturing operations in order to manufacture and distribute our products in the most efficient manner 
based on our assessments  we may make capital improvements to modernize certain units  move manufacturing or distribution capabilities from one plant or facility to another plant or facility  discontinue manufacturing or distributing certain products or close all or part of a manufacturing plant or facility 
we also have shared services agreements at several of our plants and if such agreements are terminated or revised  we would assess and potentially adjust our manufacturing operations 
the closure of all or part of a manufacturing plant or facility could result in future charges which could be significant 
if we are unable to retain key personnel or attract new skilled personnel  it could have an adverse effect on our business 
the unanticipated departure of any key member of our management team could have an adverse effect on our business 
in addition  because of the specialized and technical nature of our business  our future performance is dependent on the continued service of  and on our ability to attract and retain  qualified management  scientific  technical  marketing and support personnel 
competition for such personnel is intense  and we may be unable to continue to attract or retain such personnel 

table of contents albemarle corporation and subsidiaries some of our employees are unionized  represented by workers councils or are employed subject to local laws that are less favorable to employers than the laws of the united states 
as of december   we had  employees 
approximately of our  us employees are unionized 
our collective bargaining agreements expire in and in addition  a large number of our employees are employed in countries in which employment laws provide greater bargaining or other rights to employees than the laws of the us such employment rights require us to work collaboratively with the legal representatives of the employees to effect any changes to labor arrangements 
for example  most of our employees in europe are represented by workers councils that must approve any changes in conditions of employment  including salaries and benefits and staff changes  and may impede efforts to restructure our workforce 
although we believe that we have a good working relationship with our employees  a strike  work stoppage or slowdown by our employees or significant dispute with our employees could result in a significant disruption of our operations or higher ongoing labor costs 
our joint ventures may not operate according to their business plans if our partners fail to fulfill their obligations  which may adversely affect our results of operations and may force us to dedicate additional resources to these joint ventures 
we currently participate in a number of joint ventures and may enter into additional joint ventures in the future 
the nature of a joint venture requires us to share control with unaffiliated third parties 
if our joint venture partners do not fulfill their obligations  the affected joint venture may not be able to operate according to its business plan 
in that case  our results of operations may be adversely affected and we may be required to increase the level of our commitment to the joint venture 
also  differences in views among joint venture participants may result in delayed decisions or failures to agree on major issues 
if these differences cause the joint ventures to deviate from their business plans  our results of operations could be adversely affected 
we may not be able to consummate future acquisitions or integrate future acquisitions into our business  which could result in unanticipated expenses and losses 
as part of our business growth strategy  we have acquired businesses and entered into joint ventures in the past and intend to pursue acquisitions and joint venture opportunities in the future 
our ability to implement this component of our growth strategy will be limited by our ability to identify appropriate acquisition or joint venture candidates and our financial resources  including available cash and borrowing capacity 
the expense incurred in consummating acquisitions or entering into joint ventures  the time it takes to integrate an acquisition or our failure to integrate businesses successfully  could result in unanticipated expenses and losses 
furthermore  we may not be able to realize any of the anticipated benefits from acquisitions or joint ventures 
the process of integrating acquired operations into our existing operations may result in unforeseen operating difficulties and may require significant financial resources that would otherwise be available for the ongoing development or expansion of existing operations 
some of the risks associated with the integration of acquisitions include potential disruption of our ongoing business and distraction of management  unforeseen claims and liabilities  including unexpected environmental exposures  unforeseen adjustments  charges and write offs  problems enforcing the indemnification obligations of sellers of businesses or joint venture partners for claims and liabilities  unexpected losses of customers of  or suppliers to  the acquired business  difficulty in conforming the acquired business standards  processes  procedures and controls with our operations  variability in financial information arising from the implementation of purchase price accounting  inability to coordinate new product and process development  loss of senior managers and other critical personnel and problems with new labor unions  and challenges arising from the increased scope  geographic diversity and complexity of our operations 
although our pension plans currently meet minimum funding requirements  events could occur that would require us to make significant contributions to the plans and reduce the cash available for our business 
we have several defined benefit pension plans around the world  including in the us  the netherlands  germany  belgium  france  and japan  covering most of our employees 
the us plans represent approximately of the total liabilities of the plans worldwide 
we are required to make cash contributions to our pension plans to the extent necessary to comply with minimum funding requirements imposed by the various countries benefit and tax laws 
the amount of any such required contributions will be determined annually based on an actuarial valuation of the plans as performed by the plans actuaries 

table of contents albemarle corporation and subsidiaries during  we made a million voluntary contribution to our us qualified defined benefit pension plans 
our us qualified defined benefit pension plans in aggregate were approximately funded on an internal revenue service  or irs  funding basis as of december  while we do not expect significant cash contributions to be required  we may choose to make additional voluntary pension contributions in contributions after could vary depending on factors such as asset returns  then current interest rates  and legislative changes 
the amount we may elect or be required to contribute to our pension plans in the future may increase significantly 
these contributions could be substantial and would reduce the cash available for our business 
the occurrence or threat of extraordinary events  including domestic and international terrorist attacks  may disrupt our operations and decrease demand for our products 
chemical related assets may be at greater risk of future terrorist attacks than other possible targets in the us and throughout the world 
as an american chemistry council member company  we have completed vulnerability assessments of our us manufacturing locations and meet the requirements of this industry standard 
we have a corporate security standard and audit our facilities for compliance 
recent investments have been made to upgrade site security 
however  federal legislation is under consideration that could impose new site security requirements  specifically on chemical manufacturing facilities  which may increase our overhead expenses 
new federal regulations have already been adopted to increase the security of the transportation of hazardous chemicals in the us we believe we have met these requirements but additional federal and local regulations that limit the distribution of hazardous materials are being considered 
we ship and receive materials that are classified as hazardous 
bans on movement of hazardous materials through cities like washington  dc could affect the efficiency of our logistical operations 
broader restrictions on hazardous material movements could lead to additional investment to produce hazardous raw materials and change where and what products we manufacture 
the occurrence of extraordinary events  including future terrorist attacks and the outbreak or escalation of hostilities  cannot be predicted  and their occurrence can be expected to continue to affect negatively the economy in general  and specifically the markets for our products 
the resulting damage from a direct attack on our assets  or assets used by us  could include loss of life and property damage 
in addition  available insurance coverage may not be sufficient to cover all of the damage incurred or  if available  may be prohibitively expensive

these forward looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve certain risks  uncertainties and assumptions  which are difficult to predict and many of which are beyond our control 
there can be no assurance  therefore  that our actual results will not differ materially from the results and expectations expressed or implied in the forward looking statements

we assume no obligation to provide revisions to any forward looking statements should circumstances change  except as otherwise required by securities and other applicable laws 
the following discussion should be read together with our consolidated financial statements and related notes included in this annual report on form k 
the following is a discussion and analysis of results of operations for the years ended december   and a discussion of consolidated financial condition and sources of additional capital is included under a separate heading financial condition and liquidity on page overview and outlook we are a leading global developer  manufacturer and marketer of highly engineered specialty chemicals 
our products and services enhance the value of our customers end products by improving performance  providing essential product attributes  lowering cost and simplifying processing 
we sell a highly diversified mix of products to a wide range of customers  including petroleum refiners  utilities providers  manufacturers of consumer electronics  building and construction materials  automotive parts  packaging  pharmachemicals and agrichemicals 
we believe that our commercial and geographic diversity  technical expertise  flexible  low cost global manufacturing base  and experienced management team enable us to maintain leading market positions in those areas of the specialty chemicals industry in which we operate 
our plans for growth in our businesses are being impacted by the current poor conditions in the global economy  but we believe that our businesses are well positioned to adapt to these changing global market conditions 
we expect to continue to deliver value to our shareholders through strategically managing our product portfolio for higher growth and higher margin products and services  continued focus on research and development  investment in innovative technologies  our financial discipline  effective cost controls 
table of contents albemarle corporation and subsidiaries and reductions where appropriate  and our ongoing stewardship of our assets and financial position 
we continue to build upon our existing green solutions portfolio and our ongoing mission to provide innovative  yet commercially viable  clean energy products and services to the marketplace 
on a segment by segment basis  we expect continued near term weakness in our polymer additives segment as softness in demand in the electronics  construction and automotive industries continues to pressure this segment s performance  particularly in our flame retardants portfolio 
industry destocking has driven downstream inventories down steeply 
while timing is uncertain  we expect the tightening in inventory levels may provide improving volumes in our polymer additives segment as end market demand recovers 
we also expect the potential for more stringent fire safety regulations in many countries around the world may help drive growth in our polymer additives segment 
growth in our catalysts segment is expected to be driven by long term global demand for petroleum products  generally deteriorating quality of crude oil feedstock  implementation of more stringent fuel quality requirements as a part of clean air initiatives  and new opportunities in alternative fuel technologies 
our fine chemicals segment continues to benefit from the continued rapid pace of innovation and the introduction of new products  coupled with the movement by pharmaceutical companies to outsource certain research  product development and manufacturing functions 
highlights acquisition of interests in our two chinese joint ventures 
we acquired the remaining ownership interests of our polymer additive joint ventures in china ningbo jinhai albemarle chemical industry co  ltd 
and shanghai jinhai albemarle fine chemicals co  ltd 
shanghai jinhai on june  to become a leading manufacturer and supplier of polymer antioxidants in china and one of the top suppliers worldwide as we continue to provide even broader solutions for our customers in china and the growing regional and global marketplace 
additionally  we approved projects to more than double the antioxidant production capacity at our shanghai jinhai site to further strengthen our position in the china plastics additives marketplace as market conditions improve 
formation of sinobrom joint venture 
we reached an agreement on december  with weifang sinobrom import and export company  ltd  or sinobrom  to form a new fine chemicals joint venture that combined the existing business of sinobrom  a leading marketer of bromine derivatives in china  with albemarle s global bromine expertise across the world 
the new joint venture  sinobrom albemarle bromine chemicals shandong company ltd  is owned by albemarle and creates new growth platforms for albemarle in shandong province  the heart of the chinese bromine and derivatives market 
acquisition of sorbent technologies corporation 
we acquired the mercury control provider sorbent technologies corporation on july  for per share representing an aggregate purchase price of approximately million 
this fine chemicals acquisition brings proprietary and comprehensive technologies that broaden our current bromine offerings and allow us to bring innovative  turnkey solutions to utilities and other bromine based mercury solutions providers in the industry while complementing our existing green solutions portfolio and our ongoing mission to provide innovative and viable clean energy products and services to the marketplace 
divestiture of our port de bouc  france facility 
we entered into an agreement to divest our port de bouc  france facility to better position us to focus on our core business initiatives 
this transaction had an effective date of december  and resulted in a special item charge of million million after income taxes 
stock repurchase plan 
we repurchased an aggregate of  shares of our common stock in open market or privately negotiated transactions at an average price of per share 
increased dividends 
we increased our dividend for the th consecutive year  ending the year at an annual dividend rate of per share 
extension of debt agreement 
in march  we exercised an option under the march credit agreement to extend the maturity date from march to march lenders representing of the commitments  or million out of million  approved the extension 
outlook polymer additives we expect the recent downturn in consumer electronics  together with already lackluster demand in the automotive and construction sectors  to impact volumes and profitability of our polymer additives segment through although we are taking steps to restructure our operations and cut costs  we expect will be challenging until consumer demand returns and global markets rebound 
in the longer term  the increasing standard of living around the globe should drive higher demand for electrical and electronic equipment and new construction 
this combined with the potential for increasingly stringent fire safety regulations and global climate initiatives should increase the need for insulation materials 
the timing of the return to growth in the global markets is uncertain 

table of contents albemarle corporation and subsidiaries we are continuing to increase our presence in china as we build a foundation for expanding our business in asia 
expansion of our now wholly owned antioxidants facility in shanghai is expected to come on line in in addition  our flame retardant plant in nanjing should allow us to increase operations as we produce phosphorous based flame retardants at this site to serve the asia pacific construction and electronic markets 
new product development momentum continues in our polymer additives segment 
the trend in some electronic components toward halogen free flame retardants  while challenging our legacy products  also creates numerous development opportunities with our diverse customer base 
we plan to begin commercializing sales of a new halogen free product in one of our key growth markets and have several others in various stages of development 
we also plan to commercialize a new polyurea curative which offers greater cure speed flexibility 
catalysts we expect revenue growth in our catalysts segment to be driven by global demand for petroleum products  generally deteriorating quality of crude oil feedstock and implementation of more stringent fuel quality requirements as a part of clean air initiatives 
while we continue to closely monitor developments in the global economy  we expect our catalysts segment profit growth in to come primarily from new product introductions  new markets that we penetrate  fcc pricing improvements and the continued growth in our polyolefin catalysts business 
with continuing global demand for oil and consumer fuel and tightening fuel quality regulations  we believe refiners will process more sour crudes  which should require additional hpc catalysts to remove the metals and impurities  further driving demand for these catalysts 
the hpc catalysts expansion at our bayport  texas facility is now operational and delivering products 
this plant has added approximately  metric tons to our capacity and increased our global hpc capacity including capacity at our joint venture nippon ketjen by approximately 
we believe this will provide us with the capacity to meet the growth in demand that we expect in this business in the coming years 
we continue to believe we will need additional hpc capacity in the future to meet expected increased demand 
we must also continue to successfully pass through metals costs and ensure optimal inventory levels in periods of declining metals prices 
our focus in fcc catalysts is on improving margins to support the value these products bring to the market 
while we believe there remains room for further margin improvement  we believe to be successful we must continue to deliver high performing  superior quality products to meet the growing demands of refiners processing increasingly heavy crudes 
we have seen incremental margin increases  although we continue to face raw material cost pressures related to energy  metals  imported rare earths  and transportation costs 
we believe  however  that our price increases should offset increasing raw material and energy costs  but there is no guarantee that will occur 
we are focused on new product development in catalysts and have introduced high throughput experimentation to more rapidly test and develop new technologies 
our marketing and research groups are tightly aligned so we can continue to bring innovative technologies to the market 
we will continue to explore new opportunities for our catalysts in the alternative fuels business  which includes biodiesel  canadian oil sands  gas to liquids gtl  and coal to liquids ctl markets 
these opportunities become increasingly viable as oil prices increase 
fine chemicals our fine chemicals segment continues to benefit from the continued rapid pace of innovation and the introduction of new products  coupled with the movement by pharmaceutical companies to outsource certain research  product development and manufacturing functions 
in our performance chemicals sector  in spite of the current economic pressures  we expect stable growth in as we continue to expand the breadth of use of our bromine and bromine derivatives 
in addition to an overall focus on margin improvement  our two strategic areas of focus in our fine chemicals segment have been to maximize our bromine franchise value in the performance chemicals sector and to continue the growth of our fine chemistry services business 
we are focused on profitably growing our globally competitive bromine and derivatives production network to serve all major bromine consuming products and markets 
as we supply bromine feed stocks to our polymer additives segment  our profitability is generally impacted as market conditions change in that sector 
also  we will continue our focus on developing our fine chemistry services business 
our new products pipeline in this business has approximately doubled in the last year  allowing us to develop preferred outsourcing positions serving leading chemical and pharmaceutical innovators in diverse industries 
we remain confident in continuing to generate growth in profitable niche products leveraged from this service business 
corporate and other we are continuing our focus on reducing working capital and maximizing cash generation 
in addition  we will continue to focus on tax efficiency  however  incremental income is more likely to be earned in locales with higher incremental rates 
we believe our global effective tax rate may be in the range of to but will vary based on the locales in which incremental income is actually earned 
we increased our quarterly dividend payout by in to per share 
under our existing share repurchase program  we expect to periodically repurchase shares in on an opportunistic basis 
in addition  we remain committed to evaluating the merits of any opportunities that may arise for acquisitions that complement our business footprint

summary of critical accounting policies and estimates estimates  assumptions and reclassifications the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the us  or us gaap  requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of revenues  expenses  assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements 
listed below are the estimates and assumptions that we consider to be critical in the preparation of the financial statements 
certain amounts in the accompanying consolidated financial statements and notes thereto have been reclassified to conform to the current presentation 
recovery of long lived assets 
we evaluate the recovery of our long lived assets on a segment basis by periodically analyzing our operating results and considering significant events or changes in the business environment 
income taxes 
we assume the deductibility of certain costs in our income tax filings and estimate the future recovery of deferred tax assets 
environmental remediation liabilities 
we estimate and accrue the costs required to remediate a specific site depending on site specific facts and circumstances 
cost estimates to remediate each specific site are developed by assessing the scope of our contribution to the environmental matter  the scope of the anticipated remediation and monitoring plan  and the extent of other parties share of responsibility 
actual results could differ materially from the estimates and assumptions that we use in the preparation of our financial statements 

table of contents albemarle corporation and subsidiaries revenue recognition we recognize sales when the revenue is realized or realizable  and has been earned  in accordance with the sec s staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements 
we recognize net sales as risk and title to the product transfer to the customer  which usually occurs at the time shipment is made 
significant portions of our sales are sold free on board fob shipping point or on an equivalent basis  and other transactions are based upon specific contractual arrangements 
our standard terms of delivery are generally included in our contracts of sale  order confirmation documents and invoices 
we recognize revenue from services when performance of the services has been completed 
we have a limited amount of consignment sales that are billed to the customer upon monthly notification of amounts used by the customers under these contracts 
goodwill and other intangible assets we account for goodwill and other intangibles acquired in a business combination in conformity with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  which requires that goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets not be amortized 
we test goodwill for impairment by comparing the estimated fair value of our reporting units to the related carrying value 
we measure the fair value based on present value techniques involving future cash flows 
future cash flows include assumptions for sales volumes  selling prices  raw material prices  labor and other employee benefit costs  capital additions and other economic or market related factors 
significant management judgment is involved in estimating these variables and they include inherent uncertainties since they are forecasting future events 
we use a weighted average cost of capital wacc approach to determine our discount rate for goodwill recoverability testing 
our wacc calculation includes factors such as the risk free rate of return  borrowing costs and expected equity premiums 
the factors in this calculation are largely external to our company  and therefore  are beyond our control 
we test our recorded goodwill balances for impairment in the fourth quarter of each year or upon the occurrence of events or changes in circumstances that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of our reporting units below their carrying amounts 
definite lived intangible assets  such as purchased technology  patents  customer lists and trade names are amortized over their estimated useful lives  generally for periods ranging from three to fifty years 
we continually evaluate the reasonableness of the useful lives of these assets and test for impairment in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
see note  goodwill and other intangibles to our consolidated financial statements included in item beginning on page pension plans and other postretirement benefits we follow the guidance of sfas no 
 employers accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans an amendment of certain requirements of fasb statements no 
 and r  or sfas no 
 sfas no 
 employers accounting for pensions  and sfas no 
 employers accounting for postretirement benefits other than pensions  when accounting for pension and postretirement benefits 
under these accounting standards  assumptions are made regarding the valuation of benefit obligations and the performance of plan assets 
as required under sfas no 
 we recognize a balance sheet asset or liability for each of the pension or postretirement benefit plans equal to the plan s funded status as of the measurement date 
the difference between a plan s funded status and its balance sheet position prior to adoption of the standard is recognized  net of tax  as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss income in the shareholders equity section of the consolidated balance sheets 
the primary assumptions are as follows discount rate the discount rate is used in calculating the present value of benefits  which is based on projections of benefit payments to be made in the future 
expected return on plan assets we project the future return on plan assets based on prior performance and future expectations for the types of investments held by the plans as well as the expected long term allocation of plan assets for these investments 
these projected returns reduce the net benefit costs recorded currently 
rate of compensation increase for salary related plans  we project employees annual pay increases  which are used to project employees pension benefits at retirement 
rate of increase in the per capita cost of covered health care benefits we project the expected increases in the cost of covered health care benefits 
during  we made changes to the assumptions related to the discount rate  the rate of compensation increase for salary related plans and the rate of increase in the per capita cost of covered health care benefits 
we consider available information that we deem relevant when selecting each of these assumptions 
in selecting the discount rate  consideration is given to indices such as moody s aa  the international index company  and iboxx  as well as a yield curve derived from fixed income security yields 
the yield curve is generally based on a universe containing 
table of contents albemarle corporation and subsidiaries country specific aa graded or better corporate bonds without special features or options  which could affect the duration 
in some countries  the yield curve may be based on local government bond rates with a premium added to reflect corporate bond risk 
payments we expect to be made from our retirement plans are applied to the resulting yield curve 
for each plan  the discount rate was developed as the level equivalent rate that would produce the same present value as that using spot rates aligned with the projected benefit payments 
at december   the weighted average discount rate was increased for the pension plans from to and for the other postretirement plans from to to reflect market conditions as of the december  measurement date 
in estimating the expected return on plan assets  we consider past performance and future expectations for the types of investments held by the plan as well as the expected long term allocation of plan assets to these investments 
at december   the weighted average expected rate of return on pension plan assets remained at 
there was no change in the weighted average expected return on other postretirement benefit plan assets either 
our us defined benefit plan for non represented employees was closed to new participants effective march  we adopted a defined contribution pension plan for us employees hired after march  in projecting the rate of compensation increase  we consider past experience in light of movements in inflation rates 
at december  and  the assumed weighted average rate of compensation increase changed to from  respectively  for the pension plans 
the assumed weighted average rate of compensation remained at for the other postretirement plans at december  and in selecting the rate of increase in the per capita cost of covered health care benefits  we consider past performance and forecasts of future health care cost trends 
at december   the previously assumed ultimate rate of increase in the per capita cost of covered health care benefits for us retirees decreased by 
for  the assumed trend rate for pre coverage is per year  decreasing to an ultimate rate of in the year the assumed trend rate for post coverage is per year  decreasing to an ultimate rate of in the year the effect of a increase in the us health care cost trend rate would increase the benefit obligation by million and would increase the service and interest benefit cost components by a minimal amount 
a decrease in the us heath care cost trend rate would decrease the benefit obligation by million and would decrease the service and interest benefit cost components by a minimal amount 
a variance in the assumptions discussed above would have an impact on the projected benefit obligations  the accrued other postretirement benefit liabilities  and the annual net periodic pension and other postretirement benefit cost 
the following table reflects the sensitivities associated with a hypothetical change in certain assumptions  primarily in the us in thousands favorable unfavorable increase decrease increase decrease in benefit obligation increase decrease in benefit cost increase decrease in benefit obligation increase decrease in benefit cost actuarial assumptions discount rate pension other postretirement benefits expected return on plan assets pension other postretirement benefits rate of increase decrease in per capita cost of covered health care benefits not applicable 
income taxes we use the liability method for determining our income taxes  under which current and deferred tax liabilities and assets are recorded in accordance with enacted tax laws and rates 
under this method  the amounts of deferred tax liabilities and assets at the end of each period are determined using the tax rate expected to be in effect when taxes are actually paid or recovered 
future tax benefits are recognized to the extent that realization of such benefits is more likely than not 
deferred income taxes are provided for the estimated income tax effect of temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax basis of existing assets and liabilities 
deferred tax assets are also provided for operating losses  capital losses and certain tax credit carryovers 
a valuation allowance  reducing deferred tax assets  is established when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
the realization of such deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of sufficient future taxable income of the appropriate character 
although realization is not assured  we believe it is more likely than not that the net deferred tax assets will be realized 

table of contents albemarle corporation and subsidiaries we only recognize a tax benefit after concluding that it is more likely than not that the benefit will be sustained upon audit by the respective taxing authority based solely on the technical merits of the associated tax position 
once the recognition threshold is met  we recognize a tax benefit measured as the largest amount of the tax benefit that  in our judgment  is greater than likely to be realized 
interest and penalties related to income tax liabilities are included in income tax expense 
we are subject to income taxes in the us and numerous foreign jurisdictions 
we are no longer subject to us federal income tax examinations by tax authorities for years before all us federal income tax issues for the tax years through were resolved as of december the irs is currently reviewing our income tax returns for the tax years through with respect to jurisdictions outside the us  we are no longer subject to income tax audits for years before during  we completed the tax audits for the following tax jurisdictions and respective tax years belgium  through  united kingdom   and the netherlands  through no significant tax was assessed for these audits 
the german tax authorities are examining tax years through  and we anticipate a resolution during while we believe we have adequately provided for all tax positions  amounts asserted by taxing authorities could be greater than our accrued position 
accordingly  additional provisions on federal and foreign tax related matters could be recorded in the future as revised estimates are made or the underlying matters are settled or otherwise resolved 
since the timing of resolutions and or closure of tax audits are uncertain  it is difficult to predict with certainty the range of reasonably possible significant increases or decreases in the liability for unrecognized tax benefits that may occur within the next twelve months 
our current view is that it is reasonably possible that we could record a decrease in the liability for unrecognized tax benefits  relating to a number of issues  up to approximately million as a result of settlements with taxing authorities and closure of tax statutes 
as of september  and continuing in and  we designated the undistributed earnings of substantially all of our foreign operations as permanently reinvested and  as a result  recorded a tax benefit in of million due to the reversal of previously recorded deferred tax liabilities 
we will not provide for deferred income taxes on the future earnings of these subsidiaries as a result of this designation 
our foreign earnings are computed under us federal tax earnings and profits  or e p  principles 
in general  to the extent our financial reporting book basis over tax basis of a foreign subsidiary exceeds these e p amounts  deferred taxes have not been provided  as they are essentially permanent in duration 
the determination of the amount of such unrecognized deferred tax liability is not practicable 
we provide for deferred income taxes on our undistributed earnings of foreign operations that are not deemed to be permanently reinvested 
stock based compensation expense the fair value of restricted stock awards and performance unit awards is determined based on the number of shares or units granted and the quoted price of our common stock at grant date  and the fair value of stock options is determined using the black scholes valuation model 
the fair value of these awards is determined after giving affect to estimated forfeitures 
such value is recognized as expense over the service period generally the vesting period of the equity grant 
to the extent restricted stock awards  performance unit awards and stock options are forfeited prior to vesting in excess of the estimated forfeiture rate  the corresponding previously recognized expense is reversed as an offset to operating expenses 
internal control over financial reporting section of the sarbanes oxley act of  or sox  requires that we make an assertion as to the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting in our annual report on form k filings 
our independent registered public accounting firm  pricewaterhousecoopers llp  provides its assessment of our effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting 
in order to make our assertion  we are required to identify material financial and operational processes  document internal controls supporting the financial reporting process and evaluate the design and effectiveness of these controls 
see management s report on internal control over financial reporting in item we have a dedicated sox team in house to facilitate ongoing internal control reviews  coordinate the process for these reviews  provide direction to the business groups and corporate staff involved in the initiative and assist in the assessment of internal control over financial reporting 
a steering committee  comprised of personnel from finance and alliance services  is in place to set uniform guiding principles and policies  review the progress of the compliance activities  and direct the efforts of the sox team 
status and updates are provided to our audit committee of our board of directors on an ongoing basis 
we also retained an accounting firm other than our independent registered public accounting firm to assist us in our compliance with sox 
table of contents albemarle corporation and subsidiaries our sox effort involves many of our employees around the world  including participation by our business areas and our alliance services group 
we view our ongoing evaluation of our internal control over financial reporting as more than a regulatory exercise it provides us an opportunity to continually assess our financial control environment and make us a more effective company 
financial condition and liquidity overview the principal uses of cash in our business generally have been investment in our assets  funding working capital and repayment of debt 
in  we made a million voluntary contribution to our us defined benefit pension plans 
historically  cash to fund the needs of our business has been principally provided by funds from operations  debt financing and equity issuances 
we are continuing our program to improve working capital efficiency and working capital metrics particularly in the areas of accounts receivable and inventory 
we expect the combination of our current cash balances and availability under our march credit agreement  which is discussed below  to remain sufficient to fund working capital requirements for the foreseeable future 
cash flow our cash balance increased by million to million at december  from million at december  for  our operations provided million of cash compared to million in this increase of million is primarily due to a decrease in accounts receivable and an increase in accounts payable  partially offset by a decrease in profitability and income taxes payable and an increase in pension and postretirement contributions 
cash flows from operating activities funded investing activities of million  which consisted principally of acquisitions and capital expenditures for plant machinery and equipment improvements 
remaining cash flows from operating activities and net proceeds from borrowings of million were used to purchase million of our common stock and pay quarterly dividends to shareholders totaling million 
net current assets increased million to million at december  from million at december  the increase in net current assets was due primarily to an increase in cash  inventory  and other current assets partially offset by a decrease in accounts receivable and an increase in accounts payable 
cash and cash equivalents at december  were million  down million from million at year end for  cash flows provided from operating activities of million  together with million of proceeds from borrowings and million of proceeds from the exercise of stock options  were used primarily to cover operating activities  repay debt of million  fund capital expenditures totaling million  purchases of million of our common stock  pay quarterly dividends to shareholders totaling million  and acquire additional interests of million in our two antioxidant joint ventures in china ningbo jinhai albemarle chemical and industry company limited and shanghai jinhai albemarle fine chemicals company limited 
capital expenditures in of million were used for plant machinery and equipment improvements and were comparable to expenditures of million 
we expect our capital expenditures to be approximately million in mainly due to increases in plant machinery and equipment in our catalysts and fine chemicals segments 
however  we will be closely monitoring our willingness to fund that budget in light of the global economic situation  and our cash generation as the year progresses 
we anticipate that future capital spending should be financed primarily with cash flow provided from operations with additional cash needed  if any  provided by borrowings  including borrowings under our march credit agreement 
the amount and timing of any additional borrowings will depend on our specific cash requirements 
long term debt we currently have outstanding million of senior notes due in  or the senior notes 
the senior notes are senior unsecured obligations and rank equally with all of our other senior unsecured indebtedness from time to time outstanding 
the senior notes will be effectively subordinated to any of our future secured indebtedness and to the existing and future indebtedness of our subsidiaries 
we may redeem the senior notes before their maturity  in whole at any time or in part from time to time  at a redemption price equal to the greater of of the principal amount of the senior notes to be redeemed or the sum of the present values of the remaining scheduled payments of principal and interest thereon exclusive of interest accrued to the date of redemption discounted to the redemption date on a semi annual basis assuming a day year consisting of twelve day months at the treasury rate as defined in the indenture governing the senior notes plus basis points  plus  in each case  accrued interest thereon to the date of redemption 
the principal amount of the senior notes becomes immediately due and payable upon the occurrence of certain bankruptcy or insolvency events involving us or certain of our subsidiaries and may be declared immediately due and payable by the trustee or the 
table of contents albemarle corporation and subsidiaries holders of not less than of the senior notes upon the occurrence of an event of default 
events of default include  among other things failure to pay principal or interest at required times  failure to perform or remedy a breach of covenants within prescribed periods  an event of default on any of our other indebtedness or certain indebtedness of our subsidiaries of million or more that is caused by a failure to make a payment when due or that results in the acceleration of that indebtedness before its maturity  and certain bankruptcy or insolvency events involving us or certain of our subsidiaries 
we believe that as of december   we were  and currently are  in compliance with all of the covenants of the indenture governing the senior notes 
for additional funding and liquidity purposes  we currently maintain a million five year unsecured revolving senior credit facility  which we refer to as the march credit agreement 
the march credit agreement provides for an additional million in credit  if needed  upon additional loan commitments by our existing and or additional lenders 
the total spreads and fees can range from to over the london inter bank offered rate  or libor  applicable to the currency of denomination of the borrowing and are based upon our credit rating from one of the major credit rating agencies 
there were aggregate borrowings outstanding under the march credit agreement of million at december  borrowings under the march credit agreement bear interest at variable rates  which was a weighted average of during the fourth quarter of in march  we exercised an option under the march credit agreement to extend the maturity date from march to march lenders representing of the commitments  or million out of million  approved the extension 
no other changes to the agreement were part of the extension  and no fees  other than attorney fees  were paid 
as a result of the extension  million and million in commitments now have a maturity expiration date of march and march  respectively 
borrowings under our march credit agreement are conditioned upon compliance with the following covenants a consolidated funded debt  as defined in the march credit agreement  must be less than or equal to times consolidated ebitda  as defined in the march credit agreement  as of the end of any fiscal quarter  b consolidated tangible domestic assets  as defined in the march credit agreement  must be greater than or equal to million for us to make investments in entities and enterprises that are organized outside the us  and c with the exception of liens specified in our march credit agreement  liens may not attach to assets when the aggregate amount of all indebtedness secured by such liens plus unsecured indebtedness  other than indebtedness incurred by our subsidiaries under the march credit agreement would exceed of consolidated net worth  as defined in the march credit agreement 
we believe that as of december   we were  and currently are  in compliance with all of the debt covenants under the march credit agreement 
the non current portion of our long term debt amounted to million at december   compared to million at december  in addition  at december   we had the ability to borrow an additional million under our march credit agreement 
off balance sheet arrangements in the normal course of business with customers  vendors and others  we have entered into off balance sheet arrangements  including bank guarantees and letters of credit which totaled approximately million at december  none of these off balance sheet arrangements either has  or is likely to have  a material effect on our current or future financial condition  results of operations  liquidity or capital resources 
other obligations the following table summarizes our contractual obligations for plant construction  purchases of equipment and various take or pay and throughput agreements in thousands thereafter long term debt obligations capital lease obligation expected interest payments on long term debt obligations operating lease obligations rental take or pay throughput agreements letters of credit and guarantees capital projects facility divestiture obligation additional investment commitment payments total these amounts are based on a weighted average interest rate of for the march credit agreement  for the senior notes  and for our remaining long term debt obligations and capital lease for the weighted average rate for years and thereafter is for the march credit agreement  for the senior notes  and for our remaining long term debt obligations and capital lease 

table of contents albemarle corporation and subsidiaries these amounts primarily relate to contracts entered into with certain third party vendors in the normal course of business to secure raw materials for our production processes 
in order to secure materials  sometimes for long durations  these contracts mandate a minimum amount of product to be purchased at predetermined rates over a set timeframe 
amounts in the table above exclude required employer pension contributions 
we have determined that the expected contributions to our domestic nonqualified and foreign qualified and nonqualified pension plans should approximate million 
we may choose to make additional pension contributions above this amount 
we have made million in contributions to our qualified and nonqualified pension plans during the year ended december  the liability for unrecognized tax benefits  including interest and penalties  recorded in other noncurrent liabilities totaled million and million at december  and  respectively 
related assets for corresponding offsetting benefits recorded in other assets totaled million and million at december  and  respectively 
we cannot estimate the amounts of any cash payments during the next twelve months associated with these liabilities and are unable to estimate the timing of any such cash payments in the future at this time 
liquidity outlook we anticipate that cash provided from operating activities in the future and borrowings under our march credit agreement should be sufficient to pay our operating expenses  satisfy debt service obligations  fund capital expenditures and pension contributions  and make dividend payments for the foreseeable future 
in addition  as we have historically done  we will continue to evaluate the merits of any opportunities that may arise for acquisitions of businesses or assets  which may require additional liquidity 
while we maintain business relationships with a diverse group of financial institutions  their continued viability is not certain and could lead them not to honor their contractual credit commitments or renew their extensions of credit or provide new sources of credit 
recently  the capital markets have become increasingly volatile as a result of adverse conditions that have caused the consolidation  failure and near failure of a number of large financial services companies 
if the capital markets continue to experience volatility and the availability of funds remains limited  we may incur increased costs associated with borrowings 
in addition  it is possible that our ability to access the capital markets may be limited by these or other factors at a time when we would like  or need  to do so  which could have an impact on our ability to finance our businesses or react to changing economic and business conditions 
while we believe that recent governmental and regulatory actions reduce the risk of a further deterioration or systemic contraction of capital markets  there can be no certainty that our liquidity will not be negatively impacted 
in addition  our cash flows from operations may be adversely affected by adverse consequences to our customers and the markets in which we compete as a result of the current financial  economic  and capital market conditions and uncertainty 
on december   we had approximately of our cash in us treasury or equivalent securities 
the increased concentration of short term investments in us treasury or equivalent securities  in part  reflects our effort to mitigate the counterparty risk attendant to the aforementioned capital market conditions 
in addition  we have untapped lines of credit in excess of million available 
with generally strong cash generative businesses and minimal significant debt maturities before  we believe we have a solid liquidity position given the current financial market situation 
safety and environmental matters we are subject to federal  state  local  and foreign requirements regulating the handling  manufacture and use of materials some of which may be classified as hazardous or toxic by one or more regulatory agencies  the discharge of materials into the environment and the protection of the environment 
to our knowledge  we are currently complying and expect to continue to comply in all material respects with applicable environmental laws  regulations  statutes and ordinances 
compliance with existing federal  state  local  and foreign environmental protection laws is not expected to have a material effect on earnings or our competitive position  but the costs associated with increased legal or regulatory requirements could have an adverse effect on our results 
among other environmental requirements  we are subject to the federal superfund law  and similar state laws  under which we may be designated as a potentially responsible party  or prp  and may be liable for a share of the costs associated with cleaning up various hazardous waste sites 
management believes that in most cases  our participation is de minimis 
further  almost all such sites represent environmental issues that are quite mature and have been investigated  studied and in many cases settled 
in de minimis situations  our policy generally is to negotiate a consent decree and to pay any apportioned settlement  enabling us to be effectively relieved of any further liability as a prp  except for remote contingencies 
in other than de minimis prp matters  our records indicate that unresolved prp exposures should be immaterial 
we accrue and expense our proportionate share of prp costs 
because management has been actively involved in evaluating environmental matters  we are able to conclude that the outstanding environmental liabilities for unresolved prp sites should not be material to operations 

table of contents albemarle corporation and subsidiaries our environmental and safety operating costs charged to expense were million  million and million in  and  respectively  excluding depreciation of previous capital expenditures  and are expected to be in the same range in the next few years 
costs for remediation have been accrued and payments related to sites are charged against accrued liabilities  which at december  totaled approximately million  down million from million at december  we believe that any sum we may be required to pay in connection with environmental remediation and asset retirement obligation matters in excess of the amounts recorded should occur over a period of time and should not have a material adverse effect upon our results of operations  financial condition or cash flows on a consolidated annual basis  although any such sum could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations  financial condition or cash flows in a particular quarterly reporting period 
see also item legal proceedings on page capital expenditures for pollution abatement and safety projects  including such costs that are included in other projects  were approximately million  million and million in  and  respectively 
in the future  capital expenditures for these types of projects may increase due to more stringent environmental regulatory requirements and our efforts in reaching sustainability goals 
management s estimates of the effects of compliance with governmental pollution abatement and safety regulations are subject to i the possibility of changes in the applicable statutes and regulations or in judicial or administrative construction of such statutes and regulations  and ii uncertainty as to whether anticipated solutions to pollution problems will be successful  or whether additional expenditures may prove necessary

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the primary currencies for which we have foreign currency exchange rate exposure are the european union euro  japanese yen  british pound sterling  brazilian real  korean won and the us dollar in certain of its foreign locations 
in response to the greater fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates in recent periods  we have increased the degree of risk management activities to minimize the impact on earnings of future periods 
we manage our foreign currency exposures by balancing certain assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies and through the use from time to time of foreign exchange contracts 
the principal objective of such contracts is to minimize the risks and or costs associated with global operating activities 
the counterparties to these contractual agreements are major financial institutions with which we generally have other financial relationships 
we are exposed to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by these counterparties 
however  we do not anticipate nonperformance by the other parties  and no material loss would be expected from their nonperformance 
we do not utilize financial instruments for trading or other speculative purposes 
we enter into foreign currency forward contracts  which generally expire within one year  in the regular course of business to assist in managing our exposure against foreign currency fluctuations on sales and intercompany transactions 
the primary method to cover foreign currency exposure is to seek a natural hedge  in which the operating activities denominated in respective currencies balance in respect to timing and the underlying exposures 
in the event a natural hedge is not available  a foreign currency forward contract may be employed to reduce currency exposure 
while these contracts are subject to fluctuations in value  such fluctuations are generally offset by the value of the underlying foreign currency exposures being hedged 
gains and losses on foreign currency forward contracts are recognized currently in income  but do not have a significant impact on results of operations 
our financial instruments  subject to foreign currency exchange risk  consist of foreign currency forward contracts and represented a net liability position of million at december  we conducted a sensitivity analysis on the fair value of our foreign currency hedge portfolio assuming instantaneous changes in foreign currency exchange rates from their levels as of december   with all other variables held constant 
a appreciation of the us dollar against foreign currencies would result in an increase of million in the fair value of our foreign currency exchange hedging contracts 
a depreciation of the us dollar against foreign currencies would result in a decrease of million in the fair value of our foreign currency exchange hedging contracts 
the sensitivity in fair value of our foreign currency hedge portfolio represents changes in fair values estimated based on market conditions as of december   without reflecting the effects of underlying anticipated transactions 
when those anticipated transactions are realized  actual effects of changing foreign currency exchange rates could have a material impact on our earnings and cash flows in future periods 
we are exposed to changes in interest rates that could impact our results of operations and financial condition 
we manage the worldwide exposure of our interest rate risks and foreign exchange exposure through our regular operations and financing activities 

table of contents albemarle corporation and subsidiaries we had outstanding variable interest rate borrowings of million and million at december  and  respectively 
these borrowings bore average interest rates of and at december  and  respectively 
a hypothetical change approximately basis points in the interest rate applicable to these borrowings would change our annualized interest expense by approximately million as of december  we may enter into interest rate swaps  collars or similar instruments with the objective of reducing interest rate volatility relating to our borrowing costs 
our raw materials are subject to price volatility caused by weather  supply conditions  political and economic variables  and other unpredictable factors 
historically  we have not used futures  options and swap contracts to manage the volatility related to the above exposures 
however  the refinery catalysts business has used financing arrangements to provide long term protection against changes in metals prices 
we seek to limit our exposure by entering into long term contracts when available  and we seek price increase limitations through contracts 
these contracts do not have a significant impact on results of operations 
in  we entered into treasury lock agreements  or t locks  with a notional value of million  to fix the yield on the us treasury security used to set the yield for approximately of our january public offering of senior notes 
the t locks fixed the yield on the us treasury security at approximately 
the value of the t locks resulted from the difference between the yield to maturity of the year us treasury security that had the maturity date most comparable to the maturity date of the senior notes issued and the fixed rate of approximately 
the cumulative loss effect of the t lock agreements was million and is being amortized over the life of the senior notes as an adjustment to the interest expense of the senior notes 
at december   there were losses of approximately million million after income taxes in accumulated other comprehensive loss that remain to be expensed 
in addition  certain of our operations use natural gas as a source of energy which can expose our business to market risk when the price of natural gas changes suddenly 
in an attempt to mitigate the impact and volatility of price swings in the natural gas market  we purchase natural gas contracts  when appropriate  for a portion of our month rolling forecast for north american natural gas requirements 
our natural gas hedge transactions are executed with major financial institutions 
such derivatives are held to secure natural gas at fixed prices and not for trading 
our natural gas contracts qualify as cash flow hedges and are marked to market 
the unrealized gains and or losses on these contracts are deferred and accounted for in accumulated other comprehensive loss to the extent that the unrealized gains and losses are offset by the forecasted transaction 
at december  and  there were no natural gas hedge contracts outstanding 
additionally  any unrealized gains and or losses on the derivative instrument that are not offset by the forecasted transaction are recorded in earnings as appropriate  but do not have a significant impact on results of operations
