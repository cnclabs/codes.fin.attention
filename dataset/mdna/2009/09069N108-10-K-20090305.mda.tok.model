table of contents we were the sole vendor for the centers for medicare and medicaid services cms competitive acquisition program cap for certain medicare part b drugs and biologicals which commenced july  cap was a voluntary program for physicians that offered them the option to obtain many of their medicare part b drugs and biologicals from us and have us  rather than the physician  bill cms for the price of the drug 
as it was designed  cap represented unacceptable profit risk to us due to provisions which delayed  for up to one year  reimbursement rate increases to correspond to cost increases from drug manufacturers 
our cap contract expired december   we are no longer servicing cap  and it is unclear if cms will continue the cap program

in preparing our financial statements  we are required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
we evaluate our estimates and judgments on an ongoing basis 
we base our estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that may not be readily apparent from other sources 
our actual results may differ from these estimates  and different assumptions or conditions may yield different estimates
