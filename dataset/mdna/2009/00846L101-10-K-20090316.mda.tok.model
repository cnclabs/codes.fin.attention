the information contained in this section has been derived from the consolidated financial statements of agfeed 
information contained herein should be read together with agfeed s financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this annual report 
dollar amounts set forth in this item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are in thousands s unless otherwise indicated 
overview we are a leading producer of premix animal feed and commercial hog production in the prc 
our premix feed business consists of the research and development  manufacture  marketing and sale of premix feed for use in the domestic animal husbandry markets  primarily the hog raising markets in the prc 
premix is an animal feed additive that is broadly used in commercial animal production worldwide 
the use of premix feed reduces the time it takes to grow an animal to reach market weight 
we have been in the premix feed business since and currently operate five premix feed manufacturing facilities 
nanchang best  shanghai best  guangxi huijie  shandong feed and hopejia operate facilities jiangxi  shanghai  guangxi  shandong  and hainan provinces  respectively 
in november  we acquired lushan and entered the hog breeding and production business 
in addition to our premix feed business  we are also engaged in the business of raising  breeding and selling hogs in china 
as of december   the company owned operating hog farms located in jiangxi  shanghai  hainan  guangxi and fujian provinces  which are in or near the largest pork consumption areas in the prc 
the hog farms are well structured and well managed through five hog production management branches featuring centralized resources including sales  human resources  purchasing and finance departments in jiangxi  shanghai  guangxi  fujian and hainan provinces 
we have developed a system of centralized raw material purchases  accounting and internal control management  corporate marketing strategies and brand building 
agfeed has created  and centrally manages  an animal disease control response team 
this team consists of experienced hog industry professionals that are used by each of our subsidiaries across both of our lines of business 
our increased size and economies of scale throughout have benefited us greatly in both raw materials cost savings and administrative efforts 
agfeed had revenues of million for the year ended december  compared to revenues of million for the year ended december  the increase we experienced in this period was the result of our organic growth in our feed business and the hog farm acquisitions we made during the year 
feed business in our feed business  we operate each subsidiary independently with regard to manufacturing and local marketing and sales efforts 
we share sales referrals and leads among the subsidiaries  but our subsidiaries do not compete against each other for new sales 
most of our research and development occurs at nanchang best and guangxi huijie 
the results of our r d efforts are for the benefit of  and shared with  each of our feed operating companies 
as of december   we had established relationships with over  independently owned feed distribution chain stores that sell our products exclusively  targeting backyard and small hog farms 
these complement our direct sales to more than large size commercial hog farms 
we rely on the distributors to market and sell our products to the smaller hog farms 
approximately of china s total annual hog production is supplied by backyard and small farms that raise less than hogs per year per family 
through our network of distributors and direct sales  we are able to market our premix feed to the producers of more than of the annual hog production in china 
agfeed is one of a handful of companies that have received green certification from the minister of agriculture of prc for its premix products under the brand label best 
this means that these products are safe  environmentally friendly  and can effectively promote the healthy growth of pigs 
according to current government regulations  pork cannot be accredited by the government as green unless it is produced using government certified green feed 
having our feed certified as green requires us to adhere to strict operational controls and procedures 
this green certification laid the ground for our hog farms to produce hogs providing green pork 
it is also an incentive for other commercial hog farms to enter into sales contracts with our feed operations 
agfeed invests capital in research and development to maintain and improve on a superior quality product while experimenting with environmentally sensitive premix formulas 
we will continue to invest up to of our revenues to increasing our long term profitability and competitiveness 
in the last year agfeed managed to negotiate a number of agreements with dealers and suppliers to ensure that we receive supplies of key raw materials at a discount to market 
this is an important aspect of our ongoing strategy to mitigate corn and soybean meal price disruptions 
additionally  to maintain reasonable profit  we increased our selling price in the spring of in the midst of the rising and uncertain raw material market 
the increase in our revenues during the year ended december  was due to increases in the volume of products sold as a direct result of new products launched and our expansion into new markets 
due to a stronger agfeed brand name  we were able to raise our premix feed prices several times in our second quarter and successfully mitigate the effects of increased costs of raw materials during the year 
we also experienced increases in our cost of goods sold during the year ended december  the costs of corn and soybean meal  which are two of our main raw materials  increased approximately to and to  respectively 
the cost of corn stabilized during the last half of hog production business in our hog production business  we have grown our business through strategic acquisitions of current producing commercial hog farms 
since november  we have acquired at least a majority interest in one breeder hog farm and an additional operating hog farms 
these farms are located in jiangxi  fujian  shanghai and guangxi provinces 
all of our hog farms are immediately accretive to earnings 
we sell live hogs in two of china s wealthiest regions shanghai and guangdong  both of which have china s highest hog prices as well as deep pork consuming cultures 
we have effectively marketed our products through a team based approach  sharing sales leads and referrals 
due to centralized procurement processes  we have been able to offset production costs related to corn  soybean meal  veterinary drugs and animal health products 
for  agfeed plans to achieve a production capacity of up to  hogs 
this capacity is based on a projected average sow population of  head at an average production per sow of hogs  hogs  coupled with the potential purchase and finishing of baby pigs as market conditions warrant 
we believe this could add an additional  to  hogs to our sale total 
agfeed is studying the entrance into a genetics program that can potentially significantly improve hog productivity and profitability through a higher number of piglets born per sow and lower feed costs due to improved feed to meat conversion ratios as better hog types grow faster while consume less feed 
agfeed s future investment plans include modernization of our pork production facilities  investment in reporting and cash management systems and the training of our employees  environmental and health safety programs including an emphasis on upgrading bio security 
these actions are part of our effort to improve on the standards of the new proposed china safety law to be implemented on june  and to assure consistent high quality and safe pork 
according to the china feed industry association  the prc has the world s largest and most profitable markets for hog production with approximately million hogs produced annually  compared to approximately million in the us 
more than billion chinese consume pork as their primary source of meat 
of all meat consumed in the prc is pork 
chinese consumers consume more pork each year than the rest of the world combined 
pork production in china is a key political  social and security issue for consumers 
the prc government supports hog producers with favorable tax status and subsidies  insurance  vaccines  caps on feed costs and land use grants 
hog production is exempt from all taxes and sow owners receive government grants and subsidies 
examples of the importance that the prc puts on hog production are exemplified by the adoption of new policies and enactment of new laws benefiting hog producers 
in january  the chinese central government instituted a set of measures that could prevent large declines in hog prices with the view of stabilizing hog production and hog prices in order to protect the interest of hog farms 
in july  the ndrc announced that they were channeling billion rmb for livestock farm construction and another billion rmb to support live pig production 
the food safety law  which goes into effect on june   provides a legal basis for the government to strengthen food safety control from the production line to the dining table 
critical accounting policies in presenting our financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  we are required to make certain estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported therein 
several of the estimates and assumptions we are required to make relate to matters that are inherently uncertain as they pertain to future events 
however  events that are outside of our control cannot be predicted and  as such  they cannot be contemplated in evaluating such estimates and assumptions 
if there is a significant unfavorable change to current conditions  it will likely result in a material adverse impact to our consolidated results of operations  financial position and liquidity 
we believe that the estimates and assumptions we used when preparing our financial statements were the most appropriate at that time 
presented below are those accounting policies that we believe require subjective and complex judgments that could potentially affect reported results 
use of estimates 
our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to impairment of long lived assets and allowance for doubtful accounts 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions  however  we believe that our estimates  including those for the above described items  are reasonable 
areas that require estimates and assumptions include valuation of accounts receivable and inventory  determination of useful lives of property and equipment  estimation of certain liabilities and sales returns 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
we continually monitor customer payments and maintain a reserve for estimated losses resulting from our customers inability to make required payments 
in determining the reserve  we evaluate the collectability of our accounts receivable based upon a variety of factors 
in cases where we become aware of circumstances that may impair a specific customer s ability to meet its financial obligations  we record a specific allowance against amounts due 
for all other customers  we recognize allowances for doubtful accounts based on our historical write off experience in conjunction with the length of time the receivables are past due  customer credit worthiness  geographic risk and the current business environment 
actual future losses from uncollectible accounts may differ from our estimates 
inventories 
inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market 
cost is determined using the first in  first out method 
we evaluate our ending inventories for estimated excess quantities and obsolescence 
our evaluation includes the analysis of future sales demand by product  within specific time horizons 
inventories in excess of projected future demand are written down to net realizable value 
in addition  we assess the impact of changing technology on inventory balances and writes down inventories that are considered obsolete 
inventory obsolescence and excess quantities have historically been minimal 
long lived assets 
we periodically assess potential impairments to our long lived assets in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
sfas no 
requires  among other things  that an entity perform an impairment review whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be fully recoverable 
factors we considered include  but are not limited to significant underperformance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results  significant changes in the manner of use of the acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business  and significant negative industry or economic trends 
when we determine that the carrying value of a long lived asset may not be recoverable based upon the existence of one or more of the above indicators of impairment  we estimate the future undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition 
if the sum of the expected future undiscounted cash flows and eventual disposition is less than the carrying amount of the asset  we recognize an impairment loss 
an impairment loss is reflected as the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair market value of the asset  based on the fair market value if available  or discounted cash flows 
to date  there has been no impairment of long lived assets 
property and equipment 
useful lives of property and equipment is based on historical experience and industry norms 
changes in useful lives due to changes in technology or other factors can affect future depreciation estimates 
revenue recognition 
our revenue recognition policies are in compliance with staff accounting bulletin sab revenue is recognized when services are rendered to customers when a formal arrangement exists  the price is fixed or determinable  the delivery is completed  no other significant obligations of agfeed exist and collectibility is reasonably assured 
payments received before all of the relevant criteria for revenue recognition are satisfied are recorded as unearned revenue 
we are not subject to vat withholdings 
we give volume rebates to certain customers based on volume achieved 
agfeed accrues sales rebates based on actual sales volume 
sales returns and rebates included in our revenues were   and  for the years ended december   and  respectively 
we make estimates and judgments when determining whether the collectability of revenue from customers is reasonably assured 
management estimates regarding collectability impact the actual revenues recognized each period and the timing of the recognition of revenues 
our assumptions and judgments regarding future collectability could differ from actual events  thus materially impacting our financial position and results of operations 
sales returns and allowances have historically been insignificant 
accordingly  estimating returns is not critical 
however  if circumstances change  returns and allowance may impact the company s earnings 
there are no differences in our arrangements with our different types of customers 
accordingly  we do not have different revenue recognition policies for different types of customers 
we offer credit terms ranging from to days for most customers 
from some large customers  we may extend these terms beyond days 
recent accounting pronouncements in june  fasb issued fasb staff position no 
eitf  accounting for nonrefundable advance payments for goods or services received for use in future research and development activities  which addresses whether nonrefundable advance payments for goods or services used or rendered for research and development activities should be expensed when the advance payment is made or when the research and development activity has been performed

results of operations comparison of fiscal years ended december  and december  as of december  change change revenues cost of sales gross profits operating expenses interest and financing costs net income revenues 
compared to the same period in  the increase in revenues was due to an increase in the volume of feed products that we sold and the acquisition of our hog farms 
the increase in feed product sales was a result of expanding our distribution channels by the opening of additional exclusive distribution stores for our products 
we experienced favorable market conditions that increased the demand for our feed products 
a stronger agfeed brand name allowed us to successfully increase our price twice in the second quarter of due to softening in the market for hog prices  we experienced a decrease in the selling price for our hogs during the second half of however  as a result of economies of scale  we were able to cut hog production cost through centralized raw materials purchases  sales and marketing channels  and finance and internal control management 
cost of goods sold 
we experienced increases in the unit cost of goods sold for our two business lines during the twelve month period ended december  compared to the same period in the cost of goods sold included costs in both premix feed and hog production 
these raw materials constitute approximately of our raw material costs 
gross profit 
gross margins decreased to from during the twelve month period ended december  as compared to the same period last year 
the decrease in gross margin can be attributed to the increase in the cost of hog feed during the last two quarters  and a substantial general sell off of swine inventory resulting in falling prices after the olympics ended 
this was modified somewhat by actions taken in the first half of  including expansion of our product distribution channels  and our entry into long term contracts for key product ingredients which locked in favorable cost savings 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expense includes overhead expenses such as rent  management and staff salaries  general insurance  marketing  accounting  legal and offices expenses 
the increase in our selling  general and administrative expense also reflects the addition of our new subsidiaries  which had a total of approximately million in selling  general and administrative expenses during selling expenses for the period increased by due to costs associated with the aggressive expansion into markets in neighboring provinces  and the costs associated with the absorption of our new subsidiaries 
interest and financing costs 
we incurred interest and financing costs of approximately million during  principally as a result of the issuance of million principal amount of convertible notes issued during february million of the convertible notes were converted into shares of common stock  resulting in the non recurring accelerated amortization of the debt issuance costs and debts discounts amounting to approximately million 
due to foreign exchange appreciation in rmb against the usd  we incurred a one time  non recurring loss on foreign translation of  during  as it is hard to timely convert usd deposits into rmb to implement these procedures due to safe regulations 
hog production is an income tax exempt sector in china and sow owners receive government grants and subsidies 
our feed manufacturing companies benefit from exemption from value added tax 
net income 
the increase in our net income was due to higher sales and the benefits from economies of scale in our business resulting in a modest increase in operating efficiency 
this was offset by one time  non operational related charges and interest expenses associated with the conversion of a portion of the million of convertible notes by investors during we continued to benefit from the tax exempt status for our hog production business 
comparison of fiscal years ended december  and december  as of december  change change revenues cost of sales gross profits selling  general and administrative expenses net income revenues 
the increase in revenues was due to an increase in the volume of feed products that we sold  the acquisition of guangxi huijie and the introduction in early of the airubao series  a new special blended feed product formulated especially for baby pigs 
guangxi huijie contributed approximately metric tons of premix volume during the fiscal year ended december   nanchang best experienced a decrease of approximately metric tons and shanghai best experienced an increase of approximately  metric tons of premix during the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  to account for the increase in premix volume 
we focused on increasing sales of the airubao series  which is a special blended feed product 
for comparative purposes  we will analyze the blended feed and airubao series together 
this increase was due primarily to the new airubao sales and approximately metric tons of blended feed sold by guangxi huijie 
nanchang best sold  metric tons during the year ended december  compared to  metric tons during the same period in guangxi huijie also accounted for  metric tons of other feed products  nanchang best sold metric tons and shanghai best sold metric tons of other feed products during the year ended december  overall  the guangxi huijie acquisition provided approximately of our revenues while nanchang best provided and shanghai best provided of our total revenues during the fiscal year ended december  guangxi huijie contributed approximately  nanchang best approximately and shanghai best approximately of the total volume of feed sold during the year ended december  nanchang best s revenues increased approximately during the year ended december  compared to the same period in shanghai best s revenues increased approximately during the year ended december  compared to the same period in lushan  acquired in november  did not materially contribute to our overall revenues 
cost of goods sold 
we experienced an approximate and increase in the unit cost of goods sold for blended feed and premix products  respectively  during the twelve month period ended december  compared to the same period in in order to provide excellent customer service and differentiate ourselves from our competition  at our customers request  we supply them with customized formulations of our products 
in any given month  the cost of the various additives used fluctuates  which can result in temporary increases in unit cost of goods sold 
we experienced an increase in the costs of corn and soybean meal of approximately and  respectively over their levels during the year ended december  these additives constitute approximately of our raw material costs 
these increased costs offset our increases in revenues 
even though this may have an adverse effect on our short term profits  we take the long term view that this practice results in increased customer loyalty  builds the agfeed brand and will ultimately lead to increased sales and gross profits 
in addition  we are presently experiencing more stable pricing in these additives  which we anticipate will stabilize our cost of goods sold 
nanchang best experienced a increase in cost of goods sold during the year ended december  compared to the same period in shanghai best experienced a increase in cost of goods sold during the year ended december  compared to the same period in gross profit 
gross margins decreased to for the year ended december  from for the same period in the decrease in gross margin can be attributed to several factors i the cost of introducing the airubao series  ii we experienced an approximate increase in the unit cost of goods sold of blended feed during the twelve months ended december  compared to the same period in  iii the unit cost of goods sold for premix products increased approximately during the year ended december  compared to the same period in gross margins at nanchang best for the year ended december  were approximately compared to for the same period in gross margins at shanghai best for the year ended december  were compared to for the same period in gross margins at guangxi huijie for the year ended december  were approximately 
gross margin calculations for each subsidiary are calculated prior to any adjustments for intercompany sales  which are reflected in the consolidated financial statements 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
we incurred legal and audit expense in the year ended december  of approximately  associated with being a us publicly traded reporting company that we did not incur during the same period in the increase in our general and administrative expense also reflects the addition of guangxi huijie  which had approximately  of general and administrative expenses during the year ended december  general and administrative expense includes overhead expenses such as rent  management and staff salaries  general insurance  marketing  accounting and legal and office expenses 
selling expenses for the period increased by due to the increase in revenues and the costs associated with entering markets in neighboring provinces as well as the addition of guangxi huijie  which had approximately  of selling expenses during the year ended december  we attempted to control our selling expenses through the use of strict cost controls and efficient use of our distribution channels 
net income 
our increase in net income was due to an increase in income from operations offset by an increase in non operating income due to net interest expense offset by other income of approximately  the major reason for the increase in non operating income during was interest earned on the net proceeds of our financings of approximately  and other income of approximately  offset by interest paid in connection with short term loans of approximately  in addition  our nanchang best subsidiary became a sino foreign joint venture due to an investment by a foreign investor in july nanchang best receives favorable tax status and is exempt from all income tax through july  after which will pay tax at a reduced rate of for the next three years

in connection with the convertible notes  we issued  warrants which are exercisable immediately and have a strike price 
we paid  related to the sale of shares and  related to the issuance of the convertible notes

during the period from october  through october   the company repurchased  shares of our common stock for gross proceeds of  no additional shares have been repurchased 
during the year ended december   we completed two private placement offerings of our securities 
through the final closing of the first private placement offering on april   we received aggregate gross proceeds of  from the sale of an aggregate of  units to accredited investors 
each unit was priced at and represented one share of our common stock and a warrant to purchase eight percent of one share of common stock 
accordingly  we issued an aggregate of  shares of our common stock and warrants to purchase an aggregate of  shares of our common stock to the accredited investors who participated in this offering 
in connection with the private placement  fees of eight percent of the securities placed were paid in cash and a number of common stock purchase warrants equal to eight percent of the units placed were paid to participating dealers and one finder 
accordingly  we paid  and issued warrants to purchase  shares of our common stock to the participating dealers and finder 
all of the common stock purchase warrants issued have a three year term and have an initial exercise price of 
we received net proceeds from the private placement of  after deduction of the costs associated with the financing of  on june   we completed a second private placement offering pursuant to which we sold  units at an offering price of per unit for gross proceeds of  each unit sold consisted of one share of common stock and one warrant to purchase percent of one share of common stock 
accordingly  we issued  shares of our common stock and warrants to purchase  shares of our common stock to the one accredited investor that participated in this offering 
in connection with this private placement offering  a fee of eight percent of the securities placed was paid in cash and a number of common stock purchase warrants equal to eight percent of the units placed were paid to a finder

all stock purchase warrants are exercisable for a period of three years at an exercise price of per share 
we received net proceeds from the private placement of  after deduction of costs associated with the financing 
as of december   we had no outstanding loans 
the loans that we entered into in and were paid in full during the second quarter of during the year ended december   we generated  of cash from our operating activities 
the cash was generated primarily due to net income of  non cash expenses of  offset by an increase in operating assets  net of  we used  in investing activities during the year ended december   of which  was for the acquisition of property and equipment  and  for the acquisition of the hog farms and one feed company 
we received  in cash from financing activities 
during the year ended december   we received  from the sale of our securities and paid  in offering costs 
we also received  from the issuance of convertible notes and warrants  of which the company paid  for the cost of issuing the convertible notes and warrants 
in addition  warrants holders exercised  warrants resulting in gross proceeds to us of  and minority interest holders contributed  at december   our accounts receivable balance was approximately million  a reduction of million in the last quarter alone 
there is no accounts receivable for hog sales because the farmers purchasing hogs from us generally pay cash 
our principal demands for liquidity are to increase capacity  raw materials purchase  sales distribution  and the possible acquisition of producing hog farms or joint ventures in our industry as opportunities present themselves  as well as general corporate purposes 
we anticipate that the amount of cash we have on hand as of the date of this report as well as the cash that we will generate from operations will satisfy these requirements 
we may seek additional funds from the capital markets as we identify additional acquisition candidates 
we expect all of our hog farm acquisitions in the future to be accretive to earnings 
we intend to meet our liquidity requirements  including capital expenditures related to the purchase of equipment  purchase of raw materials  and the expansion of our business  through cash flow provided by operations and funds raised through cash investments 
the majority of the our revenues and expenses were denominated in rmb  the currency of the prc 
there is no assurance that exchange rates between the rmb and the usd will remain stable 
contractual obligations no contractual obligation occurred during the year ended december  and therefore it is not expected to have any effect on our liquidity and cash flow in future periods 
inflation and seasonality demand for our products remains fairly consistent throughout the year and we do not believe our operations have been materially affected by inflation or seasonality
