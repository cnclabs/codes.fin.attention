overview we are a fully integrated self administered and self managed reit and one of the largest owners and developers of class a office properties in the united states 
our properties are concentrated in five markets boston  midtown manhattan  washington  dc  san francisco and princeton  nj 
we generate revenue and cash primarily by leasing our class a office space to our tenants 
factors we consider when we lease space include the creditworthiness of the tenant  the length of the lease  the rental rate to be paid  the costs of tenant improvements  current and anticipated operating costs and real estate taxes  our current and anticipated vacancy  current and anticipated future demand for office space generally and general economic factors 
we also generate cash through the sale of assets  which may be either non core assets or core assets that command premiums from real estate investors 
the impact of the current state of the economy  including rising unemployment  constrained capital and the deleveraging of the financial system  continues to have a dampening effect on the fundamentals of our business  including overall market occupancy and rental rates 
our core strategy has always been to operate in supply 
table of contents constrained markets with high barriers to entry and to focus on executing long term leases with financially strong tenants 
historically  this combination has tended to reduce our exposure to down cycles  but if major tenants in our markets come under financial pressure and do not utilize all of their space it will likely lead to increased supply through subletting or tenant defaults and a corresponding reduction in market rental rates 
we are also not immune from the impact of the credit crisis and global economic slowdown on our own tenants and our investments 
during the third quarter of  lehman brothers  inc  our tenth largest tenant  filed for bankruptcy protection and we established a reserve for its related accrued straight line rent balance of million 
lehman brothers must continue to pay its rent while it occupies the space  but it may reject its lease at any time 
there can be no assurance whether and for how long lehman brothers will continue to occupy this space 
lehman brothers rent contributes approximately million per year to our revenues 
in addition  during the fourth quarter of  we recognized aggregate non cash impairment charges which represented the other than temporary decline in the fair values below the carrying values of certain of our investments in unconsolidated joint ventures 
the joint ventures include the entities that own madison avenue  two grand central tower  west th street  the value added fund and our eighth avenue and th street project located in new york city 
more generally  we remain concerned about the financial stress that our current and prospective tenants face 
we believe that tenant defaults will continue and that  in general  demand for office space will decrease due to significant job losses in the financial and professional services industries and that market rents will be under pressure for the foreseeable future 
in part as a result of these market conditions  on february   we announced our intention to suspend construction on our development at west th street in new york city because we were not able to conclude a lease transaction with a major law firm with which we had been negotiating over the last year 
agreement on financial terms had been reached with the firm within the last year  but recently the law firm informed us that it could not proceed on those terms thereby rendering the project economically infeasible in today s environment 
the project  a one million square foot office building  was originally scheduled for completion in as a result of the decision to suspend construction at west th street  we expect to reduce our capital commitments on the project through by approximately million 
after suspension of the west th street project  our development program will be approximately billion and is pre leased to tenants 
as of december   we had invested approximately million in our current active developments ie  excluding west th street and  in addition to anticipated proceeds from existing construction loan facilities  we expect to make additional investments of approximately million over the next four years 
recently we have witnessed a reduction in construction materials and labor pricing  which may reduce our total project costs  although there can be no assurance in this regard 
as of december   we had million in cash and million in availability under our unsecured line of credit and anticipate funding the development projects through a combination of this existing liquidity supplemented by new construction loan facilities and or the incurrence of additional secured or unsecured debt 
while we successfully utilized an accordion feature under our unsecured line of credit to increase the lenders total commitment under the facility to billion in july  completed an offering of million of exchangeable senior notes in august and completed a million financing of embarcadero center four in november  many of the debt capital markets that real estate companies like us frequently access  such as the unsecured bond market and the convertible debt market  are not currently available to us on terms that we believe are economically attractive 
in addition  other capital sources such as the traditional banks  pension funds and life insurance companies are lending fewer dollars  under stricter terms and at greater costs to the borrowers 
despite these challenges  we believe the quality of our assets and our strong balance sheet align ourselves well with the lenders current investment selectivity and should enable us to access the credit markets even in the current difficult environment 
because capital may continue to be constrained  however  we are also evaluating the appropriate amount and form of distributions for see liquidity and capital resources 

table of contents we believe the successful lease up and completion of our development pipeline will enhance our long term return on equity and earnings growth as these developments are placed in service in  and as with all aspects of our business  however  we continue to monitor the impact of the global economic slowdown and may further adjust our development plans accordingly 
we do not anticipate undertaking any new development projects in the foreseeable future without significant pre leasing commitments from creditworthy tenants 
our focus on acquisition activity has moderated  but we continue to actively monitor the market and seek opportunities to selectively acquire high quality real estate at attractive returns 
finally  in recent years  we have been an active seller of real estate assets and  although we will consider additional asset sales  we do not expect our sales volume to be comparable to that of prior years 
for descriptions of significant transactions that we entered into during  see item business transactions during critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  or gaap  requires management to use judgment in the application of accounting policies  including making estimates and assumptions 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
these judgments affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting periods 
if our judgment or interpretation of the facts and circumstances relating to various transactions had been different  it is possible that different accounting policies would have been applied resulting in a different presentation of our financial statements 
from time to time  we evaluate our estimates and assumptions 
in the event estimates or assumptions prove to be different from actual results  adjustments are made in subsequent periods to reflect more current information 
below is a discussion of accounting policies that we consider critical in that they may require complex judgment in their application or require estimates about matters that are inherently uncertain 
real estate upon acquisitions of real estate  we assess the fair value of acquired tangible and intangible assets  including land  buildings  tenant improvements  above and below market leases  origination costs  acquired in place leases  other identified intangible assets and assumed liabilities in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 business combinations and allocate the purchase price to the acquired assets and assumed liabilities  including land at appraised value and buildings at replacement cost 
we assess and consider fair value based on estimated cash flow projections that utilize discount and or capitalization rates that we deem appropriate  as well as available market information 
estimates of future cash flows are based on a number of factors including the historical operating results  known and anticipated trends  and market and economic conditions 
the fair value of the tangible assets of an acquired property considers the value of the property as if it were vacant 
we also consider an allocation of purchase price of other acquired intangibles  including acquired in place leases that may have a customer relationship intangible value  including but not limited to the nature and extent of the existing relationship with the tenants  the tenants credit quality and expectations of lease renewals 
based on our acquisitions to date  our allocation to customer relationship intangible assets has been immaterial 
we record acquired above and below market leases at their fair values using a discount rate which reflects the risks associated with the leases acquired equal to the difference between the contractual amounts to be paid pursuant to each in place lease and management s estimate of fair market lease rates for each corresponding in place lease  measured over a period equal to the remaining term of the lease for above market leases and the initial term plus the term of any below market fixed rate renewal options for below market leases 
other intangible assets acquired include amounts for in place lease values that are based on our evaluation of the specific characteristics of each tenant s lease 
factors to be considered include estimates of carrying costs during hypothetical expected lease up periods considering current market conditions  and costs to execute similar leases 
in estimating carrying costs  we include real estate taxes  insurance and other operating expenses and estimates of 
table of contents lost rentals at market rates during the expected lease up periods  depending on local market conditions 
in estimating costs to execute similar leases  we consider leasing commissions  legal and other related expenses 
real estate is stated at depreciated cost 
the cost of buildings and improvements includes the purchase price of property  legal fees and other acquisition costs 
costs directly related to the development of properties are capitalized 
capitalized development costs include interest  internal wages  property taxes  insurance  and other project costs incurred during the period of development 
management reviews its long lived assets used in operations for impairment following the end of each quarter and when there is an event or change in circumstances that indicates an impairment in value 
an impairment loss is recognized if the carrying amount of its assets is not recoverable and exceeds its fair value 
if such impairment is present  an impairment loss is recognized based on the excess of the carrying amount of the asset over its fair value 
the evaluation of anticipated cash flows is highly subjective and is based in part on assumptions regarding future occupancy  rental rates and capital requirements that could differ materially from actual results in future periods 
since cash flows on properties considered to be long lived assets to be held and used as defined by sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  sfas no 
are considered on an undiscounted basis to determine whether an asset has been impaired  our established strategy of holding properties over the long term directly decreases the likelihood of recording an impairment loss 
if our strategy changes or market conditions otherwise dictate an earlier sale date  an impairment loss may be recognized and such loss could be material 
if we determine that impairment has occurred  the affected assets must be reduced to their fair value 
sfas no 
 requires that qualifying assets and liabilities and the results of operations that have been sold  or otherwise qualify as held for sale  be presented as discontinued operations in all periods presented if the property operations are expected to be eliminated and we will not have significant continuing involvement following the sale 
the components of the property s net income that is reflected as discontinued operations include the net gain or loss upon the disposition of the property held for sale  operating results  depreciation and interest expense if the property is subject to a secured loan 
we generally consider assets to be held for sale when the transaction has been approved by our board of directors  or a committee thereof  and there are no known significant contingencies relating to the sale  such that the property sale within one year is considered probable 
following the classification of a property as held for sale  no further depreciation is recorded on the assets 
a variety of costs are incurred in the acquisition  development and leasing of properties 
after the determination is made to capitalize a cost  it is allocated to the specific component of a project that is benefited 
determination of when a development project commences and capitalization begins  and when a development project is substantially complete and held available for occupancy and capitalization must cease involves a degree of judgment 
our capitalization policy on development properties is guided by sfas no 
capitalization of interest cost and sfas no 
accounting for costs and the initial rental operations of real estate projects 
the costs of land and buildings under development include specifically identifiable costs 
the capitalized costs include pre construction costs necessary to the development of the property  development costs  construction costs  interest costs  real estate taxes  salaries and related costs and other costs incurred during the period of development 
we begin the capitalization of costs during the pre construction period which we define as activities that are necessary to the development of the property 
we consider a construction project as substantially completed and held available for occupancy upon the completion of tenant improvements  but no later than one year from cessation of major construction activity 
we cease capitalization on the portion substantially completed and occupied or held available for occupancy  and we capitalize only those costs associated with the portion under construction 
investments in unconsolidated joint ventures except for ownership interests in variable interest entities  we account for our investments in joint ventures under the equity method of accounting because we exercise significant influence over  but do not control  these 
table of contents entities 
our judgment with respect to our level of influence or control of an entity and whether we are the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity involves the consideration of various factors including the form of our ownership interest  our representation in the entity s governance  the size of our investment including loans  estimates of future cash flows  our ability to participate in policy making decisions and the rights of the other investors to participate in the decision making process and to replace us as manager and or liquidate the venture  if applicable 
our assessment of our influence or control over an entity affects the presentation of these investments in our consolidated financial statements 
these investments are recorded initially at cost  as investments in unconsolidated joint ventures  and subsequently adjusted for equity in earnings and cash contributions and distributions 
any difference between the carrying amount of these investments on our balance sheet and the underlying equity in net assets is amortized as an adjustment to equity in earnings of unconsolidated joint ventures over the life of the related asset 
under the equity method of accounting  our net equity is reflected within the consolidated balance sheets  and our share of net income or loss from the joint ventures is included within the consolidated statements of operations 
the joint venture agreements may designate different percentage allocations among investors for profits and losses  however  our recognition of joint venture income or loss generally follows the joint venture s distribution priorities  which may change upon the achievement of certain investment return thresholds 
for ownership interests in variable interest entities  we consolidate those in which we are the primary beneficiary 
our investments in unconsolidated joint ventures are reviewed for impairment periodically and we record impairment charges when events or circumstances change indicating that a decline in the fair values below the carrying values has occurred and such decline is other than temporary 
the ultimate realization of our investment in unconsolidated joint ventures is dependent on a number of factors  including the performance of each investment and market conditions 
we will record an impairment charge if we determine that a decline in the value of an investment in an unconsolidated joint venture is other than temporary 
during december  we recognized non cash impairment charges which represented the other than temporary decline in the fair values below the carrying values of certain of our investments in unconsolidated joint ventures 
in accordance with accounting principles board opinion no 
the equity method of accounting for investments in common stock apb no 
 a loss in value of an investment under the equity method of accounting  which is other than a temporary decline  must be recognized 
unlike sfas no 
 potential impairments under apb no 
result from fair values derived based on discounted cash flows and other valuation techniques which are more sensitive to current market conditions 
as a result  we recognized non cash impairment charges of approximately million  million  million and million on our investments in madison avenue  two grand central tower  west th street and the value added fund  respectively 
during december  an unconsolidated joint venture in which we have a interest suspended development activity on its eighth avenue and th street project located in new york city 
the proposed project was comprised of an assemblage of land parcels and air rights  including contracts to acquire land parcels and air rights  on which the joint venture was to construct a class a office property 
as a result  we recognized a charge totaling approximately million including million of non cash impairment charges in accordance with apb no 
 which represented our share of land and air rights impairment losses  forfeited contract deposits and previously incurred planning and pre development costs 
the combined summarized financial information of the unconsolidated joint ventures is disclosed in note of the consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition contractual rental revenue is reported on a straight line basis over the terms of our respective leases 
in accordance with sfas no 
 we recognize rental revenue of acquired in place above and below market leases at their fair values over the terms of the respective leases 
accrued rental income as reported on the consolidated balance sheets represents rental income recognized in excess of rent payments actually received pursuant to the terms of the individual lease agreements 

table of contents for the year ended december   we recorded million of rental revenue representing the adjustments of rents from above and below market leases in accordance with sfas no 
for the year ended december   the impact of the straight line rent adjustment was approximately a million increase in rental revenue 
the straight line adjustment for the year included an approximately million decrease due to the establishment of reserves for the full amount of the accrued straight line rent balances associated with our leases in new york city with lehman brothers  inc and the law firm of heller ehrman llp 
amounts exclude sfas no 
and straight line income from unconsolidated joint ventures  which is disclosed in note of the consolidated financial statements 
our leasing strategy is generally to secure creditworthy tenants that meet our underwriting guidelines 
furthermore  following the initiation of a lease  we continue to actively monitor the tenant s creditworthiness to ensure that all tenant related assets are recorded at their realizable value 
when assessing tenant credit quality  we review relevant financial information  including financial ratios  net worth  revenue  cash flows  leverage and liquidity  evaluate the depth and experience of the tenant s management team  and assess the strength growth of the tenant s industry 
as a result of the underwriting process  tenants are then categorized into one of three categories low risk tenants  the tenant s credit is such that we require collateral  in which case we require a security deposit  and or reduce upfront tenant improvement investments  or the tenant s credit is below our acceptable parameters 
we consistently monitor the credit quality of our tenant base 
we provide an allowance for doubtful accounts arising from estimated losses that could result from the tenant s inability to make required current rent payments and an allowance against accrued rental income for future potential losses that we deem to be unrecoverable over the term of the lease 
tenant receivables are assigned a credit rating of through a rating of represents the highest possible rating and no allowance is recorded 
a rating of represents the lowest credit rating  in which case we record a full reserve against the receivable balance 
among the factors considered in determining the credit rating include payment history  credit status and change in status credit ratings for public companies are used as a primary metric  change in tenant space needs ie  expansion downsize  tenant financial performance  economic conditions in a specific geographic region  and industry specific credit considerations 

table of contents if our estimates of collectibility differ from the cash received  then the timing and amount of our reported revenue could be impacted 
the average remaining term of our in place tenant leases  including unconsolidated joint ventures  was approximately years as of december  the credit risk is mitigated by the high quality of our existing tenant base  reviews of prospective tenants risk profiles prior to lease execution and consistent monitoring of our portfolio to identify potential problem tenants 
recoveries from tenants  consisting of amounts due from tenants for common area maintenance  real estate taxes and other recoverable costs  are recognized as revenue in the period during which the expenses are incurred 
tenant reimbursements are recognized and presented in accordance with emerging issues task force  or eitf  issue reporting revenue gross as a principal versus net as an agent  or issue 
issue requires that these reimbursements be recorded on a gross basis  as we are generally the primary obligor with respect to purchasing goods and services from third party suppliers  have discretion in selecting the supplier and have credit risk 
we also receive reimbursement of payroll and payroll related costs from third parties which we reflect on a net basis in accordance with issue our hotel revenues are derived from room rentals and other sources such as charges to guests for long distance telephone service  fax machine use  movie and vending commissions  meeting and banquet room revenue and laundry services 
hotel revenues are recognized as earned 
we receive management and development fees from third parties 
management fees are recorded and earned based on a percentage of collected rents at the properties under management  and not on a straight line basis  because such fees are contingent upon the collection of rents 
we review each development agreement and record development fees as earned depending on the risk associated with each project 
profit on development fees earned from joint venture projects is recognized as revenue to the extent of the third party partners ownership interest 
gains on sales of real estate are recognized pursuant to the provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for sales of real estate 
the specific timing of a sale is measured against various criteria in sfas no 
related to the terms of the transaction and any continuing involvement in the form of management or financial assistance associated with the properties 
if the sales criteria are not met  we defer gain recognition and account for the continued operations of the property by applying the finance  installment or cost recovery methods  as appropriate  until the sales criteria are met 
depreciation and amortization we compute depreciation and amortization on our properties using the straight line method based on estimated useful asset lives 
in accordance with sfas no 
 we allocate the acquisition cost of real estate to land  building  tenant improvements  acquired above and below market leases  origination costs and acquired in place leases based on an assessment of their fair value and depreciate or amortize these assets over their useful lives 
the amortization of acquired above and below market leases and acquired in place leases is recorded as an adjustment to revenue and depreciation and amortization  respectively  in the consolidated statements of operations 
fair value of financial instruments for purposes of disclosure  we calculate the fair value of our mortgage notes payable and unsecured senior notes 
we discount the spread between the future contractual interest payments and hypothetical future interest payments on our mortgage debt and unsecured notes based on a current market rate 
in determining the current market rate  we add our estimate of a market spread to the quoted yields on federal government treasury securities with similar maturity dates to our own debt 
because our valuations of our financial instruments are based on these types of estimates  the actual fair value of our financial instruments may differ materially if our estimates do not prove to be accurate 

table of contents derivative instruments and hedging activities derivative instruments and hedging activities require management to make judgments on the nature of its derivatives and their effectiveness as hedges 
these judgments determine if the changes in fair value of the derivative instruments are reported in the consolidated statements of operations as a component of net income or as a component of comprehensive income and as a component of equity on the consolidated balance sheets 
while management believes its judgments are reasonable  a change in a derivative s effectiveness as a hedge could materially affect expenses  net income and equity 
we recognized net derivative losses of approximately million for the year ended december  see note of the consolidated financial statements 
results of operations the following discussion is based on our consolidated financial statements for the years ended december   and at december   and  we owned or had interests in a portfolio of  and properties  respectively the total property portfolio 
as a result of changes within our total property portfolio  the financial data presented below shows significant changes in revenue and expenses from period to period 
accordingly  we do not believe that our period to period financial data with respect to the total property portfolio are necessarily meaningful 
therefore  the comparisons of operating results for the years ended  and show separately the changes attributable to the properties that were owned by us throughout each period compared the same property portfolio and the changes attributable to the properties included in properties acquired  sold  repositioned and placed in service 
in our analysis of operating results  particularly to make comparisons of net operating income between periods meaningful  it is important to provide information for properties that were in service and owned by us throughout each period presented 
we refer to properties acquired or placed in service prior to the beginning of the earliest period presented and owned by us through the end of the latest period presented as our same property portfolio 
the same property portfolio therefore excludes properties placed in service  acquired or repositioned after the beginning of the earliest period presented or disposed of prior to the end of the latest period presented 
net operating income  or noi  is a non gaap financial measure equal to net income available to common shareholders  the most directly comparable gaap financial measure  plus minority interest in operating partnership  losses from early extinguishments of debt  losses from investments in securities  net derivative losses  depreciation and amortization  interest expense  general and administrative expense  less gains on sales of real estate from discontinued operations net of minority interest  income from discontinued operations net of minority interest  gains on sales of real estate and other assets net of minority interest  income loss from unconsolidated joint ventures  minority interests in property partnerships  interest and other income and development and management services revenue 
we use noi internally as a performance measure and believe noi provides useful information to investors regarding our financial condition and results of operations because it reflects only those income and expense items that are incurred at the property level 
therefore  we believe noi is a useful measure for evaluating the operating performance of our real estate assets 
our management also uses noi to evaluate regional property level performance and to make decisions about resource allocations 
further  we believe noi is useful to investors as a performance measure because  when compared across periods  noi reflects the impact on operations from trends in occupancy rates  rental rates  operating costs and acquisition and development activity on an unleveraged basis  providing perspective not immediately apparent from net income 
noi excludes certain components from net income in order to provide results that are more closely related to a property s results of operations 
for example  interest expense is not necessarily linked to the operating performance of a real estate asset and is often incurred at the corporate level as opposed to the property level 
in addition  depreciation and amortization  because of historical cost accounting and useful life estimates  may distort operating performance at the property level 
noi presented by 
table of contents us may not be comparable to noi reported by other reits that define noi differently 
we believe that in order to facilitate a clear understanding of our operating results  noi should be examined in conjunction with net income as presented in our consolidated financial statements 
noi should not be considered as an alternative to net income as an indication of our performance or to cash flows as a measure of liquidity or ability to make distributions 
comparison of the year ended december  to the year ended december  the table below shows selected operating information for the same property portfolio and the total property portfolio 
the same property portfolio consists of properties  including properties acquired or placed in service on or prior to january  and owned through december   totaling approximately million net rentable square feet of space excluding square feet of structured parking 
the total property portfolio includes the effects of the other properties either placed in service  acquired or repositioned after january  or disposed of on or prior to december  properties placed in service includes our th street joint venture project 
in connection with partially placing this property in service  we consolidated the joint venture entity that owns the property as of october  due to the involvement we have in the venture once the property is operational

table of contents rental revenue the increase of approximately million in the total property portfolio rental revenue is comprised of increases and decreases within four categories that comprise our total property portfolio 
rental revenue from the same property portfolio increased approximately million  properties sold decreased approximately million  properties acquired increased approximately million and properties placed in service increased approximately million for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  rental revenue from the same property portfolio increased approximately million for the year ended december  compared to included in the same property portfolio rental revenue is an overall increase in contractual rental revenue of approximately million  offset by a decrease of approximately million in straight line rents 
an aggregate of million of the decrease in straight line rent is due to the establishment of reserves for the full amount of the accrued straight line rent balances associated with our leases in new york city with lehman brothers  inc and the law firm of heller ehrman llp 
approximately million of the increase from the same property portfolio was due to an increase in recoveries from tenants which relates to the increase in operating expenses 
approximately million of the increase from the same property portfolio was due to an increase in parking and other income 
we expect the aggregate impact of straight line rents for fiscal to be between million and million 
lehman brothers  inc contributes approximately million per year to our rental revenue 
in the event that lehman brothers  inc rejects its lease and vacates its space  we will lose this revenue until we are able to lease this space to a new tenant 
the increase in rental revenue from properties placed in service relates to fully placing in service our th street development project in the first quarter of and our citypoint and south of market development projects during the fourth quarter of in addition  we partially placed in service our one preserve parkway development project during the second quarter of rental revenue from properties placed in service increased approximately million  as detailed below property date placed in service rental revenue for the year ended december change in thousands th street first quarter     south of market fourth quarter    citypoint fourth quarter    one preserve parkway second quarter    total the acquisitions of kingstowne towne center  north first business park  fourth avenue  springfield center drive and springfield metro center during and massachusetts avenue during  resulted in an increase of revenue from properties acquired

table of contents liquidity and capital resources general our principal liquidity needs for the next twelve months and beyond are to fund normal recurring expenses  meet debt service and principal repayment obligations  including balloon payments on maturing debt  fund capital expenditures  including major renovations  tenant improvements and leasing costs  fund development costs  fund possible property acquisitions  and make the minimum distribution required to maintain our reit qualification under the internal revenue code of  as amended 
we expect to satisfy these needs using one or more of the following construction loans  long term secured and unsecured indebtedness including unsecured exchangeable indebtedness  cash flow from operations  distribution of cash flows from joint ventures  cash and cash equivalent balances  sales of real estate  issuances of our equity securities and or additional preferred or common units of partnership interest in our operating partnership  and our unsecured line of credit or other short term bridge facilities 
we believe that our liquidity needs will be satisfied using our cash on hand  cash flows generated by operations  availability under our unsecured line of credit and cash flows provided by other financing activities 
we draw on multiple financing sources to fund our long term capital needs 
our unsecured line of credit is utilized primarily as a bridge facility to fund acquisition opportunities  to refinance outstanding indebtedness and to meet short term development and working capital needs 
we generally fund our development projects with construction loans  which may be partially guaranteed by our operating partnership  until project completion or lease up thresholds are achieved 
contractual rental revenue  recovery income from tenants  other income from operations  available cash balances  draws on our unsecured line of credit and refinancing of maturing indebtedness are our principal sources of capital used to pay operating expenses  debt service  recurring capital expenditures and the minimum distribution required to maintain our reit qualification 
we seek to increase income from our existing properties by maintaining quality standards for our properties that promote high occupancy rates and permit increases in rental rates while reducing tenant turnover and controlling operating expenses 
our sources of revenue also include third party fees generated by our office real estate management  leasing  development and construction businesses 
consequently  we believe our revenue  together with proceeds from financing activities  will continue to provide the necessary funds for our short term liquidity needs 
material changes in these factors may adversely affect our net cash flows 
such changes  in turn  could adversely affect our ability to fund distributions  debt service payments and tenant improvements 
in addition  a material adverse change in our cash provided by operations may affect our ability to comply with the financial performance covenants under our unsecured line of credit and unsecured senior notes 

table of contents the credit markets continue to be extremely constrained in the real estate sector  as lenders are primarily focusing on refinancing or restructuring existing loans 
lenders are taking relatively little underwriting risk  the amount of capital they are willing to commit has decreased and the underwriting standards that they are employing have become increasingly conservative 
we have approximately million of debt maturities in the largest is approximately million where we have two one year extension options and expect to exercise the first extension option in the other two loans are with life insurance companies  at conservative loan to value ratios and we expect to refinance or replace them at maturity 
in  we have debt maturities totaling approximately million and our unconsolidated joint ventures have debt maturities totaling approximately million of which our share is approximately million 
all of these loans are secured mortgages 
the two largest maturities are loans on west th street and two grand central tower  and we anticipate a reduced loan amount as part of the refinancing of these assets 
the remaining loans are moderately leveraged mortgages on stabilized properties where we expect to be able to refinance the existing loan amounts 
we intend to be proactive requesting financing bids on these and other stable assets and anticipate completing additional financings during the remainder of our capital commitments over the next few years are to fund our development program 
in total our remaining capital requirements  net of interest and anticipated fundings from existing construction loans  to complete our ongoing developments is million  through the end of with our cash  availability under our unsecured line of credit  and the anticipated cash flow generated by the operating portfolio  we believe we have sufficient capacity to fund the entire program 
in addition  we expect to arrange supplementary construction facilities on a number of these projects as we move through to create additional liquidity 
for more details on properties under construction  see page finally  in recent years  we have been an active seller of real estate assets and  although we will consider additional asset sales  we do not expect our sales volume to be comparable to that of prior years 
reit tax distribution considerations dividend because capital may continue to be constrained  we are also evaluating the appropriate amount and form of payment of distributions for a reit is subject to a number of organizational and operational requirements  including a requirement that it currently distribute at least of its annual taxable income 
our policy is to distribute at least of our taxable income to avoid paying federal tax 
our last four regular quarterly distributions including distributions paid to third party op unitholders totaled an aggregate of approximately million 
under the applicable reit regulations  we can apply the fourth quarter dividend which was declared on december  and paid on january   in whole or in part  to satisfy our minimum reit distribution requirements 
if we choose to apply the entire amount  we could reduce our required distributions by approximately million 
in addition  as a result of a temporary revenue procedure recently issued by the internal revenue service  we are  like many other reits  also evaluating the financial  legal and tax implications on both stockholders and holders of partnership interests in bplp of issuing equity in lieu of a portion of our regular cash dividend 
we continue to consider the advantages and disadvantages of reducing our cash distributions and or issuing equity in lieu of a portion of our cash distributions in light of the current state of the capital markets  our current stock price and other factors 
sales to the extent that we sell assets and cannot efficiently use the proceeds for either our development activities or attractive acquisitions  we would  at the appropriate time  decide whether it is better to declare a special dividend  adopt a stock repurchase program  reduce our indebtedness or retain the cash for future investment opportunities 
such a decision will depend on many factors including  among others  the timing  availability and terms of development and acquisition opportunities  our then current and anticipated leverage  the price of our common stock and reit distribution requirements 
at a minimum  we expect that we would distribute at least that amount of proceeds necessary for us to avoid paying corporate level tax on the applicable gains realized from any asset sales
