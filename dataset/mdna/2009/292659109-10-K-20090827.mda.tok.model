item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations forward looking statements 
overview we design  manufacture and sell photovoltaic pv products  known as pv or solar laminates that generate clean  renewable energy by converting sunlight into electricity 
our solar laminates have unique characteristics that differentiate them from conventional crystalline solar modules  including physical flexibility  light weight  high durability and ease of installation 
these characteristics make our products particularly suitable for rooftop and building integrated photovoltaic bipv applications  which are our target markets 
we manufacture our solar laminates using a proprietary process and technology that we developed through nearly years of research 
solar laminate sales represent more than of our revenues 
we also receive fees and royalties from licensees of our nickel metal hydride nimh battery technology and sell high performance nickel hydroxide used in nimh batteries 
our business segments we operate our business in two business segments united solar ovonic and ovonic materials 
financial information regarding each segment is available in note  business segments  of the notes to our consolidated financial statements 
united solar ovonic our united solar ovonic segment designs  manufactures and sells pv laminates that generate clean  renewable energy by converting sunlight into electricity 
this business  which we conduct through our wholly owned subsidiary  united solar ovonic llc uso  is based principally on our pioneering technologies for thin film amorphous silicon pv laminates and roll to roll manufacturing 
in addition  subsequent to june   we completed the acquisition of solar integrated technologies  inc sit  which will expand our sales activities to include design  development and installation of rooftop and bipv systems and applications  as well as enhance our field engineering and technical support activities 
our pv laminates possess several unique attributes that make them ideal for both rooftop and building integrated applications  including ability to be integrated with roofing materials  ability to qualify for special bipv incentives  light weight  superior resistance to wind uplift  no roof penetration  high durability and impact resistance  and ease of installation 
in addition  our products generate more electricity in real world conditions than many competing products  resulting in higher returns for our customers 
we sell our pv laminates principally for commercial and industrial roofing applications 
we believe we have a strategic competitive advantage because our pv laminates are readily adaptable for integration 
table of contents into various roofing materials 
we sell most of our laminates to commercial roofing materials manufacturers  builders and building contractors  and solar power installers integrators who incorporate our pv laminates into their products for commercial sale and then handle all aspects of the consumer relationship  including marketing  sales and service 
we have developed similar relationships with residential roofing material manufacturers  who are developing applications to sell our laminates through their distributions and installation channels for the residential market 
the adaptability of our lightweight  flexible pv laminates also presents opportunities for sales to developers of certain ground mount and other pv applications 
in addition  as a consequence of our sit acquisition in august  we now have the capacity to sell and service complete rooftop and bipv systems to end user customers 
we presently have mw of nameplate manufacturing capacity 
we have an additional mw of nameplate manufacturing capacity attributable to our auburn hills facility  which is offline as we consolidate certain of the production operations from this facility into our newer auburn hills facility 
this consolidation  which will lower overall costs and improve manufacturing efficiencies  is part of an overall program to reduce costs 
we manufacture our pv laminates using our proprietary vacuum deposition and large scale  roll to roll manufacturing processes to deposit amorphous silicon as a thin film on a large roll of stainless steel 
we have designed  developed and manufactured the automated production equipment based on these proprietary process technologies 
we believe our manufacturing process and product design create significant barriers to entry for competitors who may seek to produce products similar to our own 
we also believe that consolidating our pv equipment design and manufacturing activities with our pv laminate manufacturing activities allows us to more effectively improve our manufacturing efficiency and reduce capital costs 
our pv sales compete with companies that currently manufacture and distribute products based on well established technologies for electricity generation  as well as companies that currently manufacture and distribute products based on alternative energy generation technologies  such as solar and wind 
our principal competitors in the solar market include sharp corporation  q cells ag  evergreen solar  inc  kyocera corporation  sanyo electric co  ltd 
sanyo  sunpower corp  mitsubishi electric corporation  yingli solar  trina solar limited  and suntech power holdings co  ltd  all of which manufacture predominantly crystalline or polycrystalline silicon pv modules  and first solar  inc  which manufactures thin film  cadmium telluride pv modules on glass substrates 
the competitiveness of alternative energy generation products in general  including solar power products  is typically enhanced by governmental incentives designed to encourage the use of these products as compared to conventional energy generation sources  which today are less expensive at the customer level in most locations 
however  our long term goal is to compete directly  without subsidies  in energy markets 
sit also competes with numerous developers  contractors and installers of pv systems principally for rooftop applications 
we enter into long term supply agreements  some of which are take or pay agreements that require the customer to purchase a specified minimum amount of our products with our customers 
as of june   our backlog of anticipated product sales for fiscal years through was billion including sales to sit  which we have since acquired  of million 
as of june   our backlog of anticipated product sales was approximately billion 
the company s estimate of anticipated product sales may be impacted by various assumptions  including anticipated price reductions  currency exchange rates  and overall customer demand 
anticipated product sales include future firm commitments under take or pay agreements  confirmed orders from customers as of june  and government contracts 
for a discussion of the risks associated with our backlog and customer demand more generally  see item a risk factors

for additional information concerning sit  see note subsequent events  to our notes to consolidated financial statements 
our long term research and development strategy involves reducing production costs  improving light to electricity conversion efficiency and identifying new commercial applications for our products 
we seek to offset our research and development costs with third party funding  including product development agreements and government funding 
for example  in july  we entered into a three year cooperative agreement in which we will receive approximately million from the department of energy under an innovative program  the solar america initiative  to increase the efficiency of our photovoltaic products  lower material costs and develop innovative installation methods in order to reduce overall system costs 
the key raw materials used in our united solar ovonic segment business are stainless steel  high purity industrial gases  primarily argon  nitrogen  hydrogen  silane and germane  and polymer materials 
we believe that we have adequate sources for the supply of key raw materials and components for our pv laminate manufacturing needs 
we have  in certain instances  selected single source suppliers for certain key raw materials and components for efficiency  cost and quality 
we are actively managing our direct material costs through purchasing strategies  product design and operating improvements 
our united solar ovonic segment is headquartered in auburn hills  michigan  and has manufacturing facilities in auburn hills and greenville  michigan and tijuana  mexico 
we maintain sales offices in france  germany  italy  spain  and the united states 
additionally  we have established a joint venture  united solar ovonic jinneng limited  which is organized under the laws of the people s republic of china  to manufacture solar products in china for sale in the chinese market using solar cells purchased from  and technology licensed by  uso 
we presently own of the joint venture  with the option to increase our ownership to in certain circumstances  and tianjin jinneng investment co 
owns the remainder of the joint venture 
the joint venture is expected to commence operations in the second quarter of fiscal year ovonic materials our ovonic materials segment invents  designs and develops materials and products based on our pioneering materials science technology 
we seek to commercialize this technology internally and through third party relationships  such as licenses and joint ventures 
we are presently commercializing our nimh materials and consumer battery technology through this segment 
we are also engaged in pre commercialization activities for our emerging technologies  the funding of which we seek to offset with royalties and licensing revenues and third party funding  including product development agreements and government funding 

table of contents nimh batteries nimh batteries are rechargeable energy storage solutions offering high power and energy  long cycle life and maintenance free operation 
they are adaptable to a broad range of consumer  transportation and stationary applications 
products utilizing our nimh battery technology compete with lead acid  nickel cadmium and lithium battery technologies 
nimh batteries produce high energy and power for their weight and volume  do not contain any environmentally hazardous substances  have excellent durability and abuse tolerance  have a long cycle life  and provide excellent cost benefits 
we commercialize our nimh battery technology principally through third party licensing arrangements with nimh battery manufacturers throughout the world 
we also sell proprietary high performance positive electrode nickel hydroxide materials for use in nimh batteries 
we conduct our nimh battery technology licensing and materials manufacturing activities through our consolidated subsidiary ovonic battery company  inc  in which we have a equity interest and the balance is owned by honda motor company  ltd 
 sanoh industrial co  ltd 
and sanyo 
subsequent to june   we completed the sale of our interest in cobasys llc  our former joint venture through which we also commercialized our nimh battery technology 
see note subsequent events  to our notes to consolidated financial statements 
licensing we have licensed our nimh battery technology to nimh battery manufacturers  principally for consumer and transportation applications  on a royalty bearing  nonexclusive basis 
we are presently receiving royalties from manufacturers who are currently producing nimh batteries using our technology 
royalties from sanyo for consumer and transportation applications represented and  respectively  of our revenues in this segment for fiscal years and materials manufacturing we produce proprietary high performance positive electrode nickel hydroxide materials for use in nimh batteries  which we sell to licensees of our nimh battery technology 
our positive electrode materials offer advantages such as higher capacity and power  greater cycle life  high temperature performance and lower costs 
sales to gold peak industries holdings limited represented and  respectively  of our nimh materials product sales in this segment and and  respectively  of our total revenues in this segment for fiscal years and we conduct our manufacturing operations at an automated facility in troy  michigan 
the key raw materials used in our nickel hydroxide business are primarily nickel and cobalt 
all of the raw materials used are generally readily available from numerous sources  but interruptions in production or delivery of key raw materials could have an adverse impact on our manufacturing operations in this segment 
prices for these raw materials fluctuate in the normal course of business due to supply and demand 
our product pricing formula to our customers is based on the raw material price 
emerging technologies our research and development activities have generated new technologies  which we are seeking to bring to full scale commercialization 
these technologies  some of which are discussed below  are subject to further development and will require substantial additional funding to reach commercial product status 
we seek to offset our funding requirements by obtaining third party funding through strategic alliances and government contracts 

table of contents ovonic solid hydrogen storage technologies hydrogen is a clean and efficient fuel source that yields more energy per unit of weight than any other combustible fuel  and we are developing a practical approach to storing hydrogen in a solid metal matrix at low pressures using a family of efficient metal hydrides 
our solid hydrogen storage solutions have several advantages over conventional gaseous and liquid storage solutions  including improved volumetric density and greater safety due to our technology s low pressure refilling and storage capabilities 
we are presently manufacturing and selling pre production volumes of portable hydrogen canisters in our rochester hills  michigan facility 
ovonic metal hydride fuel cell technologies fuel cells are environmentally clean power generators in which hydrogen and oxygen are combined to produce electricity  with water and heat as the only byproducts 
our ovonic metal hydride fuel cell technology is a proprietary approach which provides a lower cost solution in comparison to conventional proton exchange membrane pem fuel cells  which require expensive platinum catalysts 
as part of our development activities  we have demonstrated high power fuel stacks utilizing our metal hydride fuel cell technology that meet the power ratings of certain commercially available fuel cells for the stationary market at a fraction of the cost 
ovonic biofuel reformation technologies hydrogen is a widely used industrial gas 
our ovonic reformation technology produces high purity hydrogen in a safe process from multiple renewable biofuel and biomass sources at far lower operating temperatures than commercial processes and without the generation of carbon dioxide gas 
our proprietary process has the potential to dramatically reduce distributed hydrogen cost by eliminating high transportation costs 
we are presently seeking funding as we move from laboratory scale development to pilot scale production 
ovonyx our ovonyx joint venture is commercializing our proprietary ovonic universal memory oum technology through licensing and product development arrangements 
oum is a basic  new type of nonvolatile memory that can replace conventional nonvolatile or flash memory in applications requiring retention of stored data when power is turned off  including cell phones  pdas  digital cameras and microelectronics 
oum  which is also known in the semiconductor industry as phase change random access memory pram and pc ram  offers several advantages over conventional nonvolatile memory  including significantly faster write time  greater scalability  lower power utilization and longer life  and is compatible with existing complementary metal oxide semiconductor cmos manufacturing processes 
we own or on a fully diluted basis after giving effect to the exercise of stock options and warrants of the common stock of ovonyx 
as part of this joint venture arrangement  we have contributed intellectual property  licenses  production processes and know how 
in addition to our equity interest in ovonyx  we receive of ovonyx s annual gross revenue as a royalty 
ovonyx has entered into royalty bearing  nonexclusive license agreements with intel corporation  samsung electronics co  ltd  elpida memory  inc  stmicroelectronics nv  bae systems  hynix semiconductor  inc  and numonyx bv  to produce oum products 
under most of these agreements  
table of contents ovonyx is also participating in joint development programs to assist in the commercialization of oum phase change memory products 
our technology and intellectual property the principal markets in which we compete the alternative energy generation  energy storage and information technology markets are characterized by rapid change and competition driven by technological and product performance advantages  as well as cost 
we have driven some of this activity through our pioneering and proprietary materials  product and production process technologies 
at the same time  we are actively engaged in product design and development to commercialize and improve our materials  products and production processes 
research and development expenditures our research and development expenditures are reflected as cost of revenues from product development agreements and product development and research expenses in our consolidated statements of operations 
we seek to offset our research and development costs with third party funding  including joint ventures  product development agreements and government funding 
patents and intellectual property we maintain an extensive patent portfolio presently consisting of approximately us patents and over foreign counterparts to which we are regularly adding new patents based upon our continuing research and development activities 
importantly  our portfolio includes numerous basic and fundamental patents applicable to each of our business segments  covering not only materials  but also the production technology and products we develop 
based on the breadth and depth of our patent portfolio  we believe that our proprietary patent position is sustainable notwithstanding the expiration of certain patents 
we do not expect the expiration of any patents to materially affect the business prospects of any of our business segments 
competition since our businesses are based upon our pioneering technologies that offer fundamental solutions in the alternative energy generation  energy storage and information technology markets  we compete not only at the product level for market share but also at the technology level for market acceptance 
our competition includes well established conventional technologies  other alternative technology solutions and other technologies within an alternative solution 
for example  our pv technology competes with conventional electricity generation technologies  such as gas and coal  alternative electricity generation technologies  such as wind and nuclear  and other solar technologies  such as crystalline products 
our business competitors include some of the world s largest industrial companies  many of which are pursuing new technology solutions in addition to their well established conventional technologies 
we believe that we have derived a key business and technological advantage through our research and development activities by continuously inventing new technologies and improving our existing materials  products and production processes 
however  even as we successfully pursue these research and development activities  some of our technologies  particularly in the alternative energy generation and energy storage markets  presently face commercial barriers as compared to well established conventional technologies  including infrastructural barriers  customer transition costs and higher manufacturing costs associated with present production volumes 
the competitiveness of products based on our technologies in these areas is typically enhanced by external factors  including rising energy costs  concerns regarding 
table of contents energy security and governmental incentives at the consumer level 
our long term goal is to compete directly in energy markets without subsidies 
our employees as of june   we employed approximately  people  approximately  of whom are located in the united states

item a risk factors the continuing global economic  capital markets and credit disruptions pose risks for our business segments 
the continuing global economic  capital markets and credit disruptions pose risks for our business segments 
these risks include slower economic activity and investment in construction projects that make use of our products and services 
these economic developments  particularly decreased credit availability  have reduced demand for solar products  including our solar laminates and for the solar development and installation services of sit 
further  these conditions have caused some of our customers to be unable to fully comply with the terms of their agreements to purchase our solar laminates 
continued decreases in credit availability as well as continued economic instability may adversely impact our existing or future business and require that we reallocate product shipments from customers who are unable to satisfy their contractual obligations to other customers or pursue other remedies  including contract renegotiation 
the decline in polysilicon prices  and the increase in the global capacity of pv products  is causing downward pressure on the prices of our products  resulting in lower revenues and earnings 
polysilicon  a key raw material for traditional glass panel pv products  is readily available to solar cell and module manufacturers after several years of short supply and prices have been falling rapidly 
these price reductions are resulting in price reductions of solar cells and modules that compete with our laminates 
while we believe our laminates have unique characteristics that make them attractive for a variety of applications  particularly bipv installations  the market price decline of competitive products is resulting in downward pressure on our pricing that negatively impacts our revenues and earnings 
we have instituted demand creation initiatives that are extending our business model and subjecting us to additional business and financial risks 

table of contents we have instituted demand creation initiatives in our united solar ovonic segment to stimulate demand for our products 
certain of these initiatives  such as offering project financing and acquiring sit  extend our existing business model in this segment from principally manufacturing and selling laminates through our channel partners to include development  design  installation  maintenance  financing and ownership of pv projects 
as a result  these initiatives will expose us to additional business risks  such as credit risks project financing and project construction and performance risks sit acquisition  which may be significant 
some of these initiatives  such as project financing  are capital intensive  and there can be no assurances that our existing capital resources will be sufficient to meaningfully stimulate demand 
additionally  certain of these initiatives will require us to redeploy our capital resources from other initiatives  such as our manufacturing capacity expansion  which may impair our ability to pursue these other initiatives and realize their benefits 
further  there can be no assurance that these initiatives will successfully stimulate demand for our products 
in response to market conditions  we have instituted capital expenditure and cost reduction initiatives that are impacting our financial performance and our cash resources and will continue to do so in the future 
we have instituted a number of cost reduction initiatives to improve our cost structure and preserve capital in response to market conditions 
we have incurred restructuring expenses as a result of certain of these activities and may incur additional restructuring expenses as we pursue further cost reduction activities in the future 
in addition  in response to market conditions  we temporarily suspended our manufacturing capacity expansion in our united solar ovonic segment and reduced our production in this segment 
we recognized under absorption of overhead costs resulting from our production adjustments and may recognize similar costs in the future if we do not operate our facilities at production capacity 
if our production levels and related cash flows remain at reduced levels we may be required to record an impairment to our plant and equipment  which could have a material adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations 
furthermore  there can be no assurance that market demand will align with our present manufacturing capacity and  as a result  our business could be materially adversely affected 
volatility in customer demand in the solar industry could affect future levels of sales and profitability and limit our ability to predict such levels  if we are unable to balance our production levels with customer demand  our business and financial results will be materially adversely impacted 
in june  in order to meet increasing demand for our products  we announced the active expansion of our production capacity and the commencement of a plan to reach gw of annual production capacity by in march of  we announced that we were slowing the pace of our demand driven production and expansion plan to better reflect the present impact of credit availability on project flow in the global pipeline for photovoltaics 
in connection with this announcement we have delayed expansion at our greenville facility and battle creek facility  which will reduce our capital expenditures and allow us to preserve and  in strategic situations  redeploy our capital in other areas 
when market conditions and visibility improves  we believe that we can quickly re initiate our manufacturing capacity expansion  as a result of the operational improvements we have made with respect to the construction and ramp of new facilities 
in the meantime  however  we will have to ensure that we balance our production levels with demand for our products 
historically  we have maintained moderate lead times  which has enabled customers to place orders close to their true needs for product 
in defining our financial goals and projections  we consider inventory on hand  backlog  production cycles and expected order patterns from customers 
if our estimates in these areas become inaccurate  we may not be able to meet our revenue goals and 
table of contents projections 
in addition  some customers require us to manufacture product and have it available for shipment  even though the customer is unwilling to make a binding commitment to purchase all  or even some  of the products 
as a result  in any quarterly fiscal period we are subject to the risk of cancellation of orders leading to a fall off of sales and backlog 
further  those orders may be for products that meet the customer s unique requirements so that those cancelled orders would  in addition  result in an inventory of unsaleable products  and thus potential inventory write offs 
we routinely estimate inventory reserves required for such products  but actual results may differ from these reserve estimates 
we have acquired sit to extend our business model and enhance our competitiveness  but we face integration and other related risks arising from this acquisition that could expose us to liability or cause us not to achieve these benefits 
we have begun the process of integrating sit into our business  which we expect will require significant resources until completed in the second half of fiscal year however  we may not be able to integrate sit successfully into our existing business and could incur or assume unknown or contingent liabilities as a result of this acquisition or fail to realize the expected improvements in our engineering and technical capabilities or responsiveness to market opportunities 
we also may incur acquisition or disposition related charges  amortization of expenses related to intangibles and charges for impairment of long term assets as a result of this acquisition 
we also may lose some laminate sales from customers who choose to withdraw business from us because they perceive sit to be a competitor 
if any of these possibilities occur  our business could be materially adversely affected 
we face intense competition from other companies producing solar energy and other renewable energy products 
the solar energy market is intensely competitive and rapidly evolving 
the number of solar energy product manufacturers is rapidly increasing due to the growth of actual and forecast demand for solar energy products and the relatively low barriers to entry 
if we fail to attract and retain customers in our target markets for our current and future core products  namely solar laminates  we will be unable to increase our revenue and market share 
some of our competitors have established more prominent market positions  and if we fail to attract and retain customers and establish successful distribution networks in our target markets for our products  we will be unable to increase our sales 
in addition  many of our competitors manufacture predominantly crystalline or polycrystalline silicon solar modules which are currently sold at lower cost than our solar laminates 
we may also face competition from new entrants to the solar energy market  including those that offer more advanced technological solutions or that have greater financial resources 
a significant number of our competitors are developing or currently producing products based on more advanced solar energy technologies  including amorphous silicon  string ribbon  copper indium gallium di selenide  and nano technologies  which may eventually offer cost and technology advantages over the technologies currently used by us 
a widespread adoption of any of these technologies could result in a rapid decline in our position in the solar energy market and our revenue if we fail to adopt such technologies or develop new technologies 
furthermore  the entire solar energy industry also faces competition from conventional energy for example a decline in base grid electricity prices  and non solar renewable energy providers 
due to the relatively high manufacturing costs compared to most other energy sources  solar energy is generally not competitive without government incentive programs 
many of our existing and potential competitors have substantially greater financial  technical  manufacturing and other resources than we do 
our competitors greater size in some cases provides 
table of contents them with a competitive advantage with respect to manufacturing because of their economies of scale and their ability to purchase raw materials at lower prices 
as a result  those competitors may have stronger bargaining power with their suppliers and may have an advantage over us in negotiating favorable pricing  as well as securing supplies in times of shortages 
many of our competitors also have greater brand name recognition  more established distribution networks  balance of system capabilities  and larger customer bases 
in addition  many of our competitors have well established relationships with our current and potential distributors and have extensive knowledge of our target markets 
as a result  they may be able to devote more resources to the research  development  promotion and sale of their products or respond more quickly to evolving industry standards and changes in market conditions than we can 
our failure to adapt to changing market conditions and to compete successfully with existing or new competitors may materially and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 
our customers increasingly need financing to purchase our products  which exposes us to additional business and credit risks 
availability and cost of financing are significant factors that affect demand for our products 
developers and owners of solar facilities typically require project financing before initiating a solar installation 
roofing contractors and other solar integrators must obtain working capital financing to carry inventory of our products and maintain their operations 
historically most of our customers have arranged their own financing without assistance from us  but with the illiquidity of current financing markets some of our customers have sought various forms of credit support from us 
from time to time we may provide credit support to certain customers through open account sales or extended payment terms 
due to our size and capital constraints  we are not able to satisfy all credit requests by our customers 
these credit support transactions expose us to credit risk  including the risk of default by customers 
in addition  if we are unable to provide credit to our customers  or otherwise induce third parties to satisfy customer credit demands  we could lose sales and be unable to achieve our future business plan 
we have a history of losses and our future profitability is uncertain  the failure to maintain sustainable profitability could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations  financial condition and cash flows 
since our inception  we have incurred significant net losses 
principally as a result of ongoing operating losses  we had an accumulated deficit of million as of june  however  we generated net income of million for the year ended june   and our goal is to operate our business in such a way that such profitability is sustainable over the long term 
nonetheless  we may be unable to sustain or increase our profitability in the future  which in turn could materially and adversely impact our ability to repay our debt and could materially decrease the market value of our common stock and as a result  the value of our convertible senior notes 
we expect to continue to make significant capital expenditures and anticipate that our expenses will increase as we seek to continuously improve our manufacturing operations  whether domestically or internationally  service our debt obligations  develop our distribution network  continue to research and develop our products and manufacturing technologies  implement our demand creation initiatives  which may include project financing and strategic acquisitions  implement internal systems and infrastructure to support our growth  and retain key members of management  retain other personnel and hire additional personnel 

table of contents we do not know whether our revenue will grow at all or grow rapidly enough to absorb these costs and our limited operating history under our current business strategy and new management team makes it difficult to assess the extent of these expenses or their impact on our operating results 
if we fail to sustain profitability  our business  results of operations  financial condition and cash flows could be materially adversely affected 
we have international operations  which we are expanding  that are vulnerable to risks associated with doing business in foreign countries 
we have a pv laminate manufacturing facility in tijuana  mexico  and have established a joint venture in tianjin  china  to manufacture pv laminates 
also  a portion of our expenses are denominated in currencies other than us dollars 
international operations and transactions are subject to certain risks inherent in doing business abroad  including the potential that we may be forced to forfeit  voluntarily or involuntarily  foreign assets due to economic or political instability in the countries in which we choose to locate our manufacturing facilities  difficult and expensive compliance with the commercial and legal requirements of international markets  difficulty in interpreting and enforcing contracts governed by foreign law  which may be subject to multiple  conflicting and changing laws  regulations and tax systems  inability to obtain  maintain or enforce intellectual property rights  encountering trade barriers such as export requirements  tariffs  currency exchange controls  taxes and other restrictions and expenses  which could affect the competitive pricing of our solar laminates and reduce our market share in some countries  being subjected to additional withholding taxes or other tax on our foreign income or tariffs and other restrictions on foreign trade and investment  including currency exchange controls  being subjected to fluctuations in exchange rates which may affect product demand and our profitability in us dollars to the extent the price of our solar laminates and cost of raw materials  labor and equipment is denominated in a foreign currency  limitations on dividends or restrictions against repatriation of earnings  difficulty in recruiting and retaining individuals skilled in international business operations  and increased costs associated with maintaining international marketing efforts 
in addition  since expanding our business globally is an important element of our strategy  our exposure to these risks will be greater in the future 
the likelihood of such occurrences and their potential effect on us vary from country to country and are unpredictable 
however  any such occurrences could be harmful to our business and our profitability 
demand for our products is affected by existing regulations concerning the electrical utility industry  changes to such regulations may present technical  regulatory and economic barriers to the purchase and use of solar power products  which may significantly reduce demand for our products 
the market for electricity generation products is influenced heavily by foreign  federal  state and local government regulations and policies concerning the electric utility industry  as well as internal policies and regulations promulgated by electric utilities 
these regulations and policies often relate to electricity pricing and technical interconnection of customer owned electricity generation 
in the united states at 
table of contents both the national level and the state and local level and in a number of other countries  these regulations and policies are being modified and may continue to be modified 
customer purchases of  or further investment in the research and development of  alternative energy sources  including solar power technology  could be deterred by these regulations and policies  which could result in a significant reduction in the potential demand for our solar power products 
for example  utility companies commonly charge fees to larger  industrial customers for disconnecting from the electric grid or for having the capacity to use power from the electric grid for back up purposes 
these fees could increase the cost to our customers of using our solar power products and make them less desirable  thereby harming our business  prospects  results of operations and financial condition 
we anticipate that our solar power products and their installation will be subject to oversight and regulation in accordance with national  state and local laws and ordinances relating to building codes  safety  and environmental protection  utility interconnection and metering and related matters 
there is also a burden in having to track the requirements of individual countries and states and design equipment to comply with the varying standards 
any new government regulations or utility policies pertaining to our solar power products may result in significant additional expenses to us and our resellers and their customers and  as a result  could cause a significant reduction in demand for our solar power products 
we receive a significant portion of our revenues from a small number of customers 
we historically have entered into agreements with a relatively small number of major customers throughout the world 
our five largest customers represented approximately  and of our total revenue for the fiscal years ended june   and  respectively 
any loss or material reduction in sales to any of our top customers would be difficult to recoup from other customers and could have an adverse effect on our sales  results of operations  financial condition and cash flows 
the reduction or elimination of government incentives related to solar power could cause our revenues to decline 
today  the cost of solar power exceeds the cost of power furnished by the electric utility grid in most locations 
as a result  federal  state and local government bodies in many countries  most notably germany  japan  italy  spain  france  greece  china and the united states  have provided incentives in the form of rebates  tax credits and other incentives to end users  distributors  system integrators and manufacturers of solar power products to promote the use of solar energy to reduce dependency on other forms of energy 
these government economic incentives could be reduced or eliminated 
reductions in  or eliminations or expirations of  incentives related to solar power could result in decreased demand for our solar laminates and lower our revenue 
we must continue to develop and market new and innovative products and there can be no assurance that such efforts will be successful 
our financial performance depends in part on our ability to enhance our existing solar laminates  develop new and innovative products and product applications  reduce our costs of producing solar laminates  and adopt or develop new technologies that continue to differentiate our products from those of our competitors 
the continued demand for our solar laminates is premised in part on the features of our solar laminates that distinguish them from the solar laminates of our competitors and the resulting unique product applications 
these features include physical flexibility  the ability of our laminates to be integrated with roofing materials  light weight  superior resistance to wind lift  durability  no roof penetration and ease of installation 
there are companies using similar or competitive technologies that 
table of contents have introduced or announced plans to introduce solar laminates incorporating some or all of these features 
in addition  all solar laminates compete based on efficiency and significant advances in the efficiency of the solar laminates of our competitors also could provide them with a competitive advantage 
if we fail to enhance our existing solar laminates  develop new and innovative products and product applications  or adopt or develop new technologies that continue to differentiate our products from those of our competitors  our business  financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected 
the expansion of our business into new markets  such as residential  may increase our exposure to certain risks  including class action claims 
we are developing new applications of our solar technology  including solar laminates to be integrated into residential roofing materials 
our new solar technology applications may not gain market acceptance and we may not otherwise be successful in entering new markets  including the market for residential applications 
moreover  entry into new markets may increase our exposure to certain risks that we currently face or expose us to new risks 
for example  the residential construction market for solar energy systems is exposed to different risks than the commercial construction markets  including more acute seasonality  sensitivity to interest rates  and other macroeconomic conditions  as well as aesthetics and enhanced legal exposure 
in particular  new home developments can result in class action litigation when one or more homes in a development experience problems with roofing or power systems 
if we enter the residential market and experience product failures that create property damage or personal injury  we may be exposed to greater liability of a different nature than with respect to product failures in commercial building applications 
we have focused our business strategy on  and invested significant financial resources in  the bipv segment of the pv market and there is no guarantee that the demand for bipv systems will develop as we anticipate 
our current business strategy rests on increasing demand for bipv systems 
we believe that there has been an increase in demand for bipv systems based in part on increasing interest and customer support from the building industry  solar customers and governments 
as a result  we have invested  and will continue to invest  significant financial resources in the production and commercialization of our solar laminates for bipv systems 
if the bipv segment does not develop as we anticipate  or takes longer to develop than we anticipate  we may experience difficulties implementing our growth and business targets 
this in turn could adversely impact our business  financial condition and results from operations 
we may be unable to obtain key raw materials that meet our quality  quantity and cost requirements 
the key raw materials used in our business are stainless steel  resin based polymers  nickel and high purity industrial gases  primarily argon  nitrogen  hydrogen  silane and germane 
most of our key raw materials are readily available from numerous sources  however we have  in certain instances  selected single source suppliers for certain key raw materials and components for efficiency  cost and quality 
our supply chain and operations could be adversely impacted by the failure of the suppliers of the single sourced materials to provide us with the raw materials that meet our quality  quantity and cost requirements 
in addition  significant shortages or price increases in raw materials that are not single sourced may adversely impact our business 
any constraint on our production may cause us to be unable to meet our obligations under customer purchase orders  and any increase in the price of raw materials could constrain our margins  either of which would adversely impact our financial results 

table of contents we actively manage our raw materials and other supply costs through purchasing strategies  product design and operating improvements  however our management may not always be effective  which could adversely impact our supply chain and financial condition 
some of our suppliers may be unable to supply our demand for raw materials and components 
in such event  we may be unable to identify new suppliers or qualify their products for use in our production lines in a timely manner and on commercially reasonable terms 
raw materials and components from new suppliers also may be less suited for our technology and yield solar laminates with lower conversion efficiencies  higher failure rates and higher rates of degradation than solar laminates manufactured with the raw materials from our current suppliers 
our failure to obtain raw materials and components that meet our quality  quantity and cost requirements in a timely manner could interrupt or impair our ability to manufacture our solar laminates or increase our manufacturing cost 
significant warranty and product liability claims could adversely affect our business and results of operations 
we may be subject to warranty and product liability claims in the event that our solar laminates or pv systems fail to perform as expected or if a failure of our solar laminates or pv systems results  or is alleged to result  in bodily injury  property damage or other damages 
since our solar laminates and pv systems are electricity producing devices  it is possible that our products could result in injury  whether by product malfunctions  defects  improper installation or other causes 
in addition  because the products we are developing incorporate new technologies and use new installation methods  we cannot predict whether or not product liability claims will be brought against us in the future or the effect of any resulting negative publicity on our business 
as a result of our acquisition of sit  we may be subject to warranty and product liability claims associated with the manufacture  sale and installation of products by sit before the acquisition 
moreover  we may not have adequate resources in the event of a successful claim against us 
our current standard product warranty for our solar laminates ranges from years 
we believe our warranty periods are competitive with industry practice 
due to the long warranty period and our proprietary technology  we bear the risk of extensive warranty claims long after we have shipped product and recognized revenue 
although we test our solar power products for reliability and durability  we cannot ensure that we effectively simulate the year warranty period 
any increase in the defect rate of our products would cause us to increase the amount of warranty reserves and have a corresponding negative impact on our financial results 
a successful warranty or product liability claim against us that is not covered by insurance or is in excess of our available insurance limits could require us to make significant payments of damages 
in addition  quality issues can have various other ramifications  including delays in the recognition of revenue  loss of revenue  loss of future sales opportunities  increased costs associated with repairing or replacing products  and a negative impact on our goodwill and reputation 
the possibility of future product failures could cause us to incur substantial expenses to repair or replace defective products 
furthermore  widespread product failures may damage our market reputation and reduce our market share and cause sales to decline 
the conversion rate of our outstanding convertible debt is dependent upon the trading price of our common stock and thus the dilutive impact of the future converted shares cannot be predicted 
except in the instance of specific events involving the price of the company s common stock  the price of the notes  and certain corporate transactions  our outstanding convertible debt is not convertible until march  the holders of the notes may convert the principal amount of their notes into cash 
table of contents and  if applicable  shares of the company s common stock initially at a conversion rate of shares equivalent to an initial conversion price of approximately per share per  principal amount of the notes 
the holders of the notes are only entitled to amounts in excess of the principal amount if shares of the company s common stock exceed a market price of for a period of consecutive trading days during the applicable cash settlement averaging period 
since we cannot predict the future trading price of our common stock  we cannot estimate the number of shares that will be issued at the time of conversion and the effect of those shares on the trading price of the common stock or the effect on earnings per share 
if we lose key personnel or are unable to attract and retain qualified personnel to maintain and expand our business  financial condition  results of operations and prospects could be adversely affected 
our success is highly dependent on the continued services of the senior management team and of a limited number of skilled managers  scientists and technicians 
the loss of any of these individuals could have a material adverse effect on us 
in addition  our success will depend upon  among other factors  the recruitment and retention of additional highly skilled and experienced management and technical personnel 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to retain existing employees or to attract and retain additional personnel on acceptable terms given the competition for such personnel in industrial  academic and nonprofit research sectors 
we may become subject to legal or regulatory proceedings which may reach unfavorable resolutions 
we are involved in legal proceedings arising in the normal course of business 
due to the inherent uncertainties of legal proceedings  the outcome of any such proceeding could be unfavorable  and we may choose to make payments or enter into other arrangements  to settle such proceedings 
failure to settle such proceedings could require us to pay damages or other expenses  which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations 
we have been subject to legal proceedings in the past involving the validity and enforceability of certain of our patents 
while such patent related legal proceedings have been resolved  such proceedings can require the expenditure of substantial management time and financial resources and can adversely affect our financial performance 
there can be no assurance that we will not be a party to other legal proceedings in the future 
we are subject to a variety of federal  state and local laws  rules and regulations related to the discharge or disposal of toxic  volatile or other hazardous chemicals that may expose us to liability and other compliance risks 
although we believe that we are in compliance with these laws  rules and regulations  the failure to comply with present or future regulations could result in fines  suspension of production or cessation of operations 
third parties may also have the right to sue to enforce compliance 
moreover  it is possible that increasingly strict requirements imposed by environmental laws and enforcement policies thereunder could require us to make significant capital expenditures 
the operation of a manufacturing plant entails the inherent risk of environmental damage or personal injury due to the handling of potentially harmful substances 
there can be no assurance that we will not incur material costs and liabilities in the future because of an accident or other event resulting in personal injury or unauthorized release of such substances to the environment 
in addition  we generate hazardous materials and other wastes that are disposed of at licensed disposal facilities 
we may be liable  
table of contents irrespective of fault  for material cleanup costs or other liabilities incurred at these facilities in the event of a release of hazardous substances by such facilities into the environment 
our success depends in part upon our ability to protect our intellectual property and our proprietary technology including our trade secrets and other confidential information 
our success depends in part on our ability to obtain and maintain intellectual property protection for products based on our technologies 
our policy is to seek to protect our products and technologies by  among other methods  filing united states and foreign patent applications related to our proprietary technology  inventions and improvements 
the patent positions of companies like ours are generally uncertain and involve complex legal and factual questions 
our ability to maintain our proprietary position for our technology will depend on our success in obtaining effective patent claims and enforcing those claims once granted 
we do not know whether any of our patent applications will result in the issuance of any patents 
our issued patents and those that we may issue in the future may be challenged  invalidated  rendered unenforceable or circumvented  which could limit our ability to stop competitors from marketing related products or the length of term of patent protection that we may have for our products and technologies 
in addition  the rights granted under any issued patents may not provide us with competitive advantages against competitors with similar products or technologies 
furthermore  our competitors may independently develop similar technologies or duplicate technology developed by us in a manner that does not infringe our patents or other intellectual property 
because of the extensive time required for development and commercialization of products based on our technologies  it is possible that  before these products can be commercialized  any related patents may expire or remain in force for only a short period following commercialization  thereby reducing any advantages of these patents and making it unlikely that we will be able to recover investments we have made to develop our technologies and products based on our technologies 
in addition to patent protection  we also rely on protection of trade secrets  know how and confidential and proprietary information 
to maintain the confidentiality of trade secrets and proprietary information  we have entered into confidentiality agreements with our employees  agents and consultants upon the commencement of their relationships with us 
these agreements require that all confidential information developed by the individual or made known to the individual by us during the course of the individual s relationship with us be kept confidential and not disclosed to third parties 
our agreements with employees also provide that inventions conceived by the individual in the course of rendering services to us will be our exclusive property 
individuals with whom we have these agreements may not comply with their terms 
in the event of the unauthorized use or disclosure of our trade secrets or proprietary information  these agreements  even if obtained  may not provide meaningful protection for our trade secrets or other confidential information 
to the extent that our employees or consultants use technology or know how owned by others in their work for us  disputes may arise as to the rights in related inventions 
adequate remedies may not exist in the event of unauthorized use or disclosure of our confidential information 
the disclosure of our trade secrets would impair our competitive position and could have a material adverse effect on our operating results  financial condition and future growth prospects 
we may be involved in lawsuits to protect or enforce our patents  which could be expensive and time consuming 
competitors may infringe our patents 
to counter infringement or unauthorized use  we may be required to file patent infringement claims  which can be expensive and time consuming 
in addition  in an infringement proceeding  a court may decide that a patent of ours is not valid or is unenforceable  or may refuse to stop the other party from using the technology at issue on the grounds that our patents do 
table of contents not cover its technology 
an adverse determination of any litigation or defense proceedings could put one or more of our patents at risk of being invalidated or interpreted narrowly and could put our patent applications at risk of not issuing 
interference proceedings brought by the united states patent and trademark office may be necessary to determine the priority of inventions with respect to our patent applications 
litigation or interference proceedings may fail and  even if successful  may result in substantial costs and be a distraction to our management 
we may not be able to prevent misappropriation of our proprietary rights  particularly in countries where the laws may not protect such rights as fully as in the united states 
furthermore  because of the substantial amount of discovery required in connection with intellectual property litigation  there is a risk that some of our confidential information could be compromised by disclosure 
in addition  during the course of this litigation  there could be public announcements of the results of hearings  motions or other interim proceedings or developments 
if securities analysts or investors perceive these results to be negative  it could have a substantial adverse effect on the price of our common stock 
we may not prevail in any litigation or interference proceeding in which we are involved 
even if we do prevail  these proceedings can be expensive and distract our management 
third parties may own or control patents or patent applications that are infringed by our products or technologies 
our success depends in part on avoiding the infringement of other parties patents and proprietary rights 
in the united states and most other countries  patent applications are published months after filing 
as a result  there may be patents of which we are unaware  and avoiding patent infringement may be difficult 
we may inadvertently infringe third party patents or patent applications 
these third parties could bring claims against us that  even if resolved in our favor  could cause us to incur substantial expenses and  if resolved against us  could additionally cause us to pay substantial damages 
further  if a patent infringement suit were brought against us  we and our joint venture partners and licensees could be forced to stop or delay research  development  manufacturing or sales of products based on our technologies in the country or countries covered by the patent we infringe  unless we can obtain a license from the patent holder 
such a license may not be available on acceptable terms  or at all  particularly if the third party is developing or marketing a product competitive with products based on our technologies 
even if we were able to obtain a license  the rights may be nonexclusive  which would give our competitors access to the same intellectual property 
we also may be required to pay substantial damages to the patent holder in the event of an infringement 
under some circumstances in the united states  these damages could be triple the actual damages the patent holder incurs 
if we have supplied infringing products to third parties for marketing or licensed third parties to manufacture  use or market infringing products  we may be obligated to indemnify these third parties for any damages they may be required to pay to the patent holder and for any losses the third parties may sustain themselves as the result of lost sales or damages paid to the patent holder 
any successful infringement action brought against us may also adversely affect marketing of products based on our technologies in other markets not covered by the infringement action 
furthermore  we may suffer adverse consequences from a successful infringement action against us even if the action is subsequently reversed on appeal  nullified through another action or resolved by settlement with the patent holder 
the damages or other remedies awarded  if any  may be significant 
as a result  
table of contents any infringement action against us would likely harm our competitive position  be costly and require significant time and attention of our key management and technical personnel 
compliance with environmental regulations can be expensive  and noncompliance with these regulations may require us to pay substantial fines  suspend production or cease operations 
the operation of our manufacturing facilities entails the use and handling of potentially harmful substances  including toxic and explosive gases that pose inherent risks of environmental damage or personal injury 
although we believe that we are in material compliance with environmental regulations  rules and regulations  there can be no assurance that we will not incur material costs and liabilities in the future because of an accident or other event resulting in personal injury or unauthorized release of such substances into the environment 
we may be liable  irrespective of fault  for material cleanup costs or other liabilities incurred at these facilities in the event of a release of hazardous substances into the environment by our operations 
for example  our manufacturing process involves the controlled storage and use of silane and germane gases  both of which are toxic and combustible 
although we have rigorous safety procedures for handling these materials  the risk of accidental injury from such hazardous materials cannot be completely eliminated 
if we have an accident at one of our facilities involving a release of these substances  we may be subject to civil and or criminal penalties  including financial penalties and damages  and possibly injunctions preventing us from continuing our operations 
in addition  it is possible that increasingly strict requirements imposed by environmental laws and enforcement policies could require us to make significant capital expenditures 
to date such laws and regulations have not had a significant impact on our operations  and we believe that we have all necessary permits to conduct operations as they are presently conducted 
if more stringent laws and regulations are adopted in the future  the costs of compliance with these new laws and regulations could be substantial 
the failure to comply with present or future regulations could result in fines  third party lawsuits  suspension of production or cessation of operations 
we have entered into joint ventures and licensing agreements to develop and commercialize products based on our technologies and we must manage such joint ventures and licensing agreements successfully 
we have entered into licensing and joint venture agreements in order to develop and commercialize certain products based on our technologies 
any revenue or profits that may be derived by us from these agreements will be substantially dependent upon our ability to agree with our joint venture partners and licensees about the management and operation of the joint ventures and license agreements 
in addition  any revenue or profits from such agreements will be substantially dependent on the willingness and ability of our joint venture partners and licensees to devote their financial resources and manufacturing and marketing capabilities to commercialize products based on our technologies 
there can be no assurance that we will agree regarding the operation of such joint ventures and licensing agreements  that required financial resources will be available on mutually agreeable terms or that commercialization efforts will be successful 
if we and our joint venture partners and licensees are unable to agree with respect to the operation of our joint ventures and licensing agreements  are unwilling or unable to devote financial resources or are unable to commercialize products based on our technologies  we may not be able to realize revenue and profits based on our technologies and our business could be materially adversely affected 

table of contents our government product development and research contracts may be terminated by unilateral government action  or we may be unsuccessful in obtaining new government contracts to replace those that have been terminated or completed 
we have several government product development and research contracts 
any revenue or profits that may be derived by us from these contracts will be substantially dependent upon the government agencies willingness to continue to devote their financial resources to our research and development efforts 
there can be no assurance that such financial resources will be available or that such research and development efforts will be successful 
our government contracts may be terminated for the convenience of the government at any time  even if we have fully performed our obligations under the contracts 
upon a termination for convenience  we would generally only be entitled to recover certain eligible costs and expenses we had incurred prior to termination and would not be entitled to any other payments or damages 
therefore  if government product development and research contracts are terminated or completed and we are unsuccessful in obtaining replacement government contracts  our revenue and profits may decline and our business may be adversely affected 
the credit facility entered into by our subsidiaries  united solar ovonic corporation and united solar ovonic llc  contains covenant restrictions that may limit our ability to operate our business 
we conduct substantially all of our united solar ovonic segment operations through our subsidiaries united solar ovonic corporation and united solar ovonic llc 
for example  our cash flows from that segment are dependent on the distributions to us by united solar ovonic corporation and united solar ovonic llc 
in february  united solar ovonic corporation and united solar ovonic llc entered into a secured credit facility with an aggregate commitment of up to million  of which we are a guarantor 
the credit facility contains  and any other future debt agreements may contain  covenant restrictions that may effectively limit our ability to operate our business  due to restrictions on our or our subsidiaries ability to  among other things incur additional debt or issue guarantees  create liens  make certain investments  enter into transactions with our affiliates  sell certain assets  make certain restricted payments  declare or pay dividends or make other distributions to stockholders  and merge or consolidate with any person 
as a result of these covenants  our ability to respond to changes in business and economic conditions and to obtain additional financing  if needed  may be significantly restricted  and we may be prevented from engaging in transactions that might otherwise be beneficial to us due to the restrictions imposed by the credit facility 
in addition  the failure to comply with these covenants could result in a default  which could permit the lenders and debt holders to accelerate such debt 
our ability to utilize our net operating loss carryforwards could be substantially limited if we experience an ownership change under the internal revenue code  which may adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 
as a result of our past financial performance  we have significant operating loss and research and development credit carryforwards which expire from to section of the internal revenue code of  as amended the code  contains rules that limit the ability of a company that undergoes 
table of contents an ownership change to utilize its net operating loss carryforwards in years after the ownership change 
an ownership change for purposes of section of the code generally refers to any change in ownership of more than of the company s stock over a three year period 
these rules generally operate by focusing on ownership changes among stockholders owning  directly or indirectly  or more of the stock of a company or any change in ownership arising from a new issuance of the company s stock 
if we undergo an ownership change for purposes of section as a result of future transactions involving our common stock  including purchases or sales of stock between our greater than stockholders  our ability to use our net operating loss carryforwards would be subject to the limitations of section depending on the resulting limitations  a significant portion of our net operating loss carryforwards could expire before we would be able to use them 
our inability to utilize our net operating loss carryforwards may adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 
we have a significant amount of debt outstanding 
our indebtedness  along with our other contractual commitments  could adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations  as well as our ability to meet any of our payment obligations 
together with our subsidiaries  we have a significant amount of debt and debt service requirements 
as of june   we have approximately million of outstanding debt 
this level of debt and related debt service could have significant consequences on our future operations  including making it more difficult for us to meet our payment and other obligations  resulting in an event of default if we and our subsidiaries fail to comply with covenants contained in our debt agreements  which could result in such debt becoming immediately due and payable  reducing the availability of our cash flow to fund working capital  capital expenditures  acquisitions and other general corporate purposes  and limiting our ability to obtain additional financing for these purposes  subjecting us to the risk of increased sensitivity to interest rate increases on our indebtedness with variable interest rates  including borrowings under our new credit facility  limiting our flexibility in planning for  or reacting to  and increasing our vulnerability to  changes in our business  the industry in which we operate and the general economy  and placing us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less debt or are less leveraged 
any of the above listed factors could have an adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations  liquidity and our ability to meet our payment obligations 
our ability to meet our payment and other obligations under our debt instruments depends on our ability to generate significant cash flow in the future 
this  to some extent  is subject to general economic  financial  competitive  legislative and regulatory factors as well as other factors that are beyond our control 
we cannot assure you that our business will generate cash flow from operations  or that future borrowings will be available to us under existing or any future credit facilities or otherwise  in an amount sufficient to enable us to meet our payment obligations and to fund other liquidity needs 
if we are not able to generate sufficient cash flow to service our debt obligations  we may need to refinance or restructure our debt  sell assets  reduce or delay capital investments  or seek to raise additional capital 
if we are unable to implement one or more of these alternatives  we may not be able to meet our payment obligations under our debt and other obligations

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations this section summarizes significant factors affecting the company s consolidated operating results  financial condition and liquidity for the three year period ended june  this section should be read in conjunction with the company s consolidated financial statements and related notes appearing elsewhere in this report 
overview we design  manufacture and sell photovoltaic pv products  known as pv or solar laminates  that generate clean  renewable energy by converting sunlight into electricity 
solar laminate sales represent more than of our revenues 
we also receive fees and royalties from licensees of our nickel metal hydride nimh battery technology  sell high performance nickel hydroxide used in nimh batteries  and receive funds for product development agreements under government sponsored programs 
the following key factors should be considered when reviewing our results for the periods discussed our consolidated financial results are driven primarily by the performance of our united solar ovonic segment 
our united solar ovonic segment accounted for and of our total revenue in the fiscal years ended june  and  respectively 
our united solar ovonic segment generated operating income of million and million in the fiscal years ended june  and  respectively 
given the expected growth of this segment as discussed below relative to our other business activities  our overall success in the foreseeable future will be aligned primarily with the performance of our united solar ovonic segment and subject to the risks of that business 
global economic  capital markets and credit disruptions have significantly impacted current market conditions in the solar market and created uncertainty  but we believe that growth opportunities will resume in calendar year we believe that there remains strong interest in alternative energy in general and solar in particular  but existing global financial constraints are impacting the funding of solar projects that otherwise have strong strategic rationale and or financial returns 
these macroeconomic conditions are adversely impacting our customers  including some customers who are unable to fully comply with take or pay agreements  and  as a result  our revenues and net income are likewise adversely impacted 
we are working with our customers to preserve relationships and maximize long term value by  among other things  reallocating product shipments to other customers and pursuing other remedies including contract renegotiations  as appropriate on a case by case basis 
we also continue to be encouraged by the opportunities for large scale restructuring of the energy infrastructure to increase emphasis on renewable energy  such as our solar laminates 
recent government support in this direction includes renewable energy spending and incentive programs included in the american recovery and reinvestment act  and the solar investment tax credit initiatives enacted as part of the us emergency economic stabilization act of  including an year extension of the  uncapped investment tax credit for commercial and residential solar installations  and permitting utilities to benefit from these tax credits 
pending energy legislation would also adopt a national renewable portfolio standard 
we believe that these programs will provide meaningful stimulus for us growth in calendar year 
table of contents we are adjusting our production in our united solar ovonic segment and reducing costs to respond to near term market conditions and improve our overall competitiveness 
in june  in order to meet increasing demand for our products  we announced the active expansion of our production capacity and the commencement of a plan to reach gw of annual production capacity by in march of  we announced that we were slowing the pace of our demand driven production and expansion plan to better reflect the present impact of credit availability on project flow in the global pipeline for photovoltaics 
in connection with this announcement  we have implemented actions  including temporary production hiatuses and a consolidation of certain production operations from our auburn hills facility into our newer auburn hills facility 
this consolidation  which will lower overall costs and improve manufacturing efficiencies  is part of an overall program to reduce costs 
other activities focus on improvement in our operations to generate higher throughput and yield  reductions in administrative costs  and raw material cost reductions 
we have incurred restructuring expenses as a result of certain of these activities and may incur additional restructuring expenses as we pursue further cost reduction activities in the future 
we have also recognized under absorption of fixed overhead costs  and associated period costs  resulting from our production adjustments and may recognize similar costs and or asset impairments in the future if we do not operate our facilities at productive capacity 
at the same time  we intend to continue to invest strategically in our business  for example to bolster our sales and marketing functions and to add technical competencies related to application engineering and structured finance 
additionally  in july  we approved a project to upgrade our deposition process  materials and equipment in our auburn hills facility 
the project will utilize existing equipment in auburn hills as well as equipment from our other facilities and will require an additional investment 
this action temporarily reduces our production capacity in this facility until the project is completed 
we expect that these activities will improve our competitiveness and margins  both in the near and long term 
we are enhancing our revenues in our united solar ovonic segment through a demand creation strategy  which includes focusing on customers and markets where our solar laminates have a competitive advantage  particularly the rooftop market 
as indicated above  there have been disruptions in the solar markets caused by global macro economic conditions 
at the same time  competition within the solar market is increasing primarily as a result of sharp declines in the pricing of polysilicon  a key raw material in traditional  rigid pv modules 
we are continuing to concentrate on the rooftop market  particularly the bipv market  which we believe represents the most attractive opportunity for our solar laminates 
the physical flexibility  durability and lightweight nature of our solar laminates makes them an attractive value proposition for the bipv market  particularly commercial rooftop applications  where our solar laminates can be integrated with roofing materials and other building products 
our strategy is to increase our sales in the rooftop market  which includes developing new channels for rooftop applications  such as the utilities channel  and designing new rooftop applications  such as residential applications 
we are also developing new applications that leverage the unique characteristics of our laminates  such as landfill covers 
we are strategically deploying our capital resources to implement our demand creation strategy in our united solar ovonic segment and enhance our business model 
as described below  we have paused our manufacturing capacity expansion  upon which we had previously principally focused our capital resources  in response to weakened market conditions 
we are now utilizing our capital resources to  among other things  offer financing to encourage and support the installation of systems utilizing our laminates  and make strategic acquisitions  like the recent 
table of contents acquisition of sit as described below 
we expect to strategically deploy our capital resources to improve our capabilities  enhance our competitiveness  and opportunistically develop demand under current market conditions 
these activities may impact the adequacy of our existing capital resources in re starting our manufacturing capacity expansion when market conditions improve 
subsequent to june   we have acquired and are integrating solar integrated technologies  inc to extend our value proposition and improve our overall competitiveness as part of our demand creation and operational excellence initiatives 
sit is a global leader in designing  developing  bonding  installing and servicing rooftop pv systems  and has significant field experience with our laminates 
sit s core competencies in rooftop solar are expected to improve our engineering and technical capabilities to better support our channel partners in europe and the us and to provide a platform for directly participating in the growing us market 
sit s expertise is also expected to enhance our applications activities to improve our responsiveness to market opportunities and reduce overall systems costs for rooftop installations of our laminates 
we have begun the process of integrating sit into our business  which we expect will require significant resources until completed in the second half of fiscal year we are pausing our manufacturing capacity expansion in our united solar ovonic segment to respond to existing uncertainties in the market consistent with our demand driven expansion strategy 
we presently have mw of nameplate capacity and are delaying further manufacturing capacity expansion until market demand and visibility improves 
we have delayed expansion at our greenville facility and planned battle creek facility  which will reduce or defer our capital expenditures and allow us to preserve and  in strategic situations  redeploy our capital in other areas as described above 
when market conditions and visibility improves  we believe that we have the operational capabilities to quickly re initiate our manufacturing capacity expansion  as a result of the improvements we have made with respect to the construction and ramp of new facilities 
we do not presently believe that we will expand to mw of nameplate capacity by or gw by we are profitably operating our ovonic materials segment and are continuing to realize value from our technology portfolio 
we have developed proprietary technologies in our ovonic materials segment that we believe have value  including technologies for nimh batteries  solid hydrogen storage  metal hydride fuel cells  and biofuel reformation 
the development activities for these technologies have been substantially balanced with external sources of revenues  such as royalties and development agreements principally government contracts  to align our development commercialization efforts at sustainable levels 
we are continually evaluating commercialization opportunities and strategic alternatives to maximize value for these technologies  which may include licenses  joint ventures  and sales 
we completed the disposition of our cobasys joint venture interest  but retained certain technology and royalty rights 
key indicators of financial condition and operating performance in evaluating our business  we use product sales  gross profit  pre tax income  earnings per share  net income  cash flow from operations and other key performance metrics 
we also use production  measured in megawatts mw per annum  and gross margins on product sales as key performance metrics for our united solar ovonic segment  particularly in connection with the manufacturing operations in this segment 

table of contents in march  we implemented an organizational restructuring to consolidate certain production operations from our auburn hills facility into our newer auburn hills facility which reduced the combined production capacity from these facilities 
this consolidation  which lowered overall costs and improved manufacturing efficiencies  is part of an overall program to reduce costs 
additionally  we have realigned our workforce based on our demand creation strategy and will recognize improved efficiencies as a result 
we have incurred total restructuring costs of million through june  as a result of certain of these activities and may incur additional restructuring expenses as we pursue further cost reduction activities in the future 
we are continuing to evaluate our facilities infrastructure and personnel requirements based on our consolidated and realigned business activities to identify additional cost savings opportunities and may undertake additional restructuring activities  and record additional restructuring charges  as a result

the increase in total revenues in was primarily attributable to an increase in pv product sales of million  the impact of which was partially offset by a price declines and product mix of million 
the cost of product sales increased million reflecting higher product sales volume  and the operating costs associated with the expansion of our production capacity in our greenville  michigan facility in the first half of fiscal year the cost of product sales increased in primarily due to the previously mentioned sales volume increase  which resulted in million of additional cost  as well as increased inventory reserves of million  higher warranty costs of million and associated period costs of million  caused by the under absorption of fixed overhead costs resulting from our declines of sales and production in the second half of fiscal these additional costs were offset in part by lower raw material costs and improved efficiencies in our manufacturing processes  which in total amounted to million resulting in increased margins on product sales from in to in

the revenue remaining on each contract at the end of fiscal year was million and million  respectively 
we continue to invest in product development and research to improve the throughput of our pv cell manufacturing equipment  reduce the cost of production and increase the sunlight to electricity conversion efficiency of our pv laminates 
although we expanded our nameplate capacity in the first half of fiscal from mw to mw with the addition of mw of nameplate capacity in our greenville  michigan facility  preproduction costs consisting of new employee training  facilities preparation  set up materials and supplies decreased million as  in the second half of fiscal  we paused the continued expansion of our michigan and tijuana  mexico facilities 
our selling  general and administrative expenses increased due to increased support services of million  sales and marketing of million and an increase in the allowance for doubtful accounts receivable of million 
we expect selling  general and administrative expenses to increase as we continue to enhance our demand creation activities and develop the strategic infrastructure to achieve and support those activities 
the loss on disposal of property  plant and equipment represents the write off of obsolete equipment that is no longer used in the production process 
the restructuring costs in fiscal year reflect severance and equipment relocation costs associated with the consolidation of certain production operations from auburn hills facility to the newer auburn hills facility

selling  general and administrative expenses consist primarily of corporate operations  including human resources  legal  finance  strategy  information technology  business development  and corporate governance 
the reduction in selling  general and administrative expenses in fiscal was primarily due to lower salaries  wages and related expenses  lower supplies and professional fees  offset by stock and option award amortization 
net loss on disposal of property  plant and equipment increased in fiscal year to million 
we were unable to sell certain assets previously classified as assets held for sale and determined these assets no longer met the criteria for classification as assets held for sale 
as a result  we reclassified these assets as held and used and recognized a loss of million 
the decline in restructuring charges in fiscal year as compared to fiscal year is primarily due to lower severance and facility related costs associated with our earlier business realignment activities 
most of the restructuring which began in fiscal was completed during fiscal as a result  restructuring charges decreased by million during the year ended june  other income expense other income expense was million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal year the change was principally due to increased interest expense reflecting a full year s interest on our convertible senior notes of million  a reduction in the level of investments and lower interest rates in fiscal which reduced interest income by million  foreign currency losses of million  investment losses of million reduced by insurance proceeds of million in fiscal in may  the fasb issued fsp apb accounting for convertible debt instruments that may be settled in cash upon conversion including partial cash settlement  fsp apb  which

fsp apb will result in significantly higher non cash interest expense on our convertible debt 
fsp apb is effective for fiscal years and interim periods beginning after december  effective july  for the company  and retrospective application will be required for all periods presented 
income taxes income tax expense was million for fiscal year compared to million in fiscal year the increase in tax expense is primarily related to taxes incurred for alternative minimum tax in the us of million  state taxes in the us of million and an increase in foreign income taxes in germany and mexico

the cost of product sales increased by million  reflecting this higher product sales volume  including the operating costs for our expanded production capacity 

table of contents margins on product sales increased from in to in due to lower labor costs  and raw material costs and improved efficiencies in our manufacturing processes  offset in part by product and price mix as described above 
margins at our greenville and tijuana manufacturing facilities were positively impacted by the faster ramp of our operations at these two facilities 
as we expand our manufacturing capacity  our gross profit margins will be impacted by higher costs associated with production volumes as we ramp production to full capacity at our new manufacturing facilities 
combined product development and research expenses increased by million in  partially offset by million of increased revenues from product development agreements

table of contents liquidity and capital resources our principal sources of liquidity are cash  cash equivalents and short term investments which principally represent the proceeds from our june offering of convertible debt and common stock  cash flows from operations  and borrowing available under our credit facility 
we believe that cash  cash equivalents and investments and cash flows from operations and borrowing under our credit facility will be sufficient to meet our liquidity needs for our current operations 
at june   we had consolidated working capital of million 
as of june   we had million in cash  cash equivalents  and short term investments consisting of floating rate corporate notes frns  corporate notes  us government agency notes  auction rate certificates arcs  and auction rate securities rights 
the investments have maturities up to months  except for the arcs which have maturities from to years 
presently  there is an absence of auctions for arcs 
as a result  these investments are not currently liquid 
in october  we agreed to an offer from ubs ag ubs to sell at par value  at anytime from june  through july   the arcs purchased from ubs which represent the entire portfolio of our arcs 
these auction rate securities rights arsrs  which are akin to a freestanding put option  are non transferable and are not traded on any exchange 
at june   we classified the arcs as short term investments based upon management s intention to exercise its right to sell the arcs to ubs 
our valuations of arcs and arsrs are based on unobservable inputs for which there is little or no market data and therefore require us to develop our own assumptions

we anticipate that future accounts receivable and saleable inventory balances will fluctuate as we continue to balance our manufacturing and sales activities until market conditions improve 
we expect project inventory and related investment to increase as we close project financing deals 
net cash used in investing activities was million in as compared to million in the corresponding period in this increase was principally due to increased purchases of investments and increased capital spending principally associated with expenditures for the expansion of our united solar ovonic segment s manufacturing capacity during the first half of fiscal because of adverse market conditions  we significantly curtailed our production capacity and expansion plans in the third quarter of fiscal year until market conditions improve  we will continue to curb capital expenditures for expansion 
however  we will continue to invest in capital equipment provided the investment results in reducing our cost structure

net cash used in investing activities was million in as compared to million in the corresponding period in this decrease was principally due to reduced purchases of investments in there was a decrease in capital spending million in compared to million in  principally associated with the timing of the expenditures for the expansion of our united solar ovonic segment s manufacturing capacity 
net cash provided by our financing activities was million in compared to million in  primarily as a result of proceeds from the june convertible debt and equity offerings 
short term borrowings on february   our subsidiaries united solar ovonic llc and united solar ovonic corporation entered into secured credit facility agreements consisting of a million revolving line of credit to finance domestic activities and a separate million revolving line of credit provided under the united states export import bank s fast track working capital guarantee program to finance foreign activities 
availability of financing under the lines of credit will be determined by reference to a borrowing base comprised of domestic and foreign inventory and receivables  respectively 
at june   there were no outstanding borrowings on the line of credit 
the credit facilities also contain an aggregate million sub limit for standby letters of credit and there were approximately million of standby letters of credit outstanding at june  convertible senior notes on june   we completed an offering of million of convertible senior notes notes 
the notes bear interest at a rate of per year  payable on june and december of each year  commencing on december  if the notes are not converted  they will mature on june  the notes are only convertible prior to march  under specific circumstances involving the price of the company s common stock  the price of the notes and certain corporate transactions including  but not limited to  an offering of common stock at a price less than market  a distribution of cash or other assets to stockholders  a merger  consolidation or other share exchange  or a change in control 
the holders of the notes may convert the principal amount of their notes into cash and  if applicable  shares of the company s common stock initially at a conversion rate of shares equivalent to an initial conversion price of approximately per share per  principal amount of the notes 
the holders of the notes are only entitled to amounts in excess of the principal amount if shares of the company s common stock exceed a market price of for a period of consecutive trading days during the applicable cash settlement averaging period 
the applicable conversion rate will be subject to adjustments in certain circumstances

table of contents off balance sheet arrangements our off balance sheet financing consists primarily of operating leases for equipment and property 
these leases have terms ranging from a month to month basis to years 
we incurred lease expense of million  million and million for the years ended june   and  respectively 
contractual obligations the company previously announced expansion plans to expand its manufacturing capacity 
as of june   the company had purchase commitments of approximately million for its announced expansion of which advance payments of million have been made  and the company intends to fund this additional expansion through existing funds and cash generated from operations 
the company has significantly curtailed its expansion plans until market conditions improve 
discussion with vendors on the purchase commitments continue  to date  the company has not incurred any significant cost from these purchase commitments 
the company  in the ordinary course of business  enters into purchase commitments for certain raw materials 
the company also enters into purchase commitments for capital equipment  including subcontracts for the purchase of components for the new solar manufacturing equipment being installed in greenville  michigan and tijuana  mexico 
our contractual obligations include the following maturities in thousands payments due by period in thousands less than more than total year years years years convertible senior notes  including interest capital lease obligations  including interest operating leases purchase obligations total we anticipate capital expenditures to be approximately million during fiscal year significant accounting policies and critical accounting estimates our significant accounting policies are more fully described in note nature of operations  basis of presentation and summary of significant accounting policies  of the notes to our consolidated financial statements 
certain of our accounting policies require management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as of the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
these estimates and assumptions are based on our historical experience  the terms of existing contracts  our evaluation of trends in the industry  information provided by our customers and suppliers and information available from other outside sources  as appropriate 
however  they are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty 
as a result  actual results in these areas may differ significantly from our estimates 

table of contents we consider an accounting estimate to be significant if it requires us to make assumptions about matters that were uncertain at the time the estimate was made and changes in the estimate would have had a significant impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations 
inventory reserves we evaluate the recoverability of our inventory based upon assumptions about anticipated customer demand and future market conditions 
the key factors we consider when estimating our inventory reserve include historical sales  anticipated demand  expected sales price  market trends  product obsolescence  the effect new products might have on the sale of existing products and other factors 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional inventory reserves may be required 
inventory reserves were million and million at june  and  respectively 
warranty reserve we generally provide a year product warranty on power output on all solar product sales 
we estimate our warranty liability based on past experience of claims and claims paid as well as our engineering and laboratory tests of our product under different conditions and then apply that knowledge to the installed base of solar product sales 
at june  and  the company had recorded a liability for future warranty claims of approximately million and million  respectively 
allowance for uncollectible accounts the company maintains an allowance for uncollectible accounts and considers a number of factors  when estimating the allowance including the length of time trade accounts receivable are past due  existing collateral or other security that can be obtained  trade credit insurance coverage  previous payment and loss history  the customer s current ability to pay its obligation  and its knowledge of the customer and the customer s business 
the allowance for doubtful accounts was million and million at june  and  respectively 
government contracts  reserves and liabilities the company had a reserve for losses on government contracts of million and million at june  and  respectively 
our reserves and liabilities for government contracts reflect estimated obligations as a result of audits of certain government contracts by the defense contract audit agency 
see note liabilities  of the notes to our consolidated financial statements 
federal taxes on income the company accounts for income taxes using the asset and liability approach 
deferred income taxes are provided for the differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their reported amounts in the financial statements 
this method also requires the recognition of future tax benefits  such as net operating loss carryforwards  to the extent that the realization of such benefits is more likely than not 
at june   the company had net operating loss carryforwards of million expiring in through and an alternative minimum tax credit carryforward of million  which does not 
table of contents expire 
additionally  the company had r d credit carryforwards of million expiring in through at june  and  a full valuation allowance has been recorded for all of the above tax benefits 
the company has historically reserved its net deferred tax assets dta  which are mainly comprised of net operating losses nol that resulted in prior years  basis differences in intangible assets  and other temporary differences 
in assessing whether or not the deferred tax assets are realizable in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
accounting for income taxes sfas  significant weight is given to evidence  both positive and negative  that can be objectively verified 
currently  a three year historical cumulative pre tax accounting income test is widely used to assess the probability of a future dta recognition including the ability to demonstrate recent cumulative profitability over the past several years 
the company has had a long history of numerous consecutive losses  and as of june   the company has a three year cumulative pre tax loss 
in addition  other factors that the company considered in its analysis include the continuing global economic  capital markets and credit disruptions resulting in reduced industry demand for solar products  continued uncertainty in the overall economy  changes within the sales pipeline after consideration of both the positive and negative evidence  the company has retained a full valuation allowance on its dta in accordance with sfas share based compensation ecd records the fair value of stock based compensation grants as an expense 
in order to determine the fair value of stock options on the date of grant  ecd applies the black scholes option pricing model 
inherent in this model are assumptions related to expected stock price volatility  option life  risk free interest rate and dividend yield 
while the risk free interest rate and dividend yield are less subjective assumptions  typically based on factual data derived from public sources  the expected stock price volatility and option life assumptions require a greater level of judgment 
ecd uses an expected stock price volatility assumption that is based on historical implied volatilities of the underlying stock which is obtained from public data sources 
with regard to the weighted average option life assumption  ecd considers the exercise behavior of past grants and models the pattern of aggregate exercises 
patterns are determined on specific criteria of the aggregate pool of optionees 
forfeiture rates are based on the company s historical data for stock option forfeitures

table of contents item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the following discussion about our exposure to market risk of financial instruments contains forward looking statements 
actual results may differ materially from those described 
interest rate risk our investments in financial instruments are comprised of debt securities 
all such instruments are classified as securities available for sale 
we do not invest in portfolio equity securities  or commodities  or use financial derivatives for trading purposes 
our debt security portfolio represents funds held temporarily  pending use in our business and operations 
the company had million of these investments as of june  it is the company s policy that investments including cash equivalents shall be rated a or higher by moody s or standard and poor s  no single investment excluding cash equivalents shall represent more than of the portfolio and at least of the total portfolio shall have maturities of days or less 
our market risk primarily relates to the risks of changes in the credit quality of issuers 
an interest rate increase decrease of would increase decrease the value of our portfolio by approximately million and million  as of june   respectively 
the company invests in arcs 
our arcs are student loan asset backed securities guaranteed by the federal family education loan program ffelp 
the payments of principal and interest on these student loans are guaranteed by the state or not for profit guaranty agency and the us department of education 
at the time of our initial investment and through the date of this filing  all of our arcs are rated as aaa 
the arcs mature at various dates between december and december the arcs bear interest at rates determined every or days through an auction process 
presently  there is an absence of auctions for arcs 
as a result  these investments are not currently liquid 
these funds will not be accessible until a successful auction occurs  the issuer redeems the arc  a buyer is found outside the auction process or the securities mature 
in october  the company agreed to an offer from ubs ag ubs to sell at par value  at anytime from june  through july   the arcs purchased from ubs which represent the entire portfolio of our arcs 
these arsrs  which are akin to a freestanding put option  are non transferable and are not traded on any exchange 
at june  the company classified the arcs as short term investments based upon management s intention to exercise its right to sell the arcs to ubs 
our investments in arcs are not valued using a market model due to the recent absence of auctions 
the valuation analyses utilized discount rates based on the reported rates for comparable securities ie  similar student loan portfolios and holding periods in active markets  plus a factor for the present market illiquidity associated with the arcs 
the reported rate for a comparable security was the sum of the base rate that is used in the reporting of that security  in this case three month libor  and the interest rate spread above the base rate  as reported from the active markets for that security 
the illiquidity factor was established based on the credit quality of the arc determined by the percentage of the underlying loans guaranteed by ffelp 
the resulting discount rates used in the valuation analyses ranged from to based on the arc
