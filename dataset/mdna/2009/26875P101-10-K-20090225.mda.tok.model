risk factors our business and operations are subject to many risks 
the risks described below may not be the only risks we face  as our business and operations may also be subject to risks that we do not yet know of  or that we currently believe are immaterial 
if any of the events or circumstances described below actually occurs  our business  financial condition  results of operations or cash flow could be materially and adversely affected and the trading price of our common stock could decline 
the following risk factors should be read in conjunction with the other information contained in this report  including the consolidated financial statements and the related notes 
a substantial or extended decline in natural gas or crude oil prices would have a material and adverse effect on us 
prices for natural gas and crude oil fluctuate widely 
since we are primarily a natural gas company  we are more significantly affected by changes in natural gas prices than changes in the prices for crude oil and condensate or natural gas liquids 
among the factors that can cause these price fluctuations are the level of consumer demand  supplies of natural gas and crude oil  weather conditions  domestic and international drilling activity  the price and availability of competing energy sources  including liquefied natural gas  the availability  proximity and capacity of transportation facilities  worldwide economic and political conditions  the level and effect of trading in commodity futures markets  including by commodity price speculators and others  the effect of worldwide energy conservation measures  and the nature and extent of governmental regulation and taxation  including environmental regulations 
our cash flow and results of operations depend to a great extent on the prevailing prices for natural gas and crude oil 
prolonged or substantial declines in natural gas and or crude oil prices may materially and adversely affect our liquidity  the amount of cash flow we have available for our capital expenditures and other operating expenses  our ability to access the credit and capital markets and our results of operations 
in addition  if we expect significant sustained decreases in natural gas and crude oil prices in the future such that the future cash flow from our natural gas and crude oil properties falls below the net book value of our properties  we may be required to write down the value of our natural gas and crude oil properties 
any such future asset impairments could materially and adversely affect our results of operations and  in turn  the trading price of our common stock 
drilling natural gas and crude oil wells is a high risk activity and subjects us to a variety of risks that we cannot control 
drilling natural gas and crude oil wells  including development wells  involves numerous risks  including the risk that we may not encounter commercially productive natural gas and crude oil reservoirs 
as a result  we may not recover all or any portion of our investment in new wells 
specifically  we often are uncertain as to the future cost or timing of drilling  completing and operating wells  and our drilling operations and those of our third party operators may be curtailed  delayed or canceled  and the cost of such operations may increase  as a result of a variety of factors  including unexpected drilling conditions  title problems  pressure or irregularities in formations  equipment failures or accidents  adverse weather conditions  compliance with environmental and other governmental requirements  the availability and timely issuance of required governmental permits and licenses  the availability of  costs associated with and terms of contractual arrangements for properties  including leases  pipelines and related facilities and equipment to gather  process  compress  transport and market natural gas  crude oil and related commodities  costs of  or shortages or delays in the availability of  drilling rigs  tubular materials and other necessary equipment  and lack of necessary services and or qualified personnel 
our failure to recover our investment in wells  increases in the costs of our drilling operations or those of our third party operators and or curtailments  delays or cancellations of our drilling operations or those of our third party operators may materially and adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
our ability to sell and deliver our natural gas and crude oil production could be materially and adversely affected if we fail to obtain adequate gathering  processing  compression and transportation services 
the sale of our natural gas and crude oil production depends on a number of factors beyond our control  including the availability  proximity and capacity of  and costs associated with  gathering  processing  compression and transportation facilities owned by third parties 
these facilities may be temporarily unavailable to us due to market conditions  mechanical reasons or other factors or conditions  and may not be available to us in the future on terms we consider acceptable  if at all 
any significant change in market or other conditions affecting these facilities or the availability of these facilities  including due to our failure or inability to obtain access to these facilities on terms acceptable to us or at all  could materially and adversely affect our business and  in turn  our financial condition and results of operations 
if we fail to acquire or find sufficient additional reserves over time  our reserves and production will decline from their current levels 
the rate of production from natural gas and crude oil properties generally declines as reserves are depleted 
except to the extent that we conduct successful exploration 
exploitation and development activities  acquire additional properties containing proved reserves or  through engineering studies  identify additional behind pipe zones or secondary recovery reserves  our proved reserves will decline as reserves are produced 
maintaining our production of natural gas and crude oil at  or increasing our production from  current levels  is  therefore  highly dependent upon our level of success in acquiring or finding additional reserves  as is  in turn  our future cash flow and results of operations 
a portion of our natural gas and crude oil production may be subject to interruptions that could have a material and adverse effect on us 
a portion of our natural gas and crude oil production may be interrupted  or shut in  from time to time for various reasons  including as a result of accidents  weather conditions  loss of gathering  processing  compression or transportation facility access or field labor issues  or intentionally as a result of market conditions such as natural gas or crude oil prices that we deem uneconomic 
if a substantial amount of our production is interrupted  our cash flow and  in turn  our results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 
we operate in other countries and  as a result  are subject to certain political  economic and other risks 
our operations in jurisdictions outside the united states us are subject to various risks inherent in foreign operations 
these risks may include  among other risks loss of revenue  equipment and property as a result of expropriation  war and other political risks  increases in taxes and governmental royalties  renegotiation of contracts with governmental entities  difficulties enforcing our rights against a governmental agency because of the doctrine of sovereign immunity and foreign sovereignty over international operations  changes in laws and policies governing operations of foreign based companies  and currency restrictions and exchange rate fluctuations 
our international operations may also be adversely affected by us laws and policies affecting foreign trade and taxation 
the realization of any of these factors could materially and adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we have limited control over the activities on properties we do not operate 
some of the properties in which we have an interest are operated by other companies and involve third party working interest owners 
as a result  we have limited ability to influence or control the operation or future development of such properties  including compliance with environmental  safety and other regulations  or the amount of capital expenditures that we will be required to fund with respect to such properties 
moreover  we are dependent on the other working interest owners of such projects to fund their contractual share of the capital expenditures of such projects 
these limitations and our dependence on the operator and other working interest owners for these projects could cause us to incur unexpected future costs and materially and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 
if we acquire natural gas and crude oil properties  our failure to fully identify existing and potential problems  to accurately estimate reserves  production rates or costs  or to effectively integrate the acquired properties could materially and adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
from time to time  we seek to acquire natural gas and crude oil properties 
although we perform reviews of properties to be acquired in a manner that we believe is consistent with industry practices  reviews of records and properties may not necessarily reveal existing or potential problems  nor may they permit a buyer to become sufficiently familiar with the properties in order to assess fully their deficiencies and potential 
even when problems with a property are identified  we often may assume environmental and other risks and liabilities in connection with acquired properties pursuant to the acquisition agreements 
moreover  there are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities of proved natural gas and crude oil reserves  actual future production rates and associated costs with respect to acquired properties 
actual reserves  production rates and costs may vary substantially from those assumed in our estimates 
in addition  an acquisition may have a material and adverse effect on our business and results of operations  particularly during the periods in which the operations of the acquired properties are being integrated into our ongoing operations or if we are unable to effectively integrate the acquired properties into our ongoing operations 
weather and climate may have a significant and adverse impact on us 
demand for natural gas and crude oil is  to a significant degree  dependent on weather and climate  which impacts  among other things  the price we receive for the commodities we produce and  in turn  our cash flow and results of operations 
for example  relatively warm temperatures during a winter season generally result in relatively lower demand for natural gas as less natural gas is used to heat residences and businesses and  as a result  relatively lower prices for natural gas production 
in addition  our exploration and development activities and equipment can be adversely affected by extreme weather conditions  such as hurricanes in the gulf of mexico  which may cause a loss of production from temporary cessation of activity or lost or damaged facilities and equipment 
extreme weather conditions could also impact other areas of our operations  including access to our drilling and production facilities for routine operations  maintenance and repairs  the installation and operation of gathering and production facilities and the availability of  and our access to  necessary third party services  such as gathering  processing  compression and transportation 
such extreme weather conditions could materially and adversely affect our business and  in turn  our financial condition and results of operations 
we have substantial capital requirements  and we may be unable to obtain needed financing on satisfactory terms  if at all 
we make  and will continue to make  substantial capital expenditures for the acquisition  development  production  exploration and abandonment of natural gas and crude oil reserves 
we intend to finance our capital expenditures primarily through our cash flow from operations  commercial paper borrowings and borrowings under other uncommitted credit facilities and  to a lesser extent and if and as necessary  bank borrowings  borrowings under our revolving credit facilities and public and private equity and debt offerings 
lower natural gas and crude oil prices  however  would reduce our cash flow 
further  if the condition of the credit and capital markets materially declines  we might not be able to obtain financing on terms we consider acceptable  if at all 
the recent credit crisis and corresponding reaction by lenders to risk and  related thereto  the recent weakness and volatility in domestic and global financial markets and economic conditions  may increase the interest rates that lenders and commercial paper investors require us to pay and adversely affect our ability to finance our capital expenditures through equity or debt offerings 
in addition  a substantial rise in interest rates would decrease our net cash flows available for reinvestment 
any of these factors could have a material and adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
the inability of our customers and other contractual counterparties to satisfy their obligations to us may have a material and adverse effect on us 
we have various customers for the natural gas  crude oil and related commodities that we produce as well as various other contractual counterparties  including several financial institutions and affiliates of financial institutions 
domestic and global economic conditions  including the financial condition of financial institutions generally  have recently weakened 
in addition  there has been recent weakness and volatility in domestic and global financial markets  including the credit crisis and corresponding reaction by lenders to risk 
these conditions and factors may adversely affect the ability of our customers and other contractual counterparties to pay amounts owed to us from time to time and to otherwise satisfy their contractual obligations to us  as well as their ability to access the credit and capital markets for such purposes 
moreover  our customers and other contractual counterparties may be unable to satisfy their contractual obligations to us for reasons unrelated to these conditions and factors  such as the unavailability of required facilities or equipment due to mechanical failure or market conditions 
furthermore  if a customer is unable to satisfy its contractual obligation to purchase natural gas  crude oil or related commodities from us  we may be unable to sell such production to another customer on terms we consider acceptable  if at all  due to the geographic location of such production  the availability  proximity or capacity of transportation facilities or market or other factors and conditions 
the inability of our customers and other contractual counterparties to pay amounts owed to us and to otherwise satisfy their contractual obligations to us may materially and adversely affect our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flow 
competition in the oil and gas exploration and production industry is intense  and many of our competitors have greater resources than we have 
we compete with major integrated oil and gas companies and other independent oil and gas companies for the acquisition of licenses and leases  properties and reserves and the equipment  materials  services and employees and other personnel including geologists  geophysicists  engineers and other specialists required to explore for  develop  produce and market natural gas and crude oil 
in addition  many of our competitors have financial and other resources substantially greater than those we possess and have established strategic long term positions and strong governmental relationships in countries in which we may seek new or expanded entry 
as a consequence  we may be at a competitive disadvantage in bidding for drilling rights 
in addition  many of our larger competitors may have a competitive advantage when responding to factors that affect demand for natural gas and crude oil  such as changing worldwide prices and levels of production and the cost and availability of alternat ive fuels 
we also face competition from competing energy sources  such as liquefied natural gas imported into the us from other countries and  to a lesser extent  alternative energy sources 
reserve estimates depend on many interpretations and assumptions that may turn out to be inaccurate 
any significant inaccuracies in these interpretations and assumptions could cause the reported quantities of our reserves to be materially misstated 
estimating quantities of proved natural gas and liquids reserves and future net cash flows from such reserves is a complex process 
it requires interpretations of available technical data and various assumptions  including assumptions relating to economic factors  made by our management and our independent petroleum consultants 
any significant inaccuracies in these interpretations or assumptions could cause the reported quantities of our reserves and future net cash flows from such reserves to be overstated or understated 
moreover  the data for a given reservoir may also change substantially over time as a result of numerous factors including  but not limited to  additional development activity  evolving production history and continual reassessment of the viability of production under varying economic conditions 
to prepare estimates of our economically recoverable natural gas and liquids reserves and future net cash flows from our reserves  we analyze many variable factors  such as historical production from the area compared with production rates from other producing areas 
we also analyze available geological  geophysical  production and engineering data  and the extent  quality and reliability of this data can vary 
the process also involves economic assumptions relating to commodity prices  production costs  severance and excise taxes  capital expenditures and workover and remedial costs 
our actual proved reserves and future net cash flows from such reserves most likely will vary from our estimates 
any significant variance could materially and adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations and the trading price of our common stock 
we incur certain costs to comply with government regulations  particularly regulations relating to environmental protection and safety  and could incur even greater costs in the future 
our exploration  production and marketing operations are regulated extensively at the federal  state and local levels  as well as by the governments and regulatory agencies in the foreign countries in which we do business  and are subject to interruption or termination by governmental and regulatory authorities based on environmental or other considerations 
moreover  we have incurred and will continue to incur costs in our efforts to comply with the requirements of environmental  safety and other regulations 
further  the regulatory environment in the natural gas and crude oil industry could change in ways that we cannot predict and that might substantially increase our costs of compliance and  in turn  materially and adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
specifically  as an owner or lessee and operator of natural gas and crude oil properties  we are subject to various federal  state  local and foreign regulations relating to the discharge of materials into  and the protection of  the environment 
these regulations may  among other things  impose liability on us for the cost of pollution cleanup resulting from operations  subject us to liability for pollution damages and require suspension or cessation of operations in affected areas 
changes in  or additions to  these regulations could materially and adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
eog is aware of the increasing focus of local  state  national and international regulatory bodies on greenhouse gas ghg emissions and climate change issues 
we are also aware of legislation proposed by us lawmakers and by the canadian legislature to reduce ghg emissions 
eog will continue to monitor and assess any new policies  legislation or regulations in the areas where we operate to determine the impact on our operations and take appropriate actions  where necessary 
any direct and indirect costs of these regulations may materially and adversely affect eog s business  results of operations and financial condition 
our hedging activities may prevent us from benefiting fully from increases in natural gas and crude oil prices and may expose us to other risks  including counterparty risk 
we use derivative instruments primarily financial collars  price swaps and basis swaps to hedge the impact of fluctuations in natural gas and crude oil prices on our results of operations and cash flow 
to the extent that we engage in hedging activities to protect ourselves against commodity price declines  we may be prevented from fully realizing the benefits of increases in natural gas and crude oil prices above the prices established by our hedging contracts 
in addition  our hedging activities may expose us to the risk of financial loss in certain circumstances  including instances in which the counterparties to our hedging contracts fail to perform under the contracts 
we do not insure against all potential losses and could be materially and adversely affected by unexpected liabilities 
the exploration for  and production of  natural gas and crude oil can be hazardous  involving natural disasters and other unforeseen occurrences such as blowouts  cratering  fires and loss of well control  which can damage or destroy wells or production facilities  injure or kill people  and damage property and the environment 
moreover  our onshore and offshore operations are subject to customary perils  including hurricanes and other adverse weather conditions 
we maintain insurance against many  but not all  potential losses or liabilities arising from our operations in accordance with what we believe are customary industry practices and in amounts and at costs that we believe to be prudent and commercially practicable 
the occurrence of any of these events and any costs or liabilities incurred as a result of such events would reduce the funds available to us for our exploration  development and production activities and could  in turn  have a material adverse effect on our b usiness  financial condition and results of operations 
our business and prospects for future success depend to a significant extent upon the continued service and performance of our management team 
our business and prospects for future success  including the successful implementation of our strategies and handling of issues integral to our future success  depend to a significant extent upon the continued service and performance of our management team 
the loss of any member of our management team  and our inability to attract  motivate and retain substitute management personnel with comparable experience and skills  could materially and adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
unfavorable currency exchange rate fluctuations could adversely affect our results of operations 
the reporting currency for our financial statements is the us dollar 
however  certain of our subsidiaries are located in countries other than the us and have functional currencies other than the us dollar 
the assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses of certain of these foreign subsidiaries are denominated in currencies other than the us dollar 
to prepare our consolidated financial statements  we must translate those assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses into us dollars at then applicable exchange rates 
consequently  increases and decreases in the value of the us dollar versus other currencies will affect the amount of these items in our consolidated financial statements  even if the amount has not changed in the original currency 
these translations could result in changes to our results of operations from period to period 
for the fiscal year ended december   approximately of our revenues related to operations of our foreign subsidiaries whose functional currency was not the us dollar 
terrorist activities and military and other actions could materially and adversely affect us 
terrorist attacks and the threat of terrorist attacks  whether domestic or foreign  as well as military or other actions taken in response to these acts  could cause instability in the global financial and energy markets 
the us government has at times issued public warnings that indicate that energy assets might be specific targets of terrorist organizations 
any such actions could materially and adversely affect us in unpredictable ways  including the disruption of energy supplies and markets  increased volatility in natural gas and crude oil prices or the possibility that the infrastructure on which we rely could be a direct target or an indirect casualty of an act of terrorism  and  in turn  could materially and adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations

unresolved staff comments none 
item properties oil and gas exploration and production properties and reserves reserve information 
for estimates of eog s net proved and proved developed reserves of natural gas and liquids  including crude oil and condensate and natural gas liquids  see supplemental information to consolidated financial statements 
there are numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities of proved reserves and in projecting future rates of production and timing of development expenditures  including many factors beyond the control of the producer 
the reserve data set forth in supplemental information to consolidated financial statements represent only estimates 
reserve engineering is a subjective process of estimating underground accumulations of natural gas  crude oil and condensate and natural gas liquids that cannot be measured in an exact manner 
the accuracy of any reserve estimate is a function of the amount and quality of available data and of engineering and geological interpretation and judgment 
as a result  estimates of different engineers normally vary 
in addition  results of drilling  testing and production subsequent to the date of an estimate may justify revision of such estimate upward or downward 
accordingly  reserve estimates are often different from the quantities ultimately recovered 
the meaningfulness of such estimates is highly dependent upon the accuracy of the assumptions upon which they were based 
for related discussion  see item a 
risk factors 
in general  the rate of production from eog s natural gas and crude oil properties declines as reserves are depleted 
except to the extent eog acquires additional properties containing proved reserves  conducts successful exploration  exploitation and development activities or  through engineering studies  identifies additional behind pipe zones or secondary recovery reserves  the proved reserves of eog will decline as reserves are produced 
volumes generated from future activities of eog are therefore highly dependent upon the level of success in finding or acquiring additional reserves

a rig was contracted to drill two operated wells in the east irish sea in the licenses for the east irish sea were awarded to eog in in july  eog acquired rights from conocophillips in a petroleum contract covering the chuanzhong block exploration area in the sichuan basin  sichuan province  the people s republic of china 
the acquisition includes production of approximately million cubic feet equivalent per day  net  on approximately  acres 
in october  eog obtained the rights to additional zones on the acreage purchased 
eog plans to drill its first horizontal well in eog continues to evaluate other select natural gas and crude oil opportunities outside the united states and canada primarily by pursuing exploitation opportunities in countries where indigenous natural gas and crude oil reserves have been identified 
capital structure one of management s key strategies is to maintain a strong balance sheet with a consistently below average debt to total capitalization ratio as compared to those in eog s peer group 
at december   eog s debt to total capitalization ratio was 
during  eog funded billion in exploration and development and other property  plant and equipment expenditures  paid million in dividends to common and preferred stockholders  repaid million of debt and paid million for the redemption of all remaining shares of its outstanding fixed rate cumulative perpetual senior preferred stock  series b  with a  liquidation preference per share series b  primarily by utilizing cash provided from its operating activities  proceeds from long term debt borrowings and proceeds from the sale of its appalachian assets 
for  eog s budget for exploration and development and other property  plant and equipment expenditures is approximately billion  excluding acquisitions 
united states and canada crude oil and natural gas drilling activity continues to be a key component of these expenditures 
eog intends to manage the capital budget in order to balance expenditures with operating cash flows 
when it fits eog s strategy  eog will make acquisitions that bolster existing drilling programs or offer eog incremental exploration and or production opportunities 
management continues to believe eog has one of the strongest prospect inventories in eog s history 
on september   eog completed its public offering of million aggregate principal amount of senior notes due and million aggregate principal amount of senior notes due collectively  notes 
interest on the notes is payable semi annually in arrears on april and october of each year  beginning april  net proceeds from the offering of approximately million were used for general corporate purposes  including repayment of outstanding commercial paper and borrowings under other uncommitted credit facilities

the primary factors impacting the cost components of per unit rates of lease and well  transportation costs  dd a  g a and net interest expense for as compared to are set forth below 
lease and well expenses include expenses for eog operated properties  as well as expenses billed to eog from other operators where eog is not the operator of a property 
lease and well expenses can be divided into the following categories costs to operate and maintain eog s crude oil and natural gas wells  the cost of workovers  and lease and well administrative expenses 
operating and maintenance expenses include  among other expenses  pumping services  salt water disposal  equipment repair and maintenance  compression expense  lease upkeep and fuel and power 
workovers are costs of operations to restore or maintain production from existing wells 
each of these categories of costs individually fluctuates from time to time as eog attempts to maintain and increase production while maintaining efficient  safe and environmentally responsible operations 
eog continues to increase its operating activities by drilling new wells in existing and new areas 
operating costs within these existing and new areas  as well as the costs of services charged to eog by vendors  fluctuate over time 
lease and well expenses of million in increased million from million in due primarily to higher operating and maintenance expenses million and higher lease and well administrative expenses million  both in the united states 
transportation costs represent costs incurred directly by eog from third party carriers associated with the delivery of hydrocarbon products from the lease to a downstream point of sale 
transportation costs include the cost of compression the cost of compressing natural gas to meet pipeline pressure requirements  dehydration the cost associated with removing water from natural gas to meet pipeline requirements  gathering fees  fuel costs and transportation fees 
transportation costs of million in increased million from million in primarily due to increased production and costs associated with marketing arrangements to transport production from the fort worth basin barnett shale area million and the rocky mountain area million to downstream markets 
dd a of the cost of proved oil and gas properties is calculated using the unit of production method 
eog s dd a rate and expense are the composite of numerous individual field calculations 
there are several factors that can impact eog s composite dd a rate and expense  such as field production profiles  drilling or acquisition of new wells  disposition of existing wells  reserve revisions upward or downward primarily related to well performance and impairments 
changes to these factors may cause eog s composite dd a rate and expense to fluctuate from year to year 
dd a of the cost of other property  plant and equipment is calculated using the straight line depreciation method over the useful lives of the assets 
other property  plant and equipment consist of natural gas gathering and processing facilities  compressors  vehicles  buildings and leasehold improvements  furniture and fixtures  and computer hardware and software

contractual obligations the following table summarizes eog s contractual obligations at december  in thousands contractual obligations total beyond long term debt non cancelable operating leases interest payments on long term debt pipeline transportation service commitments drilling rig commitments seismic purchase obligations other purchase obligations total contractual obligations this table does not include the liability for unrecognized tax benefits  eog s pension or postretirement benefit obligations or liability for dismantlement  abandonment and restoration costs of oil and gas properties see notes  and  respectively  to consolidated financial statements 
amounts shown are based on current pipeline transportation rates and the foreign currency exchange rates used to convert canadian dollars and british pounds into united states dollars at december  management does not believe that any future changes in these rates before the expiration dates of these commitments will have a material adverse effect on the financial condition or results of operations of eog 
amounts shown represent minimum future expenditures for drilling rig services 
eog s expenditures for drilling rig services will exceed such minimum amounts to the extent eog utilizes the drilling rigs subject to a particular contractual commitment for a period greater than the period set forth in the governing contract or if eog utilizes drilling rigs in addition to the drilling rigs subject to the particular contractual commitment for example  pursuant to the exercise of an option to utilize additional drilling rigs provided for in the governing contract 
off balance sheet arrangements eog does not participate in financial transactions that generate relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships 
such entities or partnerships  often referred to as variable interest entities vie or special purpose entities spe  are generally established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other limited purposes 
eog was not involved in any unconsolidated vie or spe financial transactions or any other off balance sheet arrangement as defined in item a ii of regulation s k during any of the periods covered by this report  and currently has no intention of participating in any such transaction or arrangement in the foreseeable future 
foreign currency exchange rate risk during  eog was exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk inherent in its operations in foreign countries  including canada  trinidad  the united kingdom and china 
the foreign currency most significant to eog s operations during was the canadian dollar 
the fluctuation of the canadian dollar in impacted both the revenues and expenses of eog s canadian subsidiaries 
however  since canadian commodity prices are largely correlated to united states prices  the changes in the canadian currency exchange rate have less of an impact on the canadian revenues than the canadian expenses 
eog continues to monitor the foreign currency exchange rates of countries in which it is currently conducting business and may implement measures to protect against the foreign currency exchange rate risk 
effective march   eog entered into a foreign currency swap transaction with multiple banks to eliminate any exchange rate impacts that may result from the notes offered by one of the canadian subsidiaries on the same date see note to consolidated financial statements 
eog accounts for the foreign currency swap transaction using the hedge accounting method  pursuant to the provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  as amended 
under those provisions  as of december   eog recorded the fair value of the swap of million in other liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets 
changes in the fair value of the foreign currency swap resulted in no net impact to net income available to common stockholders on the consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income 
the after tax net impact from the foreign currency swap transaction resulted in a negative change of million for the year ended december  the change is included in accumulated other comprehensive income in the stockholders equity section of the consolidated balance sheets 
outlook pricing 
natural gas prices historically have been volatile  and this volatility is expected to continue 
uncertainty continues to exist as to the direction of future united states and canada natural gas and crude oil price trends  and there remains a rather wide divergence in the opinions held by some in the industry 
being primarily a natural gas producer  eog is more significantly impacted by changes in natural gas prices than by changes in crude oil and condensate and natural gas liquids prices 
however  crude oil and condensate and natural gas liquids comprised a larger portion of eog s product mix in than in prior years and is expected to increase further in longer term natural gas prices will be determined by the supply of and demand for natural gas as well as the prices of competing fuels  such as oil and coal 
the market price of natural gas and crude oil and condensate and natural gas liquids in will impact the amount of cash generated from operat ing activities  which will in turn impact the level of eog s total capital expenditures as well as its production 
including the impact of eog s natural gas hedges  based on eog s tax position and the portion of eog s anticipated natural gas volumes for for which prices have not been determined under long term marketing contracts  eog s price sensitivity for each per mcf change in wellhead natural gas price is approximately million for net income and million for operating cash flow 
eog s price sensitivity in for each per barrel change in wellhead crude oil and condensate price  combined with the related change in natural gas liquids price  is approximately million for net income and million for operating cash flow 
for information regarding eog s natural gas hedge position as of december   see note to consolidated financial statements 
capital 
eog plans to continue to focus a substantial portion of its exploration and development expenditures in its major producing areas in the united states and canada 
in  eog expects to allocate a slightly lower percentage of its domestic exploration and development expenditures to the fort worth basin barnett shale area and the rocky mountain operating area than in eog will also execute a steady drilling program to further develop the british columbia horn river basin 
in order to diversify its overall asset portfolio  eog expects to conduct exploratory activity in other areas outside of the united states and canada and will continue to evaluate the potential for involvement in additional exploitation type opportunities 
budgeted exploration and development expenditures  excluding acquisitions  are approximately  million 
in addition  budgeted expenditures for gathering and processing and other assets are approximately million 
the to tal capital expenditures budget of approximately billion  excluding acquisitions  is structured to maintain the flexibility necessary under eog s strategy of funding its exploration  development  exploitation and acquisition activities primarily from available internally generated cash flow 
the level of total capital expenditures may vary in and will vary in future periods depending on energy market conditions and other related economic factors 
based upon existing economic and market conditions  eog believes net operating cash flow and available financing alternatives in will be sufficient to fund its net investing cash requirements for the year 
however  eog has significant flexibility with respect to its financing alternatives and adjustment of its exploration  exploitation  development and acquisition expenditure plans if circumstances warrant 
while eog has certain continuing commitments associated with expenditure plans related to operations in the united states  canada  trinidad  the united kingdom north sea and china  such commitments are not expected to be material when considered in relation to the total financial capacity of eog 
operations 
eog expects to increase overall production in by over levels based on average natural gas prices of per mcf at henry hub  west texas intermediate crude oil prices of per barrel and a total budget for exploration and development expenditures of  million  excluding acquisitions 
united states production is expected to increase by  with a planned increase in crude oil and condensate and natural gas liquids production of and  respectively 
environmental regulations various foreign  federal  state and local laws and regulations covering the discharge of materials into the environment  or otherwise relating to the protection of the environment  affect eog s operations and costs as a result of their effect on natural gas and crude oil exploration  development and production operations  and could cause eog to incur remediation or other corrective action costs in connection with a release of regulated substances  including crude oil  into the environment 
in addition  eog has acquired certain oil and gas properties from third parties whose actions with respect to the management and disposal or release of hydrocarbons or other wastes were not under eog s control 
under environmental laws and regulations  eog could be required to remove or remediate wastes disposed of or released by prior owners or operators 
in addition  eog could be responsible under environmental laws and regulations for oil and gas properties in which eog owns an interest but is not the operator 
compliance with such laws and regulations increases eog s overall cost of business  but has not had a material adverse effect on eog s operations or financial condition 
it is not anticipated  based on current laws and regulations  that eog will be required in the near future to expend amounts that are material in relation to its total exploration and development expenditure program in order to comply with environmental laws and regulations  but  inasmuch as such laws and regulations are frequently changed  eog is unable to predict the ultimate cost of compliance 
eog also could incur costs related to the cleanup of sites to which it sent regulated substances for disposal or to which it sent equipment for cleaning  and for damages to natural resources or other claims related to releases of regulated substances at such sites 
eog is aware of the increasing focus of local  state  national and international regulatory bodies on greenhouse gas ghg emissions and climate change issues 
we are also aware of legislation proposed by united states lawmakers and the canadian legislature to reduce ghg emissions  as well as ghg emissions regulations enacted by certain of the canadian provinces in which eog operates 
eog will continue to monitor and assess any new policies  legislation or regulations in the areas where we operate to determine the impact on our operations and take appropriate actions  where necessary 
any direct and indirect costs of these regulations may adversely affect eog s business  results of operations and financial condition 
summary of critical accounting policies eog prepares its financial statements and the accompanying notes in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  which requires management to make estimates and assumptions about future events that affect the reported amounts in the financial statements and the accompanying notes 
eog identifies certain accounting policies as critical based on  among other things  their impact on the portrayal of eog s financial condition  results of operations or liquidity  and the degree of difficulty  subjectivity and complexity in their deployment 
critical accounting policies cover accounting matters that are inherently uncertain because the future resolution of such matters is unknown 
management routinely discusses the development  selection and disclosure of each of the critical accounting policies 
following is a discussion of eog s most critical accounting policies proved oil and gas reserves eog s engineers estimate proved oil and gas reserves  which directly impact financial accounting estimates  including depreciation  depletion and amortization 
proved reserves represent estimated quantities of natural gas  crude oil and condensate and natural gas liquids that geological and engineering data demonstrate  with reasonable certainty  to be recoverable in future years from known reservoirs under economic and operating conditions existing at the time the estimates were made 
the process of estimating quantities of proved oil and gas reserves is very complex  requiring significant subjective decisions in the evaluation of all available geological  engineering and economic data for each reservoir 
the data for a given reservoir may also change substantially over time as a result of numerous factors including  but not limited to  additional development activity  evolving production history and continual reassessment of the viability of production under varying economic conditions 
consequently  material revisions upward or downward to existing reserve estimates may occur from time to time 
oil and gas exploration costs eog accounts for its natural gas and crude oil exploration and production activities under the successful efforts method of accounting 
oil and gas exploration costs  other than the costs of drilling exploratory wells  are charged to expense as incurred 
the costs of drilling exploratory wells are capitalized pending determination of whether eog has discovered proved commercial reserves 
exploratory drilling costs are capitalized when drilling is complete if it is determined that there is economic producibility supported by either actual production  a conclusive formation test or by certain technical data if the discovery is located offshore in the gulf of mexico 
if proved commercial reserves are not discovered  such drilling costs are expensed 
in some circumstances  it may be uncertain whether proved commercial reserves have been found when drilling has been completed 
such exploratory well drilling costs may continue to be capitalized if the reserve quantity is sufficient to justify its completion as a producing well and sufficient progress in assessing the reserves and the economic and operating viability of the project is being made 
as of december  and  eog had exploratory drilling costs related to projects that have been deferred for more than one year see note to consolidated financial statements 
these costs meet the accounting requirements outlined above for continued capitalization 
costs to develop proved reserves  including the costs of all development wells and related equipment used in the production of natural gas and crude oil  are capitalized 
impairments oil and gas lease acquisition costs are capitalized when incurred 
unproved properties with individually significant acquisition costs are assessed on a property by property basis  and any impairment in value is recognized 
unproved properties with acquisition costs that are not individually significant are aggregated  and the portion of such costs estimated to be nonproductive  based on historical experience  is amortized over the average holding period 
if the unproved properties are determined to be productive  the appropriate related costs are transferred to proved oil and gas properties 
lease rentals are expensed as incurred 
when circumstances indicate that a producing asset may be impaired  eog compares expected undiscounted future cash flows at a producing field level to the unamortized capitalized cost of the asset 
if the future undiscounted cash flows  based on eog s estimate of future crude oil and natural gas prices  operating costs  anticipated production from proved reserves and other relevant data  are lower than the unamortized capitalized cost  the capitalized cost is reduced to fair value 
fair value is calculated by discounting the future cash flows at an appropriate risk adjusted discount rate 
depreciation  depletion and amortization for oil and gas properties the quantities of estimated proved oil and gas reserves are a significant component of our calculation of depletion expense and revisions in such estimates may alter the rate of future expense 
holding all other factors constant  if reserves were revised upward or downward  earnings would increase or decrease respectively 
depreciation  depletion and amortization of the cost of proved oil and gas properties is calculated using the unit of production method 
the reserve base used to calculate depreciation  depletion and amortization is the sum of proved developed reserves and proved undeveloped reserves for leasehold acquisition costs and the cost to acquire proved properties 
with respect to lease and well equipment costs  which include development costs and successful exploration drilling costs  the reserve base includes only proved developed reserves 
estimated future dismantlement  restoration and abandonment costs  net of salvage values  are taken into account 
certain other assets  including natural gas gathering and processing facilities  are depreciated on a straight line basis over the estimated useful life of the asset 
assets are grouped in accordance with paragraph of sfas no 
 financial accounting and reporting by oil and gas producing companies 
the basis for grouping is a reasonable aggregation of properties with a common geological structural feature or stratigraphic condition  such as a reservoir or field 
amortization rates are updated quarterly to reflect the addition of capital costs  reserve revisions upwards or downwards and additions  property acquisitions and or property dispositions and impairments 
stock based compensation effective january   eog accounts for stock based compensation under the provisions of sfas no 
r  share based payment 
in applying the provisions of sfas no 
r  judgments and estimates are made regarding  among other things  the appropriate valuation methodology to follow in valuing stock compensation awards and the related inputs required by those valuation methodologies 
assumptions regarding expected volatility of eog s common stock  the level of risk free interest rates  expected dividend yields on eog s stock  the expected term of the awards and other valuation inputs are subject to change 
any such changes could result in different valuations and thus impact the amount of stock based compensation expense recognized in the consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income
