introduction our company we are a leading provider of health information services to consumers  physicians and other healthcare professionals  employers and health plans 
we have organized our business into two operating segments as follows online services 
we own and operate both public and private online portals 
our public portals enable consumers to become more informed about healthcare choices and assist them in playing an active role in managing their health 
the public portals also enable physicians and other healthcare professionals to improve their clinical knowledge and practice of medicine  as well as their communication with patients 
our public portals generate revenue primarily through the sale of advertising and sponsorship 
table of contents products  including continuing medical education which we refer to as cme services 
our sponsors and advertisers include pharmaceutical  biotechnology  medical device and consumer products companies 
through our private portals for employers and health plans  we provide information and services that enable employees and members  respectively  to make more informed benefit  treatment and provider decisions 
we also provide related services for use by such employees and members  including lifestyle education and personalized telephonic health coaching 
we generate revenue from our private portals through the licensing of these portals to employers and health plans either directly or through distributors  as well as fees charged for our coaching services 
we also distribute our online content and services to other entities and generate revenue from these arrangements through the sale of advertising and sponsorship products and content syndication fees 
we also provide e detailing promotion and physician recruitment services for use by pharmaceutical  medical device and healthcare companies 
publishing and other services 
we provide several offline products and services webmd the magazine  a consumer targeted publication that we distribute free of charge to physician office waiting rooms  and the little blue book  a physician directory 
we generate revenue from sales of advertisements in webmd the magazine  sales of the little blue book directories and advertisements in those directories 
we also conducted in person medical education from december until december   the date at which we no longer provided this service 
our publishing and other services segment complements our online services segment and extends the reach of our brand and our influence among health involved consumers and clinically active physicians 
background information on certain trends and developments trends influencing the use of our services 
several key trends in the healthcare and internet industries are influencing the use of healthcare information services of the types we provide or are developing 
those trends are described briefly below use of the internet by consumer and physicians 
the internet has emerged as a major communications medium and has already fundamentally changed many sectors of the economy  including the marketing and sales of financial services  travel  and entertainment  among others 
the internet is also changing the healthcare industry and has transformed how consumers and physicians find and utilize healthcare information 
healthcare consumers increasingly seek to educate themselves online about their healthcare related issues  motivated in part by the continued availability of new treatment options and in part by the larger share of healthcare costs they are being asked to bear due to changes in the benefit designs being offered by health plans and employers 
the internet has fundamentally changed the way consumers obtain health and wellness information  enabling them to have immediate access to searchable information and dynamic interactive content to check symptoms  assess risks  understand diseases  find providers and evaluate treatment options 
the internet is consumers fastest growing health information resource  according to a national study released in august by the center for studying health system change 
researchers found that percent of american consumers approximately million adults conducted online health searches in  compared with percent in more than half of those surveyed said the information changed their overall approach to maintaining their health 
four in five said the information helped them better understand how to treat an illness or condition 
the internet has also become a primary source of information for physicians seeking to improve clinical practice and is growing relative to traditional information sources  such as conferences  meetings and offline journals 
increased online marketing and education spending for healthcare products 
pharmaceutical  biotechnology and medical device companies spend large amounts each year marketing their products and educating consumers and physicians about them  however  only a small portion of this amount is currently spent on online services 
we believe that these companies  which comprise the majority of the advertisers and sponsors of our public portals  are becoming increasingly aware of the effectiveness of 
table of contents the internet relative to traditional media in providing health  clinical and product related information to consumers and physicians  and this increasing awareness will result in increasing demand for our services 
however  notwithstanding our general expectation for increased demand  our advertising and sponsorship revenue may vary significantly from quarter to quarter due to a number of factors  many of which are not in our control  and some of which may be difficult to forecast accurately  including general economic conditions and the following the majority of our advertising and sponsorship contracts are for terms of approximately four to twelve months 
we have relatively few longer term advertising and sponsorship contracts 
the time between the date of initial contact with a potential advertiser or sponsor regarding a specific program and the execution of a contract with the advertiser or sponsor for that program may be subject to delays over which we have little or no control  including as a result of budgetary constraints of the advertiser or sponsor or their need for internal approvals 
other factors that may affect the timing of contracting for specific programs with advertisers and sponsors  or receipt of revenue under such contracts  include the timing of fda approval for new products or for new approved uses for existing products  the timing of fda approval of generic products that compete with existing brand name products  the timing of withdrawals of products from the market  seasonal factors relating to the prevalence of specific health conditions and other seasonal factors that may affect the timing of promotional campaigns for specific products  and the scheduling of conferences for physicians and other healthcare professionals 
changes in health plan design  health management initiatives 
in a healthcare market where the responsibility for healthcare costs and decision making has been increasingly shifting to consumers  use of information technology including personal health records to assist consumers in making informed decisions about healthcare has also increased 
we believe that through our webmd health and benefits manager tools  including our personal health record application  we are well positioned to play a role in this environment  and these services will be a significant driver for the growth of our private portals during the next several years 
however  our growth strategy depends  in part  on increasing usage of our private portal services by our employer and health plan clients employees and members  respectively 
increasing usage of our services requires us to continue to deliver and improve the underlying technology and develop new and updated applications  features and services 
in addition  we face competition in the area of healthcare decision support tools and online health management applications and health information services 
many of our competitors have greater financial  technical  product development  marketing and other resources than we do  and may be better known than we are 
we also expect that  for clients and potential clients in the industries most seriously affected by recent adverse changes in general economic conditions including those in the financial services industry  we may experience some reductions in initial contracts  contract expansions and contract renewals for our private portal services  as well as reductions in the size of existing contracts 
the healthcare industry in the united states and relationships among healthcare payers  providers and consumers are very complicated 
in addition  the internet and the market for online services are relatively new and still evolving 
accordingly  there can be no assurance that the trends identified above will continue or that the expected benefits to our businesses from our responses to those trends will be achieved 
in addition  the market for healthcare information services is highly competitive and not only are our existing competitors seeking to benefit from these same trends  but the trends may also attract additional competitors 
certain developments termination of proposed hlth merger 
in february  hlth and webmd entered into an agreement and plan of merger which we refer to as the merger agreement  pursuant to which hlth would merge into webmd which we refer to as the hlth merger  with webmd continuing as the surviving corporation 
pursuant to the terms of a termination agreement entered into on october  which we refer to as the termination agreement  hlth and webmd mutually agreed  in light of the turmoil in financial markets  to terminate the merger agreement 
the termination agreement maintained hlth s obligation  under the terms of the merger agreement  to pay the expenses webmd 
table of contents incurred in connection with the merger 
in connection with the termination of the merger  hlth and webmd amended the tax sharing agreement between them and hlth assigned to webmd the amended and restated data license agreement  dated as of february   among hlth  ebs master llc and certain affiliated companies 
for additional information  see transactions with hlth agreements with hlth below 
impairment of auction rate securities  non recourse credit facility 
we hold investments in auction rate securities which we refer to as ars backed by student loans  which are guaranteed under the federal family education loan program ffelp  and all had credit ratings of aaa or aaa when purchased 
historically  the fair value of our ars investments approximated par value due to the frequent auction periods  generally every to days  which provided liquidity to these investments 
however  since february  virtually all auctions involving these securities have failed 
as a secondary market has yet to develop  these investments have been reclassified to long term investments as of december  the result of a failed auction is that these ars will continue to pay interest in accordance with their terms at each respective auction date  however  liquidity of the securities will be limited until there is a successful auction  the issuer redeems the securities  the securities mature or until such time as other markets for these ars investments develop 
we concluded that the estimated fair value of the ars no longer approximated the par value due to the lack of liquidity 
as of march   we concluded the fair value of our ars was  compared to a face value of  the impairment in value  or  was considered to be other than temporary  and accordingly  was recorded as an impairment charge within the statement of operations during the three months ended march  during  we received  associated with the partial redemption of certain of our ars holdings which represented of their face value 
as a result  as of december   the total face value of our ars holdings was  compared to a fair value of  subsequent to march   through december   we further reduced the carrying value of our ars holdings by  since this reduction in value resulted from fluctuations in interest rate assumptions  we assessed this reduction to be temporary in nature and  accordingly  this amount has been recorded as an unrealized loss in our stockholders equity 
we continue to monitor the market for ars as well as the individual ars investments we own 
we may be required to record additional losses in future periods if the fair value of our ars holdings deteriorates further 
in may  we entered into a non recourse credit facility which we refer to as the credit facility with citigroup that is secured by our ars holdings including  in some circumstances  interest payable on the ars holdings  that will allow us to borrow up to of the face amount of the ars holdings pledged as collateral under the credit facility 
the credit facility is governed by a loan agreement  dated as of may   containing customary representations and warranties of the borrower and certain affirmative covenants and negative covenants relating to the pledged collateral 
under the loan agreement  the borrower and the lender may  in certain circumstances  cause the pledged collateral to be sold  with the proceeds of any such sale required to be applied in full immediately to repayment of amounts borrowed 
no borrowings have been made under the credit facility to date 
borrowings can be made under this credit facility until may the interest rate applicable to such borrowings is one month libor plus basis points 
any borrowings outstanding under the credit facility after march become demand loans  subject to days notice  with recourse only to the pledged collateral 
basis of presentation our company is a delaware corporation that was incorporated on may  we completed an initial public offering which we refer to as the ipo of class a common stock on september  our class a common stock has traded on the nasdaq national market under the symbol wbmd since september  and now trades on the nasdaq global select market 
prior to the date of the ipo  we were a wholly owned subsidiary of hlth and our consolidated financial statements had been derived from the consolidated financial statements and accounting records of hlth  principally representing the webmd segment  using the historical results of operations  and historical basis of assets and liabilities of the webmd related businesses

table of contents currently owns of our equity

table of contents sale of acp medicine and acs surgery 
as of december   we entered into an asset sale agreement and completed the sale of certain assets and certain liabilities of our medical reference publications business  including the publications acp medicine and acs surgery principles and practice 
the assets and liabilities sold are referred to below as the acs acp business 
acp medicine and acs surgery are official publications of the american college of physicians and the american college of surgeons  respectively 
we will receive net cash proceeds of  consisting of  received during and the remaining to be received during we incurred approximately of professional fees and other expenses associated with the sale of the acs acp business 
in connection with the sale  we recognized a loss gain of and  net of tax during the years ended december  and  respectively 
the decision to divest the acs acp business was made because management determined that it was not a good fit with our core business 
seasonality the timing of our revenue is affected by seasonal factors 
advertising and sponsorship revenue within our online services segment is seasonal  primarily due to the annual budget approval process of the advertising and sponsorship clients of our public portals 
this portion of our revenue is usually the lowest in the first quarter of each calendar year  and increases during each consecutive quarter throughout the year 
our private portal licensing revenue is historically higher in the second half of the year as new customers are typically added during this period in conjunction with their annual open enrollment periods for employee benefits 
finally  the annual distribution cycle within our publishing and other services segment results in a significant portion of our revenue in this segment being recognized in the second and third quarter of each calendar year 
the timing of revenue in relation to our expenses  much of which do not vary directly with revenue  has an impact on cost of operations  sales and marketing and general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue in each calendar quarter 
critical accounting policies and estimates our md a is based upon our consolidated financial statements and notes to consolidated financial statements  which were prepared in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles 
the preparation of the consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
we base our estimates on historical experience  current business factors  and various other assumptions that we believe are necessary to consider to form a basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
we are subject to uncertainties such as the impact of future events  economic and political factors  and changes in our business environment  therefore  actual results could differ from these estimates 
accordingly  the accounting estimates used in preparation of our financial statements will change as new events occur  as more experience is acquired  as additional information is obtained and as our operating environment changes 
changes in estimates are made when circumstances warrant 
such changes in estimates and refinements in estimation methodologies are reflected in reported results of operations  if material  the effects of changes in estimates are disclosed in the notes to our consolidated financial statements 
we evaluate our estimates on an ongoing basis  including those related to revenue recognition  the allowance for doubtful accounts  the carrying value of prepaid advertising  the carrying value of long lived assets including goodwill and intangible assets  the carrying value of investments in auction rate securities  the amortization period of long lived assets excluding goodwill  the carrying value  capitalization and amortization of software and web site development costs  the provision for income taxes and related deferred tax accounts  certain accrued expenses and contingencies  share based compensation to employees and transactions with hlth 
we believe the following reflects our critical accounting policies and our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements revenue recognition 
revenue from advertising is recognized as advertisements are delivered or as publications are distributed 
revenue from sponsorship arrangements  content syndication and distribution arrangements  and licenses of healthcare management tools and private portals as well as 
table of contents related health coaching services are recognized ratably over the term of the applicable agreement 
revenue from the sponsorship of cme is recognized over the period we substantially complete our contractual deliverables as determined by the applicable agreements 
when contractual arrangements contain multiple elements  revenue is allocated to each element based on its relative fair value determined using prices charged when elements are sold separately 
in certain instances where fair value does not exist for all the elements  the amount of revenue allocated to the delivered elements equals the total consideration less the fair value of the undelivered elements 
in instances where fair value does not exist for the undelivered elements  revenue is recognized when the last element is delivered 
long lived assets 
our long lived assets consist of property and equipment  goodwill and other intangible assets 
goodwill and other intangible assets arise from the acquisitions we have made 
the amount assigned to intangible assets is subjective and based on our estimates of the future benefit of the intangible assets using accepted valuation techniques  such as discounted cash flow and replacement cost models 
our long lived assets  excluding goodwill  are amortized over their estimated useful lives  which we determine based on the consideration of several factors including the period of time the asset is expected to remain in service 
we evaluate the carrying value and remaining useful lives of long lived assets  excluding goodwill  whenever indicators of impairment are present 
we evaluate the carrying value of goodwill annually  and whenever indicators of impairment are present 
we use a discounted cash flow approach to determine the fair value of goodwill 
there was no impairment of goodwill noted as a result of our impairment testing in  and fair value of investments 
we hold investments in ars which are backed by student loans  which are guaranteed under the federal family education loan program ffelp  and which had credit ratings of aaa or aaa when purchased 
historically  the fair value of our ars investments approximated face value due to the frequent auction periods  generally every to days  which provided liquidity to these investments 
however  since february  all auctions involving these securities have failed 
as a secondary market has yet to develop  these investments have been reclassified to long term investments as of december  the result of a failed auction is that these ars will continue to pay interest in accordance with their terms at each respective auction date  however  liquidity of the securities will be limited until there is a successful auction  the issuer redeems the securities  the securities mature or until such time as other markets for these ars investments develop 
we cannot be certain regarding the amount of time it will take for an auction market or other markets to develop 
accordingly  during the three months ended march   we concluded that the estimated fair value of the ars no longer approximated the face value due to the lack of liquidity and accordingly  we recorded an other than temporary impairment as of march  as of and subsequent to march   we estimate the fair value of our ars investments using an income approach valuation technique 
using this approach  expected future cash flows are calculated over the expected life of each security and are discounted to a single present value using a market required rate of return 
some of the more significant assumptions made in the present value calculations include i the estimated weighted average lives for the loan portfolios underlying each individual ars  which range from to years and ii the required rates of return used to discount the estimated future cash flows over the estimated life of each security  which considered both the credit quality for each individual ars and the market liquidity for these investments 
our ars have been classified as level assets in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards which we refer to as sfas no 
 fair value measurements  as their valuation requires substantial judgment and estimation of factors that are not currently observable in the market due to the lack of trading in the securities 
if different assumptions were used for the various inputs to the valuation approach including  but not limited to  assumptions involving the estimated lives of the ars investments  the estimated cash flows over those estimated lives  and the estimated discount rates applied to those cash flows  the estimated fair value of these investments could be significantly higher or lower than the fair value we determined 
we continue to monitor the market for ars as well as the individual ars investments we own 
we may be required to record additional losses in future periods if the fair value of our ars deteriorates further 

table of contents stock based compensation 
in december  the financial accounting standards board which we refer to as fasb issued sfas no 
 revised share based payment which we refer to as sfas r  which replaces sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation which we refer to as sfas and supersedes apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees 
sfas r requires all share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options  to be recognized as compensation expense over the service period generally the vesting period in the consolidated financial statements based on their fair values 
the fair value of each option granted is estimated on the date of grant using the black scholes option pricing model 
the assumptions used in this model are expected dividend yield  expected volatility  risk free interest rate and expected term 
we elected to use the modified prospective transition method 
under the modified prospective method  awards that were granted or modified on or after january  are measured and accounted for in accordance with sfas r 
unvested stock options and restricted stock awards that were granted prior to january  will continue to be accounted for in accordance with sfas  using the same grant date fair value and same expense attribution method used under sfas  except that all awards are recognized in the results of operations over the remaining vesting periods 
the impact of forfeitures that may occur prior to vesting is also estimated and considered in the amount recognized for all stock based compensation beginning january  as of december   approximately and  of unrecognized stock based compensation expense related to unvested awards net of estimated forfeitures is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of approximately years and years  related to the hlth and webmd stock based compensation plans  respectively 
deferred tax assets 
our deferred tax assets are comprised primarily of net operating loss which we refer to as nol carryforwards on a separate return basis 
subject to certain limitations  these loss carryforwards may be used to offset taxable income in future periods  reducing the amount of taxes we might otherwise be required to pay 
a significant portion of our deferred tax assets are reserved for through a valuation allowance 
in determining the need for a valuation allowance  management determined the probability of realizing deferred tax assets  taking into consideration factors including historical operating results  expectations of future earnings and taxable income 
management will continue to evaluate the need for a valuation allowance and  in the future should management determine that realization of the net deferred tax asset is more likely than not  some or all of the remaining valuation allowance will be reversed  and our effective tax rate may be reduced by such reversal 
transactions with hlth 
as discussed further below  our expenses reflect a services fee for an allocation of costs for corporate services provided by hlth 
our expenses also reflect the allocation of a portion of the cost of hlth s healthcare plans and the allocation of stock based compensation expense related to hlth restricted stock awards and hlth stock options held by our employees 
additionally  our revenue includes revenue from hlth for services we provide 
transactions with hlth agreements with hlth in connection with our ipo in september  we entered into a number of agreements with hlth governing the future relationship of the companies  including a services agreement  a tax sharing agreement and an indemnity agreement 
these agreements cover a variety of matters  including responsibility for certain liabilities  including tax liabilities  as well as matters related to hlth providing us with administrative services  such as payroll  tax  employee benefit plan  employee insurance  intellectual property  legal and information processing services 
on february   the tax sharing agreement was amended to provide that hlth would compensate us for any use of our nol carryforwards resulting from certain extraordinary transactions  as defined in the tax sharing agreement 
on september   hlth completed the sale of its emdeon practice services business eps for approximately  in cash eps sale 
on november   hlth completed the sale of a interest in its emdeon business services business ebs for approximately  in cash ebs sale 
hlth recognized a taxable gain on the sale of eps and 
table of contents ebs and utilized a portion of its federal nol carryforwards to offset the gain on these transactions 
under the tax sharing agreement between hlth and us  we were reimbursed for our nol carryforwards utilized by hlth in these transactions at the current federal statutory rate of 
during  hlth reimbursed us  attributable to the portion of our nol utilized by hlth as a result of the eps sale and the ebs sale 
the reimbursement was recorded as a capital contribution which increased additional paid in capital 
in connection with the termination of the merger between hlth and us on october   the tax sharing agreement was further amended to provide that  for tax years beginning after december   hlth is no longer required to reimburse us for use of nol carryforwards attributable to us that may result from extraordinary transactions by hlth 
see introduction background information on certain trends and developments termination of proposed hlth merger for a description of the termination of the proposed hlth merger 
the tax sharing agreement has not  other than with respect to certain extraordinary transactions by hlth  required either hlth or us to reimburse the other party for any net tax savings realized by the consolidated group as a result of the group s utilization of our or hlth s nol carryforwards during the period of consolidation  and that will continue following the amendment 
accordingly  hlth will not be required to reimburse us for use of nol carryforwards attributable to us in connection with a hlth s sale in february of its minority interest in ebs to an affiliate of general atlantic llc and investment funds managed by hellman friedman llc for a sale price of  in cash or b hlth s sale in july of its vips segment to an affiliate of general dynamics corporation for approximately  in cash

based on our plans and expectations as of the date of this annual report and taking into consideration issues relating to the liquidity of our ars investments  we believe that our available cash resources and future cash flow from operations  will provide sufficient cash resources to meet the commitments described above and to fund our currently anticipated working capital and capital expenditure requirements for up to twenty four months 
our future liquidity and capital requirements will depend upon numerous factors  including retention of customers at current volume and revenue levels  our existing and new application and service offerings  competing technological and market developments  and potential future acquisitions

if required  we may raise such additional funds through public or private debt or equity financing  strategic relationships or other arrangements 
we cannot assure you that such financing will be available on acceptable terms  if at all  or that such financing will not be dilutive to our stockholders 
future indebtedness may impose various restrictions and covenants on us that could limit our ability to respond to market conditions  to provide for unanticipated capital investments or to take advantage of business opportunities

this fsp amends the factors that should be considered in developing renewal or extension assumptions used to determine the useful life of a recognized intangible asset under sfas no

revised  business combinations  and other us generally accepted accounting principles 
this fsp is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after december   and interim periods within those fiscal years

in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
revised  business combinations which we refer to as sfas r  a replacement of sfas no 
sfas r is effective for fiscal years beginning on or after december  and applies to all business combinations 
sfas r provides that  upon initially obtaining control  an acquirer shall recognize percent of the fair values of acquired assets  including goodwill  and assumed liabilities  with only limited exceptions  even if the acquirer has not acquired percent of its target 
as a consequence  the current step acquisition model will be eliminated 
additionally  sfas r changes current practice  in part  as follows contingent consideration arrangements will be fair valued at the acquisition date and included on that basis in the purchase price consideration  transaction costs will be expensed as incurred  rather than capitalized as part of the purchase price  pre acquisition contingencies  such as legal issues  will generally have to be accounted for in purchase accounting at fair value  and in order to accrue for a restructuring plan in purchase accounting  the requirements in sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities  would have to be met at the acquisition date 
while there is no expected impact to our consolidated financial statements on the accounting for acquisitions completed prior to december   the adoption of sfas r on january  could materially change the accounting for business combinations consummated subsequent to that date and for tax matters relating to prior acquisitions settled subsequent to december  item a

however  the fair values of our cash and money market investments  which approximate million at december   are not subject to changes in interest rates 
we have entered into a non recourse credit facility credit facility with citigroup that is secured by our ars holdings including  in some circumstances  interest payable on the ars holdings  that will allow us to borrow up to of the face amount of the ars holdings pledged as collateral under the credit facility
