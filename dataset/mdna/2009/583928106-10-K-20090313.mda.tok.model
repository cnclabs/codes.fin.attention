item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the information contained in this section should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto for the years ended december    and in addition  this section contains forward looking statements 
these forward looking statements are subject to the inherent uncertainties in predicting future results and conditions 
certain factors that could cause actual results and conditions to differ materially from those projected in these forward looking statements are described in the risk factors section on page critical accounting policies the sec has recently issued cautionary advice regarding disclosure about critical accounting policies 
the sec defines critical accounting policies as those that are both most important to the portrayal of a company s financial condition and results  and that require management s most difficult  subjective  or complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about matters that are inherently uncertain and may change materially in subsequent periods 
the preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires estimates and assumptions that affect amounts reported and disclosed in the financial statements and related notes 
significant estimates made by us include valuation of loans  evaluation of the recoverability of accounts receivable and income tax assets  and the assessment of litigation and other contingencies 
the matters that give rise to such provisions are inherently uncertain and may require complex and subjective judgments 
although we believe that estimates and assumptions used in determining the recorded amounts of net assets and liabilities at december  are reasonable  actual results could differ materially from the estimated amounts recorded in our financial statements 

table of contents change in reporting entity since medallion bank commenced operations in december  we had historically consolidated medallion bank s financial statements with those of our own 
although medallion bank is not an investment company  and sec rules generally do not permit investment companies such as ours to consolidate the financial statements of non investment companies  such as medallion bank  we had sought and obtained a letter from the sec in march permitting such consolidation 
we believed that consolidating medallion bank provided a more complete and accurate representation of our full scope of operations  and our complete financial position and results of operations 
during august  we filed a registration statement on form n which the sec staff reviewed and on which they provided comments  including those relating to the consolidation of the accounts of medallion bank which have evolved since based on discussion with the sec staff  we determined during the fourth quarter to voluntarily not consolidate medallion bank and present medallion bank as a portfolio company 
we determined that this change represents a change in the reporting entity as described in sfas no 
 accounting changes and error corrections 
accordingly we retrospectively applied this change to the financial statements of all prior periods presented  including previously issued interim periods presented  included in our form k 
the effect of this retrospective application was to present our financial position and results of operations as if medallion bank had not been consolidated for all periods presented and to present medallion bank as an unconsolidated portfolio investment 
although this created changes in the reported levels of assets  liabilities  revenues  and expenses  our net increase in net assets resulting from operations  shareholders equity  and the related amounts per common share were unchanged 
general we are a specialty finance company that has a leading position in originating  acquiring  and servicing loans that finance taxicab medallions and various types of commercial businesses 
a wholly owned portfolio company of ours  medallion bank  also originates consumer loans for the purchase of recreational vehicles  boats  motorcycles  and trailers 
since  the year in which we became a public company  we have increased our taxicab medallion loan portfolio at a compound annual growth rate of  and our commercial loan portfolio at a compound annual growth rate of and on a managed basis when combined with medallion bank 
since medallion bank acquired a consumer loan portfolio and began originating consumer loans in  it has increased its consumer loan portfolio at a compound annual growth rate of 
total assets under our management  which includes assets serviced for third party investors and managed by unconsolidated portfolio companies  were  as of december  and  at december   and have grown at a compound annual growth rate of from  at the end of our loan related earnings depend primarily on our level of net interest income 
net interest income is the difference between the total yield on our loan portfolio and the average cost of borrowed funds 
we fund our operations through a wide variety of interest bearing sources  such as revolving bank facilities  bank certificates of deposit issued to customers  debentures issued to and guaranteed by the sba  and bank term debt 
net interest income fluctuates with changes in the yield on our loan portfolio and changes in the cost of borrowed funds  as well as changes in the amount of interest bearing assets and interest bearing liabilities held by us 
net interest income is also affected by economic  regulatory  and competitive factors that influence interest rates  loan demand  and the availability of funding to finance our lending activities 
we  like other financial institutions  are subject to interest rate risk to the degree that our interest earning assets reprice on a different basis than our interest bearing liabilities 
we also provide debt  mezzanine  and equity investment capital to companies in a variety of industries  consistent with our investment objectives 
these investments may be venture capital style investments which may not be fully collateralized 
medallion capital s investments are typically in the form of secured debt instruments with fixed interest rates accompanied by warrants to purchase an equity interest for a nominal exercise price such warrants are included in equity investments on the consolidated balance sheets 
interest income is earned on the debt instruments 
we are a closed end  non diversified management investment company under the act 
we have elected to be treated as a business development company under the act 
we have also elected to be treated for federal income tax purposes as a ric under subchapter m of the code 
as a ric  we generally do not have to pay corporate level federal income taxes on any net ordinary income or capital gains that we distribute to our shareholders as dividends if we meet certain source of income and asset diversification requirements 
medallion bank is not a ric and must pay corporate level federal income taxes 
our wholly owned portfolio company  medallion bank  is a bank regulated by the fdic and the utah department of financial institutions which originates taxicab medallion  commercial  and consumer loans  raises deposits  and conducts other banking activities 
medallion bank generally provides us with our lowest cost of funds which it raises through bank certificates of deposits issued to its customers 
to take advantage of this low cost of funds  we refer a portion of our taxicab medallion and commercial loans to medallion bank  which then originates these loans  which are serviced by us 
we earn referral and servicing fees for these activities 

table of contents realized gains or losses on investments are recognized when the investments are sold or written off 
the realized gains or losses represent the difference between the proceeds received from the disposition of portfolio assets  if any  and the cost of such portfolio assets 
in addition  changes in unrealized appreciation or depreciation of investments are recorded and represent the net change in the estimated fair values of the portfolio assets at the end of the period as compared with their estimated fair values at the beginning of the period 
generally  realized gains losses on investments and changes in unrealized appreciation depreciation on investments are inversely related 
when an appreciated asset is sold to realize a gain  a decrease in the previously recorded unrealized appreciation occurs 
conversely  when a loss previously recorded as unrealized depreciation is realized by the sale or other disposition of a depreciated portfolio asset  the reclassification of the loss from unrealized to realized causes a decrease in net unrealized depreciation and an increase in realized loss 
our investment in medallion bank  as a wholly owned portfolio investment  is also subject to quarterly assessments of fair value 
we conduct a thorough valuation analysis as described previously  and determine whether any factors give rise to a valuation different than recorded book value  including various regulatory restrictions that were established at medallion bank s inception  by the fdic and state of utah  and also by additional marketplace restrictions  such as the ability to transfer industrial bank charters 
as a result of this valuation process  we used medallion bank s actual results of operations as the best estimate of changes in fair value  and recorded the results as a component of unrealized appreciation depreciation on investments  although changes in these restrictions and other applicable factors could change these conclusions in the future 
the credit markets are undergoing a crisis which has disrupted a wide range of traditional financing sources 
the crisis has made it increasingly difficult and significantly more expensive through higher credit spreads for finance companies to obtain and renew financing 
continued turmoil in the credit markets could limit our access to funds and restrict us from continuing our current operating strategy or implementing new operating strategies 
if funds are available to us  we anticipate that our cost of funds will increase as we obtain new financing 
the credit crisis has also caused many financial institutions to record significant write downs  mostly on their residential mortgage related assets and structured investment vehicles and due to unsound lending practices 
we are not involved in these types of transactions and always understand the importance of proper underwriting 
nonetheless  the judgments used by management in applying the critical accounting policies discussed herein may be affected by a further and prolonged deterioration in the economic environment  which may result in changes to future financial results 
subsequent evaluations of our loan portfolio and other investments  in light of the factors then prevailing  may result in changes to the fair value of the investments  including a decrease in the fair value 
in addition  the fair value of investments in our portfolio may be negatively impacted by illiquidity or dislocation in marketplaces resulting in depressed market prices 

table of contents trends in investment portfolio our investment income is driven by the principal amount of and yields on our investment portfolio 
to identify trends in the balances and yields  the following table illustrates our investments at fair value  grouped by medallion loans  commercial loans  equity investments  and investment securities  and also presents the portfolio information for medallion bank  at the dates indicated

table of contents portfolio summary total portfolio yield the weighted average yield of the total portfolio at december  was for the loan portfolio  a decrease of basis points from at december   which was an increase of basis points from at december  the weighted average yield of the total managed portfolio at december  was for the loan portfolio  a decrease of basis points from at december   which was an increase of basis points from at december  the decrease from reflected the general market condition of falling interest rates  partially offset by changes in the portfolio composition towards higher yielding commercial and equity investments 
the increase from primarily reflected the market increase in interest rates  partially offset by a higher proportion of lower yielding medallion loans 
medallion loan portfolio our medallion loans comprised of the net portfolio of  at december   compared to of  at december  and of  at december  our managed medallion loans of  comprised of the net portfolio of  at december   compared to of  at december  and of  at december  the medallion loan portfolio decreased by  or in  or on a managed basis  primarily reflecting decreases in new york  chicago and boston 
the decrease in the new york market can be attributed to loan payoffs and the sale of participation interests to third parties 
total medallion loans serviced for third parties were   and  at december    and the weighted average yield of the medallion loan portfolio at december  was  a decrease of basis points from at december   which was an increase of basis points from at december  the weighted average yield of the managed medallion loan portfolio at december  was  a decrease of basis points from at december   which was an increase of basis points from at december  the change in yield primarily reflected the impact of changes in interest rates in the economy which rose from into and then fell sharply 
at december   of the medallion loan portfolio represented loans outside new york  compared to and at year end and at december   of the managed medallion loan portfolio represented loans outside new york  compared to and at year end and we continue to focus our efforts on originating higher yielding medallion loans outside the new york market 
commercial loan portfolio our commercial loans represented of the net investment portfolio as of december   compared to and at december  and  and were   and on a managed basis 
commercial loans decreased by  or during decreased by  or on a managed basis  primarily reflecting loan participations sold 
net commercial loans serviced by third parties were  at december  and  at december   compared to loans serviced for third parties of  at december  the weighted average yield of the commercial loan portfolio at december  was  a decrease of basis points from at december   which was down basis points from at december  the weighted average yield of the managed commercial loan portfolio at december  was  a decrease of basis points from at december   which was down basis points from at december  the decrease in the managed portfolio reflected the greater proportion of floating rate loans  compared to the owned portfolio with a larger concentration of high yield  fixed rate loans 
we continue to originate adjustable rate and floating rate loans tied to the prime rate 
at december   variable rate loans represented approximately of the commercial portfolio  compared to and at december  and  and were   and on a managed basis 
although this strategy initially produces a lower yield  we believe that this strategy mitigates interest rate risk by better matching our earning assets to their adjustable rate funding sources 

table of contents consumer loan portfolios our managed consumer loans  all of which are held in the portfolio managed by medallion bank  represented of the managed net investment portfolio as of december   compared to at december  and at december  medallion bank started originating new adjustable rate consumer loans during the third quarter 
recreational vehicles  boats  and trailers located in all states collateralize the loans 
the portfolio is serviced by a third party subsidiary of a major commercial bank 
the weighted average gross yield of the managed consumer loan portfolio was at december   compared to and at december  and amortization of the portfolio purchase premium reduced the yield by an average of   and in   and adjustable rate loans represented approximately of the managed consumer portfolio compared to and at december  and delinquency and loan loss experience we generally follow a practice of discontinuing the accrual of interest income on our loans that are in arrears as to interest payments for a period of days or more 
we deliver a default notice and begin foreclosure and liquidation proceedings when management determines that pursuit of these remedies is the most appropriate course of action under the circumstances 
a loan is considered to be delinquent if the borrower fails to make a payment on time  however  during the course of discussion on delinquent status  we may agree to modify the payment terms of the loan with a borrower that cannot make payments in accordance with the original loan agreement 
for loan modifications  the loan will only be returned to accrual status if all past due interest payments are brought fully current 
for credit that is collateral based  we evaluate the anticipated net residual value we would receive upon foreclosure of such loans  if necessary 
there can be no assurance  however  that the collateral securing these loans will be adequate in the event of foreclosure 
for credit that is cash flow based  we assess our collateral position  and evaluate most of these relationships as ongoing businesses  expecting to locate and install a new operator to run the business and reduce the debt 
for the consumer loan portfolio  the process to repossess the collateral is started at days past due 
if the collateral is not located and the account reaches days delinquent  the account is charged off to realized losses 
if the collateral is repossessed  a realized loss is recorded to write the collateral down to of its net realizable value  and the collateral is sent to auction 
when the collateral is sold  the net auction proceeds are applied to the account  and any remaining balance is written off as a realized loss  and any excess proceeds are recorded as a realized gain 
proceeds collected on charged off accounts are recorded as realized gains 
all collection  repossession  and recovery efforts are handled on behalf of medallion bank by the servicer 
the following table shows the trend in loans days or more past due as of december  dollars in thousands amount amount amount medallion loans commercial loans secured mezzanine asset based receivable other secured commercial total commercial loans total loans days or more past due total medallion bank loans total managed loans days or more past due percentages are calculated against the total or managed loan portfolio  as appropriate 
in general  collection efforts since the establishment of our collection department have substantially contributed to the sizable reduction in overall delinquencies of medallion and other secured commercial loans 
medallion delinquencies decreased as a result of a renegotiation and paydowns with a past due relationship 
delinquencies in secured mezzanine financing  mostly in recreational and consumer discretionary services  increased over due to the current state of the economy 
for the same reasons  medallion bank also experienced higher consumer delinquencies due to bankruptcies and job losses 
we are actively working with each delinquent borrower to bring them current  and believe that any potential loss exposure is reflected in our mark to market estimates on each loan 
although there can be no assurances as to changes in the trend rate and further negative changes in the economy  management believes that any loss exposures are properly reflected in reported asset values 

table of contents we monitor delinquent loans for possible exposure to loss by analyzing various factors  including the value of the collateral securing the loan and the borrower s prior payment history 
under the act  our loan portfolio must be recorded at fair value or marked to market 
unlike other lending institutions  we are not permitted to establish reserves for loan losses 
instead  the valuation of our portfolio is adjusted quarterly to reflect our estimate of the current realizable value of our loan portfolio 
since no ready market exists for this portfolio  fair value is subject to the good faith determination of management and the approval of our board of directors 
because of the subjectivity of these estimates  there can be no assurance that in the event of a foreclosure or the sale of portfolio loans we would be able to recover the amounts reflected on our balance sheet 
in determining the value of our portfolio  management and the board of directors may take into consideration various factors such as the financial condition of the borrower and the adequacy of the collateral 
for example  in a period of sustained increases in market interest rates  management and the board of directors could decrease its valuation of the portfolio if the portfolio consists primarily of long term  fixed rate loans 
our valuation procedures are designed to generate values that approximate that which would have been established by market forces  and are therefore subject to uncertainties and variations from reported results 
based upon these factors  net unrealized appreciation or depreciation on investments is determined  or the amount by which our estimate of the current realizable value of our portfolio is above or below our cost basis

we are currently in discussions with the irs to obtain llc tax treatment for medallion bank  which would provide pass through taxation for our shareholders  and which has already been agreed to by the state of utah 
we cannot assure you that we will be successful in our efforts  but if we are successful  this treatment would reduce taxes and increase the reported net income of medallion bank 
in addition  to facilitate maintenance of medallion bank s capital ratio requirement and to provide the necessary capital for continued growth  the company periodically makes capital contributions to medallion bank  including an aggregate of  contributed over various months in and an aggregate of  contributed similarly in separately  medallion bank paid 
table of contents dividends to the company of  in and  in without the capital infusions by the company  a portion of the medallion bank dividends would have been retained to ensure medallion bank met its capital ratio requirements  and in such circumstance  if the company maintained its dividend at the existing levels  a portion of those dividends would have represented a tax free return of capital 
see note of the consolidated financial statements for additional information about these investments 
equity investments equity investments were   and of our total portfolio at december    and equity investments were less than   and of our total managed portfolio at december    and equity investments are comprised of common stock  partnership interests  and warrants 
the decreases in equity investments primarily reflected the sale of shares of common stock of clear channel that were received in a tax free exchange for of our ownership interest in medallion taxi media 
investment securities investment securities were   and of our total portfolio at december    and investment securities were   and of our total managed portfolio at december    and the investment securities are primarily us treasuries and or adjustable rate mortgage backed securities purchased by medallion bank to better utilize required cash liquidity 
trend in interest expense our interest expense is driven by the interest rates payable on our short term credit facilities with banks  bank certificates of deposit  fixed rate  long term debentures issued to the sba  and other short term notes payable 
the establishment of the merrill lynch commercial financial corp line of credit in september fully paid off in december  and its favorable subsequent renegotiations had the effect of substantially reducing our cost of funds 
most recently  we established additional medallion lending relationships with dz bank in december  and with citibank in december that provide for future growth in the portfolio at generally lower rates than under prior facilities 
in addition  medallion bank began raising brokered bank certificates of deposit during  which were at our lowest borrowing costs 
as a result of medallion bank raising funds through certificates of deposits as previously noted  we were able to realign the ownership of some of our medallion loans and related assets to medallion bank allowing us and our subsidiaries to use cash generated through these transactions to retire debt with higher interest rates 
in addition  medallion bank is able to bid on these deposits at a wide variety of maturity levels which allows for improved interest rate management strategies 
our cost of funds is primarily driven by the rates paid on our various debt instruments and their relative mix  and changes in the levels of average borrowings outstanding 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for details on the terms of all outstanding debt 
our debentures issued to the sba typically have terms of ten years 

table of contents we measure our borrowing costs as our aggregate interest expense for all of our interest bearing liabilities divided by the average amount of such liabilities outstanding during the period 
the following table shows the average borrowings and related borrowing costs for the years ended december    and average balances have generally increased  primarily reflecting the funding needs to support the growth in our investment portfolios  although the decline in the revolving lines of credit reflect loan participations sold during the year 
the increase in borrowing costs reflected the trend of increasing interest rates in the economy

sba financing subjects its recipients to limits on the amount of secured bank debt they may incur 
we use sba funding to fund loans that qualify under small business investment act sbia and sba regulations 
we believe that financing operations primarily with short term floating rate secured bank debt has generally decreased our interest expense  but has also increased our exposure to the risk of increases in market interest rates  which we mitigate with certain interest rate strategies 
at december    and  short term floating rate debt constituted   and of total debt  and was   and on a fully managed basis including the borrowings of medallion bank 
factors affecting net assets factors that affect our net assets include net realized gain or loss on investments and change in net unrealized appreciation or depreciation on investments 
net realized gain or loss on investments is the difference between the proceeds derived upon sale or foreclosure of a loan or an equity investment and the cost basis of such loan or equity investment 
change in net unrealized appreciation or depreciation on investments is the amount  if any  by which our estimate of the fair value of our investment portfolio is above or below the previously established fair value or the cost basis of the portfolio 
under the act and the sbia  our loan portfolio and other investments must be recorded at fair value 
unlike certain lending institutions  we are not permitted to establish reserves for loan losses  but adjust quarterly the valuation of the loan portfolio to reflect our estimate of the current value of the total loan portfolio 
since no ready market exists for our loans  fair value is subject to our good faith determination 
in determining such fair value  we and our board of directors consider factors such as the financial condition of its borrowers and the adequacy of their collateral 
any change in the fair value of portfolio loans or other investments as determined by us is reflected in net unrealized depreciation or appreciation of investments and affects net increase in net assets resulting from operations but has no impact on net investment income or distributable income 

table of contents our investment in medallion bank  as a wholly owned portfolio investment  is also subject to quarterly assessments of fair value 
we conduct a thorough valuation analysis as described previously  and determine whether any factors give rise to valuation different than recorded book value  including various regulatory restrictions that were established at medallion bank s inception  by the fdic and state of utah  and also by additional marketplace restrictions  such as the ability to transfer industrial bank charters 
as a result of this valuation process  we used medallion bank s actual results of operations as the best estimate of changes in fair value  and recorded the results as a component of unrealized appreciation depreciation on investments  although changes in these restrictions and other applicable factors could change these conclusions in the future

asset liability management interest rate sensitivity we  like other financial institutions  are subject to interest rate risk to the extent that our interest earning assets consisting of medallion  commercial  and consumer loans  and investment securities reprice on a different basis over time in comparison to our interest bearing liabilities consisting primarily of credit facilities with banks and other lenders  bank certificates of deposit  and subordinated sba debentures 
having interest bearing liabilities that mature or reprice more frequently on average than assets may be beneficial in times of declining interest rates  although such an asset liability structure may result in declining net earnings during periods of rising interest rates 
abrupt increases in market rates of interest may have an adverse impact on our earnings until we are able to originate new loans at the higher prevailing interest rates 
conversely  having interest earning assets that mature or reprice more frequently on average 
table of contents than liabilities may be beneficial in times of rising interest rates  although this asset liability structure may result in declining net earnings during periods of falling interest rates 
this mismatch between maturities and interest rate sensitivities of our interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities results in interest rate risk 
the effect of changes in interest rates is mitigated by regular turnover of the portfolio 
based on past experience  we anticipate that approximately of the taxicab medallion portfolio will mature or be prepaid each year 
we believe that the average life of our loan portfolio varies to some extent as a function of changes in interest rates 
borrowers are more likely to exercise prepayment rights in a decreasing interest rate environment because the interest rate payable on the borrower s loan is high relative to prevailing interest rates 
conversely  borrowers are less likely to prepay in a rising interest rate environment 
however  borrowers may prepay for a variety of other reasons  such as to monetize increases in the underlying collateral values  particularly in the medallion loan portfolio 
in addition  we manage our exposure to increases in market rates of interest by incurring fixed rate indebtedness  such as ten year subordinated sba debentures  and by setting repricing intervals or the maturities of tranches drawn under the revolving lines of credit or issued as certificates of deposit  for terms of up to five years 
we had outstanding sba debentures of  with a weighted average interest rate of  constituting of our total indebtedness as of december  also  as of december   portions of the adjustable rate debt with banks repriced at intervals of as long as months  and certain of the certificates of deposit were for terms of up to months  further mitigating the immediate impact of changes in market interest rates 
a relative measure of interest rate risk can be derived from our interest rate sensitivity gap 
the interest rate sensitivity gap represents the difference between interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities  which mature and or reprice within specified intervals of time 
the gap is considered to be positive when repriceable assets exceed repriceable liabilities  and negative when repriceable liabilities exceed repriceable assets 
a relative measure of interest rate sensitivity is provided by the cumulative difference between interest sensitive assets and interest sensitive liabilities for a given time interval expressed as a percentage of total assets 
the following table presents our interest rate sensitivity gap at december   compared to the respective positions at the end of and the principal amount of interest earning assets are assigned to the time frames in which such principal amounts are contractually obligated to be repriced 
we have not reflected an assumed annual prepayment rate for such assets in this table

adjusted for the medallion loan prepayment assumption results in a cumulative one year negative interest rate gap and related ratio of  or for december   compared to a negative rate gap of  or and  or for december  and  respectively  and was  or   or  and  or on a combined basis with medallion bank 

table of contents our interest rate sensitive assets were  and interest rate sensitive liabilities were  at december  the one year cumulative interest rate gap was a negative  or of interest rate sensitive assets  compared to a negative  or at december  and  or at december  however  using our estimated prepayment refinancing rate for medallion loans to adjust the interest rate gap resulted in a negative gap of  or at december  we seek to manage interest rate risk by originating adjustable rate loans  by incurring fixed rate indebtedness  by evaluating appropriate derivatives  pursuing securitization opportunities  and by other options consistent with managing interest rate risk 
on a combined basis with medallion bank  our interest rate sensitive assets were approximately  and interest rate sensitive liabilities were  at december  the one year cumulative interest rate gap was a negative  or of interest rate sensitive assets  compared to a negative  or and  or at december  and using our estimated prepayment refinancing rate for medallion loans to adjust the interest rate gap resulted in a negative gap of  or at december  interest rate cap agreements from time to time  we enter into interest rate cap agreements to manage the exposure of the portfolio to increases in market interest rates by hedging a portion of our variable rate debt against increases in interest rates 
there were no interest rate caps outstanding during  and liquidity and capital resources our sources of liquidity are the revolving lines of credit with citibank and dz bank  unfunded commitments from the sba for long term debentures that are issued to or guaranteed by the sba  loan amortization and prepayments  private issuances of debt securities  and participations or sales of loans to third parties 
as a ric  we are required to distribute at least of our investment company taxable income  consequently  we have primarily relied upon external sources of funds to finance growth 
trust ii s  line with citibank had availability of  as of december   and the trust iii s  revolving line of credit with dz bank has  availability 
medallion capital has  of additional funding commitments with the sba  which requires capital contributions from us of up to  since sba financing subjects its recipients to certain regulations  we will seek funding at the subsidiary level to maximize its benefits 
lastly   was available under revolving credit agreements with commercial banks  and approximately  was available under the company s margin loans 
additionally  medallion bank  our wholly owned  unconsolidated portfolio company has access to independent sources of funds for our business originated there  primarily through brokered certificates of deposit 
medallion bank also has  available under fed funds lines with several commercial banks 
in addition  medallion bank  as a non ric subsidiary of ours  is allowed to retain all earnings in the business to fund future growth

unlike certain lending institutions  we are not permitted to establish reserves for loan losses 
instead  we must value each individual investment and portfolio loan on a quarterly basis 
we record unrealized depreciation on investments and loans when we believe that an asset has been impaired and full collection is unlikely 
we record unrealized appreciation on equities if we have a clear indication that the underlying portfolio company has appreciated in value and  therefore  our equity investment has also appreciated in value 
without a readily ascertainable market value  the estimated value of our portfolio of investments and loans may differ significantly from the values that would be placed on the portfolio if there existed a ready market for the investments 
we adjust the valuation of the portfolio quarterly to reflect management s estimate of the current fair value of each investment in the portfolio 
any changes in estimated fair value are recorded in our statement of operations as net unrealized appreciation depreciation on investments 
our investment in medallion bank  as a wholly owned portfolio investment  is also subject to quarterly assessments of its fair value 
we conduct a thorough valuation analysis as described previously  and determine whether any factors give rise to valuation different than recorded book value 
as a result of this valuation process  we used medallion bank s actual results of operations as the best estimate of changes in fair value  and recorded the result as a component of unrealized appreciation depreciation on investments  although changes in these restrictions and other applicable factors could change these conclusions in the future 
in addition  the illiquidity of our loan portfolio and investments may adversely affect our ability to dispose of loans at times when it may be advantageous for us to liquidate such portfolio or investments 
in addition  if we were required to liquidate some or all of the investments in the portfolio  the proceeds of such liquidation may be significantly less than the current value of such investments 
because we borrow money to make loans and investments  our net operating income is dependent upon the difference between the rate at which we borrow funds and the rate at which we invest these funds 
as a result  there can be no assurance that a significant change in market interest rates will not have a material adverse effect on our interest income 
in periods of sharply rising interest rates  our cost of funds would increase  which would reduce our net operating income before net realized and unrealized gains 
we use a combination of long term and short term borrowings and equity capital to finance our investing activities 
our long term fixed rate investments are financed primarily with short term floating rate debt  and to a lesser extent by term fixed rate debt 
we may use interest rate risk management techniques in an effort to limit our exposure to interest rate fluctuations 
such techniques may include various interest rate hedging activities to the extent permitted by the act 
we have analyzed the potential impact of changes in interest rates on net interest income 
assuming that the balance sheet were to remain constant and no actions were taken to alter the existing interest rate sensitivity  and including the impact on medallion bank  a hypothetical immediate increase in interest rates would have negatively impacted net increase in net assets resulting from operations as of december  by approximately  on an annualized basis  compared to a positive impact of  at december   and the impact of such an immediate increase of over a one year period would have been  at december   compared to  for december  although management believes that this measure is indicative of our sensitivity to interest rate changes  it does not adjust for potential changes in credit quality  size  and composition of the assets on the balance sheet  and other business developments that could affect net increase in net assets resulting from operations in a particular quarter or for the year taken as a whole 
accordingly  no assurances can be given that actual results would not differ materially from the potential outcome simulated by these estimates 
we continue to work with investment banking firms and other financial intermediaries to investigate the viability of a number of other financing options which include  among others  the sale or spin off certain assets or divisions  the development of a securitization conduit program  and other independent financing for certain subsidiaries or asset classes 
these financing options would also provide additional sources of funds for both external expansion and continuation of internal growth

prepayments on loans are influenced significantly by general interest rates  medallion loan market values  economic conditions  and competition 
based on current market conditions  we believe citibank may not extend the credit facility beyond its current maturity date in november we have available liquidity of  under our revolving credit agreement with dz bank as of december  we also generate liquidity through deposits generated at medallion bank  borrowing arrangements with other banks  and through the issuance of sba debentures  as well as from cash flow from operations 
in addition  we may choose to participate a greater portion of our loan portfolio to third parties 
we are actively seeking additional sources of liquidity  including sources of liquidity to repay our borrowings under the citibank facility  however  given current market conditions  we cannot assure you that we 
table of contents will be able to secure additional liquidity on terms favorable to us or at all 
if that occurs  we may decline to underwrite lower yielding loans in order to conserve capital until credit conditions in the market become more favorable  or we may be required to dispose of assets when we would not otherwise do so  and at prices which may be below the net book value of such assets in order for us to repay indebtedness on a timely basis 
also  medallion bank is not a ric  and therefore is able to retain earnings to finance growth
