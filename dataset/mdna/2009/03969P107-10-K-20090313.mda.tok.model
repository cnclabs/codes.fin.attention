results of operations 
this section provides an analysis of our results of operations presented in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations by comparing the results for the year ended december  to the results for the year ended december  and comparing the results for the year ended december  to the results for the year ended december  liquidity and capital resources 
this section provides an analysis of our cash flows and a discussion of our outstanding commitments and contingencies that existed as of december  included in this discussion is our financial capacity to fund our future commitments and a discussion of other financing arrangements 
overview we are a biotechnology company focused on the discovery and development of small molecule therapeutics for the treatment of gout  hiv  cancer and inflammatory diseases 
we have five product candidates in clinical trials including rdea an inhibitor of the urat kidney transporter for the treatment of hyperuricemia and gout  rdea a non nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor nnrti for the treatment of hiv 
rdea  the prodrug of rdea  is also being evaluated in a pilot phase a proof of concept study in gout patients to provide an early confirmation of rdea s activity in the target population 
rdea a next generation nnrti for the treatment of hiv  rdea an inhibitor of mitogen activated erk kinase mek for the treatment of cancer and inflammatory diseases  and rdea a next generation inhibitor of mek for the treatment of cancer and inflammatory diseases 
in addition to our product candidates in clinical development  we have other programs at the discovery or preclinical stage 
research and development expense research and development expenses primarily consist of costs associated with the development and clinical trials of our product candidates  costs associated with our ongoing research programs  salaries and share based compensation for research and development personnel and facility costs 
at this time  due to the risks inherent in the clinical trial process and given the early stage of development of our product candidates and lead compounds from our research programs  we are unable to estimate with any 
table of contents certainty the costs we will incur in the continued development of our product candidates for commercialization 
other than costs for outsourced services associated with our clinical programs  we generally do not track our research and development expenses by project  rather  we track such expenses by the type of cost incurred 
due to these same factors  we are unable to determine the anticipated completion dates for our current research and development projects 
we expect our research and development costs to decrease from levels due to reduced company funded activity in our hiv  cancer  and inflammatory disease research and development programs 
general and administrative expense general and administrative expense primarily consist of salaries  share based compensation and other related costs for personnel in executive  finance and accounting  business development  investor relations  information technology  legal and human resource functions 
other general and administrative costs include professional fees for legal  accounting and other general corporate purposes  and facility costs not otherwise included in research and development expense 
other income  net other income  net primarily consists of the interest earned on our cash  cash equivalents and short term investments available for sale  net of interest expense 
recent developments in december  we completed a single ascending dose phase clinical study of rdea in normal healthy volunteers  demonstrating that single doses of up to mg of rdea were well tolerated  with linear increases in drug levels observed throughout the dose ranges investigated  and with up to an hour elimination half life 
a dose related decrease in serum uric acid was observed  with overall reductions compared to placebo of up to over the first hours  which is about twice that observed in prior studies with a single mg dose of rdea  rdea s prodrug  given as an enteric coated tablet  in december  we completed a million gross proceeds private placement of  newly issued shares of common stock and warrants to purchase  shares of common stock at a total purchase price of per unit  with each unit consisting of one share of common stock and one warrant to purchase shares of common stock  in november  we received an million growth capital loan from oxford finance corporation and silicon valley bank  in october  based on positive in vitro synergy data  we initiated a phase study of rdea in combination with sorafenib nexavar  onyx pharmaceuticals and bayer healthcare in advanced cancer patients  and we have continued to prepare rdea for further clinical development by obtaining additional regulatory approvals to conduct our planned international phase b hiv study and by successfully completing a number of important safety and toxicology studies including a thorough qt study 
results from the thorough qt study demonstrated that qtc intervals were not increased by any dose of rdea tested 
in addition  the study provided information on the lack of pharmacokinetic differences between caucasians and african americans 
these results provide further support for rdea s cardiac safety profile as well as its potential to improve current standard of care therapy as ethnicity based differences in metabolism  which can lead to increased side effects in african americans  have been documented with efavirenz sustiva  bristol myers squibb 
critical accounting policies and estimates the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with united states generally accepted accounting principles  or gaap 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that 
table of contents affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
we evaluate our estimates on an ongoing basis  including those related to accrued clinical liabilities and share based compensation 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis of making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies involve significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our condensed consolidated financial statements 
accrued clinical liabilities we review and accrue clinical costs based on work performed  which relies on estimates of the services received and related expenses incurred 
clinical trial related contracts vary significantly in length  and may be for a fixed amount  based on milestones or deliverables  a variable amount based on actual costs incurred  capped at a certain limit  or for a combination of these elements 
revisions are charged to expense in the period in which the facts that give rise to the revision become known 
historically  revisions have not resulted in material changes to research and development costs  however  a modification in the protocol of a clinical trial or cancellation of a trial could result in a charge to our results of operations 
share based compensation we grant equity based awards under three stockholder approved  share based compensation plans 
we have granted  and may in the future grant  options and restricted stock awards to employees  directors  consultants and advisors under either our non officer equity incentive plan or our stock incentive plan 
in addition  all of our employees are eligible to participate in our employee stock purchase plan which enables employees to purchase common stock at a discount through payroll deductions 
the benefits provided under all of these plans are subject to the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards  or sfas  no 
r  share based payment  which we adopted effective january  under the modified prospective application method 
the valuation provisions of sfas r apply to new awards and to awards that are outstanding on the adoption date and are subsequently modified or cancelled 
we estimate the fair value of stock options granted using the black scholes merton  or black scholes  option valuation model 
this fair value is then amortized over the requisite service periods of the awards 
the black scholes option valuation model requires the input of subjective assumptions  including each option s expected life and price volatility of the underlying stock 
expected volatility is based on the weighted average volatility of our stock  factoring in daily share price observations and the historical price volatility of certain peers within our industry sector 
in computing expected volatility  the length of the historical period used is equal to the length of the expected term of the option and the share purchase right 
the expected life of employee stock options represents the average of the contractual term of the options and the weighted average vesting period  as permitted under the simplified method  under staff accounting bulletin  or sab  no 
 share based payments and sab no 
as share based compensation expense is based on awards ultimately expected to vest  it has been reduced for estimated forfeitures 
sfas r requires forfeitures to be estimated at the time of grant and revised  if necessary  in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates 
forfeitures are estimated based on historical experience 
changes in assumptions used under the black scholes option valuation model could materially affect our net loss and net loss per share 
new accounting pronouncements in september  the financial accounting standards board  or fasb  issued sfas no 
 fair value measurements 
sfas establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosures about fair value measurements 
the changes resulting from the application of sfas relate to the definition of fair value  the methods used to measure fair value  and the expanded disclosures about fair value measurements 
on january   we adopted the provisions of sfas see note to our financial statements for further 
table of contents details on the impact of the adoption of sfas on our consolidated results of operations and financial condition for the year ended december  in february  the fasb issued sfas no 
 the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities including an amendment of fasb statement no 
sfas permits entities to choose to measure many financial assets and financial liabilities at fair value 
unrealized gains and losses on items for which the fair value option has been elected are reported in earnings 
at this time  we have not elected to account for any of our financial assets or liabilities using the provisions of sfas as such  the adoption of sfas  on january   did not have an impact on our consolidated results of operations or financial condition for the year ended december  in june  the fasb ratified the consensus reached by the emerging issues task force  or eitf  on eitf issue no 
 accounting for nonrefundable advance payments for goods or services to be used in future research and development activities 
eitf addresses the diversity that exists with respect to the accounting for the non refundable portion of a payment made by a research and development entity for future research and development activities 
under eitf  an entity would defer and capitalize non refundable advance payments made for research and development activities until the related goods or services are delivered or the related services are performed 
eitf is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  on january   we adopted the provisions of eitf  which did not have an impact on our consolidated results of operations and financial condition for the year ended december  in december  the fasb ratified the consensus reached by the eitf on eitf issue no 
 accounting for collaborative arrangements 
the scope of eitf is limited to collaborative arrangements where no separate legal entity exists and in which the parties are active participants and are exposed to significant risks and rewards that depend on the success of the activity 
the eitf concluded that revenue transactions with third parties and associated costs incurred should be reported in the appropriate line item in each participating company s financial statements pursuant to the guidance in eitf issue no 
 reporting revenue gross as a principal versus net as an agent 
the eitf also concluded that the equity method of accounting under accounting principles board opinion no 
 the equity method of accounting for investments in common stock  should not be applied to arrangements that are not conducted through a separate legal entity 
furthermore  the eitf concluded that the income statement classification of payments made between the parties in an arrangement should be based on a consideration of the following factors the nature and terms of the arrangement  the nature of the entities operations  and whether the partners payments are within the scope of existing gaap 
to the extent such costs are not within the scope of other authoritative accounting literature  the income statement characterization for the payments should be based on an analogy to authoritative accounting literature or a reasonable  rational  and consistently applied accounting policy election 
the provisions of eitf are effective for fiscal years beginning on or after december   and companies will be required to apply the provisions through retrospective application 
we plan to adopt eitf at the beginning of fiscal and are evaluating the impact of the adoption on our results of operations and financial condition 
in may  the fasb issued sfas no 
 the hierarchy of generally accepted accounting principles 
sfas identifies the sources of accounting principles and the framework for selecting the principles used in the preparation of financial statements of non governmental entities that are presented in conformity with gaap 
sfas shall be effective days following the sec s approval of the public company accounting oversight board amendments to au section  the meaning of present fairly in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles 
we do not currently believe that the adoption of sfas will have a material impact on our results of operations and financial condition 
results of operations year ended december  and revenues for the year ended december   revenues decreased to million from million for the year ended december  historically  our revenues have resulted from the research services we provided under 
table of contents our master services agreement with valeant for its preclinical neuropharmacology program 
the decrease in revenues from levels was due to the earlier than anticipated identification of a clinical development candidate from that program and valeant s subsequent reduction in the utilization of our research and development services 
the master services agreement has since terminated by its terms 
research and development expense for the year ended december   research and development expense increased to million from million for the same period in the increase in research and development expense was primarily due to continued development and progression of our clinical and preclinical programs  which included increased spending of approximately million on clinical research organizations  professional outside services  and research and clinical trial supplies and materials for the year ended december  in addition  the increase in research and development expense was a result of additional personnel costs of approximately million and an increase in share based compensation expense of approximately million for the year ended december  resulting from increased headcount in as compared to general and administrative expense for the year ended december   general and administrative expense increased to million from million for the same period in the increase in general and administrative expense was primarily the result of higher share based compensation expense of approximately million and additional personnel costs of approximately million due to increased headcount in as compared to other income  net for the year ended december   other income  net decreased to million from million for the same period in the decrease in other income  net was primarily a result of lower average interest rates and lower average cash balances for as compared to  as well as increased interest expense in associated with our growth capital loan  tenant improvements loan and capital lease obligation entered into in there were no comparable obligations in year ended december  and revenues for the year ended december   we earned million in revenues under the master services agreement with valeant for our research services and development of a clinical development candidate for valeant s preclinical neuropharmacology program 
there were no revenues for the year ended december  research and development expense for the year ended december   research and development expense increased to million from million for the year ended december  the increase in research and development expenses was due to the startup of our research and development programs in december research and development expense for the year ended december   primarily consisted of approximately million for clinical research organizations  professional outside services  and research and clinical trial supplies and materials  approximately million for research and development personnel costs  approximately million for facility related costs and approximately million in share based compensation expense 
general and administrative expense for the year ended december   general and administrative expense increased to million from million for the year ended december  the increase in general and administrative expense was primarily the result of additional personnel costs of approximately million and increased share based compensation expense of million due to increased headcount in as compared to in addition  
table of contents the increase was also due to higher costs of approximately million for professional fees for legal  audit and public relations  and consulting fees for other general corporate purposes 
other income  net for the year ended december   other income  net increased to million from million primarily due to an increase in other income from the sale of fixed assets in  partially offset by a decrease in interest income as a result of lower average cash balances in as compared to liquidity and capital resources from inception through december   we have incurred a cumulative net loss of approximately million and have financed our operations through public and private offerings of securities  proceeds from our growth capital loan  revenues from collaborative agreements and interest income from invested cash balances 
in december  we entered into a securities purchase agreement for the private placement of  newly issued unregistered shares of our common stock and warrants to purchase  shares of common stock at a total purchase price of approximately per unit  with each unit consisting of one share of common stock and a warrant to purchase shares of common stock at an exercise price of per share 
the net proceeds from the private placement were approximately million 
on january   we filed a registration statement with the sec covering the resale of these shares and the shares issuable upon exercise of the warrants 
this registration statement was declared effective by the sec on january  in november  we entered into an agreement with oxford finance corporation and silicon valley bank  or the lenders  pursuant to which the lenders provided us with an approximately three year  million growth capital loan 
interest accrues at a rate of per annum  with monthly interest only payments required during a period beginning on the loan funding date and continuing through february   followed thereafter by equal monthly payments of principal and interest over a period of months 
in addition  we are required to pay a total loan commitment fee of approximately million  of which million was paid upon entering into the loan agreement and the remaining million is due at the end of the term of the loan 
we have the option to prepay the outstanding balance of the loan in full  subject to a prepayment fee 
the loan is collateralized by our general assets  excluding intellectual property 
there are no financial covenants associated with the loan 
in connection with the loan  we issued to the lenders warrants to purchase up to an aggregate of  shares of our common stock at an exercise price of per share 
the warrants are currently exercisable and expire seven years from the date of issuance 
we lease our office and laboratory facilities and certain equipment under operating leases 
in march  we exercised our right under our sublease agreement to borrow approximately  for costs incurred and paid for certain tenant improvements recently completed at our new facility 
the note bears interest at per annum and is payable in monthly installments of principal and interest of approximately  for months beginning in june in addition  in july  we entered into a capital lease agreement for approximately  to finance the purchase of certain equipment 
the agreement is secured by the equipment  bears interest at per annum  and is payable in monthly installments of principal and interest of approximately  for months beginning in august as of december   we had million in cash  cash equivalents  and short term investments compared to million as of december  the decrease in cash  cash equivalents and short term investments for the year ended december  was due to the use of our financial resources to fund our clinical and preclinical programs  increased personnel costs  and for other general corporate purposes  partially offset by the proceeds received from our growth capital loan and the sale of equity securities 
under the asset purchase agreement with valeant  we will be required to pay valeant million after the first patient is dosed in the first phase b study for the nnrti program 
we expect to dose the first patient in the phase b study in  the timing of which will be determined in part by the results of ongoing partnering discussions 
we also enter into agreements from time to time with clinical sites and contract research organizations for the conduct of our clinical trials 
we make payments to these sites and organizations based upon the number of patients 
table of contents enrolled and the length of their participation in the clinical trials 
under certain of these agreements  we may be subject to penalties in the event that we prematurely terminate these agreements 
at this time  due to the variability associated with clinical site and contract research organization agreements  we are unable to estimate with certainty the future costs we will incur 
we intend to fund our obligations under these commitments from our current financial resources 
in addition  we entered into employment agreements with our executive officers and certain other key employees that  under certain circumstances  provide for the continuation of salary and certain other benefits if terminated under specified circumstances 
these agreements generally expire upon termination for cause or when we have met our obligations under these agreements 
as of december   no events have occurred resulting in the obligation of any such payments 
the following table summarizes our contractual obligations as of december  long term debt and capital lease obligations include interest 
payment due by period less than more than total year years years years in thousands long term debt obligations operating lease obligations capital lease obligations purchase obligations other long term liabilities total at december   purchase obligations primarily consisted of commitments with third party manufacturers of materials to be used in our clinical and pre clinical studies 
approximately million of the total purchase obligations were not included in our consolidated financial statements for the year ended december  we intend to use our current financial resources to fund our commitments under these purchase obligations 
our future capital uses and requirements depend on numerous forward looking factors 
these factors may include  but are not limited to  the following the rate of progress and cost of our clinical trials and other research and development activities  the scope  prioritization and number of clinical development and research programs we pursue  the terms and timing of any collaborative  licensing and other arrangements that we may establish  the cost of filing  prosecuting  defending and enforcing any patent claims and other intellectual property rights  the costs and timing of regulatory approvals  the cost of establishing or contracting for manufacturing  sales and marketing capabilities  and the effect of competing technological and market developments 
we anticipate that our existing cash  cash equivalents and short term investments and interest earned thereon  will be sufficient to fund our operations as currently planned into the second quarter of this projection assumes we do not raise any additional funds  including through the sale of additional securities  additional debt financings or establishment of collaborative or licensing arrangements with corporate partners 
we have no current means of generating material cash flows from operations 
there can be no assurance that our product development efforts with respect to any of our product candidates will be successfully completed  that required regulatory approvals will be obtained or that any products  if introduced  will be successfully marketed or achieve commercial acceptance 
accordingly  we will continue to seek capital by various means  including by selling our equity securities  additional debt financing and by establishing one or more collaborative or licensing arrangements 
however  there can be no assurance that additional financing will be available to us on acceptable terms  if at all 

table of contents off balance sheet arrangements we have no off balance sheet arrangements that have  or are reasonably likely to have  a current or future effect on our consolidated financial condition  changes in our consolidated financial condition  expenses  consolidated results of operations  liquidity  capital expenditures or capital resources 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve our capital to fund operations  while at the same time maximizing the income we receive from our investments without significantly increasing risk 
as of december   we owned financial instruments that are sensitive to market risk  including interest rate risk  as part of our investment portfolio 
to minimize our exposure to market risk  we have generally limited our investments to cash and securities of the government of the united states of america and its federal agencies or high grade corporate and municipal bonds with maturity dates of less than one year 
due to the short term nature of our investments  a basis point movement in market interest rates over the three month period following december  would not have a material impact on the fair value of our portfolio as of december  we have no investments denominated in foreign currencies and therefore our investments are not subject to foreign currency exchange risk 
we also do not invest in any derivative financial instruments  derivative commodity instruments  auction rate securities or other market risk sensitive instruments  positions or transactions
