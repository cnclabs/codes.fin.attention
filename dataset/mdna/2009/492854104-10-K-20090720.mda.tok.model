the cautionary statements made pursuant to the reform act herein and elsewhere by us should not be construed as exhaustive 
we cannot always predict what factors would cause actual results to differ materially from those indicated by the forward looking statements 
in addition  readers are urged to consider statements that include the terms believes  belief  expects  plans  objectives  anticipates  intends  or the like to be uncertain and forward looking 
over time  our actual results  performance  or achievements will likely differ from the anticipated results  performance or achievements that are expressed or implied by our forward looking statements  and such difference might be significant and harmful to our stockholders interest 
many important factors that could cause such a difference are described under the caption risk factors  in item a of this annual report  which you should review carefully 
management s discussion and analysis introduction we are a recognized leader in the design  manufacture  and installation of laboratory and technical furniture products 
laboratory furniture products include both steel and wood cabinetry  fume hoods  flexible systems  and worksurfaces 
technical furniture products include workstations  workbenches  computer enclosures  and network storage systems 
our corporate headquarters are located in statesville  north carolina  and our manufacturing facilities are located in statesville and bangalore  india 
we also have subsidiaries in singapore and bangalore that serve the asian and middle east markets 
although only approximately of our sales were through our international subsidiaries in fiscal year  these sales are considered an important part of our long term growth strategy 
our products are primarily sold through purchase orders and contracts submitted by customers through our dealers and commissioned agents  a national distributor  and through competitive bids submitted by us and our subsidiaries 
products are sold principally to pharmaceutical  biotechnology  industrial  chemical  and commercial research laboratories  educational institutions  healthcare institutions  governmental entities  manufacturing facilities  and users of networking furniture 
we consider the markets in which we compete to be highly competitive  with a significant amount of the business involving competitive public bidding 
it is common in the laboratory furniture industry for customer orders to require delivery at extended future dates  as products are frequently to be installed in buildings yet to be constructed 
changes or delays in building construction may cause delays in delivery of the orders and our recognition of the sale 
since prices are normally quoted on a firm basis in the industry  we bear the burden of possible increases in labor and material costs between quotation of an order and delivery of the product 
the impact of such possible increases is considered when determining the sales price 
the principal raw materials and products manufactured by others and used in our products are cold rolled carbon and stainless steel  hardwood lumbers and plywood  paint  chemicals  resins  hardware  plumbing and electrical fittings 
such materials and products are purchased from multiple suppliers and are typically readily available 
critical accounting policies in the ordinary course of business  we have made a number of estimates and assumptions relating to the reporting of results of operations and financial position in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states of america 
actual results could differ significantly from those estimates 
we believe that the following discussion addresses our most critical accounting policies  which are those that are most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations  and require management s most difficult  subjective  and complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 

table of contents revenue recognition a portion of our product sales result from fixed price construction contracts that involve a signed contract for a fixed price to provide our laboratory furniture and fume hoods for a construction project 
we are usually in the role of a subcontractor  but in some cases may enter into a contract directly with the end user of the products 
our contract arrangements normally do not contain a general right of return relative to the delivered items 
product sales resulting from fixed price construction contracts are generated from multiple element arrangements that require separate units of accounting and estimates regarding the fair value of individual elements 
the company has determined that its multiple element arrangements that qualify as separate units of accounting are product sales and installation services 
there is objective and reliable evidence of fair value for both the product sales and installation services  and allocation of arrangement consideration for each of these units is based on their relative fair values 
each of these elements represents individual units of accounting  as the delivered item has value to a customer on a stand alone basis 
the company s products are regularly sold on a stand alone basis to customers which provides vendor specific objective evidence of fair value 
the fair value of installation services is separately calculated using expected costs of installation services 
many times the value of installation services is calculated using price quotations from subcontractors to the company  who perform installation services on a stand alone basis 
assuming all other criteria for revenue recognition have been met  we recognize revenue for product sales at the date of shipment 
product sales resulting from purchase orders involve a purchase order received by us from our dealers or our stocking distributor 
this category includes product sales for standard products  as well as products which require some customization 
these sales are recognized under the terms of the purchase order which generally are freight on board fob shipping point and do not include rights of return 
accordingly  these sales are recognized at the time of shipment 
allowance for doubtful accounts evaluation of the allowance for doubtful accounts involves management judgments and estimates 
we evaluate the collectability of our trade accounts receivable based on a number of factors 
in circumstances where management is aware of a customer s inability to meet its financial obligations to us  or a project dispute makes it unlikely that all of the receivable owed by a customer will be collected  a specific reserve for bad debts is estimated and recorded to reduce the recognized receivable to the estimated amount we believe will ultimately be collected 
in addition to specific customer identification of potential bad debts  a general reserve for bad debts is estimated and recorded based on our recent past loss history and an overall assessment of past due trade accounts receivable amounts outstanding 
inventories inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market 
the cost of the majority of inventories is measured on the last in  first out lifo method 
the lifo method allocates the most recent costs to cost of products sold  and  therefore  recognizes into operating results fluctuations in raw materials and other inventoriable costs more quickly than other methods 
inventories at our international subsidiaries are measured at actual cost 
pension benefits we sponsor pension plans covering all employees who met eligibility requirements as of april  in february  our pension plans were amended as of april  no further benefits have been  or will be  earned under the plans subsequent to the amendment date  and no additional participants have been  or will be  added to the plans 
several statistical and other factors  which attempt to anticipate future events  are used in calculating the expense and liability related to the pension plans 
these factors include assumptions about the discount rate used to calculate and determine benefit obligations and expected return on plan assets within certain guidelines 
the actuarial assumptions used by us may differ materially from actual results due to changing market and economic conditions  higher or lower withdrawal rates  or longer or shorter life spans of participants 
these differences may significantly affect the amount of pension income or expense recorded by us in future periods

table of contents liquidity and capital resources our principal sources of liquidity have historically been funds generated from operating activities  supplemented as needed by borrowings under our revolving credit facility 
additionally  certain machinery and equipment are financed by non cancelable operating leases or capital leases 
we believe that these sources of funds will be sufficient to support ongoing business requirements  including capital expenditures  through fiscal year at april   we had advances of million outstanding under our unsecured million revolving credit facility 
the credit facility matures in september  and we intend to extend or replace it with a new facility prior to the maturity date  although there can be no assurance as to the availability or terms of any such extension or replacement 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in item of this annual report for additional information concerning our credit facility 
during fiscal years and  we entered into capital lease arrangements related to costs of  and  respectively  associated with a new enterprise resource planning erp system that was implemented in the fourth quarter of fiscal year these lease arrangements  as well as most of our leases for machinery and equipment  provide us with renewal and purchase options and certain early cancellation rights

as discussed above  no further benefits have been  or will be  earned under our pension plans after april   and no additional participants have been  or will be  added to the plans

table of contents outlook our current expectations are that fiscal year will again be profitable for the company 
however  the financial markets in the united states  europe  and asia have been experiencing extreme disruptions in recent months  and among other things  the company expects higher pension costs as a result of investment losses in our pension portfolio in fiscal year we are unable to predict the likely duration and severity of the current disruptions and adverse economic conditions in the united states and other countries and the impact these events may have on our operations and the laboratory furniture industry in general 
the future demand for our products also continues to be limited given the company s role as subcontractor or supplier to dealers for subcontractors 
in addition to the above factors affecting the company and our markets  demand for our products is also dependent upon the number of laboratory construction projects planned and or current progress in projects already under construction 
our earnings are also impacted by increased costs of raw materials  including stainless steel  wood  and epoxy resin  and whether we are able to increase product prices to customers in amounts that correspond to such increases without materially and adversely affecting sales 
additionally  since prices are normally quoted on a firm basis in the industry  we bear the burden of possible increases in labor and material costs between the quotation of an order and delivery of a product 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risk in the area of interest rates 
this exposure is associated with advances outstanding under our bank line of credit and certain lease obligations for production machinery  all of which are priced on a floating rate basis 
advances outstanding under the bank line of credit were million at april  we believe that our exposure to market risk is not material
