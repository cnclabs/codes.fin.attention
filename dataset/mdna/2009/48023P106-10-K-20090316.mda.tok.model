overview we develop  produce  market and distribute a range of premium beverages 
with the addition of jones gaba tm in the first quarter of  our premium beverages include the following six brands jones pure cane soda tm  a premium carbonated soft drink  jones c tm  an enhanced water beverage  jones gaba tm  a functional tea juice blend  jones organics tm  a ready to drink organic tea  jones naturals  a non carbonated juice tea  and whoopass  a citrus energy drink 
we sell and distribute our products primarily throughout the united states us and canada through our network of independent distributors  which we refer to as our direct store delivery dsd channel  national retail accounts  which we refer to as our direct to retail dtr channel  as well as through licensing and distribution arrangements 
we do not directly manufacture our products but instead outsource the manufacturing process to third party bottlers and contract packers 
in september  we entered into an exclusive manufacturing and distribution agreement with national beverage corp 
national beverage to manufacture and distribute jones soda ounce cans to the more mainstream channels and in store locations in an effort to expand our points of availability within all stores including the shelves that are normally restricted to national mainstream brands manufactured by companies such as the coca cola company and pepsico 
beginning in january  national beverage corp 
started selling jones pure cane soda to retailers in the grocery and mass merchant channels in the us through this arrangement  we identify and secure retailers across the us for jones soda ounce cans  and we are solely responsible for all sales efforts  marketing  advertising and promotion 
using concentrate supplied by jones  national beverage both manufactures and sells on an exclusive basis the products directly to retailers 
finally  we also sell various products on line which we refer to as our interactive channel and sell customized soda  wearables  candy and other items 
our products are sold in states in the us and provinces in canada  primarily in convenience stores  delicatessens  sandwich shops and selected supermarkets  as well as through our national accounts with several large retailers 
we have focused our sales and marketing resources on the expansion and penetration of our products through our independent distributor network and national retail accounts in our core markets consisting of the northwest  southwest and midwest us and canada  as well as targeted expansion into our less penetrated markets consisting of the northeast and southeast us in addition we are expanding our international business outside of north america and have entered the markets of ireland  the united kingdom uk and australia through independent distributors 

table of contents beginning in  we launched our licensing business strategy as a method to extend our brand into non alternative beverage products and non beverage products 
we currently have licensing arrangements with three companies 
with these licensing agreements  we believe that we are able to partner with companies that will manufacture jones related products and extend our jones brand into select products that we feel enhance our brand image 
we do not expect this business to be a material part of our operations in our business strategy is to increase sales by expanding distribution of our brands in new and existing markets primarily within north america  stimulating consumer awareness and trial of our products leading to increased relevance and purchase intent of our brands 
our business strategy focuses on expanding points of distribution for our products  creating strong alignment with our key distributors  developing innovative beverage brands and products  stimulating strong consumer demand for our existing brands and products  with primary emphasis in the us and canada  inviting consumers to participate in our brand through submission of photographs to be placed on labels through our interactive application of my jones 
com  licensing our brand equity for the creation of other beverage or non beverage products  and licensing our patented custom label process to non competitive products 
in order to compete effectively in the beverage industry  we believe that we must convince independent distributors that jones pure cane soda tm is a leading brand in the premium soda segment of the alternative or new age beverage industry 
additionally  as a means of maintaining and expanding our distribution network  we introduce new products and product extensions  and when warranted  new brands 
in february  we launched jones gaba  our first line of beverage products containing pharma gaba  offered in a ounce can 
we will market this tea and juice blended beverage by focusing on the benefits of enhanced focus and clarity that studies have shown gaba provides 
we have allocated significant resources in our efforts to launch jones gaba in the first quarter of our results with respect to jones gaba depend in part on our ability to successfully launch jones gaba and market the product s ability to enhance levels of mental clarity and focus  as studies have shown 
jones gaba is our first entry into beverage products containing gaba and much of our success will depend on our ability to gain new points of distribution through our dsd channel 
we must also be successful in developing dtr distribution for jones gaba through existing dtr customers and obtain new listings with customers that currently do not have points of distribution 
jones gaba will be launched as a premium priced item and part of a new emerging category of functional beverages 
the current economic environment may not support a premium priced beverage entry at the level of our expectations for the product line 
the beverage industry can be affected by macro economic factors  including changes in national  regional  and local economic conditions  employment levels and consumer spending patterns 
the recent disruptions in the overall economy and financial markets as a result of the global economic crisis have adversely impacted our two primary markets the us and canada 
this has reduced consumer confidence in the economy and could negatively affect consumers willingness to purchase our products as they reduce their discretionary spending 
moreover  current economic conditions may adversely affect the ability of our distributors to obtain the credit necessary to fund their working capital needs  which could negatively impact their ability or desire to continue to purchase products from us in the same frequencies and volumes as they have done in the past 
there can be no assurances that government responses to the disruptions in the financial markets will restore consumer confidence  stabilize the markets or increase liquidity and the availability of credit 
if the current economic conditions persist or deteriorate  sales of our products could be adversely affected  collectability of accounts receivable may be compromised and we may face obsolescence issues with our inventory  any of which could have a material adverse impact on our operating results and financial condition 

table of contents based on our current plans and amounts expected to be generated from future operations  we believe that our cash and cash equivalents  and net cash provided by operations will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash needs for working capital and capital expenditures through the end of fiscal and beyond 
this will depend  however  on our ability to execute on our operating plan and to manage our costs in light of developing economic conditions and the performance of our business 
we arrived at our revenue projections for our operating plan after careful consideration of the macroeconomic factors stemming from the global economic crisis  with an emphasis on our higher margin  core products  including our jones pure cane soda glass bottle business 
further  we implemented cost containment measures in the fourth quarter of and early  including reductions in workforce  to further align our cost structure with our revenue projections 
although we do not believe we are dependent on new product launches to generate sufficient cash flow from operations in  we believe our new higher margin product introductions in  including the launch of jones gaba during the first quarter  will help to enhance our sales growth into new markets and consumer groups 
we intend to continually monitor and adjust our business plan as necessary to respond to developments in our business  our markets and the broader economy 
even with these measures  we do not anticipate reaching profitability in refer to liquidity and capital resources included in item of this annual report on form k 
results of operations years ended december  and revenue for the year ended december   revenue was approximately million  a decrease of million  or from million in revenue for the year ended december  the decrease in revenue was primarily attributable to a decrease in case sales through our dtr and dsd channels to million cases as well as a decrease in case sales of concentrate to national beverage to million cases due to the nationwide launch of cans in which resulted in sufficient inventory levels through the initial launch and reduced the demand for new orders in these decreases were offset by a reduction of  or  in promotion allowances and slotting fees  which are a reduction to revenue  to million from million 
this resulted from fewer promotion allowance programs in the latter part of due to lower sales volumes and our cost containment measures which are anticipated to contribute to a continued decline in promotion allowance programs in revenues in our dsd channel decreased in compared to the prior year as a result of lower shipments of jones soda glass bottles  our core product  due to a discontinuation of distribution points at some key retailers but this decrease was partially offset by the benefit of a full year of sales of c which was launched in september dtr channel revenue was negatively impacted in compared to due to a reduction in the number of retail stores carrying jones soda as well as the discontinuance of the jones soda ounce bottles at a major retailer 
gross profit year ended december  change dollars in thousands gross profit of revenue for the year ended december   gross profit decreased by approximately million or as compared to million in gross profit for the year ended december  this was primarily a result of lower sales volumes in our dtr channel due to a reduction in the number of retail stores carrying jones soda as well as the discontinuance of the jones soda ounce bottles at a major retailer 
also contributing to the decrease in gross profit was an increase in freight costs and the shutdown of our st 
louis co packer which resulted in longer shipping distances to customers in our midwest and southeast markets 
in  gross profit as a percentage of revenue decreased to from in 
table of contents licensing revenue licensing revenue decreased  or  to  for the year ended december   from  for the year ended december   and consisted primarily of our exclusive licensing arrangements with big sky brands for jones soda flavor booster hard candy 
we believe licensing revenue was down due to the negative impact on sales resulting from the economic downturn 
we do not expect licensing revenue to represent a material portion of our overall revenues in promotion and selling expenses promotion and selling expenses for the year ended december  were million  an increase of  or  over million for the year ended december  promotion and selling expenses as a percentage of revenue increased to for the year ended december   from in the increase in promotion and selling expenses was primarily due to an increase in selling expenses year over year of  to million  or of revenue 
this increase was primarily due to increases in sales personnel in conjunction with the emphasis on the csd channel until the strategic refocus in the fourth quarter of resulting in a reduction in force 
the effect of the workforce reduction is expected to reduce ongoing promotion and selling expenses in also contributing to the increase in promotion and selling expenses was an increase in marketing expenses of  to million  or of revenue  for from million in this was primarily due to increases in brand building efforts including promotional events and sponsorships which were offset by a decrease in marketing expense 
general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses for the year ended december  were million  an increase of million or  compared to million for the year ended december  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue increased to for the year ended december  from in the increase in general and administrative expenses was primarily due to an increase in professional fees  including legal fees relating to our securities litigation matter and accounting fees  as well as executive transition expenses of approximately  other income  net other income  net decreased to  for the year ended december   from million in  primarily due to a decrease in interest income due to lower levels of cash and short term investments and lower levels of effective interest rates compared to income tax expense benefit provision for income taxes for the years ended december  and was  and million  respectively 
the tax provision for the year ended december  relates primarily to the tax provision on income from our canadian operations 
no tax benefit is recorded for the loss in our us operations as we have recorded a full valuation allowance on our us net deferred tax assets 
we expect to continue to record a full valuation allowance on our us net deferred tax assets until we sustain an appropriate level of taxable income through improved us operations 
our effective tax rate is based on recurring factors  including the forecasted mix of income before taxes in various jurisdictions  estimated permanent differences and the recording of a full valuation allowance on our us net deferred tax assets 
net loss net loss for the year ended december  increased to million from a net loss of million for the year ended december  this was primarily due to lower sales in our dtr and dsd channels combined with increased promotion and selling expenses in conjunction with the emphasis on the csd channel as well as an increase in general and administrative expense primarily resulting from our securities litigation matter and executive transition expenses 

table of contents results of operations years ended december  and revenue for the year ended december   revenue was approximately million  an increase of  or from million in revenues for the year ended december  the increase in revenues was primarily attributable to a increase in case sales through our dtr  dsd and csd channels to million cases 
the increase in case sales was primarily due to an increase in case sales of jones soda ounce bottles and c  our enhanced water beverage launched in the first quarter  through our dtr and dsd network  as well as a higher overall price per case in concentrate case sales to national beverage for the year ended december  were higher than in  as sales in include sales of concentrate of jones pure cane soda and jones energy  while concentrate case sales in fiscal consisted solely of jones energy concentrate sales during the second quarter of and jones soda concentrate sales in the fourth quarter of the increase in concentrate sales of jones pure cane soda to national beverage in was primarily in preparation of the launch of our ounce cans in the increases in revenue were offset by an increase in promotion allowances and slotting fees  which are a reduction to revenue  to million from  in  primarily resulting from the slotting fees incurred to gain entry into the csd channel for our ounce cans 
gross profit year ended december  change dollars in thousands gross profit of revenue for the year ended december   gross profit decreased by approximately million or as compared to million in gross profit for the year ended december  this decrease was primarily as a result of increased promotion allowances and slotting fees to million in from  in due to the nationwide launch of cans in through our csd channel 
the decrease was also due to inventory provisions and write downs of approximately million related to  among other items  the transition from high fructose corn syrup to pure cane sugar production during the first three quarters  the discontinuance of our ounce jones soda cans and certain special packs and flavors in the fourth quarter 
changes in product mix and sales mix in the dsd and dtr channels also contributed to the lower gross profit as we shipped more product to our dtr customers  where we receive lower gross profit than shipments to our distributors 
additionally  in we continued to experience higher co packing costs for some of our products due to increases in energy costs  co packing fees and freight costs 
in response  we continued to shift a portion of our bottling requirements to our u 
s co packers in an effort to reduce freight and co packing costs 
in  gross profit as a percentage of revenue decreased to from in licensing revenue licensing revenue decreased  or  to  for the year ended december  from  for the year ended december  and consisted primarily of our exclusive arrangements with big sky brands for jones soda flavor booster hard candy and remaining royalties on the sale of remaining high fructose corn syrup inventory through target corporation 
in contrast  for the year ended december   licensing revenue consisted primarily of royalty payments on the sale of ounce cans pursuant to our exclusive licensing arrangement with target corporation that expired on december   and to a lesser extent our licensing arrangement with big sky brands 
promotion and selling expenses promotion and selling expenses for the year ended december  were million  an increase of million  or  over million for the year ended december  promotion and selling 
table of contents expenses as a percentage of revenue increased to for the year ended december   from in the increase in promotion and selling expenses was primarily due to increased promotion expenses resulting from our entry into the csd channel and our introduction of c in various markets in our dsd channel and increased headcount in senior sales and marketing positions in the increase in promotion and selling expenses in was also due to hiring a national advertising agency to develop an advertising campaign for our jones soda products 
further  was the first year we incurred expenses related to our sponsorship agreement with the seahawks and new jersey nets which included amounts amortized relating to the sponsorship fees  product development costs and marketing costs 
general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses for the year ended december  were million  an increase of million or  compared to million for the year ended december  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue increased to for from in the increase in general and administrative expenses was primarily due to the executive transition expenses of approximately million  a significant increase in legal fees relating to our securities litigation matter  increased negotiation costs of various customer and supplier agreements  audit and consulting fees related to sarbanes oxley section compliance  depreciation and amortization and stock based compensation 
other income  net for the year ended december   other income  net was approximately million compared to approximately  in primarily due to interest income from the funds we received from our june equity offering that were available for the entire year and foreign currency translation gains 
interest income consists of interest income earned on cash on hand and short term investments which were invested in money market and short term fixed income instruments 
income taxes expense benefit for the year ended december   we recorded a valuation allowance on our deferred taxes in the fourth quarter and  thus  recorded a net income tax expense of million compared to an income tax benefit of  in the tax provision for the year ended december   is based on an expected annual effective tax rate of  compared to a us statutory rate of 
the actual effective tax rate for the year ended december  differs from due primarily to the recording of the valuation allowance on the us deferred tax assets 
the tax provision for the year ended december  is based on an effective tax rate of compared to a us statutory rate of 
our effective tax rate is based on recurring factors  including the forecasted mix of income before taxes in various jurisdictions  estimated permanent differences and the related effective tax rates in those jurisdictions 
net loss income net loss for the year ended december  was approximately million compared to net income of million in the decrease in net income was due to an increase in slotting fees costs  promotion allowances and operating expenses 
operating expenses increased due to increased trade promotion spending for csd and dsd channels  increased expenses related to increased hiring in sales  marketing and operations departments  depreciation and amortization and legal and compliance costs 
liquidity and capital resources as of december  and  we had cash  cash equivalents and short term investment of approximately million and million  respectively and working capital of million and million  respectively 
accumulated deficit increased to million as of december  over the prior year s deficit of million 
this increase in our accumulated deficit is due to net losses from operations that we have incurred in each of the last six fiscal quarters 
during these periods  we have used a significant amount of our cash resources to fund our net losses and working capital requirements 

table of contents net cash used in operating activities in increased to million compared to million in  for a year over year increase of million 
this increase in net cash used in operating activities was primarily due to the increase in our net loss  excluding the one time non cash deferred income tax expense in the prior year  driven by lower sales in our dtr and dsd channels combined with increased promotion and selling expenses in connection with the emphasis on the csd channel in the first three quarters of also contributing to net cash used in operating activities was an increase in general and administrative expense primarily resulting from our securities litigation matter and executive transition 
additionally  significant decreases from december  to december  in accounts payable due in part to the decrease in trade spend expenses as a result of cost containment measures in late were partially offset by decreases in accounts receivable due primarily to the decline in dtr and dsd channel revenue contributed to the increase in cash used by operations 
net cash provided by investing activities totaled approximately million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively  primarily due to sale of short term investments offset to a lesser extent  by purchases of fixed assets 
net cash used in financing activities was approximately  for the year ended december   and consisted primarily of payments on our capital lease obligations compared to net cash provided by financing activities for the year ended december  of million comprised primarily of proceeds from exercises of stock options 
in early october  we implemented a reduction in workforce that reduced our staff by approximately whose annualized salaries and benefits were approximately million 
the workforce reduction was implemented in an effort to reduce ongoing operating expenses and improve our overall efficiency 
severance and termination benefits to the affected employees were not material to our financial results for the fourth quarter of in november  our million line of credit with key bank national association was terminated after discussions that were initiated by key bank given the current economic climate and our financial condition and operating results 
we considered different borrowing alternatives with key bank but these alternatives would have required us to maintain a fully secured position at all times on the loan  which we did not consider to be an effective lending position 
as a result  we elected not to pursue such alternatives 
we remained in compliance with all covenants through the termination date 
based on our current plans and amounts expected to be generated from future operations  we believe that our cash and cash equivalents and net cash provided by operations will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash needs for working capital and capital expenditures through the end of fiscal and beyond 
this will depend  however  on our ability to execute on our operating plan and to manage our costs in light of developing economic conditions and the performance of our business 
we arrived at our revenue projections for our operating plan after careful consideration of the macroeconomic factors stemming from the global economic crisis  with an emphasis on our higher margin core products  including our jones pure cane soda glass bottle business 
further  we implemented cost containment measures in the fourth quarter of and early  including reductions in workforce  to further align our cost structure with our revenue projections 
although we do not believe we are dependent on new product launches to generate sufficient cash flow from operations in  we believe the launch of jones gaba during the first quarter  plus corresponding the extensions of this product  will help to enhance our sales growth into new markets and consumer groups 
we intend to continually monitor and adjust our business plan as necessary to respond to developments in our business  our markets and the broader economy and are prepared  if necessary  to take further action to conserve cash  including further cost reductions in sales  marketing and general and administrative areas 
even with these measures  we do not anticipate reaching profitability in our current operating plan for does not depend on obtaining financing  however  if we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow from operations to cover our working capital and capital expenditure requirements  we may need to obtain funds through additional financing or securing a replacement credit facility  which may not be available to us on acceptable terms  if at all 
in addition  we may have to explore various strategies to secure any necessary additional financing  which may include  without limitation  public or private offerings of 
table of contents debt or equity securities  joint ventures with one or more strategic partners and other strategic alternatives 
there can be no assurance that our efforts in this regard will result in any agreements or transactions 
contractual obligations our commitments as of december  with respect to known contractual obligations were as follows in thousands payments due by period less than more than contractual obligations total year years years years capital lease obligations operating lease obligations sponsorships purchase obligations total our sponsorship obligations include commitments under our sponsorship agreements with the seattle seahawks  the new jersey nets and the portland trail blazers 
these obligations vary in terms and commit us to payments from to we describe these arrangements in part i  item business of this report 
purchase obligations reflected in the table above include approximately million in sugar under our supply agreements with our three pure cane sugar suppliers and approximately million in glass under our supply agreement with our glass supplier 
they are include commitments under our pharma gaba supply agreement to order approximately million of pharma gaba by december  and  on or before january   to pay of that amount  with the remaining portion to be paid in six equal monthly installments commencing on february  and ending july  in addition  we are required to use our commercially reasonable best efforts to purchase an additional million of pharma gaba through the end of the term of the agreement in july according to the following schedule approximately million of pharma gaba by july  and an additional approximately million of pharma gaba by july  the million is not included in the table above because it does not represent a firm commitment 
we have no off balance sheet arrangements 
contingencies we are subject to the possibility of losses from various contingencies 
see item legal proceedings for disclosure of the federal securities class action and shareholder derivative litigation as well as other matters 
we are unable to predict the outcome of these actions 
these actions could result in significant liability and could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations  or financial condition 
critical accounting policies the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates based on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form our basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions  or if management made different judgments or utilized different estimates 
many of our estimates or judgments are based on anticipated future events or performance  and as such are forward looking in nature  and are subject to many risks and uncertainties  including those discussed below and elsewhere in this report 
we do not undertake any obligation to update or revise this discussion to reflect any future events or circumstances 

table of contents there are certain critical accounting estimates that we believe require significant judgment in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
we have identified below our accounting policies and estimates that we consider critical to our business operations and the understanding of our results of operations 
this is not a complete list of all of our accounting policies  and there may be other accounting policies that are significant to us 
for a detailed discussion on the application of these and our other accounting policies  see note to the consolidated financial statements included in this report 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the sales price is fixed or determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured 
revenue is recorded net of provisions for discounts  slotting fees and allowances in accordance with emerging issues task force eitf no 
 accounting for consideration given by a vendor to a customer including a reseller of the vendor s products 
such incentives are recognized as a reduction in revenue at the later of the date on which the related revenue is recognized or a commitment is made  except in the case of slotting which is recognized when the commitment is made 
with respect to our dsd and dtr channels  our products are sold on various terms for cash or credit 
our credit terms  which are established in accordance with local and industry practices  typically require payment within days of delivery 
we recognize revenue upon receipt of our products by our distributors and retail customers in accordance with written sales terms  net of provisions for discounts and allowances 
all sales to distributors and customers are final sales  however  in limited instances  due to product quality issues or distributor terminations  we may accept returned product 
with respect to our csd channel  we recognize revenue from the sale of concentrate to national beverage corp 
on a gross basis upon receipt of concentrate by national beverage 
the selling price and terms of sale of concentrate to national beverage are determined in accordance with our manufacturing and distribution agreement with them 
our credit terms from the sale of concentrate typically require payment within days of delivery 
generally we do not accept returns on sales of concentrate to national beverage  however  in limited instances  due to product quality or other custom package commitments  we may accept returned product 
licensing revenue is recorded when we receive a sale confirmation from the third party 
inventory we hold raw materials and finished goods inventories  which are manufactured and procured based on our sales forecasts 
we value inventory at the lower of cost or market  which is based on estimated net realizable value  and include adjustments for estimated obsolescence  on a first in first out basis 
these valuations are subject to customer acceptance  planned and actual product changes  demand for the particular products  and our estimates of future realizable values based on these forecasted demands 
we regularly review inventory detail to determine whether a write down is necessary 
we consider various factors in making this determination  including recent sales history and predicted trends  industry market conditions and general economic conditions 
the amount and timing of write downs for any period could change if we make different judgments or use different estimates 
we also determine whether an allowance for obsolescence is required on products that are over months from production date or any changes related to market conditions  slow moving inventory or obsolete products 
deferred income taxes the determination of our provision of income taxes requires significant judgment  the use of estimates  and the interpretation and application of complex tax laws 
to the extent management believes it is more likely than not that we will not be able to utilize some or all of our deferred tax assets prior to their expiration  we are required to establish valuation allowances against that portion of deferred tax assets 
the determination of required valuation allowances involves significant management judgment and is based upon our best estimate of anticipated taxable profits in various jurisdictions with which the deferred tax assets are associated 
changes in expectations could result in significant adjustments to the valuation allowance and material changes to our provision for income taxes 

table of contents during the fourth quarter of fiscal  we concluded that it was appropriate to record a charge of approximately million to establish a full valuation allowance against the tax benefits arising from losses in our us operations 
as of december   we had incurred cumulative losses in recent years with respect to our us operations  and we increased our cumulative losses in our us operations by million in in accordance with the relevant accounting guidance  we considered future projections of us pretax income as a material factor in our analysis of the realizability of our net us deferred tax assets 
nonetheless  it was difficult to overcome the cumulative losses and thus  we continue to establish a full valuation allowance against our us deferred tax assets 
this is due to the fact that the relevant accounting guidance puts more weight on the negative objective evidence of cumulative losses in recent years than the positive subjective evidence of future projections of pretax income 
we analyze the realizability of our deferred tax assets on a quarterly basis  but reasonably expect to continue to record a full valuation allowance on future us tax benefits until we sustain an appropriate level of taxable income through improved us operations and tax planning strategies 
no valuation allowance was recorded for deferred tax assets recorded in the canadian subsidiary  as this subsidiary remains profitable 
we adopted the provisions of financial accounting standards board interpretation no 
fin on january  the adoption of fin did not impact the consolidated financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
we believe that we have appropriate support for the income tax positions taken and to be taken on our tax returns and that our accruals for tax liabilities are adequate for all open years based on an assessment of many factors including past experience and interpretations of tax law applied to the facts of each matter 
no accruals exist under fin as of december  item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk in the normal course of our business  our financial position is routinely subject to a variety of risks 
the principal market risks ie  the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices to which we are exposed are fluctuations in energy and commodity prices affecting the cost of raw materials including  but not limited to  increases in the price of bottles  pet plastic bottles  as well as cane sugar  and the limited availability of certain raw materials and co packer capacity 
we are also subject to market risks with respect to the cost of commodities because our ability to recover increased costs through higher pricing is limited by the competitive environment in which we operate 
we mitigate the risk of fluctuations in commodity prices through the purchase commitments we have for glass and sugar  which provide for a majority of our forecasted material demand 
we have entered into fixed price purchase commitments with three pure cane sugar suppliers and one glass supplier for one to two year terms 
we are still subject to freight surcharges in addition to these agreements  but anticipate a reduction in due to lower fuel prices 
with respect to foreign currency risk  approximately of sales are international and primarily are comprised of sales to canada 
as a result  we are subject to risk from changes in foreign exchange rates 
these changes result in cumulative translation adjustments  which are included in accumulated other comprehensive income loss 
we do not consider the potential loss resulting from a hypothetical adverse change in quoted canadian exchange rates  as of december   to be material 
additionally  we may be subject to interest rate risk on our investment portfolio to the extent we maintain an investment portfolio 
we are also subject to other risks associated with the business environment in which we operate  including the collectibility of accounts receivable and obsolescence of inventory due to changes in market conditions or new product initiatives 
we believe that our exposure to these risks as of december  is not material 
we do not use derivative financial instruments to protect ourselves from fluctuations in interest rates or foreign currency fluctuations 
we have entered into one to to two year agreements with our sugar suppliers for the supply of sugar at fixed prices 
we have also entered into a two year agreement with our glass supplier for the supply of glass at fixed prices 
we do not use futures contracts to hedge against fluctuations in commodity prices
