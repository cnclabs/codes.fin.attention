business overview we are a publicly traded specialty insurance company and risk management organization offering a full range of insurance products and services  focused on niche and specialty program business  which we believe is under served by the standard insurance market 
program business refers to an aggregation of individually underwritten risks that have some unique characteristic and are distributed through a select group of focused general agencies  retail agencies and program administrators 
we perform the majority of underwriting and claims services associated with these programs 
we also provide property and casualty insurance coverage and services through programs and specialty risk management solutions for agents  professional and trade associations  public entities and small to medium sized insureds 
in addition  we also operate as an insurance agency representing unaffiliated insurance companies in placing insurance coverages for policyholders 
we define our business segments as specialty insurance operations and agency operations 
on july   our merger with procentury corporation procentury was completed merger 
under the terms of the merger agreement  procentury shareholders were entitled to receive  for each procentury common share  either in cash or meadowbrook common stock based on a exchange ratio  subject to adjustment as described within the merger agreement 
in accordance with the merger agreement  the stock price used in determining the final cash and share consideration portion of the purchase price was based on the volume weighted average sales price of a share of meadowbrook common stock for the day trading period ending on the sixth trading day before the completion of the merger  or 
based upon the final proration  the total purchase price was million  of which million consisted of cash  million in newly issued common stock  and approximately million in transaction related costs 
the total number of common shares issued for purposes of the stock portion of the purchase price was million shares 
procentury is a specialty insurance company  which primarily underwrites general liability  commercial property  environmental  garage keepers  commercial multi peril  commercial auto  surety  and marine insurance primarily in the excess and surplus lines  or non admitted market through a select group of general agents 
the excess and surplus lines market provides insurance coverage for customers with hard to place risks that standard or admitted insurers typically choose not to insure 
meadowbrook insurance group  inc 
management s discussion and analysis continued five months of earnings of procentury are included in our financial statements as of and for the year ended december  in july  we completed an offering of  additional shares of newly issued common stock at per share 
the gross proceeds of the offering were million 
the net proceeds were million 
the net proceeds from the offering are being utilized to support organic growth within our underwriting operations  to fund select acquisitions and other general corporate purposes 
upon receipt of the net proceeds  we also reduced our outstanding line of credit balance from million to zero 
specialty insurance operations our specialty insurance operations segment  which includes insurance company specialty programs and fee for service specialty or managed programs  focuses on specialty or niche insurance business 
our specialty insurance operations provide services and coverages tailored to meet specific requirements of defined client groups and their members 
these services include risk management consulting  claims administration and handling  loss control and prevention  and reinsurance placement  along with various types of property and casualty insurance coverage  including workers compensation  commercial multiple peril  general liability  commercial auto liability  excess and surplus lines  environmental  garage keepers  surety  legal  professional liability  errors and omissions  inland marine  and other lines of business  where we see a market need and a profit potential 
insurance coverage is provided primarily to associations or similar groups of members and to specified classes of business of our agents 
we recognize revenue related to the services and coverages the specialty insurance operations provides within seven categories net earned premiums  management fees  claims fees  loss control fees  reinsurance placement  investment income  and net realized gains losses 
we included the results of operations related to procentury within the specialty insurance operations 
therefore  specialty insurance operations include five months of results for procentury 
with a fee for service or managed program  we earn revenue by providing certain operational functions and other services to a client s risk bearing entity  but generally do not share in the operating results of the program 
the fees we receive from these programs are generally either a fixed amount or based on a percentage of premium serviced or claim count 
we provide three broad types of insurance company programs  including fully insured  captives and client risk sharing programs 
with a client risk sharing program  our insurance company subsidiaries underwrite individual primary insurance policies for members of a group or association  or a specific industry and then share the operating results with the client or client group through a reinsurance agreement with a captive or rent a captive 
in some instances  a captive owned by a client or client group reinsures a portion of the risk on a quota share basis 
a captive is an insurance company or reinsurance company  which is formed for the purpose of insuring or reinsuring risks related to the businesses of its shareholders or members 
a rent a captive allows organizations to obtain the benefits of a captive insurance company  without the initial costs and capital investment required to form their own captive 
this is often an interim step utilized by groups and associations prior to forming their own captive 
as part of its participation in a rent a captive  the client group purchases redeemable preferred stock of our unconsolidated subsidiary 
these shares entitle the client group to participate in profits and losses of the program through a dividend or additional capital contribution 
dividends or additional capital contributions are determined and accrued on the basis of underwriting profits or losses plus investment income on trust accounts less costs 
the captive and rent a captive structures are licensed reinsurance companies  which have a self sustaining integrated set of activities and assets  and are in the reinsurance business for the purpose of providing a return to their investors  who are the shareholders primary beneficiaries of the captive company 
the primary beneficiaries have their own equity at risk  decision making authority  and the ability to absorb losses 
therefore  the transactions associated with the captive and rent a captive structures are accounted for under the provisions of sfas no 
 accounting and reporting for reinsurance of short duration and long duration contracts 
meadowbrook insurance group  inc 
management s discussion and analysis continued in addition to premium revenue and investment income from our net retained portion of the operating results  we may also be compensated through the receipt of fees for policy issuance services and acquisition costs  captive administration  reinsurance placement  loss prevention services  and claims administrative and handling services 
in addition  we may benefit from the fees our risk management subsidiary earns for services we perform on behalf of our insurance company subsidiaries 
these fees are eliminated upon consolidation 
however  the fees associated with the captive s portion of the program are reimbursed through a ceding commission 
for financial reporting purposes  ceding commissions are treated as a reduction in underwriting expenses 
with fully insured programs  we provide our insurance products without a risk bearing mechanism and derive revenue from net earned premiums and investment income 
fully insured programs are generally developed in response to specific market opportunities and may evolve into a risk sharing arrangement 
agency operations we earn commission revenue through the operation of our retail property and casualty insurance agencies  located in michigan  california  and florida 
the agency operations produce commercial  personal lines  life  and accident and health insurance  for more than fifty unaffiliated insurance carriers 
the agency produces an immaterial amount of business for our affiliated insurance company subsidiaries 
in recent years  we have derived our revenue from the following sources in thousands for the years ended december  revenues net earned premiums management fees claims fees loss control fees reinsurance placement investment income net realized losses gains specialty insurance operations agency operations holding company interest income earned intersegment revenue consolidated revenue critical accounting policies general in certain circumstances  we are required to make estimates and assumptions that affect amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements and related footnotes 
we evaluate these estimates and assumptions on an on going basis based on a variety of factors 
there can be no assurance  however  the actual results will not be materially different than our estimates and assumptions  and that reported results of operation will not be affected by accounting adjustments needed to reflect changes in these estimates and assumptions 
we believe the following policies are the most sensitive to estimates and judgments 
meadowbrook insurance group  inc 
management s discussion and analysis continued losses and loss adjustment expenses significant periods of time can elapse between the occurrence of a loss  the reporting of the loss to the insurer  and the insurer s payment of that loss 
to recognize liabilities for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses lae  insurers establish reserves as balance sheet liabilities representing estimates of amounts needed to pay reported and unreported net losses and lae 
we establish a liability for losses and lae  which represents case based estimates of reported unpaid losses and lae and actuarial estimates of incurred but not reported losses ibnr and lae 
such liabilities  by necessity  are based upon estimates and  while we believe the amount of our reserves is adequate  the ultimate liability may be greater or less than the estimate 
as of december  and  we have accrued million and million of gross loss and lae reserves  respectively 
components of losses and loss adjustment expense the following table sets forth our gross and net reserves for losses and lae based upon an underlying source of data  at december  in thousands case ibnr total direct assumed directly managed assumed residual markets assumed retroceded assumed other gross less ceded net directly managed represents business managed and processed by our underwriting  claims  and loss control departments  utilizing our internal systems and related controls 
residual markets represent mandatory pooled workers compensation business allocated to individual insurance company writers based on the insurer s market share in a given state 
the reserves referenced in the above table related to our direct and assumed business  which we directly manage and are established through transactions processed through our internal systems and related controls 
accordingly  the case reserves are established on a current basis  therefore there is no delay or lag in reporting of losses from a ceding company  and ibnr is determined utilizing various actuarial methods based upon historical data 
ultimate reserve estimates related to assumed business from residual markets are provided by individual states on a two quarter lag between the date of the evaluation and the receipt of the estimate from the national council on compensation insurance ncci  and include an estimated reserve based upon actuarial methods for this lag 
assumed business  which is subsequently retroceded to participating reinsurers  relates to business previously discontinued and now is in run off 
relative to assumed business from other sources  we receive case and paid loss data within a forty five day reporting period and develop our estimates for ibnr based on both current and historical data 
the completeness and accuracy of data received from cedants on assumed business that we do not manage directly is verified through monthly reconciliations to detailed statements  inception to date rollforwards of claim data  actuarial estimates of historical trends  field audits  and a series of management oversight reports on a program basis 
meadowbrook insurance group  inc 
management s discussion and analysis continued the following table sets forth our net case and ibnr reserves for losses and lae by line of business at december  in thousands net case net ibnr total workers compensation residual markets commercial multiple peril general liability commercial automobile other total claim reserving process and methodology when a claim is reported to one of our insurance company subsidiaries  for the majority of claims  our claims personnel within our risk management subsidiary will establish a case reserve for the estimated amount of the ultimate payment 
the amount of the reserve is primarily based upon a case by case evaluation of the type of claim involved  the circumstances surrounding each claim  and the policy provisions relating to the type of losses 
the estimate reflects the informed judgment of such personnel based on general insurance reserving practices  which focus on the ultimate probable cost of each reported claim  as well as the experience and knowledge of the claims person 
until the claim is resolved  these estimates are revised as deemed necessary by the responsible claims personnel based on subsequent developments  new information or periodic reviews of the claims 
in addition to case reserves and in accordance with industry practice  we maintain estimates of reserves for losses and lae incurred but not yet reported 
we project an estimate of ultimate losses and lae at each reporting date 
the difference between the projected ultimate loss and lae reserves and the case loss reserves and lae reserves  is carried as ibnr reserves 
by using both estimates of reported claims and ibnr determined using generally accepted actuarial reserving techniques  we estimate the ultimate liability for losses and lae  net of reinsurance recoverables 
in developing claim and claim adjustment expense reserve estimates  we perform a complete and detailed reserve analyses each quarter 
to perform this analysis  the data is organized at a reserve category level 
a reserve category can be a line of business such as commercial automobile liability  or it may be a particular geographical area within a line of business such as nevada workers compensation 
the reserves within a reserve category level are characterized as either short tail or long tail 
about of our reserves can be characterized as coming from long tail lines of business 
for long tail business  several years may lapse between the time the business is written and the time when all claims are settled 
our long tail exposures include workers compensation  commercial automobile liability  general liability  professional liability  products liability  excess  and umbrella 
short tail exposures include property  commercial automobile physical damage  a portion of ocean marine  and inland marine 
the analyses generally review losses both gross and net of reinsurance 
the standard actuarial methods that we use to project ultimate losses for both long tail and short tail exposures include  but are not limited to  the following paid development method incurred development method paid bornhuetter ferguson method reported bornhuetter ferguson method initial expected loss method paid roll forward method meadowbrook insurance group  inc 
management s discussion and analysis continued incurred roll forward method construction defect method all of these methods are consistently applied to every reserve category where they are applicable and they create indications for each accident year 
we use judgment selecting the best estimate from within these estimates or adjusted estimates 
as such  no one method or group of methods is strictly used for any line of business or reserve category within a line of business 
the individual selections by year are our best judgments based on the strengths and weaknesses of the method  indications  the inherent variability in the data and the specific modifications to selections for data characteristics 
a brief description of the methods and some discussion of their inherent strengths  weaknesses and uses are as follows paid development method 
this method uses historical  cumulative paid losses by accident year and develops those actual losses to estimated ultimate losses based upon the assumption that each accident year will develop to estimated ultimate cost in a manner that is analogous to prior years  adjusted as deemed appropriate for the expected effects of known changes in the claim payment environment  and to the extent necessary supplemented by analyses of the development of broader industry data 
selection of the paid loss pattern requires analysis of several factors including the impact of inflation on claims costs  the rate at which claims professionals make claim payments and close claims  the impact of judicial decisions  the impact of underwriting changes  the impact of large claim payments and other factors 
claim cost inflation itself requires evaluation of changes in the cost of repairing or replacing property  changes in the cost of medical care  changes in the cost of wage replacement  judicial decisions  legislative changes and other factors 
because this method assumes that losses are paid at a consistent rate  changes in any of these factors can impact the results 
since the method does not rely on case reserves  it is not directly influenced by changes in the adequacy of case reserves 
incurred development method 
this method uses historical  cumulative reported loss dollars by accident year and develops those actual losses to estimated ultimate losses based upon the assumption that each accident year will develop to estimated ultimate cost in a manner that is analogous to prior years  adjusted as deemed appropriate for the expected effects of known changes in the claim payment and case reserving environment  and to the extent necessary supplemented by analyses of the development of broader industry data 
since the method uses more data case reserves in addition to paid losses than the paid development method  the incurred development patterns may be less variable than paid patterns 
however  selection of the incurred loss pattern requires analysis of all of the factors listed in the description of the paid development method 
in addition  the inclusion of case reserves can lead to distortions if changes in case reserving practices have taken place and the use of case incurred losses may not eliminate the issues associated with estimating the incurred loss pattern subsequent to the most mature point available 
paid bornhuetter ferguson method 
this is a method that assigns partial weight to initial expected losses for each accident year and partial weight to observed paid losses 
the weights assigned to the initial expected losses decrease as the accident year matures 
the method assumes that only future losses will develop at the expected loss ratio level 
the percent of paid loss to ultimate loss implied from the paid development method is used to determine what percentage of ultimate loss is yet to be paid 
the use of the pattern from the paid development method requires consideration of all factors listed in the description of the paid development method 
the estimate of losses yet to be paid is added to current paid losses to estimate the ultimate loss for each year 
this method will react very slowly if actual ultimate loss ratios are different from expectations due to changes not accounted for by the expected loss ratio calculation 
meadowbrook insurance group  inc 
management s discussion and analysis continued reported bornhuetter ferguson method 
this is a method that assigns partial weight to the initial expected losses and partial weight to observed reported loss dollars paid losses plus case reserves 
the weights assigned to the initial expected losses decrease as the accident year matures 
the use of case incurred losses instead of paid losses can result in development patterns that are less variable than paid patterns 
however  the inclusion of case reserves can lead to distortions if changes in case reserving have taken place  and the method requires analysis of all the factors that need to be reviewed for the expected loss ratio and incurred development methods 
initial expected loss method 
this method is used directly  and as an input to the bornhuetter ferguson methods 
initial expected losses for an accident year are based on adjusting prior accident year projections to the current accident year levels using underlying loss trends  rate changes  benefit changes  reinsurance structure and cost changes and other pertinent adjustments specific to the line of business 
this method may be useful if loss development patterns are inconsistent  losses emerge very slowly  or there is relatively little loss history from which to estimate future losses 
the selection of the expected loss ratio requires analysis of loss ratios from earlier accident years or pricing studies and analysis of inflationary trends  frequency trends  rate changes  underwriting changes  and other applicable factors 
paid roll forward method 
this method adjusts prior estimates of ultimate losses based on the actual paid loss emergence in the quarter compared to the expected emergence 
it is useful in determining reserves that avoid overreacting to ordinary fluctuations in the development patterns 
incurred roll forward method 
this method adjusts prior estimates of ultimate losses based on the actual case incurred loss emergence in the quarter compared to the expected emergence 
it may also be useful in determining reserves that avoid overreacting to ordinary fluctuations in the development patterns and generally reacts faster than the paid roll forward method 
claims for short tail lines of business settle more quickly than long tail lines of business  and in general  loss development factors for short tail lines are smaller than long tail lines 
for long tail lines  we tend to rely on initial expected loss methods throughout the current accident year then move to development factor based methods for older accident years 
development methods on short tail lines are generally reliable in the third and fourth quarter of the initial accident year and recorded loss ratios reflect a blend of the development and forecast methods 
short tail lines represent of our total reserves at december  construction defect method 
the provision for ibnr loss and alae for construction defect claims is analyzed by projecting the number of ibnr claim counts and applying a selected severity ie  a frequency severity type approach 
the provision for development on reported claims is projected using a methodology similar to the incurred loss development approach described above 
however  the claims are organized in a report year rather than accident year format 
the advantage of this is that it substantially reduces the length or tail of the development 
the reserve categories where the above methods are not applicable are few 
the largest of these is our workers compensation residual market reserve category  where we utilize detailed reserve analyses performed by the industry statistical agency ncci in making our estimates 
we adjust these estimates for timing differences in the reporting of the data 
the other reserve categories that deviate from the above methods are smaller  as a group constituting approximately one percent of the total reserves 
each of the methods listed above requires the selection and application of parameters and assumptions 
for all but the initial expected loss method  the key assumptions are the patterns with which our aggregate claims data will be paid or will emerge over time development patterns 
these patterns incorporate inherent assumptions of claims cost inflation rates and trends in the frequency of claims  both overall and by severity of claim 
these are affected by underlying loss trends  rate changes  benefit changes  reinsurance meadowbrook insurance group  inc 
management s discussion and analysis continued structure and cost changes and other pertinent adjustments which are explicit key assumptions underlying the initial expected loss method 
each of these key assumptions is discussed in the following paragraphs 
to analyze the development patterns  we compile  to the extent available  long term and short term historical data for our insurance subsidiaries  organized in a manner which provides an indication of the historical development patterns 
to the extent that the historical data may provide insufficient information about future patterns whether due to environmental changes such as legislation or due to the small volume or short history of data for some segments of our business benchmarks based on industry data  and forecasts made by industry rating bureaus regarding the effect of legislative benefit changes on such patterns  may be used to supplement  adjust  or replace patterns based on our insurance companies historical data 
actuarial judgment is required in selecting the patterns to apply to each segment of data being analyzed  and our views regarding current and future claim patterns are among the factors that enter into our establishment of the reserve for losses and lae at each balance sheet date 
when short term averages or external rate bureau analyses indicate the claims patterns are changing from historical company or industry patterns  the new or forecasted information typically is factored into the methodologies 
when new claims emergence or payment patterns have appeared in the actual data repeatedly over multiple evaluations  those new patterns are given greater weight in the selection process 
because some claims are paid over many years  the selection of claim emergence and payment patterns involves judgmentally estimating the manner in which recently occurring claims will develop for many years and at times  decades in the future 
when it is likely the actual development will occur in the distant future  the potential for actual development to differ substantially from historical patterns or current projections is increased 
this process assumes that past experience  adjusted for the effects of current developments and anticipated trends  is an appropriate basis for predicting future events 
in particular  the development factor based methods all have as a key assumption that the development of losses in the future will follow a pattern similar to those measured by past experience and as adjusted either explicitly or by actuarial judgment 
there is no precise method for subsequently evaluating the impact of any specific factor on the adequacy of reserves  because the eventual deficiency or redundancy is affected by multiple and varied factors 
with respect to the ultimate estimates for losses and lae  the key assumptions remained consistent for the years ended december  and variability of claim reserve estimates by its nature  the estimate of ultimate losses and lae is subject to variability due to differences between our assumptions and actual events in the future 
although many factors influence the actual cost of claims and our corresponding reserve estimates  we do not measure and estimate values for all of these variables individually 
this is due to the fact that many of the factors known to impact the cost of claims cannot be measured directly  such as the impact on claim costs due to economic inflation  coverage interpretations and jury determinations 
in most instances  we rely on our historical experience or industry information to estimate the values for the variables that are explicitly used in our reserve analyses 
we assume that the historical effect of these unmeasured factors  which is embedded in our experience or industry experience  is representative of the future effects of these factors 
where we have reason to expect a change in the effect of one of these factors  we perform analyses to perform the necessary adjustments 
one implicit assumption underlying development patterns is that the claims inflation trends will continue into the future similar to their past patterns 
to estimate the sensitivity of the estimated ultimate loss and settlement expense payments to an unexpected change in inflationary trends  our actuarial department derives expected payment patterns separately for each major line of business 
these patterns were applied to the december  loss and settlement expense reserves to generate estimated annual incremental loss and meadowbrook insurance group  inc 
management s discussion and analysis continued settlement expense payments for each subsequent calendar year 
then  for the purpose of sensitivity testing  an explicit annual inflationary variance of one percent was added to the inflationary trend that is implicitly embedded in the estimated payment pattern  and revised incremental loss and settlement expense payments were calculated 
general inflation trends have been fairly stable over the past several years but there have been fluctuations of one to two percent over the past ten years and therefore we used a one percent annual inflation variance factor 
the effect differed by line of business but overall was a three percent change in reserve adequacy or approximately million effect on after tax net income 
a variance of this type would typically be recognized in loss and settlement expense reserves and  accordingly  would not have a material effect on liquidity because the claims have not been paid 
an explicit assumption used in the analysis is the set of initial expected loss ratios ielrs used in the current accident year reserve projections and in some of the prior accident year ultimate loss indications 
to estimate the sensitivity of the estimated ultimate loss to a change in ielrs  the actuarial department recasted the loss reserve indications using a set of ielrs all one percent higher than the final ielrs 
the effect differed by line of business but overall a one percent change in reserve adequacy or a million effect on after tax net income 
often the loss ratios by line of business will vary from the ielr in different directions causing them to partially offset each other 
a variance of this type would typically be recognized in loss and settlement expense reserves and  accordingly  would not have a material effect on liquidity because the claims have not been paid 
the other factors having influence upon the loss and lae reserve levels are too numerous and interdependent to efficiently model and test for sensitivity 
likewise  the development factors by reserve category and age are too numerous to model and test for sensitivity 
instead  ranges are estimated by reserve category considering past history  fluctuations in the development patterns  emerging issues  trends and other factors 
the ranges are compiled and the total range is estimated considering the sensitivity to all of the underlying factors together 
the resulting range is our best estimate of the expected ongoing variability in the loss reserves 
historic development as shown within the analysis of loss and loss adjustment expense development table has been five percent or less in the last four years but was ten to twenty eight percent in the years prior to the underwriting and reserving shift in at that time  we concentrated our efforts on eliminating underwriting relationships where we had substantial liabilities above an aggregate exposure retained by risk sharing associations and captives 
for a large share of our business  we also accelerated the pace at which we brought the claim administration to our employees and away from outside third party administrators 
this change enabled us to more rapidly recognize trends and underlying loss patterns  and establish more accurate reserves in a timely manner 
our range of loss and lae reserves table shows that presently we estimate them as going from favorable development of to unfavorable of 
the range was evaluated based on the ultimate loss estimates from the actuarial methods described above 
pre tax impact on earnings from a variance in future loss payments and case reserves as of december  in thousands line of business minimum reserve range maximum reserve range workers compensation including residual markets commercial multiple peril general liability commercial automobile other total meadowbrook insurance group  inc 
management s discussion and analysis continued the sensitivity around our workers compensation reserves primarily reflects the size and the maturity of the underlying book of business 
our workers compensation reserves represent of our total reserves at december  the sensitivity around our commercial multiple peril general liability reserves primarily reflects the longer duration of reserves relating to our liability excess program  which started in  and construction defect exposure  which together represent approximately of the million reserves in this line of business as of december  these lines of business are subject to greater uncertainty than the remainder of our book of business 
with the procentury merger  our liability reserves represent slightly over of our total reserves as of december  the sensitivity around our commercial automobile reserves primarily reflects the speed of reporting of the underlying losses  as well as the maturity of the case law surrounding automobile liability 
the sensitivity around the other lines of business primarily reflects the size of the underlying book of business 
our other reserves represent of total reserves at december  a large portion of these reserves represent professional liability programs which tend to be claims made and reinsured at lower limits  therefore reducing the volatility that is inherent in a smaller book of business 
another large portion represents property claims  which have a shorter reporting and payout pattern than liability and workers compensation claims 
all of our reserves are sensitive to changes in the underlying claim payment and case reserving practices  as well as the other sources of variations mentioned above 
reinsurance recoverables reinsurance recoverables represent amounts currently due from reinsurers on paid losses and lae  amounts recoverable from reinsurers on case basis estimates of reported losses and lae  and amounts recoverable from reinsurers on actuarial estimates of ibnr losses and lae 
such recoverables  by necessity  are based upon estimates 
reinsurance does not legally discharge us from our legal liability to our insureds  but it does make the assuming reinsurer liable to us to the extent of the reinsurance ceded 
instead of being netted against the appropriate liabilities  ceded unearned premiums and reinsurance recoverables on paid and unpaid losses and lae are reported separately as assets in our consolidated balance sheets 
reinsurance recoverable balances are also subject to credit risk associated with the particular reinsurer 
in our selection of reinsurers  we continually evaluate their financial stability 
while we believe our reinsurance recoverables are collectible  the ultimate recoverable may be greater or less than the amount accrued 
at december  and  reinsurance recoverables on paid and unpaid losses were million and million  respectively 
in our risk sharing programs  we are subject to credit risk with respect to the payment of claims by our clients captive  rent a captive  large deductible programs  indemnification agreements  or on the portion of risk either ceded to the captives  or retained by the clients 
the capitalization and credit worthiness of prospective risk sharing partners is one of the factors we consider upon entering into and renewing risk sharing programs 
we collateralize balances due from our risk sharing partners through funds withheld trusts or stand by letters of credit issued by highly rated banks 
we have historically maintained an allowance for the potential uncollectibility of certain reinsurance balances due from some risk sharing partners  some of which may be in dispute 
at the end of each quarter  an analysis of these exposures is conducted to determine the potential exposure to uncollectibility 
at december   we believe this allowance is adequate 
to date  we have not  in the aggregate  experienced material difficulties in collecting balances from our risk sharing partners 
no assurance can be given  however  regarding the future ability of our risk sharing partners to meet their obligations

management s discussion and analysis continued valuation of investments  other than temporary impairments of securities  and unrealized losses on investments our investment securities are classified as available for sale 
investments classified as available for sale are available to be sold in the future in response to our liquidity needs  changes in market interest rates  tax strategies and asset liability management strategies  among other reasons 
available for sale securities are reported at fair value  with unrealized gains and losses reported in the accumulated other comprehensive income component of shareholders equity  net of deferred taxes and  accordingly  have no effect on net income 
however  if there is a decline in the fair value of an investment below its cost and the decline is considered other than temporary  the amount of decline below cost is charged to earnings 
the fair value for fixed maturity securities is largely determined by one of two primary pricing methods third party pricing service market prices or independent broker quotations 
prices from third party pricing services are often unavailable for securities that are rarely traded or are traded only in privately negotiated transactions and as a result  certain of our securities are priced via independent broker quotations 
short term investments are carried at amortized cost  which approximates fair value 
our investment portfolio is primarily invested in debt securities classified as available for sale  with a concentration in fixed income securities of a high quality 
our investment philosophy is to maximize after tax earnings and maintain significant investments in tax exempt bonds 
our policy for the valuation of temporarily impaired securities is to determine impairment based on analysis of  but not limited to  the following factors rating downgrade or other credit event eg  failure to pay interest when due  financial condition and near term prospects of the issuer  including any specific events which may influence the operations of the issuer such as changes in technology or discontinuance of a business segment  prospects for the issuer s industry segment  and intent and ability to retain the investment for a period of time sufficient to allow for anticipated recovery in fair value 
we evaluate our investments in securities to determine other than temporary impairment  no less than quarterly 
investments that are deemed other than temporarily impaired are written down to their estimated net fair value and the related losses recognized in income 
additionally  for certain securitized financial assets with contractual cash flows including asset backed securities  fasb emerging issues task force eitf  recognition of interest income and impairment on purchased and retained beneficial interests in securitized financial assets  requires us to periodically update our best estimate of cash flows over the life of the security 
if management determines that the fair value of a securitized financial asset is less than its carrying amount and there has been a decrease in the present value of the estimated cash flows since the last revised estimate  considering both timing and amount  then an other than temporary impairment is recognized 
after review of our investment portfolio in relation to our policy  we recorded a pre tax realized loss of million  for the year ended december   related to certain preferred stock investments  including fannie mae  freddie mac  and lehman brothers investments  as well as several corporate bonds and asset backed and mortgage backed securities 
there were no impaired investments written down in or at december  and  we had and securities that were in an unrealized loss position  respectively 
of the securities held at december   twenty three had an aggregate million and million fair value and unrealized loss  respectively  and have been in an unrealized loss position for more than twelve months 
at december   had an aggregate million and million fair value and unrealized loss  respectively  and have been in an unrealized loss position for more than twelve months 
as of december  and  gross unrealized losses on available for sale securities were million and million  respectively

management s discussion and analysis continued revenue recognition premiums written  which include direct  assumed  and ceded premiums are recognized as earned on a pro rata basis over the life of the policy term 
unearned premiums represent the portion of premiums written that are applicable to the unexpired terms of an in force policy 
provisions for unearned premiums on reinsurance assumed from others are made on the basis of ceding reports when received and actuarial estimates 
for the year ended december   total assumed written premiums were million  of which million relates to assumed business we manage directly 
the remaining million of assumed written premiums relates to residual markets  mandatory assumed pool business  and other unaffiliated entities 
assumed premium estimates are specifically related to the mandatory assumed pool business from the ncci  or residual market business 
the pools cede workers compensation business to participating companies based upon the individual company s market share by state 
the activity is reported from the ncci to participating companies on a two quarter lag 
to accommodate this lag  we estimate premium and loss activity based on historical and market based results 
historically  we have not experienced any material difficulties or disputes in collecting balances from ncci  and therefore  no provision for doubtful accounts is recorded related to the assumed premium estimate 
in addition  certain premiums are subject to retrospective premium adjustments 
premium is recognized over the term of the insurance contract 
during the three months ended march   we recorded a million adjustment to reduce a premium accrual associated with a discontinued retrospectively rated policy with one of its risk sharing partners 
fee income  which includes risk management consulting  loss control  and claims services  is recognized during the period the services are provided 
depending on the terms of the contract  claims processing fees are recognized as revenue over the estimated life of the claims  or the estimated life of the contract 
for those contracts that provide services beyond the expiration or termination of the contract  fees are deferred in an amount equal to management s estimate of our obligation to continue to provide services in the future 
commission income  which includes reinsurance placement  is recorded on the later of the effective date or the billing date of the policies on which they were earned 
commission income is reported net of any sub producer commission expense 
any commission adjustments that occur subsequent to the earnings process are recognized upon notification from the insurance companies 
profit sharing commissions from insurance companies are recognized when determinable  which is when such commissions are received 
we review  on an ongoing basis  the collectibility of our receivables and establish an allowance for estimated uncollectible accounts 
as of december  and  the allowance for uncollectibles on receivables was million and million  respectively 
legal contingencies we are subject at times to various claims  lawsuits and proceedings relating principally to alleged errors or omissions in the placement of insurance  claims administration  consulting services and other business transactions arising in the ordinary course of business 
where appropriate  we vigorously defend such claims  lawsuits and proceedings 
some of these claims  lawsuits and proceedings seek damages  including consequential  exemplary or punitive damages  in amounts that could  if awarded  be significant 
most of the claims  lawsuits and proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business are covered by errors and omissions insurance or other appropriate insurance 
in terms of deductibles associated with such insurance  we have established provisions against these items  which are believed to be adequate in light of current information and legal advice 
in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies  if it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred as of the date of the financial statements and the amount of loss is estimable  an accrual is provided for the costs to resolve these claims in our consolidated meadowbrook insurance group  inc 
management s discussion and analysis continued financial statements 
period expenses related to the defense of such claims are included in other operating expenses in the accompanying consolidated statements of income 
we  with the assistance of outside counsel  adjust such provisions according to new developments or changes in the strategy in dealing with such matters 
on the basis of current information  we do not expect the outcome of the claims  lawsuits and proceedings to which we are subject to  either individually  or in the aggregate  will have a material adverse effect on our financial condition 
however  it is possible that future results of operations or cash flows for any particular quarter or annual period could be materially affected by an unfavorable resolution of any such matters 
goodwill goodwill represents the excess of the cost over the fair value of net assets of subsidiaries acquired and was million  or of total assets  as of december  as required by sfas no 
goodwill and other intangible assets  we no longer amortize goodwill and  at least annually  we test all existing goodwill for impairment using a fair value approach  on a reporting unit basis 
our annual assessment date for goodwill impairment testing is october st 
we test for impairment more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that there may be an impairment to goodwill 
based on our most recent evaluation of goodwill impairment  we determined that no impairment of goodwill exists 
refer to note goodwill and other intangible assets for further discussion relating to our reporting units 
deferred policy acquisition costs commissions and other costs of acquiring insurance business that vary with and are primarily related to the production of new and renewal business are deferred and amortized over the terms of the policies or reinsurance treaties to which they relate 
investment earnings are anticipated in determining the recoverability of such deferred amounts 
we reduce these costs for premium deficiencies 
there were no premium deficiencies for the years ended december   and federal income taxes we provide for federal income taxes based on amounts we believe we ultimately will owe 
inherent in the provision for federal income taxes are estimates regarding the deductibility of certain items and the realization of certain tax credits 
in the event the ultimate deductibility of certain items or the realization of certain tax credits differs from estimates  we may be required to significantly change the provision for federal income taxes recorded in the consolidated financial statements 
any such change could significantly affect the amounts reported in the consolidated statements of income 
we utilize the asset and liability method of accounting for income tax 
under this method  deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date 
valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce the deferred tax assets to the amounts more likely than not to be realized 
results of operations executive overview over the last half of the year  there have been many well documented events that have occurred in the global economy and financial markets  some of which adversely impacted our results 
among those events was the impact on our investment portfolio primarily because of impairments we recorded related to certain meadowbrook insurance group  inc 
management s discussion and analysis continued preferred stock investments  which primarily consisted of fannie mae  freddie mac  and lehman brothers investments 
in addition  procentury s results since the consummation of the merger included property losses from hurricanes gustav and ike 
despite these unusual factors  our core operating results continue to be favorable 
our results include the positive impact from continued selective growth  coupled with adherence to strict corporate underwriting guidelines  expense savings from the elimination of the fronting fees paid prior to achievement of our am best upgrade to a excellent  as well as a focus on current accident year price adequacy 
in addition  we continue to experience a favorable impact due to the further leveraging of our fixed costs  which has helped reduce our expense ratio 
our generally accepted accounting principles gaap combined ratio improved percentage points to in from in net operating income  excluding amortization  increased million  or  to million  compared to million in gross written premium increased million  or  to million  compared to million in included in this increase was million in gross written premiums related to procentury 
excluding the gross written premiums related to procentury  the increase was primarily the result of growth in new business from programs implemented in late and early during the year  new business written was million 
we anticipate further growth into as the annualized premiums of these programs continue to be realized 
in addition  we continue to experience selective growth within existing programs consistent with our corporate underwriting guidelines and our controls over price adequacy 
offsetting this growth was the loss of one program in which our pricing and financial targets were higher than our competition 
we believe that overall  the specialty insurance market will continue to be competitive in  but less than last year 
we continue to follow pricing guidelines mandated by our corporate underwriting guidelines 
throughout we experienced declining rates  and on average  meadowbrook s rates were down about  while procentury s were down by about 
we remain selective on new program implementation by focusing only on those programs that meet our underwriting guidelines and have a proven history of profitability 
we believe our actions in have set a solid foundation for and beyond  and we are excited about the ability to work from a position of strength  strength of our balance sheet and strength of our team 
we believe that the market will begin to firm  however we do not know when it will firm  and we view as a transition year for the industry 
our plans consider a range of scenarios in with outcomes along a continuum that includes market softening  a flat market and some firming to hardening 
procentury merger on july   we completed our merger with procentury 
the total purchase price  as determined in accordance with gaap  was million  of which million consisted of cash  million in newly issued common stock  and approximately million in transaction related costs 
the total number of common shares issued for the stock portion of the purchase price was approximately million shares 
the purchase price was calculated based upon the volume weighted average sales price of a share of our common stock for the day trading period ending the sixth trading day prior to completing the merger  or 
we financed the cash portion of the merger consideration with a combination of an million dividend from our insurance company subsidiary  star insurance company  available cash of million  and loan proceeds of approximately million 
as of september   we recorded million in goodwill from the procentury merger 
in addition  we recorded an increase to other intangible assets of approximately million and million related to agent relationships and trade names  respectively 
as of december   we recorded an increase to goodwill of million from the procentury merger 
this increase was primarily related to a million adjustment to record a deferred tax liability meadowbrook insurance group  inc 
management s discussion and analysis continued related to the other intangible assets related to the agent relationships and the trade name 
the remaining increase to goodwill was primarily related to adjustments recorded to reflect updated information on certain accruals and related expenses as more refined information became available during our fourth quarter review 
since the completion of the merger  we have been pleased with the integration process 
we are executing on several revenue enhancement opportunities and leveraging the infrastructure as summarized below launching a new wholesale relationship in the midwest  fulfilling a surplus lines market need for an existing workers compensation partner in new england  expanding procentury products into states through our existing admitted market capability  capitalizing on enhanced business development capabilities by having a more comprehensive risk management offering and shared marketing platform  reorganization and development of claims expertise in our various offices  generation of reinsurance cost savings due to the increased size and diversity of the merged companies  and providing a workers compensation market to select qualified procentury wholesalers 
other items on january   we exercised our option to acquire the remainder of the economics related to the acquisition of the ussu business  by terminating the management agreement with the former owners for a cash payment of million 
as a result of this event  we recorded an increase to other intangible assets of approximately million and an increase to goodwill of approximately million 
on june   we announced the affirmation of am best company s financial strength rating of a excellent for our insurance company subsidiaries 
compared to net income for the year ended december   was million  or per dilutive share  compared to net income of million  or per dilutive share  for the comparable period of net operating income  a non gaap measure  increased million  or  to million  or per dilutive share  compared to net operating income of million  or per dilutive share for the comparable period in  with lower weighted average shares outstanding 
total weighted average shares outstanding for the year ended december  were  compared to  for the comparable period in this increase in the weighted average shares is primarily the result of the equity issued in connection with the procentury merger  as well as a full year impact of the shares issued in july related to our capital raise 
net income for the year ended december   was negatively impacted by after tax realized losses of million  or per diluted share  primarily as a result of the other than temporary impairments in certain preferred stock investments  which primarily related to freddie mac  fannie mae  and lehman brothers investments  but also included several corporate bonds and asset backed and mortgage backed securities 
in addition  net income for the year includes the after tax impact of the catastrophe losses related to hurricanes gustav and ike of million  or per diluted share 
in addition  net income included amortization expense of million  compared to million in we have experienced improvements in our expense ratio as we continue to benefit from the elimination of the fronting fees associated with our prior use of an unaffiliated insurance carrier s a rated policy forms 
our expense ratio also benefited by our ability to further leverage our fixed costs in the management company 
in addition  net investment income meadowbrook insurance group  inc 
management s discussion and analysis continued increased to million 
somewhat offsetting the positive variables was a substantial increase in amortization expense related to the acquisition of the ussu business in in addition  amortization expense increased due to the other intangibles recorded as a result of the procentury merger 
we continue to see favorable prior accident year reserve development  as well as selective premium growth consistent with our corporate underwriting guidelines and our controls over price adequacy 
revenues increased million  or  to million for the year ended december   from million for the comparable period in this increase reflects a million increase in net earned premiums  of which million related to procentury 
excluding the net earned premiums related to procentury  the increase was primarily the result of overall growth within our existing programs and new business we began underwriting in and our overall net commissions and fees were down  or million 
this decrease was primarily the result of a decrease in fees related to our new england based programs  caused by a decrease in premium volume due to reduced rates in the self insured markets on which the fees are based  because of mandatory rate reductions and an increase in competition 
in addition  this decrease reflects slightly lower agency commission revenue  which resulted from more competitive pricing in certain jurisdictions 
in  we converted a portion of the policies produced by ussu to our insurance company subsidiaries 
the intercompany management fees associated with that portion of the underwritten policies of the ussu business that we brought in house were million for the year ended december  these fees are now eliminated upon consolidation  thereby lowering net commissions and fees  but not impacting overall consolidated results 
in addition  the revenues reflect a million increase in investment income  which primarily reflects the increase in invested assets acquired in the procentury merger 
the remaining increase in investment income was partially the result of overall positive cash flow and the net proceeds received from our equity offering in july slightly offsetting the increases was the million in realized losses  primarily related to the other than temporary impairments recorded in the last half of  as previously indicated 
compared to net income improved million  or  to million  or per diluted share  in  from net income of million  or per diluted share  in this improvement primarily reflects growth in underwriting profits and an increase in net investment income 
net investment income increased primarily from an overall increase in average invested assets 
improvements in our overall underwriting results reflect continued favorable development on prior year losses and a slight reduction in the expense ratio 
these improvements were partially offset by amortization of intangibles and interest expense associated with our acquisition of the ussu business 
revenues increased million  or  to million for the year ended december   from million for the comparable period in this increase reflects a million  or  increase in net earned premiums 
the increase in net earned premiums was the result of selective growth consistent with our corporate underwriting guidelines and our controls over price adequacy  partially offset by a reduction in residual market premiums that are assigned to us as a result of a decrease in the estimate of the overall size of the residual market 
the increase in revenue was also due to an overall increase in fee for service revenue  primarily as a result of our acquisition of the ussu business 
total fees received in as a result of this acquisition were million 
in addition  the increase in revenue reflects a million increase in investment income  primarily the result of overall positive cash flow  a slight increase in yield and to a lesser extent the cash received from our equity offering in july meadowbrook insurance group  inc

management fees decreased million  or  to million for the year ended december   from in the comparable period in this decrease was primarily the result of a decrease in fees related to our new england based programs  primarily caused by a decrease in premium volume due to reduced rates in the self insured markets on which the fees are based  because of mandatory rate reductions and an increase in competition 
claim fees remained relatively flat for compared to net investment income increased million  or  to million in  from million in this increase is primarily the result of million in net investment income related to procentury 
overall invested assets increased due to the inclusion of procentury s invested assets  from the merger  which were million at december   coupled with the investing from positive cash flows from operations 
the positive cash flows from operations were due to favorable underwriting results  increased fee revenue  and the lengthening of the duration of our reserves 
the increase in the duration of our reserves reflects the impact of growth in our excess liability business  which was implemented at the end of this type of business has a longer duration than the average reserves on our other programs and is now a larger proportion of reserves 
in addition  the increase in average invested assets reflects cash flows from our equity offering in july the average investment yield for december  was  compared to in the current pre tax book yield was 
the current after tax book yield for the year ended meadowbrook insurance group  inc 
management s discussion and analysis continued december  was  compared to in the duration of the investment portfolio is years at december   compared to years at december  specialty insurance operations generated pre tax income of million for the year ended december   compared to pre tax income of million for the comparable period in this increase in pre tax income primarily demonstrates a continued improvement in underwriting results including favorable reserve development on prior accident years  selective growth in premium  adherence to our strict underwriting guidelines  and our overall leveraging of fixed costs 
in addition  this improvement was also attributable to an increase in net investment income 
partially offsetting these improvements were the previously mentioned other than temporary impairments recognized in the investment portfolio in the last half of the year  which primarily related to securities within the investment portfolio acquired with the merger 
in addition  these improvements were also partially offset by the impact of the losses incurred with the two hurricanes  as mentioned above 
the gaap combined ratio was for the year ended december   compared to for the same period in net loss and loss adjustment expenses lae increased million  or  to million for the year ended december   from million for the same period in our loss and lae ratio increased percentage points to in  from for the same period in this ratio is the unconsolidated net loss and lae in relation to net earned premiums 
net loss and lae includes million of net loss and lae expense related to procentury 
in addition  the loss and lae ratio of includes percentage points related to the previously mentioned catastrophe losses 
the loss and lae ratio includes favorable development of million  or percentage points  compared to favorable development of million  or percentage points in the increase in our favorable development in comparison to was primarily the result of an increase in favorable development within our auto liability and general liability lines of business due to lower frequency and severity and better than expected claims results 
this was somewhat offset by an increase in adverse development for an excess program 
additional discussion of our reserve activity is described below within the other items reserves section 
our expense ratio decreased percentage points to for the year ended december   from for the same period in this ratio is the unconsolidated policy acquisition and other underwriting expenses in relation to net earned premiums 
the decrease in our expense ratio reflects the anticipated decrease in commission due to the elimination of the fronting fees paid in to an unaffiliated insurance carrier to use their a rated policy forms  which was approximately percentage points incurred in  compared to no costs in despite a higher level of internal fixed costs at procentury  we achieved a percentage point improvement on the expense ratio from leveraging the fixed costs of the combined company 
in addition  lower insurance related assessments and a lower level of other underwriting expenses  such as loss control and commissions relating to mix of business also contributed to this improvement 
compared to revenues from specialty insurance operations increased million  or  to million for the year ended december   from million for the comparable period in net earned premiums increased million  or  to million for the year ended december   from million in the comparable period in this increase was the result of selective growth consistent with our corporate underwriting guidelines and our controls over price adequacy  partially offset by the reduction in residual market premiums and mandatory rate decreases in the nevada  florida and massachusetts workers compensation lines of business 
management fees increased million  or  to million  for the year ended december   from million for the comparable period in this increase was related to fees received as a result of our acquisition of the ussu business 
total fees received in as a result of the ussu acquisition meadowbrook insurance group  inc 
management s discussion and analysis continued were million 
slightly offsetting these fees was a slight decrease in fees in our northeast operations 
this decrease in fees primarily related to a decrease in premium volume due to reduced rates in the self insured markets on which the fees are based  because of mandatory rate reductions and an increase in competition 
claim fees remained relatively flat for compared to net investment income increased million  or  to million in  from million in average invested assets increased million  or  to million in  from million in the increase in average invested assets primarily relates to the cash flows from operations  resulting from continued favorable underwriting results  increased fee revenue  and the lengthening of the duration of our reserves 
the increase in the duration of our reserves reflects the impact of growth in our excess liability business  which was implemented at the end of this type of business has a longer duration than the average reserves on our other programs and is now a larger proportion of reserves 
in addition  the increase in average invested assets reflects cash flows from our equity offering in july 
the invested proceeds from the equity offering added approximately  to the overall net investment income for the year 
the average investment yield for was  compared to in the current pre tax book yield was 
the current after tax book yield was  compared to in this increase is primarily the result of the increase in market interest rates  and the purchase of assets of longer duration to take advantage of higher yields 
the duration of the investment portfolio is years at december   compared to years at december  specialty insurance operations generated pre tax income of million for the year ended december   compared to pre tax income of million for the year ended december  this increase in pre tax income primarily reflects expansion of cash margins on our fee revenue  an increase in net investment income  increased underwriting profits  favorable development in prior accident year reserves  and a slightly lower expense ratio 
the gaap combined ratio was for the year ended december   compared to for the comparable period in net losses and lae increased million  or  to million for the year ended december   from million for the same period in our loss and lae ratio improved percentage points to for the year ended december   from for the same period in this ratio is the unconsolidated net loss and lae in relation to net earned premiums 
this improvement reflects the impact of overall favorable development on prior accident year reserves of percentage points from the december  reserves 
the improvement was primarily within the workers compensation and professional liability lines of business  partially offset by an increase in the ultimate loss projections within the general liability line of business 
the unfavorable development within the general liability line of business reflects a claim reserving process change for an excess liability program 
our expense ratio for the year ended december  was  compared to in this ratio is the unconsolidated policy acquisition and other underwriting expenses in relation to net earned premiums 
agency operations the following table sets forth the revenues and results from operations from our agency operations in thousands for the years ended december  net commission pre tax income our agency operations include an allocation of corporate overhead  which includes expenses associated with accounting  information services  legal  and other corporate services 
the corporate overhead allocation excludes those expenses specific to the holding company 
for the years ended december    and  the allocation of corporate overhead to the agency operations segment was million  million  and million  respectively 
meadowbrook insurance group  inc 
management s discussion and analysis continued compared to revenue from agency operations  which consists primarily of agency commission revenue  decreased  or  to million for the year ended december   from million for the comparable period in this decrease primarily reflects regional competition and a softer insurance market within our mid to larger michigan accounts and isolated competitive pricing pressure in the california automobile market 
agency operations generated pre tax income  after the allocation of corporate overhead  of million for the year ended december   compared to million for the comparable period in the decrease in the pre tax income is primarily attributable to the decrease in agency commission revenue mentioned above 
compared to revenue from agency operations  which consists primarily of agency commission revenue  decreased  or  to million for the year ended december   from million for the comparable period in this decrease was primarily the result of a reduction in premium on client renewals due to a more competitive pricing environment primarily on larger michigan accounts 
agency operations generated pre tax income  after the allocation of corporate overhead  of million for the year ended december   compared to million for the comparable period in the decrease in the pre tax income was primarily attributable to the decrease in agency commission revenue mentioned above 
other items reserves at december   our best estimate for the ultimate liability for loss and lae reserves  net of reinsurance recoverables  was million 
we established a reasonable range of reserves of approximately million to million 
this range was established primarily by considering the various indications derived from standard actuarial techniques and other appropriate reserve considerations 
the following table sets forth this range by line of business in thousands minimum reserve maximum reserve line of business range range selected reserves workers compensation commercial multiple peril general liability commercial automobile other total net reserves includes residual markets reserves are reviewed by our internal actuaries for adequacy on a quarterly basis 
when reviewing reserves  we analyze historical data and estimate the impact of numerous factors such as per claim information  industry and our historical loss experience  legislative enactments  judicial decisions  legal developments in the imposition of damages  and changes in political attitudes  and trends in general economic conditions  including the effects of inflation 
this process assumes that past experience  adjusted for meadowbrook insurance group  inc 
management s discussion and analysis continued the effects of current developments and anticipated trends  is an appropriate basis for predicting future events 
there is no precise method for subsequently evaluating the impact of any specific factor on the adequacy of reserves  because the eventual deficiency or redundancy is affected by multiple factors 
the key assumptions used in our selection of ultimate reserves included the underlying actuarial methodologies  a review of current pricing and underwriting initiatives  an evaluation of reinsurance costs and retention levels  and a detailed claims analysis with an emphasis on how aggressive claims handling may be impacting the paid and incurred loss data trends embedded in the traditional actuarial methods 
with respect to the ultimate estimates for losses and lae  the key assumptions remained consistent for the years ended december    and for the year ended december   we reported a decrease in net ultimate loss estimates for accident years and prior of million  or of million of net loss and lae reserves  which include million of meadowbrook net loss and lae reserves at december  and million of procentury net loss and lae reserves at august  the decrease in net ultimate loss estimates reflected revisions in the estimated reserves as a result of actual claims activity in calendar year that differed from the projected activity 
there were no significant changes in the key assumptions utilized in the analysis and calculations of our reserves during and the major components of this change in ultimate loss estimates are as follows in thousands additional reserves at reserves at total incurred losses paid losses reserves at december  august  beginning current prior total current prior total december  line of business reserves year years incurred year years paid workers compensation residual markets commercial multiple peril general liability commercial automobile other net reserves reinsurance recoverable consolidated meadowbrook insurance group  inc

workers compensation excluding residual markets the projected net ultimate loss estimate for the workers compensation line of business excluding residual markets decreased million  or of net workers compensation reserves 
this net overall decrease reflects decreases of million  million  million and  in accident years   and  respectively 
the decreases reflect better than expected experience for many of our workers compensation programs  including a nevada  florida  and a countrywide association program 
actual losses reported during the quarter were less than expected given the prior actuarial assumptions 
the change in ultimate loss estimates for all other accident years was insignificant 
commercial multiple peril and general liability the commercial multiple peril line and general liability line of business had an increase in net ultimate loss estimates of million  or of net commercial multiple peril and general liability reserves 
the net increase reflects increases of million  million  million   and million in the ultimate loss estimates for accident years    and  respectively 
these increases were due to greater than expected claim emergence in two discontinued programs  an excess liability program  and a contractor s business program 
these increases were offset by decreases in the net ultimate loss estimates of million and  for accident years and  respectively 
the decreases in the net ultimate loss estimates for these accident years were due to better than expected claim emergence in a contractor s business program and procentury liability business 
the change in ultimate loss estimates for all other accident years was insignificant 
commercial automobile the projected net ultimate loss estimate for the commercial automobile line of business decreased million  or of net commercial automobile reserves 
this net overall decrease reflects decreases of million  million and  in accident years   and  respectively 
these decreases primarily reflect better than expected case reserve development on two california based programs 
these decreases were offset by an increase in the net ultimate loss estimates of  for accident year due to greater than expected claim emergence in a california based program and an excess liability program 
the change in ultimate loss estimates for all other accident years was insignificant 
meadowbrook insurance group  inc 
management s discussion and analysis continued other the projected net ultimate loss estimate for the other lines of business decreased million  or of net reserves 
this net decrease reflects reductions of million and million in net ultimate loss estimate for accident years and  respectively 
these decreases are primarily due to better than expected case reserve development during the calendar year in a professional liability program 
the change in ultimate loss estimates for all other accident years was insignificant 
residual markets the workers compensation residual market line of business had a decrease in net ultimate loss estimate of million  or of net reserves 
this decrease reflects reductions of   and million in accident years  and  respectively 
we record loss reserves as reported by the national council on compensation insurance ncci  plus a provision for the reserves incurred but not yet analyzed and reported to us due to a two quarter lag in reporting 
these changes reflect a difference between our estimate of the lag incurred but not reported and the amounts reported by the ncci in the year 
the change in ultimate loss estimates for all other accident years was insignificant 
salaries and employee benefits salaries and employee benefits increased million  or  to million in  from million in included in the million were salaries and employee benefits related to procentury of million 
excluding the salaries and employee benefits related to procentury  overall salaries and employee benefits would have decreased million 
this decrease primarily reflects a decrease in variable compensation 
the decrease in variable compensation  in comparison to  reflects the increase in our targeted measure for earning variable compensation 
in addition  this decrease was the result of a decrease in profit sharing commissions 
the decrease in profit sharing commissions was the result of our purchase of an excess liability book of business 
as a result of us owning the book of business  we no longer pay the profit sharing commissions 
salaries and employee benefits increased million  or  to million in  from million for the comparable period in this increase was primarily due to merit increases  our acquisition of the ussu business  and variable compensation attributable to our performance 
overall  our headcount remained flat for additional discussion of our variable compensation plan is described below under variable compensation 
other administrative expenses other administrative expenses increased million  or  to million  from million in this increase was primarily the result of slight increases in various general operating expenses  primarily due to the merger with procentury 
partially offsetting this increase was a reduction in the management fee previously associated with our acquisition of ussu 
in january  we exercised our option to purchase the remainder of the economics related to the acquisition of the ussu business  by terminating the management agreement with the former owners  thereby eliminating the management fee associated with the management agreement 
other administrative expenses increased million  or  to million in  from million in other administrative expenses increased in comparison to as a result of our acquisition of the ussu business  primarily due to the management fee associated with this acquisition

amortization expense amortization expense for   and was million  million  and  respectively 
amortization expense per dilutive share for   and was   and  respectively 
the increase in amortization expense primarily relates to the customer relationships acquired with the ussu business and the excess liability book of business acquired in late in addition  the increase in was also due to the amortization expense associated with the other intangibles recorded as a result of the procentury merger  related to the agent relationships and trade names 
interest expense interest expense for   and was million  million  and million  respectively 
interest expense is primarily attributable to our debentures  which are described within the liquidity and capital resources section of management s discussion and analysis  as well as our line of credit and term loan 
the overall increase in compared to  primarily relates to interest expense related to the term loan we used to finance a portion of the purchase price for the procentury merger 
in addition  the increase is partially due to the interest related to the trust preferred debt instruments acquired with the merger 
the average interest rate for the year ended december  was  compared to in this decrease reflects the impact of a lower cost of debt associated with the term loan  which had an average interest rate of in the average interest rate in was  which primarily related to the debentures 
interest expense for includes interest related to a temporary increase in our line of credit  which was associated with borrowings to fund the cash portion of the ussu business acquisition

this increase reflects the impact of a higher contribution of underwriting income to pre tax income and a lower contribution of net investment income in  compared to investment income represented of pre tax income for  compared to in this change in proportion reflects the improved underwriting results in  compared to the decrease in the effective tax rate from to primarily reflects a higher level of tax exempt securities in our investment portfolio  slightly offset by a higher level of income within our fee based operations  which are taxed at a rate 
other than temporary impairments our policy for the valuation of temporarily impaired securities is to determine impairment based on analysis of the following factors rating downgrade or other credit event eg  failure to pay interest when due  financial condition and near term prospects of the issuer  including any specific events which may meadowbrook insurance group  inc 
management s discussion and analysis continued influence the operations of the issuer such as changes in technology or discontinuance of a business segment  prospects for the issuer s industry segment  and our intent and ability to retain the investment for a period of time sufficient to allow for anticipated recovery in fair value 
we evaluate our investments in securities to determine other than temporary impairment  no less than quarterly 
investments that are deemed other than temporarily impaired are written down to their estimated net fair value and the related losses recognized in operations 
after review of our investment portfolio in relation to our policy  we recorded a pre tax realized loss of million  for the year ended december   related to certain preferred stock investments  including fannie mae  freddie mac  and lehman brothers investments  as well as several corporate bonds and asset backed and mortgage backed securities 
at december   we had securities that were in an unrealized loss position 
at december   twenty three of those investments  with an aggregate fair value of million and million unrealized loss  have been in an unrealized loss position for more than twelve months 
positive evidence considered  where applicable  in reaching our conclusion that the investments in an unrealized loss position are not other than temporarily impaired consisted of there were no specific credit events which caused concerns  there were no past due interest payments  our ability and intent to retain the investment for a sufficient amount of time to allow an anticipated recovery in value  and changes in fair value were considered normal in relation to overall fluctuations in interest rates 
for additional information regarding our other than temporary impairments and their fair value and amount of unrealized losses segregated by the time period the investment has been in an unrealized loss position  please refer to note investments 
liquidity and capital resources our principal sources of funds are insurance premiums  investment income  proceeds from the maturity and sale of invested assets from our insurance company subsidiaries  and risk management fees and agency commissions from our non regulated subsidiaries 
funds are primarily used for the payment of claims  commissions  salaries and employee benefits  other operating expenses  shareholder dividends  share repurchases  and debt service 
a significant portion of our consolidated assets represents assets of our insurance company subsidiaries that may not be transferable to the holding company in the form of dividends  loans or advances 
the restriction on the transferability to the holding company from our insurance company subsidiaries is limited by regulatory guidelines 
these guidelines generally specify that dividends can be paid only from unassigned surplus and only to the extent that all dividends in the current twelve months do not exceed the greater of of total statutory surplus as of the end of the prior fiscal year or of the statutory net income for the prior year 
using these criteria  the available ordinary dividend available to be paid from the insurance company subsidiaries during is million 
the insurance company subsidiaries  which include the insurance companies acquired in the procentury merger  paid ordinary dividends of million in in  the insurance company subsidiaries have the capacity to pay ordinary dividends of million without prior regulatory approval 
in addition to ordinary dividends  the insurance company subsidiaries have the capacity to pay million of extraordinary dividends with prior regulatory approval 
the insurance company subsidiaries ability to pay future dividends without advance regulatory approval is dependent upon maintaining a positive level of unassigned surplus  which in turn  is dependent upon the insurance company subsidiaries generating net income 
no statutory dividends were paid from our insurance company subsidiaries during we also generate operating cash flow from non regulated subsidiaries in the form of commission revenue  outside management fees  and intercompany management fees 
these sources of income are used to meet debt service  shareholders dividends  and other operating expenses of the holding company and non regulated meadowbrook insurance group  inc

the issuance costs associated with these debentures have been capitalized and are included in other assets on the balance sheet 
as of june   these issuance costs were being amortized over a seven year period as a component of interest expense 
the seven year amortization period represented management s best estimate of the estimated useful life of the bonds related to both the senior debentures and junior subordinated debentures 
beginning july   we reevaluated our best estimate and determined a five year amortization period to be a more accurate representation of the estimated useful life 
therefore  this change in amortization period from seven years to five years has been applied prospectively beginning july  meadowbrook insurance group  inc

we did not have an outstanding balance on our revolving credit facility as of december  the undrawn portion of the revolving credit facility is available to finance working capital and for general corporate purposes  including but not limited to  surplus contributions to our insurance company subsidiaries to support premium growth or strategic acquisitions 
these credit facilities replaced our prior revolving credit agreement  which was terminated upon the execution of the credit facilities 
at december   we did not have an outstanding balance on our former revolving line of credit 
the principal amount outstanding under the credit facilities provides for interest at libor  plus the applicable margin  or at our option  the base rate 
the base rate is defined as the higher of the lending bank s prime rate or the federal funds rate  plus  plus the applicable margin 
the applicable margin is determined by the consolidated indebtedness to consolidated total capital ratio

at our board meeting on july   our board of directors authorized us to purchase up to  shares of our common stock in market transactions for a period not to exceed twenty four months 
this share repurchase plan replaced the existing share repurchase plan authorized in october for the year ended december   we purchased and retired  shares of common stock for a total cost of approximately million 
we did not repurchase any common stock during cash dividends paid to common shareholders totaled million in dividends to common shareholders were not paid in or on february   our board of directors declared a quarterly dividend of per common share 
the dividend is payable on march   to shareholders of record as of march  when evaluating the declaration of a dividend  our board of directors considers a variety of factors  including but not limited to  cash flow  liquidity needs  results of operations  industry conditions  overall financial condition and other relevant factors 
as a holding company  the ability to pay cash dividends is partially dependent on dividends and other permitted payments from our insurance company subsidiaries 
procentury merger following the close of business on july   our merger with procentury was completed 
in accordance with the merger agreement  the stock price used in determining the final cash and share consideration portion of the purchase price was based on the volume weighted average sales price of a share of meadowbrook common stock for the day trading period ending on the sixth trading day before the completion of the merger  or

goodwill is not amortized  but is subject to at least annual impairment testing 
identifiable intangibles of million and million were recorded related to agent relationships and trade names  respectively 
as of december   we recorded an increase to goodwill of million 
this increase was primarily related to a million adjustment on the holding company to a deferred tax liability related to the other intangible assets related to the agent relationships and the trade name 
the remaining increase to goodwill was primarily related to adjustments recorded to reflect updated information on certain accruals and related expenses as more refined information became available during the fourth quarter of ussu acquisition effective january   we exercised our option to purchase the remainder of the economics related to the acquisition of the ussu business in april  by terminating the management agreement for a payment of million

the loss and loss adjustment expense payments do not have contractual maturity dates and the exact timing of payments cannot be predicted with certainty 
however  based upon historical payment patterns  we have included an estimate of our gross losses and loss adjustment expenses 
in addition  we have anticipated cash receipts on reinsurance recoverables on unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses of million  of which we estimate that these payments to be paid for losses and loss adjustment expenses for the periods less than one year  one to three years  three to five years  and more than five years to be million  million  million  and million  respectively  resulting in net losses and loss adjustment expenses of million  million  million  and million  respectively 
we maintain an investment portfolio with varying maturities that we believe will provide adequate cash for the payment of claims 
variable compensation we have established two variable compensation plans as an incentive for performance of our management team 
they consist of an annual bonus plan bonus plan and a long term incentive plan ltip 
the bonus plan is a discretionary cash bonus plan premised upon a targeted growth in net after tax earnings on a year over year basis 
each year  the compensation committee and our board of directors establish a new target based upon prior year performance and the forecasted performance levels anticipated for the following year 
the amount of the bonus pool is established by aggregating the individual targets for each participant  which is a percentage of salary 
at the end of the year  the compensation committee and the board of directors review our performance in relation to performance targets and then establish the total bonus pool to be utilized to pay cash bonuses to the management team based upon overall corporate and individual participant goals 
the ltip is intended to provide an incentive to management to improve our performance over a three year period  thereby increasing shareholder value 
the ltip is not discretionary and is based upon a target for an average three year return on beginning equity 
if the targets are met and all other terms and conditions are satisfied  the ltip awards are paid 
the ltip is paid in cash and in stock 
a participant s percentage is established by the compensation committee and the board of directors in advance of any new three year ltip award 
the stock component of the ltip is paid based upon the closing stock price at the beginning of the three year ltip performance period  in accordance with the terms and conditions of the ltip 
with the procentury merger our compensation committee and board of directors determined that our need for successfully integrating procentury associates into our ltip would be heightened and shareholder value increased  if all participants were in the same plan beginning in as a result  our compensation committee approved the termination of our current ltip effective december  and established a new plan for based on new performance targets 
based on this amendment  the current ltip participants would receive their award based on a two year performance period  rather than a three year period 
therefore  the total award would be approximately two thirds of the original three year meadowbrook insurance group  inc 
management s discussion and analysis continued award 
there were no accounting adjustments as a result of the amendment as there were no changes to the underlying plan  only an adjustment to the performance period 
both the bonus plan and the ltip are administered by the compensation committee and all awards are reviewed and approved by the board of directors at both inception and at distribution 
regulatory and rating issues the national association of insurance commissioners naic has adopted a risk based capital rbc formula to be applied to all property and casualty insurance companies 
the formula measures required capital and surplus based on an insurance company s products and investment portfolio and is used as a tool to evaluate the capital of regulated companies 
the rbc formula is used by state insurance regulators to monitor trends in statutory capital and surplus for the purpose of initiating regulatory action 
in general  an insurance company must submit a calculation of its rbc formula to the insurance department of its state of domicile as of the end of the previous calendar year 
these laws require increasing degrees of regulatory oversight and intervention as an insurance company s rbc declines 
the level of regulatory oversight ranges from requiring the insurance company to inform and obtain approval from the domiciliary insurance commissioner of a comprehensive financial plan for increasing its rbc to mandatory regulatory intervention requiring an insurance company to be placed under regulatory control in a rehabilitation or liquidation proceeding 
at december   each of our insurance company subsidiaries was in excess of any minimum threshold at which corrective action would be required 
insurance operations are subject to various leverage tests eg  premium to statutory surplus ratios  which are evaluated by regulators and rating agencies 
our targets for gross and net written premium to statutory surplus are to and to  respectively 
as of december   on a statutory consolidated basis  including the insurance company subsidiaries acquired in the procentury merger  gross and net premium leverage ratios were to and to  respectively 
the naic s insurance regulatory information system iris was developed by a committee of state insurance regulators and is primarily intended to assist state insurance departments in executing their statutory mandates to oversee the financial condition of insurance companies operating in their respective states 
iris identifies thirteen industry ratios and specifies usual values for each ratio 
departure from the usual values on four or more ratios generally leads to inquiries or possible further review from individual state insurance commissioners 
in  our insurance company subsidiaries generated four ratios that varied from the usual value range 
the variations and reasons are set forth below ratio usual range value company williamsburg gross agents balances to policyholders surplus under company procentury insurance company adjusted liabilities to liquid assets under company century surety company gross change in policyholders surplus over or under change in adjusted policyholders surplus over or under the gross agents balances to policyholders surplus on williamsburg was impacted by our intercompany reinsurance pooling agreement 
williamsburg s assumed premium receivable increased meadowbrook insurance group  inc 
management s discussion and analysis continued million as a result of the intercompany pooling 
excluding the intercompany pooling  this ratio would have been within the usual range for adjusted liabilities to liquid assets on procentury insurance company is outside the usual range primarily from the result of a reinsurance pooling agreement whereby its parent  century surety company  has withheld million in accordance with a provision included in the agreement for funds held to secure unearned premiums and liabilities for loss and loss adjustment expenses 
both the gross change in policyholders surplus and change in adjusted policyholders surplus are outside the usual range for century surety company primarily as a result of paying its parent the maximum ordinary dividend of million in reinsurance considerations we seek to manage the risk exposure of our insurance company subsidiaries  including those insurance company subsidiaries we acquired in the procentury merger  and our clients through the purchase of excess of loss and quota share reinsurance 
our reinsurance requirements are analyzed on a specific program basis to determine the appropriate retention levels and reinsurance coverage limits 
we secure this reinsurance based on the availability  cost  and benefits of various reinsurance alternatives 
reinsurance does not legally discharge an insurer from its primary liability for the full amount of risks assumed under insurance policies it issues  but it does make the assuming reinsurer liable to the insurer to the extent of the reinsurance ceded 
therefore  we are subject to credit risk with respect to the obligations of our reinsurers 
in regard to our excess of loss reinsurance  we manage our credit risk on reinsurance recoverables by reviewing the financial stability  am best rating  capitalization  and credit worthiness of prospective or existing reinsurers 
we generally do not seek collateral where the reinsurer is rated a or better by a

at december   our fixed income portfolio had a modified duration of  compared to at december  at december   the fair value of our investment portfolio  excluding cash and cash equivalents  was billion 
our market risk to the investment portfolio is primarily interest rate risk associated with debt securities 
our exposure to equity price risk is related to our investments in relatively small positions of preferred stocks and mutual funds with an emphasis on dividend income 
these investments  which were acquired as a result of our merger with procentury  comprise of our investment portfolio 
our investment philosophy is one of maximizing after tax earnings and has historically included significant investments in tax exempt bonds 
we continue to increase our holdings of tax exempt securities based on our desire to maximize after tax investment income 
for our investment portfolio  there were no significant changes in our primary market risk exposures or in how those exposures are managed compared to the year ended december  we do not anticipate significant changes in our primary market risk exposures or in how those exposures are managed in future reporting periods based upon what is known or expected to be in effect 
a sensitivity analysis is defined as the measurement of potential loss in future earnings  fair values  or cash flows of market sensitive instruments resulting from one or more selected hypothetical changes in interest rates and other market rates or prices over a selected period 
in our sensitivity analysis model  a hypothetical change in market rates is selected that is expected to reflect reasonable possible near term changes in those rates 
near term means a period of up to one year from the date of the consolidated financial statements 
in our sensitivity model  we use fair values to measure our potential loss of debt securities assuming an upward parallel shift in interest rates to measure the hypothetical change in fair values 
the table below presents our model s estimate of changes in fair values given a change in interest rates 
dollar values are in thousands 
rates down bps rates unchanged rates up bps fair value yield to maturity or call effective duration the other financial instruments  which include cash and cash equivalents  equity securities  premium receivables  reinsurance recoverables  line of credit and other assets and liabilities  when included in the sensitivity model  do not produce a material change in fair values 
our debentures are subject to variable interest rates 
thus  our interest expense on these debentures is directly correlated to market interest rates 
at december   we had debentures of million 
at this level  a basis point change in market rates would change annual interest expense by  at december   we had debentures of million 
at this level  a basis point change in market rates would change annual interest expense by  our term loan is subject to variable interest rates 
thus  our interest expense on our term loan is directly correlated to market interest rates 
at december   we had an outstanding balance on our term loan of meadowbrook insurance group  inc 
million 
at this level  a basis point change in market rates would change annual interest expense by  at december   we did not have any outstanding term loans 
we have entered into interest rate swap transactions to mitigate our interest rate risk on our existing debt obligations 
we accrue for these transactions in accordance with sfas no 
accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  as subsequently amended 
these interest rate swap transactions have been designated as cash flow hedges and are deemed highly effective hedges under sfas no 
in accordance with sfas no 
 these interest rate swap transactions are recorded at fair value on the balance sheet and the effective portion of the changes in fair value are accounted for within other comprehensive income 
the interest differential to be paid or received is accrued and recognized as an adjustment to interest expense 
refer to note derivative instruments for further detail relating to our interest rate swap transactions 
in addition  our revolving line of credit under which we can borrow up to million is subject to variable interest rates 
thus  our interest expense on the revolving line of credit is directly correlated to market interest rates 
at december  and  we did not have an outstanding balance on our revolving line of credit
