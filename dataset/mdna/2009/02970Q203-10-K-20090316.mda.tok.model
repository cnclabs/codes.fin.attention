the consolidated financial statements of the company are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  which requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the results of operations during the reporting period 
actual results could differ materially from those estimates 
the company believes the following critical accounting policies affect its more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements investment in real estate assets rental properties are stated at cost  net of accumulated depreciation  unless circumstances indicate that cost  net of accumulated depreciation  cannot be recovered  in which case the carrying value of the property is reduced to estimated fair value 
estimated fair value i is based upon the company s plans for the continued operation of each property and ii is computed using estimated sales price  as determined by prevailing market values for comparable properties and or the use of capitalization rates multiplied by annualized net operating income based upon the age  construction and use of the building 
the fulfillment of the company s plans related to each of its properties is dependent upon  among other things  the presence of economic conditions which will enable the company to continue to hold and operate the properties prior to their eventual sale 
due to uncertainties inherent in the valuation process and in the economy  the actual results of operating and disposing of the company s properties could be materially different than current expectations 
depreciation is provided using the straight line method over the estimated useful lives of the respective assets 
the useful lives are as follows building and improvements to years tenant improvements term of the related lease furniture and equipment to years allocation of purchase price of acquired assets upon acquisitions of real estate  the company assesses the fair value of acquired tangible and intangible assets including land  buildings  tenant improvements  above and below market leases  origination costs  acquired in place leases  other identified intangible assets and assumed liabilities in accordance with sfas no 
 business combinations  and allocates the purchase price to the acquired assets and assumed liabilities 
the company also considers an allocation of purchase price of other acquired intangibles  including acquired in place leases 

table of contents the company evaluates acquired above and below market leases at their fair value using a discount rate which reflects the risks associated with the leases acquired equal to the difference between i the contractual amounts to be paid pursuant to each in place lease and ii management s estimate of fair market lease rates for each corresponding in place lease  measured over a period equal to the remaining term of the lease for above market leases and the initial term plus the term of any below market fixed rate renewal options for below market leases 
sales of real estate assets gains on property sales are accounted for in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for sales of real estate 
gains are recognized in full when real estate is sold  provided i the gain is determinable  that is  the collectibility of the sales price is reasonably assured or the amount that will not be collectible can be estimated  and ii the earnings process is virtually complete  that is  the company is not obligated to perform significant activities after the sale to earn the gain 
losses on property sales are recognized immediately 
income taxes deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on temporary differences between income and expenses reported for financial reporting and tax reporting 
the company has assessed  using all available positive and negative evidence  the likelihood that the deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income 
under sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  an enterprise must use judgment in considering the relative impact of negative and positive evidence 
the weight given to the potential effect of negative and positive evidence should be commensurate with the extent to which it can be objectively verified 
the more negative evidence that exists i the more positive evidence is necessary and ii the more difficult it is to support a conclusion that a valuation allowance is not needed for some portion  or all  of the deferred tax asset 
among the more significant types of evidence that the company considered are that future anticipated property sales will produce more than enough taxable income to realize the deferred tax asset  taxable income projections in future years  and whether the carryfoward period is so brief that it would limit realization of tax benefits 
based on the company s evaluation of the evidence the company has not provided a valuation allowance against its deferred tax assets for the year ended december  results of operations comparison of the year ended december  to the year ended december  the following table shows a comparison of rental revenues and certain expenses variance rental revenue operating expenses property operating expenses general and administrative depreciation and amortization interest expense rental revenue
