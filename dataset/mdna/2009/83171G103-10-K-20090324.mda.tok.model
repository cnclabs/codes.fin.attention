item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation the following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this form k 
certain statements in this discussion and elsewhere in this report constitute forward looking statements within the meaning of section e of the securities and exchange act of see forward looking statements following the table of contents of this k 
because this discussion involves risk and uncertainties  our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements 
overview we provide learning solutions for accounting finance  legal  insurance  banking  brokerage and engineering professionals six large vertical markets with mandatory continuing education requirements 
in addition  we provide training solutions for the pharmaceutical  banking  securities  insurance and technology industries 
we also provide information technology  corporate governance  ethics and compliance training for the general corporate market 
we offer off the shelf courses and custom designed programs with delivery methods suited to the specific needs of our clients 
our customers include professional firms of all sizes  and a large number of midsize and small companies 
we measure our operations using both financial and other metrics 
the financial metrics include revenues  gross margins  operating expenses and income from continuing operations 
other key metrics include i revenues by sales source  ii online sales  iii cash flows and iv ebitda 
some of the most significant trends affecting our business are the following the increasing recognition by professionals and corporations that they must continually improve their skills and those of their employees in order to remain competitive  continuing professional education requirements by governing bodies  including states and professional associations  the plethora of new laws and regulations affecting the conduct of business and the relationship between employers and their employees  the increased competition in today s economy for skilled employees and the recognition that effective training can be used to recruit and train employees  and the development and acceptance of the internet as a delivery channel for the types of products and services we offer 
over the last four years  our annual revenues have grown from million to million and our annual net operating income has grown from  to million 
this growth is due in large part to seven acquisitions that we have completed in this period 
our most recent acquisition was loscalzo in july loscalzo is a leading provider of live training to accountants 
these courses are delivered through various state cpa societies  accounting firms  corporations or through seminars and conferences that they conduct 
this acquisition expands our product line and customer base and gives us the opportunity to cross market and cross sell our full line of products to the loscalzo customer base 
we intend to continue focusing on acquisitions that will allow us to increase the breadth and depth of our current product offerings  including the general corporate market for compliance  governance and ethics 
we will also consider acquisitions that will give us access to new markets and products 
we prefer acquisitions that are accretive  as opposed to those that are dilutive  but ultimately the decision will be based on maximizing shareholder value rather than short term profits 
the size of the acquisitions will be determined  in part  by our size  the capital available to us and the liquidity and price of our stock 
we may use debt to enhance or augment our ability to consummate larger transactions 
there are many risks involved with acquisitions  some of which are discussed in item of part of this report above under the caption certain risk factors that may affect our growth and profitability 
these risks include integrating the acquired business into our existing operations and corporate structure  retaining key employees and minimizing disruptions to our existing business 
we cannot assure that we will be able to identify appropriate acquisition opportunities or negotiate reasonable terms or that any acquired business or assets will deliver the shareholder value that we anticipated at the outset 
critical accounting policies and estimates the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements that have been prepared according to accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
in preparing these financial statements  we are required to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities 
we evaluate these estimates on an ongoing basis 
we base these estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we consider the following accounting policies to be the most important to the portrayal of our financial condition 
revenues a large portion of our revenues is in the form of subscription fees for any of our monthly accounting update programs or access to our library of accounting  financial services training and legal courses 
other sources of revenue include direct sales of programs or courses on a non subscription basis or from various forms of live training  fees for web site design  software development  tape and dvd duplication  video production  video conversion  course design and development  ongoing maintenance of the pec  and licensing fees 
subscriptions are billed on an annual basis  payable in advance and deferred at the time of billing 
sales made over the internet are by credit card only 
renewals are usually sent out days before the subscription period ends 
larger transactions are usually dealt with by contract  the financial terms of which depend on the services being provided 
contracts for development and production services typically provide for a significant upfront payment and a series of payments based on deliverables specifically identified in the contract 
revenue is recognized on a percentage of completion basis 
revenues from subscription services are recognized as earned  deferred at the time of billing or payment and amortized into revenue on a monthly basis over the term of the subscription 
engineering products are non subscription based and revenue is recognized upon shipment of the product or  in the case of online sales  payment 
revenues from live training are recognized when earned  usually upon the completion of a one day seminar or conference 
revenues from non subscription services provided to customers  such as web site design  video production  consulting services and custom projects are generally recognized on a proportional performance basis where sufficient information relating to project status and other supporting documentation is available 
the contracts may have different billing arrangements resulting in either unbilled or deferred revenue 
we obtain either a signed agreement or purchase order from our non subscription customers outlining the terms and conditions of the sale or service to be provided 
otherwise  these services are recognized as revenues after completion and delivery to the customer 
duplication and related services are generally recognized upon shipment or  if later  when our obligations are complete and realization of receivable amounts is assured 
revenues from live training are recognized when the seminar or conference is completed 
these are usually one or two day events 
impairment of long lived assets we review long lived assets and certain intangible assets annually for impairment whenever circumstances and situations change such that there is an indication that the carrying amounts may not be recovered 
stock based compensation we have adopted the recognition and measurement requirements of sfas no 
r 
as a result  compensation costs are now recognized in the financial statements for stock options or grants awarded to employees and directors 
options and warrants granted to non employees are recorded as an expense at the date of grant based on the then estimated fair value of the security in question 
segment accounting all of our operations constitute a single segment  that of educational services 
revenues from non educational services  such as video production are not a material part of our operating income 
results of operations comparison of the years ended december   and the following table compares our statement of operations data for the years ended december   and december  the trends suggested by this table may not be indicative of future operating results  which will depend on various factors including the relative mix of products sold accounting finance  engineering or corporate training and the method of sale video or online 
years ended december amount percentage amount percentage change net revenues cost of revenues gross profit general and administrative depreciation and amortization total operating expenses operating income other income net income before benefit for income taxes income tax benefit net income net revenues net revenues for increased compared to net revenues for online revenues continue to be an important factor contributing to our overall revenue growth 
in  net revenues from online sales of subscription based products and other sales accounted for approximately million  or  of our net revenues 
in  online revenues accounted for million  or  of our net revenues 
although online revenues have increased in total dollars  as a result of loscalzo its percentage of total net revenues declined 
net revenues from sales of our accounting finance products grew in absolute terms but were relatively flat as a percentage of net revenues 
in  net revenues from our accounting finance and related products were million compared to million in this increase was primarily due to loscalzo 
in each of and net revenues from accounting finance products including both subscription and non subscription based revenue was million 
net revenues from live training  custom work and advertising were million in as compared to million in the difference is primarily attributable to loscalzo 
net revenues from sales of our engineering products  which are not subscription based were  in compared to  in the largest component of this increase was from an increase in sales from our mgi product line  which was  in as compared to  in other engineering sales increased as a result of marketing efforts and the introduction of new courses 
we are also developing new products for other engineering disciplines to address societal changes such as the desire for more green technology 
net revenues from video production  duplication and consulting services decreased in by  to  from  in although video production income increased  from  the video duplication business continues to decline as video technology is being replaced by digital formats 
consulting work varies from year to year and sales are credited to the department from which they originate and not to the department where the work is performed 
net revenues from sle decreased slightly from million in to million in this decrease was primarily due to a decrease of  from cognistar  offset by an increase of  from our ethics division 
working values develops customized ethics training for its clients and cognistar concentrates on delivering online continuing legal education 
skye generated million of net revenues in as compared to million in skye produces customized training and educational material for the pharmaceutical industry  professional firms  financial service companies and others 
our financial services training division generated net revenues of million in as compared to only million in the largest portion of the growth comes from fc course sales 
our technology training division  watchit  acquired in august  generated net revenues of  in as compared to  of revenues in cost of revenues cost of revenues includes i production costs  such as the salaries  benefits and other costs related to personnel  whether our employees or independent contractors  who are used directly in connection with producing or conducting our educational programs  ii royalties paid to third parties  iii the cost of materials  such as dvd s and packaging materials  and iv shipping costs 
compared to  cost of revenues in increased by approximately million 
approximately  of this increase came from loscalzo and the remaining increase is a result of business that required a substantial amount of outsourcing in order to complete projects and increased royalty payments on some of our products 
cost of revenues in increased to from in  resulting in a decrease in our gross profit margin 
with the addition of loscalzo which represents approximately of our net revenues on an annualized basis we anticipate a lower gross profit percentage as this business is more labor and cost intensive than our online products 
there are many different types of expenses that are characterized as production costs and they vary from period to period depending on many factors 
the expenses that showed the greatest variations from to and the reasons for those variations were as follows outside labor and direct production costs 
outside labor includes the cost of hiring actors and production personnel such as directors  producers and cameramen and the outsourcing of non video technology 
it also includes the costs of instructors for live training and the production of those courses 
these costs increased by  in from both skye and our consulting technology departments employ a number of consultants to write scripts  edit course material and provide technology services 
loscalzo employs a number of consultants to write course material in addition to instructors throughout the united states 
we have been outsourcing some of the programming and content development functions that were previously done by our employees to firms in india and china at a substantial savings 
we are always exploring other areas such as the philippines  for outsourcing our technology needs 
direct production costs  which are costs related to producing videos other than labor costs such as the cost of renting equipment and locations  and the purchase of materials increased by  these variations are related to the type of video production and custom projects and do not reflect any trends in our business 
salaries 
overall payroll and related costs attributable to production personnel increased by approximately  the increase was primarily attributable to salaries and related costs from our recent acquisitions including loscalzo in and others made in offset by decreases in other areas such as video production tape duplication 
while our technology group and sle salaries and related costs remained constant  this was offset by increased salaries from skye of approximately  in from royalties 
royalty expense increased in as compared to by  this was due to increased revenues in accounting education and engineering products and a change in a royalty agreement with one of our accounting education partners 
in addition  we often have to estimate the royalty expense due our partners as the information may not be available 
however  if volume increases or if we enter into new agreements or modify existing agreements  the actual royalty payments in under these agreements may be either higher or lower than they were in other costs 
travel and entertainment and other miscellaneous expenses increased by  primarily related to loscalzo 
the largest component of these expenses is travel and entertainment that increased by  in from as a result of loscalzo and other travel related to custom projects 
loscalzo bills certain customers for these expenses 
as our business grows we may be required to hire additional production personnel  increasing our cost of revenues 
general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses include corporate overhead such as i compensation and benefits for administrative  sales and marketing and finance personnel  ii rent  iii insurance  iv professional fees  v travel and entertainment  and vi office expenses 
general and administrative expenses in were higher than they were in by  of this amount approximately  is directly attributable to loscalzo  which resulted in increased rent  administrative payrolls and other costs 
the remaining increase of approximately  is primarily due to salaries and related costs that were attributable to acquisitions made in the second half of in addition  in conformity with sfas no 
r  we are expensing the costs associated with the grants of option and restricted stock to employees and directors 
this non cash expense in was  and  in we anticipate that general and administrative expenses will increase in as we fully absorb our recent acquisition and increase marketing expenses 
depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization expenses were  higher in than they were in the increase is attributable to certain intangible assets acquired in and we have also begun to amortize the cost of our new pec in the fourth quarter of resulting in an additional cost of approximately  in we are also constantly upgrading our computer hardware as we have built an offsite data back up center 
we expect our depreciation and amortization expenses on our fixed and intangible assets to increase as we begin to amortize the costs related to these acquisitions and the development of our new pec and spa courses 
operating income for  operating income was million compared to million in  an increase of 
as a percentage of net revenues  operating income in was compared to in  a decrease of 
our recent acquisition of loscalzo and acquisitions made in the second half of that are now fully absorbed have contributed to this increase in net income 
other income other income and expense items primarily consist of interest earned on deposits 
we currently have no outstanding debt  other than normal trade payables 
net interest income decreased by  due to decreased cash and substantially lower interest rates in as compared to we do not anticipate an increase in interest income as interest rates continue to remain very low in income tax benefit we have now recognized the full benefit of our net operating loss carryforwards pursuant to sfas no 
this has resulted in a net  benefit in we anticipate that in we will begin to use the tax deferred benefit of approximately million as we begin to incur federal income tax expense 
net income for  we recorded net income of million compared to million for our net profit margin for was compared to in  a decrease of 
the decrease in net income is primarily due to a decrease in interest income of  and a decrease in the income tax benefits available through our net operating loss carryforwards of approximately  offset by an increased operating profit of  contractual obligations  commitments and contingencies historically  we have financed our working capital requirements through internally generated funds  sales of equity and debt securities and proceeds from short term bank borrowings 
our working capital as of december   was approximately million compared to a million working capital as of december  the decrease is attributable to positive cash flow from operations and earnings offset by cash used to acquire loscalzo and purchase treasury shares 
our current ratio at december   is to  compared to to at december  the current ratio is derived by dividing current assets by current liabilities and is a measure used by lending sources to assess our ability to repay short term liabilities 
the largest component of our current liabilities  approximately million and million at december  and respectively  is deferred revenue  which is revenue collected or billed but not yet earned under the principles of revenue recognition 
most of this revenue is in the form of subscription fees and will be earned over the next months 
the cost of fulfilling our monthly subscription obligation does not exceed this revenue and is booked to expense as incurred 
for some of our products  there are no additional costs  other than shipping costs  required to complete this obligation as the material is already in our library 
for the year ended december   we had a net decrease in cash of million 
the majority of this was due to the million expended for the loscalzo acquisition and an investment in a joint venture and approximately  for asset acquisitions 
we also expended  for the purchase of treasury shares 
these decreases were offset by million generated from operations 
the primary components of our operating cash flows are our net income adjusted for non cash expenses  such as depreciation and amortization  and the changes in accounts receivable  accounts payable and deferred revenues 
in comparison  for the year ended december   we had a million increase in cash 
that increase was a result of cash generated by operations of million and cash generated from investing activities of  this was offset by a decrease in cash of million for investing activities including the acquisition of equipment  capitalization of the pec and purchase of treasury shares 
capital expenditures for the year ended december   were approximately  of which  consisted of computer equipment  most of which was at our off site backup center  a requirement of sox compliance 
we capitalized  of costs for the production of various courses and  for capitalizing the costs of our new pec 
we are constantly upgrading our technology and cannot anticipate any significant increase in capital expenditures relating to equipment purchases over the next months 
at year end  we had no indebtedness for borrowed money 
as of december   we had commitments under various leases for our offices in hawthorne  new york  the sle office in westborough  massachusetts  skye s offices in bridgewater  new jersey  and loscalzo s office in red bank  new jersey 
the total aggregate commitment under these leases is approximately million through january sle recently entered into a new lease that expires in january and calls for a monthly rent of approximately  the skye lease was recently extended to august at a monthly rental of  and the lease for the loscalzo office expires on june   at a monthly rent of  the former shareholders of skye are also entitled to a contingent payment based on certain levels of sales through december   less adjustments for use of capital and other costs 
the total additional payment cannot exceed  at our discretion  the additional payment may be paid in cash and in our common stock 
if the additional payment is made in stock  it will be determined by the average price for the trading days subsequent to december  we have accrued  as our estimated liability 
in the future  we may issue additional debt or equity securities to satisfy our cash needs 
any debt incurred or issued may be secured or unsecured  at a fixed or variable interest rate and may contain other terms and conditions that our board of directors deems prudent 
any sales of equity securities may be at or below current market prices 
we cannot assure that we will be successful in generating sufficient capital to adequately fund our liquidity needs 
interest rate risk interest rate risk represents the potential loss from adverse changes in market interest rates 
as we may hold us treasury securities or money market funds  we may be exposed to interest rate risk arising from changes in the level and volatility of interest rates and in the shape of the yield curve 
credit risk most of our cash is held in deposit accounts  us treasury and non treasury money market funds 
our bank deposit accounts are insured by the us government but only up to a maximum of  at any one bank 
our money market funds are held in a brokerage account that is insured by the security industry protection corp sipc up to  and various brokerage firms may carry additional insurance from commercial insurance companies 
our cash balances vary from time to time based on a variety of factors but in most cases are significantly in excess of the insurable limit 
as a result  we have exposure on these accounts in the event these financial institutions become insolvent 
in addition  we may have credit risk with respect to customers who default on custom orders or who default on subscription payments 
seasonality and cyclicality historically  the fourth quarter has been our strongest in terms of revenue generation 
this is due to the fact that most of our subscriptions follow the calendar year and renewals are mailed out days before the end of the year 
also  for internal budgeting reasons  corporate clients tend to defer their decisions to the end of the year 
loscalzo derives most of its revenue in the second half of the year 
in general  since most of our business relates to continuing professional education and is non discretionary  we do not believe that business cycles have a material impact on our financial performance 
with the current down turn in the economy we have noticed many of our clients are taking longer to make renewal decisions and more closely examining their use of our various products 
adverse business conditions and developments  however  would negatively affect the performance of some of our product lines 
recent accounting pronouncements in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
 non controlling interests in consolidated financial statements 
we believe that this pronouncement will not have a material impact on our financial statements 
also in december  the fasb issue sfas no 
r  business combinations 
sfas no 
r is effective for periods beginning after december   and may not be applied retroactively 
we believe that this pronouncement will affect the way we treat any contingent purchase price on future acquisitions  as the pronouncement requires establishing an estimate of that amount at the time of acquisition 
in october  the fasb issued fsp fas no 
 determining the fair value of a financial asset when the market for that is asset not active with an immediate effective date  including prior periods for which financial statements have not been issued 
fsp fas no 
clarifies the application of fair value in inactive markets and allows for the use of management s internal assumptions about future cash flows with appropriately risk adjusted discount rates when relevant observable market data does not exist 
the objective of fas no 
has not changed and continues to be the determination of the price that would be received in an orderly transaction that is not a forced liquidation or distressed sale at the measurement date 
the adoption of fsp fas no 
in the second quarter did not have a material effect on the company s results of operations  financial position or liquidity
