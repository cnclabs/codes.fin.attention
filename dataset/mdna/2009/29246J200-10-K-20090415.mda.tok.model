table of contents recent transactions on august   emrise and eec completed the acquisition of all of the capital stock of cci and  its subsidiary  acc 
acc  based in eatontown  new jersey  is a supplier of high performance rf and microwave devices and subsystems that for more than years has been serving the military  aerospace  commercial and instrumentation markets 
we believe that the acquisition of acc will strengthen our geographic presence  resources and new products to allow us to grow domestically and internationally and to increase sales to us military and other government and commercial organizations 
acc operates within the electronic devices business segment of emrise 
the results of operations of acc since august  are included in our consolidated statement of operations for the year ended december  on march   emrise completed the sale of substantially all the assets of ecc s digitran division and all the capital stock of ecc s wholly owned subsidiary  xcel japan ltd  which primarily acted as a sales office for the digitran division  to weymouth  ma based electro switch corp 
in this report we refer to the businesses of the digitran division and xcel japan  ltd 
as the digitran operations  and we refer to the sale of the digitran division and xcel japan  ltd 
as the digitran transaction 
within our digitran division we manufactured  marketed and sold electro mechanical digital and new patented technology very low profiletm rotary switches for the worldwide aerospace  defense and industrial markets 
tokyo based xcel japan ltd 
primarily sold digitran s switch product lines in japan and other countries in asia 
these businesses were part of our electronic devices business segment 
the digitran transaction is a milestone in our previously announced strategy to divest non core businesses and increase our focus on our core competencies 
for purposes of the following discussion and analysis  the digitran operations have been classified within the electronic devices business segment of emrise 
because the digitran transaction occurred after december   the full year results of the digitran operations are included in our consolidated statement of operations for the year ended december  and the digitran operations are reflected in our consolidated balance sheet  consolidated statement of stockholders equity and consolidated statement of cash flows as of december  business description emrise designs  manufactures and markets proprietary electronic devices and communications equipment for aerospace  defense  industrial  and communications applications 
we have operations in the us  england  and france 
we organize our business in two operating segments electronic devices and communications equipment 
in  our electronic devices segment contributed approximately of overall net sales while the communications segment contributed approximately of overall net sales 
our subsidiaries within our electronic devices segment design  develop  manufacture and market electronic  rf and microwave devices for defense  aerospace and industrial markets 
our subsidiaries within our communications equipment segment design  develop  manufacture and market network access equipment and network timing and synchronization products  for communications applications in defense  public and private networks and industrial markets 
within our electronic devices segment  we produce a range of power systems  rf and microwave devices 
this segment is primarily project driven with the majority of revenues being derived from custom products with long life cycles and high barriers to entry 
the majority of manufacturing and testing is performed in house or through sub contract manufacturers 
our electronic devices are used in a wide range of military airborne  seaborne and land based systems  and in flight entertainment systems  including the latest next generation ife c systems such as applications for mobile phone  e mail and internet communications and real time  on board satellite and broadcast tv which are being installed in new commercial aircraft as well as being retrofitted into existing commercial aircraft 
within our communications equipment segment  we produce a range of network access products  including network timing and synchronization products  for public and private communications networks 
this segment is end user product based with a traditional cycle of internally funded development and marketing prior to selling via direct and indirect sales channels 
manufacturing is primarily outsourced 
our communications equipment is used in a broad range of applications for military defense and homeland security  utility companies and independent and national telecommunications carriers 

table of contents critical accounting policies our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the us the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amount of net sales and expenses for each period 
the following represents a summary of our critical accounting policies  defined as those policies that we believe are the most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and that require management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effects of matters that are inherently uncertain 
revenue recognition we derive revenues from sales of electronic devices and communications equipment products and services 
our sales are based upon written agreements or purchase orders that identify the type and quantity of the item and or services being purchased and the purchase price 
we recognize revenues when shipment of products has occurred or services have been rendered  no significant obligations remain on our part  and collectability is reasonably assured based on our credit and collections practices and policies 
we recognize revenues from domestic sales of our electronic devices and communications equipment at the point of shipment of those products 
an estimate of warranty cost is recorded at the time the revenue is recognized 
product returns are infrequent and require prior authorization because our sales are final and we quality test our products prior to shipment to ensure the products meet the specifications of the binding purchase orders under which those products are shipped 
normally  when a customer requests and receives authorization to return a product  the request is accompanied by a purchase order for a repair or for a replacement product 
revenue recognition for products and services provided by acc and our subsidiaries in england depends upon the type of contract involved 
engineering design services contracts generally entail design and production of a prototype over a term of up to several years  with revenue deferred until each milestone defined in the contract is reached 
production contracts provide for a specific quantity of products to be produced over a specific period of time 
customers issue binding purchase orders or enter into binding agreements for the products to be produced 
we recognize revenues on these orders as the products are shipped 
returns are infrequent and permitted only with prior authorization because these products are custom made to order based on binding purchase orders and are quality tested prior to shipment 
an estimate of warranty cost is recorded at the time revenue is recognized 
we recognize revenues for products sold by our subsidiary in france at the point of shipment 
customer discounts are included in the product price list provided to the customer 
returns are infrequent and permitted only with prior authorization because these products are shipped based on binding purchase orders and are quality tested prior to shipment 
an estimate of warranty cost is recorded at the time revenue is recognized 
revenues from services such as repairs and modifications are recognized when the service is completed and invoiced 
for repairs that involve shipment of a repaired product  we recognize repair revenues when the product is shipped back to the customer 
service revenues contribute less than of total revenue and  therefore  are considered to be immaterial to overall financial results 

table of contents product warranty liabilities generally  our products carry a standard one year  limited parts and labor warranty 
in certain circumstances  we provide a two year limited parts and labor warranty 
we offer extended warranties beyond two years for an additional cost to our customers 
products returned under warranty typically are tested and repaired or replaced at our option 
historically  we have not experienced significant warranty costs or returns 
we record a liability for estimated costs that we expect to incur under our basic limited warranties when product revenue is recognized 
factors affecting our warranty liability include the number of units sold  the types of products involved  historical and anticipated rates of claim and historical and anticipated costs per claim 
we periodically assess the adequacy of our warranty liability accrual based on changes in these factors 
inventory valuation our finished goods electronic devices inventories generally are built to order 
our communications equipment inventories generally are built to forecast  which requires us to produce a larger amount of finished goods in our communications equipment business so that our customers can be served promptly 
our products consist of numerous electronic and other materials  which necessitate that we exercise detailed inventory management 
we value our inventory at the lower of the actual cost to purchase or manufacture the inventory first in  first out or the current estimated market value of the inventory net realizable value 
we perform cycle counts of inventories using an abc inventory methodology  which groups inventory items into prioritized cycle counting categories  or we conduct physical inventories at least once a year 
we regularly review inventory quantities on hand and record a provision for excess and obsolete inventory based primarily on our estimated forecast of product demand and production requirements for the next to months 
additionally  to determine inventory write down provisions  we review product line inventory levels and individual items as necessary and periodically review assumptions about forecasted demand and market conditions 
any inventory that we determine to be obsolete  either in connection with the physical count or at other times of observation  are reserved for and subsequently written off 
as of december   our total inventory reserves amounted to million of which million  or of total inventory  related to our electronic devices segment and million  or of total inventory  related to our communications equipment segment 
the electronic devices and communications equipment industries are characterized by rapid technological change  frequent new product development  and rapid product obsolescence that could result in an increase in the amount of obsolete inventory quantities on hand 
also  our estimates of future product demand may prove to be inaccurate  in which case we may have understated or overstated the provision required for excess and obsolete inventory 
although we make every effort to ensure the accuracy of our forecasts of future product demand  any significant unanticipated changes in demand or technological developments could have a significant impact on the value of our inventory and our reported operating results 
foreign currency translation we have foreign subsidiaries that together accounted for approximately and of our net revenues  and of our assets and and of our total liabilities as of and for the years ended december  and  respectively 
in preparing our consolidated financial statements  we are required to translate the financial statements of our foreign subsidiaries from the functional currencies in which they keep their accounting records into us dollars 
this process results in exchange gains and losses which  under relevant accounting guidance  are included either within our statement of operations under the caption other income expense or as a separate part of our net equity under the caption accumulated other comprehensive income loss 
under relevant accounting guidance  the treatment of these translation gains or losses depends upon management s determination of the functional currency of each subsidiary 
this determination involves consideration of relevant economic facts and circumstances affecting the subsidiary 
generally  the currency in which the subsidiary transacts a majority of its transactions  including billings  financing  payroll and other 
table of contents expenditures  would be considered the functional currency 
however  management must also consider any dependency of the subsidiary upon the parent and the nature of the subsidiary s operations 
if management deems any subsidiary s functional currency to be its local currency  then any gain or loss associated with the translation of that subsidiary s financial statements is included as a separate component of stockholders equity in accumulated other comprehensive income loss 
however  if management deems the functional currency to be us dollars  then any gain or loss associated with the translation of these financial statements would be included in other income expense within our statement of operations 
if we dispose of any of our subsidiaries  any cumulative translation gains or losses would be realized into our statement of operations 
if we determine that there has been a change in the functional currency of a subsidiary to us dollars  then any translation gains or losses arising after the date of the change would be included within our statement of operations 
based on our assessment of the factors discussed above  we consider the functional currency of each of our international subsidiaries to be each subsidiary s local currency 
accordingly  we had cumulative translation losses of million and gains of million that were included as part of accumulated other comprehensive income loss within our balance sheets at december  and december   respectively 
during the year ended december  and  we included translation losses of million and gains of million  respectively  under accumulated other comprehensive income 
the magnitude of these gains or losses depends upon movements in the exchange rates of the foreign currencies in which we transact business as compared to the value of the us dollar 
during  these currencies include the euro  the british pound sterling and  to a lesser extent  the japanese yen 
any future translation gains or losses could be significantly higher or lower than those we recorded for these periods 
a million british pound sterling loan payable from one of our subsidiaries in england to emrise was outstanding as of december  million based on the exchange rate at december  
exchange rate losses and gains on the long term portion of this loan are recorded in cumulative translation gains or losses in the equity section of the balance sheet 
intangibles  including goodwill we periodically evaluate our intangibles  including goodwill  for potential impairment 
our judgments regarding the existence of impairment are based on many factors including market conditions and operational performance of our acquired businesses 
in assessing potential impairment of goodwill  we consider these factors as well as forecasted financial performance of the acquired businesses 
if forecasts are not met  we may have to record additional impairment charges not previously recognized 
in assessing the recoverability of our goodwill and other intangibles  we must make assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors to determine the fair value of those respective assets 
if these estimates or their related assumptions change in the future  we may be required to record impairment charges for these assets that were not previously recorded 
if that were the case  we would have to record an expense in order to reduce the carrying value of our goodwill 
under sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  we are required to analyze our goodwill for impairment issues at least annually or more frequently if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount 
at december   our reported goodwill totaled million 
during the year ended december   we recorded a non cash impairment loss related to goodwill and other intangible assets of million  which is reflected as a component of operations in the accompanying consolidated statement of operations 
in assessing the potential impairment of goodwill  we consider forecasted financial performance of the acquired businesses to determine the fair value of the respective assets 
due to a decline in the forecasted financial performance of our communications segment  the estimated fair market value of that segment s intangible assets declined as compared to the carrying value of such assets on our balance sheet 
as a result  the impairment charge reflects the write down of substantially all of the carrying value of the goodwill and other intangible assets for our communications segment 

table of contents overview the majority of our products are customized to the unique specifications of our customers and are subject to variable timing of delivery 
shipments of products can be accelerated or delayed due to many reasons including  but not limited to  exceeding or not meeting customer contract requirements  a change in customer timing or specifications  technology related issues and production related issues 
comparability of our revenues and gross profit is difficult from period to period as we typically do not have recurring orders 
exceptions to this include certain long term military contracts and certain long term telecommunications contracts 
overall sales increased in as compared to included in our net sales results for is million of net sales contributed by acc  which we acquired on august  acc product sales accounted for of our overall increase in sales 
the remaining increase in net sales is primarily due to an increase in sales of our other electronic devices subsidiaries  partially offset by exchange translation and lower sales of communication equipment 
overall gross margin increased to in from in the increase in overall gross margin was primarily due to improved sales prices of our products  improved efficiency in manufacturing and favorable changes in product mix  particularly at our us electronic devices subsidiaries and strong gross margins related to acc products 
the following is a detailed discussion of our results of operations by business segment 
results of operations comparison of the year ended december  to the year ended december  net sales year ended variance december  favorable unfavorable in thousands dollar percent electronic devices as of net sales communications equipment as of net sales total net sales electronic devices the increase in sales within our electronic devices segment in as compared to is primarily due to the inclusion of million of sales generated by acc  which was acquired in august also contributing to the improvement was a million increase in sales of digital switches 
one of our european subsidiaries also experienced increased sales  especially due to higher shipments of ife c products for commercial aircraft applications 
however  the effect of exchange rates between the us dollar and the british pound sterling on the translation of our european operations into us dollars had an unfavorable impact on all of our european operations net sales as compared to the prior year 
the translation impact of exchange rates remains an uncertainty and could negatively or positively impact our overall results in future periods 
in  we expect net sales within our electronic devices segment to increase slightly as compared to this reflects the expected favorable impact of including months of acc s net sales in as compared to a little over months in  the loss of the net sales relating to our digitran operations after march and the anticipated unfavorable effect of exchange rates expected in as compared to between the us dollar and the british pound sterling on the translation of our european operations into us dollars 
communications equipment the slight decrease in sales within our communications equipment segment in as compared to is primarily due to a million decrease in sales at our french subsidiary as the result of a temporary spending reduction by the french defense ministry  which resulted in a short term reduction in orders and shipments for communication networking products 
this decrease was partially offset by a million increase in our domestic communications equipment operations as a result of increases in test equipment sales associated with new government contracts 
we expect net sales in our communications equipment segment to increase slightly in as compared to growth in our communication segment has been  and is likely to continue to be  impacted by the recent economic conditions as many of our communication products are deemed to be discretionary expenditures by our customers and many companies in this industry have announced publicly plans to reduce capital expenditures and or to defer discretionary spending due to current economic conditions 
once global economic conditions improve  we believe this segment will benefit more so than our electronic devices segment 
we also anticipate an unfavorable effect of exchange rates expected in as compared to between the us dollar and the euro on the translation of our european operations into us dollars 

table of contents gross profit year ended variance december  favorable unfavorable in thousands dollar percent electronic devices as of net sales communications equipment as of net sales total gross profit total gross margin electronic devices the improvement in gross profit within our electronic devices segment is primarily due to substantial gross margin improvements within all of our electronic device subsidiaries due to a combination of improved selling prices  improved efficiency in manufacturing and or favorable changes in product mix 
included in our overall gross profit for is million contributed by acc  representing approximately four months of gross profit contribution for that subsidiary 
during  we expect gross profit expressed in dollars and gross profit expressed as a percent of net sales within our electronic devices segment to remain consistent with results 
this reflects the favorable impact of including acc s net sales for months in as compared to a little over four months in  offset by the loss of the net sales from our digitran operations after march and the anticipated unfavorable effect of exchange rates expected in as compared to between the us dollar and the british pound sterling on the translation of our european operations into us dollars 
communications equipment the increase in gross margin is primarily due to increased sales of higher margin tiempotm products 
during  we expect gross profit expressed in dollars and gross profit expressed as a percent of net sales within our communications equipment segment to improve slightly as compared to due in large part to our expected results for the communications equipment segment discussed under the heading net sales above 
operating expenses year ended variance december  favorable unfavorable in thousands dollar percent selling  general and administrative as of net sales engineering and product development as of net sales total operating expenses selling  general and administrative the increase in selling  general and administrative expenses is primarily the result of million of additional expenses relating to approximately four months of operations of acc 
during  we expect selling  general and administrative expense to increase by at least million 
this anticipated increase reflects the unfavorable impact of including a full months of acc s expenses in as compared to approximately months during  as well as higher anticipated costs relating to sarbanes oxley compliance due to the fact that we will be subject to the sarbanes oxley act section external audit requirements beginning january  these increases are expected to be partially offset by decreases in selling general and administrative expenses relating to the sale of our digitran operations in march and significant restructuring efforts which we expect to complete in the first half of  which include reduction in headcount  outsourcing certain centralized services and a reduction in facility costs 
engineering and product development the increase in engineering and product development costs in was primarily due to million of engineering and product development costs attributable to acc 
during  engineering and product development expenses are expected to remain at or slightly below levels 
this reflects the impact of including acc s expenses for the full months in as compared to approximately months during offset by the favorable impact of reduced expenses due to the sale of our digitran operations in march 
table of contents loss on asset impairment in  we incurred a loss on the impairment of our goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets of million 
in assessing the potential impairment of goodwill  we consider forecasted financial performance of the acquired businesses to determine the fair value of the respective assets 
due to a decline in the forecasted financial performance of our communications segment  the estimated fair market value of that segment s intangible assets declined as compared to the carrying value of such assets on our balance sheet 
as a result  the impairment charge reflects the write down of substantially all of the carrying value of the goodwill and other intangible assets for our communications segment 
interest expense interest expense was million for as compared to million for due to higher outstanding loan and line of credit balances  higher interest rates associated with our credit facility entered into in november and the additional debt incurred in connection with the acquisition of acc in august included in interest expense in are approximately million of unused line fees  non cash amortization of deferred financing costs and non cash amortization of debt discount related to issuance costs for the credit facility 
we expect interest expense in to remain relatively consistent with levels  although we expect the ratio of non cash to cash component of interest expense to increase slightly in as compared to this reflects the fact that we had higher debt levels for approximately the last four months of and the first three months of due to borrowings made in connection with the acquisition of acc and through the closing of the sale of our digitran operations in march  which permitted us to pay down our acquisition debt in the amount of million 
other income expense we incurred other expenses of million for and generated other income of million for other expense for consisted primarily of short term exchange rate losses associated with the volatility of the us dollar to the british pound sterling and euro on the current portion of certain assets and liabilities 
other income for included a one time accrual reversal related to the satisfactory resolution of an employee related legal dispute at our french subsidiary 
loss on early extinguishment of debt loss on early extinguishment of debt was million for relating to the exit costs associated with the early termination of our previous credit facilities and term loans 
we did not incur such a loss in if we were to terminate our existing credit facility during  we would incur significant cash and non cash expenses in connection with such a termination including early termination fees and a write off of all unamortized debt acquisition costs and unamortized debt discount 
income tax expense income tax expense amounted to million for compared to million for income tax expense is primarily the result of foreign income tax on foreign earned profits in europe and japan and new jersey state income taxes on income generated by acc 
we expect a significant increase in income tax expense in  primarily due to income tax obligations associated with an anticipated gain on the digitran transaction  which we completed in march net loss we reported a net loss of million in and a net loss of million in included in the net loss in was a million non cash loss associated with the impairment of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets 
liquidity and capital resources in making an assessment of our liquidity  we believe that the items in our financial statements that are most relevant to our ongoing operations are our working capital  cash generated from our operating activities and cash available from our financing activities 
during  we funded our daily cash flow requirements through funds provided by operations and through borrowings under our credit facility with gvec resource iv inc gvec or the lender  an affiliate of private equity management group llc pem group 
working capital was million at december  as compared to million at december  the decrease in working capital is primarily due to the current portion of our long term debt million as of december  and our revolving line of credit million as of december  being classified as a current liability at december  as compared to being classified as long term debt at december  the current portion of long term debt increased due to higher scheduled principal payments in as compared to at december  and  we had accumulated deficits of million and million  respectively  and cash and cash equivalents of million and million  respectively 
net cash generated in operating activities during totaled million as compared to million of net cash used in operating activities in our reported net loss of million in  included a non cash loss on impairment of intangible assets of million 
additional non cash adjustments to our net loss include i the amortization of debt discount and amortization of deferred financing cost which  on a combined basis  totaled million in compared to a combined total of million in  both of which are non cash expenses associated with our gvec credit facility and ii depreciation and amortization expense which totaled million and million  respectively during and  also a non cash expense 
significant sources and uses of cash associated with operating activities during included an increase in accrued expenses of million related to timing of payments and an increase in inventory of million primarily associated with the addition of acc inventories in that were absent in  partially offset by a decrease in inventory reserves as a result of scrapping of inventory during the year and the effect of currency exchange rates between the british pound sterling and the us dollar 

table of contents cash used in our investing activities totaled million in as compared to million in the million of expenditures in consisted entirely of net increases to property  plant and equipment compared to million of investment in property  plant and equipment in the remaining million of expenditures in were associated with our purchase of acc in august in connection with the purchase of acc  we are obligated to pay up to an additional  in cash if acc meets certain operating income targets for one or both of the two month periods following the closing 
additionally  eec issued subordinated secured contingent promissory notes the notes to each of the sellers of acc in the aggregate principal amount of up to  the notes only become payable if acc meets certain operating income thresholds during the first and second month periods after august  cash provided by our financing activities totaled million in as compared to million in in august  we borrowed million from our lender in connection with the purchase of acc 
during we paid approximately million towards the repayment of long term debt and or notes to stockholders as compared to million in for the year ended december   our cash balances decreased by approximately million due to the unfavorable effects of exchange rates on our cash balances primarily due to decreases in the exchange rate of the british pound sterling and the euro as compared to the us dollar 
this compares to a million increase in cash as a result of the effects of exchange rates on our cash balances during as of december   we had outstanding borrowings of million under the revolving loan portion of our gvec credit facility 
at december   we had remaining actual availability under a formula based calculation of million under the credit facility 
actual remaining availability represents the additional amount we were eligible to borrow as of december  maximum contractual availability represents the maximum amount of availability provided under the contract as of that date and includes the actual remaining availability 
in addition to the revolving lines of credit  at december   we had long term loans and capitalized lease and equipment loan obligations totaling million  the current portion of which loans and obligations totaled million 
our backlog increased to million as of december  as compared to million as of december  the increase is primarily due to the addition of incremental backlog in connection with the acquisition of acc 
the amount of backlog orders represents revenue that we anticipate recognizing in the future  as evidenced by purchase orders and other purchase commitments received from customers  but on which work has not yet been initiated or with respect to which work is currently in progress 
our backlog as of december  was approximately related to our electronic devices business  which business tends to provide us with long lead times for our manufacturing processes due to the custom nature of the products  and approximately related to our communications equipment business  which business tends to deliver standard or modified standard products from stock as orders are received 
we believe that the majority of our current backlog is shippable within the next months 
however  there can be no assurance that we will be successful in fulfilling such orders and commitments in a timely manner or that we will ultimately recognize as revenue the amounts reflected as backlog 
credit facility on november   we and our direct subsidiaries  eec  cxr larus and ro associates entered into a credit agreement with the lender  providing for a credit facility in the aggregate amount of  on august   in connection with the acquisition of acc and cci  we amended the credit facility to include acc and cci as borrowers and to  among other things  include a term loan in the principal amount of  the term loan c 
as of december   we owed a total of million under the credit facility 
in connection with digitran transaction we repaid approximately million in march the credit facility consists of i a one year revolving loan for up to million that may be renewed two times  each for a period of one year the revolver  and ii term loans in net outstanding principal amount of million 
the term loans require scheduled payments commencing september and regular payments thereafter until the loans are paid in full on november  total principal payments on term loans a and b are million in and million in the revolver is formula based and generally provides that the outstanding borrowings under the line of credit may not exceed an aggregate of of eligible accounts receivable  plus of the value of eligible raw materials not to exceed  plus of the value of eligible finished goods inventory not to exceed  minus the aggregate amount of reserves that may be established by the lender 
the revolver has a maturity date of november   unless it is renewed by the lender in which case the maturity date will be extended to november  interest on the revolver is payable monthly 
the interest rate is variable and is adjusted monthly based on prime rate as published in the money rates column of the wall street journal the base rate plus  subject to a minimum rate of 
the revolver is subject to various financial covenants on a consolidated basis  including ebitda  measured on a fiscal quarter end basis  must not be less than the scheduled amount for each specified period  the debt service coverage ratio  measured quarterly  must be greater than the lesser of the scheduled amount for each specific period or  minimum liquidity above the scheduled amount  unfinanced capital expenditures not in excess of  per quarter  and the leverage ratio  measured quarterly  must not be greater than the scheduled amount for each specified period 
additionally  the revolver is subject to the borrowers not incurring purchase money commitments in excess of million 

table of contents the term loans bear interest at the base rate plus  subject to a minimum rate of  and require interest only payments in the first year  scheduled principal plus interest payments in years two and three  and a final balloon payment at the end of year three 
interest on the term loans is payable monthly 
the borrowers under the credit facility may make full or partial prepayment of the term loans provided that any such prepayment is accompanied by the applicable prepayment premium discussed below 
upon the sale or disposition by borrowers or any of their subsidiaries of property or assets  we may be obligated to prepay the revolver and the term loans with the net cash proceeds received in connection with such sales or dispositions to the extent that the aggregate amount of net cash proceeds received and not paid to gvec as a prepayment for all such sales or disposition exceed  in any fiscal year 
if the lender terminates the credit facility during a default period or if we prepay the revolver or the term loans prior to the scheduled maturity dates  then we are subject to penalties as follows if the termination or prepayment occurs during the one year period after november   the penalty is equal to of the outstanding principal balance of the revolver and the term loans  if the termination or prepayment occurs during second year after november   the penalty is equal to of the outstanding principal balance of the revolver and the term loans 
the revolver is subject to an unused line fee of per annum  payable monthly  on any unused portion of the revolving credit facility 
to secure payment of the indebtedness of borrowers under the credit facility  the borrowers irrevocably pledged and assigned to  and granted to the lender a continuing security interest in all the personal property of the borrowers including the borrowers interest in any deposit accounts  the stock of each of the borrowers subsidiaries  the intellectual property owned by each of the borrowers  and the proceeds of the intellectual property owned by each of the borrowers 
in an event of default  the lender may  at its option  exercise any or all remedies available to it with respect to the collateral 
in addition  certain of the borrowers foreign subsidiaries have agreed to guaranty the borrowers performance under the credit facility 
we have agreed with our lender to raise at least million in net proceeds through the sale of stock of the borrowers by no later than september  under to the terms of amendment number to the credit facility  we are obligated to remit to our lender  with respect to the first  of net cash proceeds received in connection with the sale of stock  of the next  of net cash proceeds received in connection with the sale of stock  and of the net cash proceeds in excess of the first  received in connection with the sale of stock 
in that case   would be used to pay down debt and  would remain within emrise to support ongoing working capital needs 
we are currently evaluating a number of options to meet this obligation under our credit facility 
given current economic and financial market conditions even a small equity raise could prove difficult 
if we are successful in structuring an equity raise acceptable to us and our lender  it may result in substantial dilution to our stockholders 
if we are unsuccessful in meeting our lender s requirement for additional capital by the required due dates and or if we breach any of our agreed upon financial covenants under the credit facility  then we will be in default under the terms of our credit facility 
in the event of a default and continuation of a default  whether as a result of our inability to raise additional capital or for some other reason  the lender may limit future availability under our revolving line of credit and or accelerate the payment of all principal balances and accrued interest requiring us to pay the entire indebtedness under our credit facility outstanding on that date 
upon the occurrence and during the continuation of an event of default  the lender may also elect to increase the interest rate applicable to the outstanding balance of the term loans a and b by four percentage points above the per annum interest rate that would otherwise be applicable 
any of these conditions could have a material adverse effect on our operations and or ability to conduct business after that date 
various factors  including the adverse effects of the global market crisis  could impact our lender s ability to provide us with access to the funds available under our credit facility  resulting in our access to cash and our ability to operate our business being negatively affected
