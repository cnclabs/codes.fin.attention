fiscal years and were weeks in length  while the quarters for those years were weeks in length 
long term strategies to grow earnings per share our long term strategies with respect to increasing net income and earnings per share include the following expanding our restaurant base 
we will continue to evaluate opportunities to develop texas roadhouse restaurants in existing markets and new domestic or international markets 
we will remain focused primarily on mid sized markets where we believe there exists a significant demand for our restaurants because of population size  income levels and the presence of shopping and entertainment centers and a significant employment base 
restaurants that we owned and operated for the full six months before the beginning of generated average unit volumes of million for  which was a week year 
when we lease the land  the total cash cost of developing our prototype restaurant  including pre opening expenses  is between million and million 
our average cash investment to develop and open a new restaurant  including the cost of land and pre opening expenses  
table of contents is approximately million to million 
our ability to expand our restaurant base is influenced by factors beyond our control and therefore we may not be able to achieve our anticipated growth 
we may  at our discretion  add franchise restaurants  domestically and or internationally  primarily with franchisees who have demonstrated prior success with the texas roadhouse or other restaurant concepts and in markets in which the franchisee demonstrates superior knowledge of the demographics and restaurant operating conditions 
we may  also  look to acquire franchise restaurants under terms favorable to the company and our stockholders 
additionally  from time to time  we will evaluate potential mergers  acquisitions  joint ventures or other strategic initiatives to acquire or develop additional concepts 
on february   we opened a new restaurant  aspen creek  which is wholly owned by texas roadhouse  inc maintaining and or improving restaurant level profitability 
we plan to maintain  or possibly increase  restaurant level profitability through a combination of increased comparable restaurant sales and operating cost management 
leveraging our scalable infrastructure

we generally incur higher labor costs  as a percentage of restaurant sales  during the first few months after the opening of a new restaurant 
higher average hourly wage rates resulted from several state mandated increases in minimum and tip wage rates throughout and into and an increase in federal minimum wage rate in july we anticipate our labor costs will continue to be pressured by inflation  which is primarily caused by federal and state mandated increases in minimum and tip wage rates 
these increases may or may not be offset by additional menu price adjustments

managing and market partner bonuses were lower  as a percentage of restaurant sales  due to lower profitability 
the increase in credit card fees resulted from the increased use of credit and debit cards as a percentage of restaurant transactions 
our general liability claims experience for the policy year ended september   though favorable  was not as favorable as for the prior year policy period

the million increase in accounts receivable in was due to the timing of credit card settlements as fiscal year ended on a bank holiday 
in addition  higher depreciation was partially offset by lower gift card sales and decreases in other working capital 
our operations have not required significant working capital and  like many restaurant companies  we have been able to operate with negative working capital 
sales are primarily for cash  and restaurant operations do not require significant inventories or receivables 
in addition  we received trade credit for the purchase of food  beverages and supplies  thereby reducing the need for incremental working capital to support growth

critical accounting policies and estimates the above discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue and expenses  and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities 
our significant accounting policies are described in note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
critical accounting policies are those that we believe are most important to portraying our financial condition and results of operations and also require the greatest amount of subjective or complex judgments by management 
judgments or uncertainties regarding the application of these policies may result in materially different amounts being reported under different conditions or using different assumptions 
we consider the following policies to be the most critical in understanding the judgments that are involved in preparing the consolidated financial statements 
share based employee compensation 
effective with the first quarter of  we account for share based compensation in accordance with sfas r 
as required by sfas r  share based compensation expense is estimated for equity awards at fair value at the grant date 
we determine the 
table of contents fair value of equity awards using the black scholes option pricing model 
the black scholes option pricing model requires various highly judgmental assumptions including the expected dividend yield  stock price volatility and life of the award 
if any of the assumptions used in the model change significantly  share based compensation expense may differ materially in the future from that recorded in the current period 
see note in the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of share based employee compensation

we evaluate our long lived assets for impairment at the individual restaurant level when events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of a restaurant may not be recoverable 
our evaluation requires an estimation of the future undiscounted cash flows from operating the restaurant over its estimated useful life  which can be for a period of over years 
in the estimation of future cash flows  we consider the period of time the restaurant has been open  the trend of operations over such period and future periods and expectations for future sales growth 
we limit assumptions about important factors such as trend of future operations and sales growth to those that are supportable based upon our plans for the restaurant and actual results at comparable restaurants 
as we assess the ongoing expected cash flows and carrying amounts of our long lived assets  these factors could cause us to realize a material impairment charge 
if assets are determined to be impaired  we measure the impairment charge by calculating the amount by which the asset carrying amount exceeds its fair value 
the determination of asset fair value is also subject to significant judgment 
we generally measure estimated fair market value by discounting estimated future cash flows or obtaining an independent third party appraisal  if available 
if these assumptions change in the future  we may be required to record impairment charges for these assets 
we recorded an impairment of million in with respect to one underperforming restaurant in the fourth quarter of we recorded an impairment of million in with respect to one underperforming restaurant in the fourth quarter of additionally  million was incurred in due to a lease reserve and other charges incurred in conjunction with the subsequent closure of the restaurant in the first quarter of the company recorded an impairment loss of million in with respect to two restaurants that were approved to relocate to better sites in their respective markets 
one of these restaurants opened at its new site in january and the other one opened at its new site in september we concluded that no other impairment charge was necessary as a result of our impairment evaluations for  and goodwill 
goodwill is tested annually for impairment  and is tested for impairment more frequently if events and circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired 
an impairment loss is recognized to the extent that the carrying amount exceeds the implied fair value of goodwill 
the determination of impairment consists of two steps 
first  we determine the fair value of the reporting unit and compare it to its carrying amount 
fair value is determined based on discounted cash flows 
second  if the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value  an impairment loss is recognized for any excess of the carrying amount of the reporting unit s goodwill over the implied fair value of the goodwill 
the implied fair value of goodwill is determined by allocating the fair value of the reporting unit  which we consider to be at the restaurant level  in a manner similar to a purchase price allocation  in accordance with sfas no 
 business combinations 
the residual fair value after this allocation is the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill 
the most significant assumptions we use in this analysis are those made in estimating future cash flows 
in estimating future cash flows  we use the assumptions from our strategic plan for items such as sales growth and operating costs 
if our assumptions used in performing the impairment test prove inaccurate  the fair value of the restaurants may ultimately prove to be significantly lower  thereby causing the carrying value to exceed the fair value and indicating impairment has occurred 
we concluded that no goodwill impairment charge was required for  and 
table of contents insurance reserves 
we self insure a significant portion of expected losses under our workers compensation  general liability and property insurance programs 
we purchase insurance for individual claims that exceed the amounts listed below workers compensation general liability property we record a liability for unresolved claims and for an estimate of incurred but not reported claims at the anticipated cost to us based on estimates provided by a third party administrator and actuary 
our estimated liability is based on a number of assumptions and factors regarding economic conditions  the frequency and severity of claims and claim development history and settlement practices 
estimates of claims reserves are discounted using a discount rate of approximately at december  resulting in a discount of million 
an increase or decrease in the discount rate of basis points would change the reserve  and resulting expense  by an immaterial amount 
we also monitor actuarial observations of historical claim development for the industry 
our assumptions are reviewed  monitored  and adjusted when warranted by changing circumstances 
income taxes 
we account for income taxes in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  under which deferred assets and liabilities are recognized based upon anticipated future tax consequences attributable to differences between financial statement carrying values of assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases 
a valuation allowance is established to reduce the carrying value of deferred tax assets if it is considered more likely than not that such assets will not be realized 
any change in the valuation allowance would be charged to income in the period such determination was made 
uncertain tax positions are accounted for under fin fin requires that a position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return be recognized in the financial statements when it is more likely than not ie  a likelihood of more than fifty percent that the position would be sustained upon examination by tax authorities that have full knowledge of all relevant information 
a recognized tax position is then measured at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than fifty percent likely of being realized upon settlement 
effects of inflation we believe inflation has had a negative effect on our operations during the past few years as we have not substantially offset increases in our restaurant and operating costs resulting from inflation by altering our menu  increasing menu prices and or making other adjustments 
whether we are able and or choose to offset the effects of inflation will determine to what  if any  extent inflation affects our operations in future periods 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates on debt and changes in commodity prices 
our exposure to interest rate fluctuations is limited to our outstanding bank debt 
our options for the rate are the base rate  which is the higher of the issuing bank s prime lending rate or the federal funds rate plus  or libor plus an applicable margin 
at december   there was million in outstanding borrowings under our revolving line of credit  which bears interest at approximately to basis points depending on our leverage ratios over libor 
we had various other notes payable totaling million with fixed interest rates ranging from to 
should interest rates based on these borrowings increase by one percentage point  our estimated annual interest expense would increase by million 

table of contents on october   we entered into an interest rate swap  which started on november   with a notional amount of million to hedge a portion of the cash flows of our variable rate borrowings 
we have designated the interest rate swap as a cash flow hedge of our exposure to variability in future cash flows attributable to interest payments on a million tranche of floating rate debt borrowed under our revolving credit facility 
under the terms of the swap  we pay a fixed rate of on the million notional amount and receive payments from the counterparty based on the month libor rate for a term ending on november   effectively resulting in a fixed rate on the libor component of the million notional amount 
by using a derivative instrument to hedge exposures to changes in interest rates  we expose ourselves to credit risk 
credit risk is the failure of the counterparty to perform under the terms of the derivative contract 
we minimize the credit risk by entering into transactions with high quality counterparties whose credit rating is evaluated on a quarterly basis 
our counterparty in the interest rate swap is jp morgan chase  jp many of the ingredients used in the products sold in our restaurants are commodities that are subject to unpredictable price volatility 
there are no established fixed price markets for certain commodities such as produce and cheese  and we are subject to prevailing market conditions when purchasing those types of commodities 
for other commodities  we employ various purchasing and pricing contract techniques in an effort to minimize volatility  including fixed price contracts for terms of one year or less and negotiating prices with vendors with reference to fluctuating market prices 
we currently do not use financial instruments to hedge commodity prices  but we will continue to evaluate their effectiveness 
extreme and or long term increases in commodity prices could adversely affect our future results  especially if we are unable  primarily due to competitive reasons  to increase menu prices 
additionally  if there is a time lag between the increasing commodity prices and our ability to increase menu prices or if we believe the commodity price increase to be short in duration and we choose not to pass on the cost increases  our short term financial results could be negatively affected 
we are subject to business risk as our beef supply is highly dependent upon three vendors 
if any of these vendors were unable to fulfill its obligations under its contracts  we may encounter supply shortages and incur higher costs to secure adequate supplies  any of which would harm our business
