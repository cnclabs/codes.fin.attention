in light of these risks  uncertainties and assumptions  the forward looking events discussed may not occur 
we undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward looking statement  whether as a result of new information  future events or otherwise 
overview we explore for and develop oil and natural gas in the rocky mountain region of the united states 
on december   we completed our initial public offering in which we received net proceeds of million after deducting underwriting fees and other offering costs 
we intend to increase stockholder value by profitably growing reserves and production  primarily through drilling our development properties 
we seek high quality exploration and development projects with potential for providing long term drilling inventories that generate high returns 
substantially all of our revenues are generated through the sale of natural gas and oil production at market prices and the settlement of commodity hedges 
approximately of our december production volume was natural gas 
we were formed in january since inception  we substantially increased our activity level and the number of properties that we operate 
our operating results reflect this growth 
we began active natural gas and oil operations in march upon the acquisition of properties in the wind river basin 
also in  we completed two additional acquisitions of properties in the uinta  wind river  powder river and williston basins 
in early  we completed an acquisition of largely undeveloped coalbed methane properties located in the powder river basin 
in september  we acquired properties in the piceance basin in or around the gibson gulch field the piceance basin acquisition properties 
in may  we acquired additional coalbed methane properties in the powder river basin of wyoming 
in june  we sold our williston basin properties 
a summary of our significant property acquisitions is as follows primary locations of acquired properties date acquired purchase price in millions wind river basin march uinta basin april wind river  powder river and williston basins december powder river basin march piceance basin september powder river basin may 
table of contents because of our rapid growth through acquisitions and development of our properties  our historical results of operations and period to period comparisons of these results and certain financial data may not be meaningful or indicative of future results 
our acquisitions were financed with a combination of funding from equity investments in our company  our credit facility  cash flow from operations and  in the case of the piceance basin properties  a bridge loan that we repaid in december with a portion of the proceeds from our initial public offering 
as of december   we had bcfe of estimated net proved reserves with a standardized measure of million at cigrm and wti 
as of december   we had bcfe of estimated net proved reserves with a standardized measure of million at cigrm and wti  while at december   we had bcfe of estimated net proved reserves with a standardized measure of million at cigrm and wti 
the average sales prices received for natural gas  before the effects of hedging contracts  for the years ended december   and were per mcf  per mcf and per mcf  respectively  and for oil per bbl  per bbl and per bbl  respectively 
after the effects of all hedging contracts  the average sales prices received for natural gas for the years ended december   and were per mcf  per mcf and per mcf  respectively  and for oil per bbl  per bbl and per bbl  respectively 
oil and natural gas prices  particularly in the rockies  are inherently volatile and are influenced by many factors outside of our control 
we plan our activities and capital budget using a conservative sales price assumption and our existing hedge position 
it is our board approved strategic objective to hedge at least of our anticipated production on a forward month basis 
we focus our efforts on increasing natural gas reserves and production while controlling costs at a level that is appropriate for long term operations 
our future earnings and cash flows are dependent on our ability to manage our overall cost structure to a level that allows for profitable production 
like all oil and gas exploration and production companies  we face the challenge of natural production declines 
as initial reservoir pressures are depleted  oil and gas production from a given well naturally decreases 
thus  an oil and gas exploration and production company depletes part of its asset base with each unit of oil or natural gas it produces 
we attempt to overcome this natural decline by drilling to find additional reserves and acquiring more reserves than we produce 
our future growth will depend on our ability to continue to add reserves in excess of production 
we will maintain our focus on costs to add reserves through drilling and acquisitions as well as the costs necessary to produce such reserves 
our ability to add reserves through drilling is dependent on our capital resources and can be limited by many factors  including our ability to timely obtain drilling permits and regulatory approvals 
see below  trends and uncertainties regulatory trends 
the permitting and approval process has been more difficult in recent years than in the past due to more stringent rules  such as those recently enacted by the colorado oil and gas conservation commission  increased activism from environmental and other groups  which has extended the time it takes us to receive permits  and other necessary approvals 
because of our relatively small size and concentrated property base  we can be disproportionately disadvantaged by delays in obtaining or failing to obtain drilling approvals compared to companies with larger or more dispersed property bases 
as a result  we are less able to shift drilling activities to areas where permitting may be easier and we have fewer properties over which to spread the costs related to complying with these regulations and the costs or foregone opportunities resulting from delays 

table of contents results of operations the following table sets forth selected operating data for the periods indicated to increase decrease to increase decrease year ended december  year ended december  year ended december  amount percent amount percent in thousands  except per unit data operating results operating revenues oil and gas production commodity derivative gain other total operating and other revenues operating expenses lease operating expense gathering and transportation expense production tax expense exploration expense impairment  dry hole costs and abandonment expense depreciation  depletion and amortization general and administrative expense non cash stock based compensation expense total operating expenses production data natural gas mmcf oil mbbls combined volumes mmcfe daily combined volumes mmcfe d average prices natural gas per mcf oil per bbl combined per mcfe average costs per mcfe lease operating expense gathering and transportation expense production tax expense depreciation  depletion and amortization general and administrative expense non cash stock based compensation expense is presented herein as a separate line item but is combined with general and administrative expense in the consolidated statements of operations for a total of million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
this separate presentation is a non gaap measure 
management believes the separate presentation of the non cash component of general and administrative expense is useful because the cash portion provides a better understanding of our required cash for general and administrative expenses 
we also believe that this disclosure allows for a more accurate comparison to our peers  which may have higher or lower costs associated with stock based grants 
average prices shown in the table are net of the effects of all of our realized commodity hedging transactions 
our average realized price calculation includes all cash settlements for commodity derivatives  whether or not they qualify for hedge accounting under sfas no

year ended december  compared to year ended december  production revenues 
production revenues increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  due to a increase in production and a increase in natural gas and oil prices after the effects of realized hedges on a per mcfe basis 
the net increase in production added approximately million of production revenues  and the increase in prices on a per mcfe basis increased production revenues by approximately million 
total production volumes for the calendar year of bcfe increased from bcfe for the calendar year due to increased production in the piceance  uinta  wind river and powder river basins 
the increased production was partially offset by the sale of the williston basin properties in june additional information concerning production is in the following table 
year ended december  year ended december  increase decrease oil natural gas total oil natural gas total oil natural gas total mbbls mmcf mmcfe mbbls mmcf mmcfe mbbls mmcf mmcfe piceance basin uinta basin wind river basin powder river basin williston basin other total the sale of the williston basin properties was completed on june  the production increase in the piceance basin was the result of our continued development activities  with initial sales on new gross wells throughout the production increase in the uinta basin reflects our continued exploration and development activities in the west tavaputs  blacktail ridge and lake canyon fields 
during the year ended december   we had initial sales on new gross wells in the uinta basin 
the production increase in the wind river basin was due to the highly successful recompletion of an existing well in cave gulch to a third zone in the frontier formation in may that had peak production rates in excess of mmcfe d 
this production was partially offset by natural production declines in our cave gulch  cooper reservoir and wallace creek fields that occurred throughout the production increase in the powder river basin was the result of our continued development activities with initial sales on new gross wells for the year ended december  as of december   we had net operated coalbed methane wells in the dewatering stage 
also of note and included in other is production from our first two gross wells related to our paradox basin shale gas discovery at our yellow jacket prospect  which had first sales in late december 
table of contents hedging activities 
in  approximately of our natural gas volumes and of our oil volumes were hedged  which resulted in an increase in gas revenues of million  offset by a reduction in oil revenues of million after cash settlements for all commodity derivatives 
in  we hedged approximately of our natural gas volumes and of our oil volumes  which resulted in an increase in gas revenues of million  offset by a reduction in oil revenues of million after cash settlements for all commodity derivatives 
commodity derivative gain 
during the year ended december   we determined that the forecasted transactions to which certain mid continent natural gas hedges had been designated were no longer probable of occurring within the specified time periods 
we therefore discontinued hedge accounting for these hedges in accordance with sfas no 
in addition  we entered into basis only swaps for natural gas production in the rocky mountain region  which do not qualify for cash flow hedge accounting during the period 
the change in the fair value of the derivative instruments that do not qualify for cash flow hedge accounting is recognized in the line item titled commodity derivative gain in the condensed consolidated statements of operations 
the table below summarizes the realized and unrealized gains and losses we recognized in commodity derivative gain for the periods indicated year ended december  in thousands realized gains on derivatives not designated as cash flow hedges unrealized ineffectiveness recognized on derivatives designated as cash flow hedges unrealized gains on derivatives not designated as cash flow hedges total commodity derivative gain other operating revenues 
other operating revenues decreased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  other operating revenues for primarily consisted of gains realized from the sale of properties  gathering and rental fees and the sale of seismic data 
other operating revenues for primarily consisted of a gain realized on the sale of the williston basin properties  along with gains realized from joint exploration agreements entered into in the paradox and uinta basins 
lease operating expense 
the decrease in lease operating expense to per mcfe in from per mcfe in was primarily the result of decreased expenses on a mcfe basis in the piceance  powder river and wind river basins offset by an increase in the uinta basin 
the following table displays the lease operating expense per mcfe by basin year ended december  year ended december  increase decrease in thousands per mcfe in thousands per mcfe per mcfe piceance basin uinta basin wind river basin powder river basin williston basin other total 
table of contents lease operating expenses in the piceance basin decreased to per mcfe for the year ended december  from per mcfe for the year ended december  primarily due to the implementation of a new water disposal pipeline system  which substantially reduced water hauling expenses 
the increase in the uinta basin to per mcfe for the year ended december  from per mcfe for the year ended december  was the result of three scheduled compressor overhauls that took place in  along with increased workover and lease maintenance costs in the west tavaputs field 
higher costs related to high pour point oil production in our early development program in the lake canyon and blacktail ridge fields also contributed to the higher lease operating expense in the uinta basin 
lease operating expense decreased in the powder river basin to per mcfe for the year ended december  from per mcfe for the year ended december  primarily as a result of lower well service  lease maintenance  fuel  and labor costs as well as initial production on wells that were previously in the dewatering stage  which provided increased production without increasing costs thereby causing the cost per mcfe to decline 
lease operating expense decreased in the wind river basin to per mcfe for the year ended december  from per mcfe for the year ended december  as a result of lower well servicing and workover costs  along with an increase in production from the recompletion of the bullfrog well  which had peak production rates in excess of mmcfe d 
gathering and transportation expense 
gathering and transportation expense increased to per mcfe in from per mcfe in primarily due to additional transportation and processing contracts that went into effect throughout and along with increased fuel costs 
the following table displays the gathering and transportation expense by basin year ended december  year ended december  increase decrease in thousands per mcfe in thousands per mcfe per mcfe piceance basin uinta basin wind river basin powder river basin other total we have entered into long term firm transportation contracts for a portion of our production to guarantee capacity on major pipelines and reduce the risk and impact related to possible production curtailments that may arise due to limited pipeline capacity 
the majority of our long term firm transportation agreements are for gas production in the piceance  uinta and powder river basins where we expect to allocate a significant portion of our capital expenditure program in future years 
in addition  we have entered into long term firm processing contracts on a portion of our production in the piceance and uinta basins 
included in the above gathering and transportation expense are and per mcfe of firm transportation expense and and per mcfe of firm processing expense from long term contracts for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the increase in firm transportation expense to per mcfe for the year ended december  from per mcfe for the year ended december  was the result of additional long term contracts with rockies express pipeline and questar pipeline to deliver  gross mmbtu per day to each pipeline 
our transportation commitment with rockies express pipeline  which was effective january  provides us access to sell natural gas to mid continent markets 
our commitment with questar pipeline  which was effective november  provides us the flexibility to access and sell natural gas to various rocky mountain markets 
production tax expense 
total production taxes increased to million in from million in the increase in production tax expense was primarily related to the increase in 
table of contents natural gas and oil revenues before the effects of hedging 
production taxes as a percentage of natural gas and oil revenues before the effects of hedging were for and for production taxes are primarily based on the wellhead values of production and the tax rates that vary across the different areas in which we operate 
as the proportion of our production changes from area to area  our production tax rate will vary depending on the quantities produced from each area and the production tax rates in effect 
exploration expense 
exploration expense decreased to million in from million in exploration expense for consisted of million for seismic programs  principally in the big horn  uinta and paradox basins  million for delay rentals and million for two scientific wells drilled for data gathering purposes 
the expense for consisted of million for seismic programs  principally in the montana overthrust  paradox and big horn basins  along with million for delay rentals and other exploration costs 
impairment  dry hole costs and abandonment expense 
our impairment  dry hole costs and abandonment expense increased to million in from million in during  impairment expense was million  abandonment expense was million  dry hole costs included million for a well drilled in the uinta basin and million for additional costs on wells that were deemed to be uneconomic in prior years 
the million for dry hole costs were associated with the peters point ultra deep well  which was completed in june and was tested and determined to be non commercial in the pennsylvanian weber sandstone and mississippi leadville zones 
therefore  a proportionate share of the well cost was expensed 
during  impairment expense was million  abandonment expenses were million and dry holes and partial dry holes in the wind river non operated  paradox and uinta basins were million 
in  we also expensed million related to two wells in the montana overthrust area that were tested and determined to be non commercial in the zones below the cody shale  thus  a proportionate share of the well costs were expensed 
we evaluate the impairment of our proved oil and gas properties on a field by field basis whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate a property s carrying amount may not be recoverable 
if the carrying amount exceeds the property s estimated fair value  we will adjust the carrying amount of the property to fair value through a charge to impairment expense 
for  our impairment testing required us to take a non cash impairment charge to our proved oil and gas properties in the cooper reservoir field  located in the wind river basin  of million primarily as the result of geologic and engineering reevaluations  as well as lower oil and gas prices at december  unevaluated oil and gas properties are also assessed periodically for impairment on a property by property basis based on remaining lease terms  drilling results  reservoir performance  commodity price outlooks or future plans to develop existing acreage 
during the year ended december   we recognized a non cash impairment charge of million primarily on the carrying value of unevaluated oil and gas properties in the talon field  which is also located in the wind river basin 
both the cooper reservoir and talon fields are not considered strategic areas for future operations 
in  based upon our fair value analysis  we recognized a million non cash impairment charge associated with our tri state properties within the dj basin 
we subsequently sold these properties in for an immaterial gain 
we account for oil and gas exploration and production activities using the successful efforts method of accounting under which we capitalize exploratory well costs until a determination is made as to whether or not the wells have found proved reserves 
if proved reserves are not assigned to an exploratory well  the costs of drilling the well are charged to expense 
otherwise  the costs remain capitalized and are depleted as production occurs 
the following table shows the costs of exploratory wells for which drilling was completed and which are included in unevaluated oil and gas properties as 
table of contents of december  pending determination of whether the wells will be assigned proved reserves 
the following table does not include million related to exploratory wells in progress for which drilling had not been completed at december  time elapsed since drilling completed months months months months total in thousands wells for which drilling has been completed the majority of the million of exploratory well costs that have been capitalized for a period greater than one year are for wells located in the powder river basin 
in this basin  we drill wells into various coal seams 
in order to produce gas from the coal seams  a period of dewatering lasting from a few to months  or in some cases longer  is required prior to obtaining sufficient gas production to justify capital expenditures for compression and gathering and to classify the reserves as proved 
in addition to our wells in the powder river basin  we have six wells that have been capitalized for greater than one year located in the montana overthrust area  and in the paradox  big horn and uinta basins 
the two wells located in the montana overthrust area are under economic evaluation for possible development  as we are assessing and conducting appraisal operations to determine whether economic reserves can be attributed to this area 
in the paradox basin  we have one well that will be re entered and converted to a horizontal well  and completion work is planned for the second well during the second quarter of the well located in the big horn basin is pending upgrades of production gathering and processing facilities 
the well located in the uinta basin is pending the development of a gas gathering infrastructure 
depreciation  depletion and amortization

the capital expenditures for proved properties for each area compared to the proved reserves corresponding to each producing area determine a weighted average dd a rate for current production 
future dd a rates will be adjusted to reflect future capital expenditures and proved reserve changes in specific areas 
general and administrative expense 
general and administrative expense  excluding non cash stock based compensation  increased to million in from million in this increase was primarily due to increased costs related to our employees compensation and benefit plans and additional personnel required for our capital program and production levels 
as of december   we had full time employees in our corporate office compared to as of december  in addition  we had increased costs in connection to the regulatory rule making process during on a per mcfe basis  general and administrative expense  excluding non cash stock based compensation  did not change and remained at per mcfe for the year ended december  
table of contents non cash charges for stock based compensation were million in compared to million in non cash stock based compensation expense for and was related to the vesting of our stock option awards and nonvested shares of common stock issued to employees 
the increase in charges for non cash stock based compensation during was primarily due to additional equity awards  which were granted during the latter part of and in the components of non cash stock based compensation for and are shown in the following table

the weighted average interest rates used to capitalize interest for the years ended december  and were and  respectively  which included interest on both our convertible notes and amended credit facility  commitment fees paid on the unused portion of our amended credit facility  amortization of deferred financing and debt issuance costs and the effects of interest rate hedges 
we capitalized interest costs of million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
income tax expense 
our effective tax rates were and in and  respectively 
our effective tax rate differs from the statutory rates primarily because we recorded stock based compensation expense under sfas no 
revised  share based payment sfas no 
r  and other operating expenses that are not deductible for income tax purposes 
due to the tax deductions created by our drilling activities  we expect that we will incur cash income tax liabilities relating only to the alternative minimum tax  or amt  in the next year 
at december   we had approximately million of federal tax net operating loss carryforwards  or nols  which expire through we also have a federal amt credit carryforward of million  which has no expiration date 
we believe it is more likely than not that we will use these nols to offset and reduce current tax liabilities in future years 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  production revenues 
production revenues increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  due to a increase in production  offset by a decrease in natural gas prices after the effect of realized hedges 
the average cigrm first of market price was lower than in the net decrease in prices on a per mcfe basis lowered production revenues by approximately million  while production increases added approximately million of production revenues  after natural production declines  so that new production from our drilling program more than offset natural production declines

the increase in production was partially offset by decreases in the williston basin of which we sold on june   the wind river basin of and the powder river basins of 
unscheduled third party plant downtime  pipeline curtailments  compressor maintenance and intentional well shut ins due to low gas daily prices in the rocky mountain region resulted in production volumes being approximately bcf lower than well capacity for the year ended december  additional information concerning production is in the following table

during the year ended december   we had initial sales on new gross wells 
the production increase in the piceance basin was the result of our continued development activities  with initial sales on new gross wells 
the production decrease in the wind river basin was due to natural production declines in our cave gulch  cooper reservoir and wallace creek fields that occurred throughout  with no significant drilling or recompletion activities to offset these declines 
the production decrease in the powder river basin was due to natural production declines in our existing mature fields and the lag time between drilling of coalbed methane well and production of natural gas while dewatering occurs 
this was partially offset by initial sales on new gross wells for the year ended december  as of december   we had net operated coalbed methane wells in the dewatering stage 
hedging activities 
in  we hedged approximately of our natural gas volumes and of our oil volumes  which resulted in an increase in gas revenues of million  offset by a reduction in oil revenues of million

lease operating expense 
the increase in lease operating expense to per mcfe in compared to in is primarily the result of increased expenses in the powder river  wind river and piceance basins 
lease operating expense increased in the powder river basin to per 
table of contents mcfe in from per mcfe in due to substantially higher water handling charges on dewatering wells in new pilot areas that had no offsetting gas production as yet 
lease operating expenses  on a per unit basis  in the powder river basin were also adversely affected by the basin wide pipeline curtailments 
as of december   we had net operated coalbed methane wells in the dewatering stage 
lease operating expense increased in the wind river basin to per mcfe in from per mcfe in due to natural production declines in our cave gulch  cooper reservoir and wallace creek fields  while actual lease operating expenses have remained relatively stable 
lease operating expense increased in the piceance basin to per mcfe in from per mcfe in as a result of higher than expected water transportation and disposal costs

income tax expense 
our effective tax rates were and in and  respectively 
for both the and periods  our effective tax rate differs from the statutory rates primarily because we recorded stock based compensation expense under accounting principles board apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and sfas no 
r  that is not deductible for income tax purposes 
we have a significant deferred tax asset associated with nols 
it is more likely than not that we will use these nols to offset and minimize current tax liabilities  including amt  in future years 
capital resources and liquidity our primary sources of liquidity since our formation in january have been sales and other issuances of equity securities  net cash provided by operating activities  bank credit facilities  convertible senior notes  proceeds from joint exploration agreements and sales of interests in properties 
our primary use of capital has been for the exploration  development and acquisition of natural gas and oil properties 
as we pursue profitable reserve and production growth  we continually monitor the capital resources  including issuance of equity and debt securities  available to us to meet our future financial obligations  planned capital expenditure activities and liquidity 
our future success in growing proved reserves and production will be highly dependent on capital resources available to us and our success in finding or acquiring additional reserves 
currently  the debt and equity markets are under considerable stress and dislocation making financing transactions difficult and expensive to complete if they can be completed at all 
however  we believe that we have significant liquidity available to us under our amended credit facility for our planned uses of capital 
in addition  our strong hedge position 
table of contents provides relative certainty on a significant portion of our cash flows from operations even upon a decline in the price of natural gas and oil resulting from decreased demand and the market crisis in general 
see below  trends and uncertainties declining commodity prices 
we actively review acquisition opportunities on an ongoing basis 
if we were to make significant additional acquisitions for cash  we may need to obtain additional equity or debt financing  which under current market conditions we may not be able to obtain on terms acceptable to us or at all 
at december   our balance sheet reflected a cash and cash equivalents balance of million with a balance of million of borrowings outstanding under our amended credit facility 
at december   the borrowing base under our amended credit facility after a reduction for our convertible notes outstanding was million  with commitments from over seven banks totaling million 
cash flow from operating activities net cash provided by operating activities was million  million and million in  and  respectively 
the increases in net cash provided by operating activities were primarily due to an increase in oil and gas revenues  along with the changes in current assets and liabilities  which were offset by increased expenses  as discussed above in results of operations 
changes in current assets and liabilities increased cash flow from operations by million and million in and  respectively  and reduced cash flow from operations by million in our operating cash flow is sensitive to many variables  the most significant of which is the volatility of prices for natural gas and oil production 
prices for these commodities are determined primarily by prevailing market conditions 
regional and worldwide economic activity  weather  infrastructure capacity to reach markets and other variable factors influence market conditions for these products 
these factors are beyond our control and are difficult to predict 
for additional information on the impact of changing prices on our financial position  see item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk below 
to mitigate some of the potential negative impact on cash flow caused by changes in natural gas and oil prices  we have entered into financial commodity swap and collar contracts to receive fixed prices for a portion of our natural gas and oil production 
we typically hedge a fixed price for natural gas at our sales points new york mercantile exchange nymex less basis to mitigate the risk of differentials to the nymex henry hub index 
at december   we had in place natural gas and crude oil financial collars and swaps covering portions of our  and production 
in addition to financial transactions  we are a party to various physical commodity contracts for the sale of natural gas that cover varying periods of time and have varying pricing provisions 
under sfas no 
 these physical commodity contracts qualify for the normal purchase and normal sales exception and  therefore  are not subject to hedge or mark to market accounting 
the financial impact of physical commodity contracts is included in oil and gas production revenues at the time of settlement 
all derivative instruments  other than those that meet the normal purchase and normal sales exception as mentioned above  are recorded at fair market value in accordance with sfas no 
and are included in the consolidated balance sheets as assets or liabilities 
as required under sfas no 
 all fair values are adjusted for non performance risk 
for derivative instruments that qualify and are designated as cash flow hedges  changes in fair value  to the extent the hedge is effective  are recognized in other comprehensive income until the forecasted transaction occurs 
the ineffective portion of hedge derivatives is reported in commodity derivative gain or loss in the consolidated statements of operations 
realized gains and losses on cash flow hedges are transferred from other comprehensive income and recognized in earnings and included within oil and gas production revenues in the consolidated statements of operations as the associated production occurs 

table of contents if the forecasted transaction to which the hedging instrument had been designated is no longer probable of occurring within the specified time period  the hedging instrument loses cash flow hedge accounting treatment in accordance with sfas no 
all current mark to market gains and losses are recorded in earnings and all accumulated gains or losses recorded in other comprehensive income related to the hedging instrument are also reclassified to earnings 
due to our limited ability to sell our natural gas out of the rocky mountain region to the mid continent region at index prices  and due to an unexpected pipeline curtailment on rockies express that restricted our ability to transport to the mid continent  a portion of our mid continent gas derivatives no longer qualified for hedge accounting during the year ended december  we therefore discontinued hedge accounting for certain hedges during we recognized million in unrealized net gain within commodity derivative gain in the consolidated statements of operations for the year ended december   attributable to hedges that no longer qualified for hedge accounting 
while such derivative contracts no longer qualify for hedge accounting as of december   we believe that these contracts remain a valuable component of our commodity price risk management program 
some of our derivatives do not qualify for hedge accounting under sfas no 
but are  to a degree  an economic offset to our commodity price exposure 
if a derivative instrument does not qualify as a cash flow hedge or is not designated as a cash flow hedge  the change in the fair value of the derivative is recognized in commodity derivative gain or loss in the consolidated statements of operations 
these mark to market adjustments produce a degree of earnings volatility but have no cash flow impact relative to changes in market prices 
our cash flow is only impacted when the underlying physical sales transaction takes place in the future and when the associated derivative instrument contract is settled by making or receiving a payment to or from the counterparty 
realized gains and losses of derivative instruments that do not qualify as cash flow hedges are recognized in commodity derivative gain or loss in the consolidated statements of operations and are reflected in cash flows from operations on the consolidated statements of cash flows 
during the year ended december   in addition to the swaps and collars discussed above  we entered into basis only swaps 
with a basis only swap  we have hedged the difference between the nymex price and the price received for our natural gas production at the specific delivery location 
although we believe this is a sound economic hedging strategy  the basis only swaps do not qualify for hedge accounting under sfas no 
because the total future cash flow has not been fixed 
as a result  the changes in fair value of these derivative instruments are recorded in earnings 
as of december   we had basis only hedges in place for a portion of our anticipated natural gas production in  and for a total of  mmbtu 
we recognized million in unrealized net gain within commodity derivative gain in the consolidated statements of operations for the year ended december  attributable to these basis only swaps 
at december   the estimated fair value of all of our commodity derivative instruments was a net asset of million comprised of current and noncurrent assets  including a fair value net asset of million for basis only swaps 
we will reclassify the appropriate cash flow hedge amounts to gains or losses included in natural gas and oil production operating revenues as the hedged production quantities are produced 
based on current projected market prices  the net amount of existing unrealized after tax income as of december  to be reclassified from other comprehensive income to earnings in the next months would be a gain of approximately million 
any actual increase or decrease in revenues will depend upon market conditions over the period during which the forecasted transactions occur 
we anticipate that all originally forecasted transactions related to our derivatives that continue to be accounted for as cash flow hedges will occur by the end of the originally specified time periods 
the hedge instruments designated as cash flow hedges are at highly liquid trading locations but may contain slight differences compared to the delivery location of the forecasted sale  which may result in ineffectiveness in accordance with sfas no

table of contents by removing the price volatility from a portion of our natural gas and oil production for and and a portion of our natural gas production for and  we have mitigated  but not eliminated  the potential effects of changing prices on our operating cash flow for those periods 
while mitigating negative effects of falling commodity prices  these derivative contracts also limit the benefits we would receive from increases in commodity prices 
by using derivative instruments that are not traded on an exchange to hedge exposures to changes in commodity prices  we expose ourselves to the credit risk of our counterparties 
credit risk is the potential failure of the counterparty to perform under the terms of the derivative contract 
when the fair value of a derivative contract is positive  the counterparty is expected to owe us  which creates credit risk 
to minimize the credit risk in derivative instruments  it is our policy to enter into derivative contracts only with counterparties that are creditworthy financial institutions deemed by management as competent and competitive market makers 
the creditworthiness of our counterparties is subject to periodic review 
we have hedges in place with eight different counterparties  of which all but one are lenders in our amended credit facility 
as of december   jp morgan chase company  j

we believe all of these institutions currently are acceptable credit risks 
we are not required to provide credit support or collateral to any of our counterparties under current contracts  nor are they required to provide credit support to us

capital expenditures our capital expenditures are summarized in the following tables year ended december  basin area in millions uinta piceance powder river wind river paradox other total year ended december  in millions acquisitions of proved and unevaluated properties and other real estate drilling  development  exploration and exploitation of natural gas and oil properties geologic and geophysical costs and exploratory dry holes and abandonment costs furniture  fixtures and equipment total includes million of non cash deferred tax liability associated with the difference between the tax basis of the properties acquired in the ch acquisition and the book basis attributed to the properties under the purchase method of accounting 

table of contents includes related gathering and facilities  but excludes exploratory dry holes  which are expensed under successful efforts accounting as exploration expense 
for the years ended december   and  we received million  million and million  respectively  of proceeds principally from the sale of interests in oil and gas properties  which are not deducted from the capital expenditures presented above 
total unevaluated properties increased million to million at december   from million at december  the increase was principally from an increase in wells in progress resulting from increased development and exploratory drilling activity during the year ended december  our board of directors has approved a capital budget of million for  however  due to current commodity price forecasts and capital markets constraints  we plan to align capital spending with cash flow from operations 
our current estimate is for a capital budget of up to million  which may be adjusted throughout the year as business conditions warrant 
we expect that we have sufficient available liquidity through with the amended credit facility  our hedge position and cash flow from operations 
future cash flows are subject to a number of variables  including our level of natural gas and oil production  commodity prices and operating costs 
there can be no assurance that operations and other capital resources will provide sufficient amounts of cash flow to maintain planned levels of capital expenditures 
the amount  timing and allocation of capital expenditures is generally discretionary and within our control 
if natural gas and oil prices decline to levels below our acceptable levels or costs increase to levels above our acceptable levels  we could choose to defer a portion of our budgeted capital expenditures until later periods to achieve the desired balance between sources and uses of liquidity by prioritizing capital projects to first focus on those that we believe will have the highest expected financial returns and ability to generate near term cash flow 
we routinely monitor and adjust our capital expenditures in response to changes in prices  availability of financing  drilling and acquisition costs  industry conditions  the timing of regulatory approvals  the availability of rigs  success or lack of success in drilling activities  contractual obligations  internally generated cash flow and other factors both within and outside our control 
financing activities credit facility 
our amended credit facility  which matures on march   has commitments of million and  based on mid year reserves and our hedge positions  a borrowing base of million after a reduction related to our convertible notes outstanding 
future borrowing bases will be computed based on proved natural gas and oil reserves  hedge positions and estimated future cash flows from those reserves  as well as any other outstanding debt 
the borrowing base is required to be redetermined at least twice per year 
the amended credit facility bears interest  based on the borrowing base usage  at the applicable london interbank offered rate libor plus applicable margins ranging from to or an alternate base rate  based upon the greater of the prime rate  the federal funds effective rate plus or the adjusted one month libor plus plus applicable margins ranging from to 
we pay commitment fees ranging from to of the unused borrowing base 
the amended credit facility is secured by natural gas and oil properties representing at least of the value of our proved reserves and the pledge of all of the stock of our subsidiaries

the amended credit facility also contains certain 
table of contents financial covenants 
we are currently in compliance with all financial covenants and have complied with all financial covenants for all prior periods 
in december  we entered into two interest rate derivative contracts to manage our exposure to changes in interest rates 
the first contract was a floating to fixed interest rate swap for a notional amount of million and the second was a floating to fixed interest rate collar for a notional amount of million  both to terminate on december  under the swap  we will make payments to or receive payments from the contract counterparty when the variable rate of one month libor falls below or exceeds the fixed rate of 
under the collar  we will make payments to or receive payments from the contract counterparty when the variable rate falls below the floor rate of or exceeds the ceiling rate of 
our interest rate derivative instruments have been designated as cash flow hedges in accordance with sfas no 
changes in fair value of the interest rate swaps or collars are reported in other comprehensive income  to the extent the hedge is effective  until the forecasted transaction occurs  at which time they are recorded as adjustments to interest expense 
ineffectiveness related to such derivative instruments was de minimis for both the years ended december  and during the year ended december   net settlement payments on the interest rate derivative contracts  which were included in interest expense  were million 
we anticipate that all originally forecasted transactions will occur by the end of the originally specified time periods 
as of december   based on current projected interest rates  the amount to be reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income to net income in the next months would be a reduction of approximately million 
at december   the estimated fair value of the interest rate derivatives was a liability of million 
convertible notes 
on march   we issued million aggregate principal amount of convertible notes 
the full million principal amount of the convertible notes is currently outstanding 
the convertible notes mature on march   unless earlier converted  redeemed  or purchased by us 
the conversion price is approximately per share of our common stock  equal to the applicable conversion rate of shares of our common stock  subject to adjustment upon certain events 
upon conversion of the convertible notes  holders will receive  at our election  cash  shares of common stock  or a combination of cash and shares of common stock 
the convertible notes bear interest at a rate of per annum  payable semi annually in arrears on march and september of each year  beginning september  the convertible notes are not traded on a public exchange 
therefore  based on market based parameters of the various components of the convertible note  the estimated fair value was approximately million as of december  on or after march   we may redeem for cash all or a portion of the convertible notes at a redemption price equal to of the principal amount of the convertible notes to be redeemed  plus accrued and unpaid interest  if any  up to  but excluding  the applicable redemption date 
in satisfaction of our obligation upon conversion of the convertible notes  we may elect to deliver  at our option  cash  shares of our common stock or a combination of cash and shares of our common stock 
we currently intend to net cash settle the convertible notes 
however  we have not made a formal legal irrevocable election to net cash settle and reserve the right to settle the convertible notes in any manner allowed under the indenture for the convertible notes as business conditions warrant 
holders of the convertible notes may require us to purchase all or a portion of their convertible notes for cash on each of march   march   march  and march  at a purchase price equal to of the principal amount of the convertible notes to be repurchased  plus accrued and unpaid interest  if any  up to but excluding the applicable purchase date 
holders may convert their convertible notes into cash  shares of our common stock  or a combination of cash and shares of our common stock  as elected by us  at any time prior to the close of business on september   if any of the following conditions are satisfied if the closing price 
table of contents of our common stock reaches specified thresholds or the trading price of the convertible notes falls below specified thresholds  if the convertible notes have been called for redemption  if we make certain significant distributions to holders of our common stock  or we enter into specified corporate transactions  none of which occurred during or through the date of the filing of this form k 
after september   holders may surrender their convertible notes for conversion at any time prior to the close of business on the business day immediately preceding the maturity date regardless of whether any of the foregoing conditions have been satisfied 
in addition  following certain corporate transactions that constitute a qualifying fundamental change  we are required to increase the applicable conversion rate for a holder who elects to convert its convertible notes in connection with such corporate transactions in certain circumstances 
contractual obligations 
a summary of our contractual obligations as of and subsequent to december  is provided in the following table 
payments due by year after total in thousands notes payable convertible notes purchase commitments drilling rig commitments office and office equipment leases and other firm transportation and processing agreements asset retirement obligations derivative liability total included in notes payable is the outstanding principal amount under our amended credit facility 
this table does not include future commitment fees  interest expense or other fees on our amended credit facility because the amended credit facility is a floating rate instrument  and we cannot determine with accuracy the timing of future loan advances  repayments or future interest rates to be charged 
on march   we issued million aggregate principal amount of convertible notes 
for purposes of contractual obligations  we assume that the holders of our convertible notes will not exercise the conversion feature  and we will therefore repay the million in cash 
we currently expect to call the convertible notes for redemption in we are also obligated to make annual interest payments equal to million 
we have two take or pay carbon dioxide co purchasing agreements that expire in october and december  respectively  whereby we have a minimum volume commitment to purchase co at a contracted price  subject to annual escalation 
the contracts are with two different suppliers and provide co used in fracturing operations in our west tavaputs field 
should we not take delivery of the minimum volume required  we would be obligated to pay for the deficiency 
at this time our planned volumes needed exceed the minimum requirement and we do not anticipate any deficiency payments 
we currently have four drilling rigs under contract 
one contract expires in  two contracts expire in  and one contract expires in any other rig performing work for us is doing so on a well by well basis and therefore can be released without penalty at the conclusion of drilling on the current well 
these types of drilling obligations have not been included in the table above 
neither the ultimate settlement amounts nor the timing of our asset retirement obligations can be precisely determined in advance 
see critical accounting policies and estimates below for a more detailed discussion of the nature of the accounting estimates involved in estimating asset retirement obligations 

table of contents derivative liabilities represent the fair value for interest rate derivatives presented as liabilities in our condensed consolidated balance sheets as of december  the ultimate settlement amounts of our derivative liabilities are unknown because they are subject to continuing market fluctuations 
see critical accounting policies and estimates below for a more detailed discussion of the nature of the accounting estimates involved in valuing derivative instruments 
the values in the table represent the gross amounts that the company is financially committed to pay 
however  the company will record in its financials the company s proportionate share based on the company s working interest and net revenue interest  which will vary from basin to basin 
we have entered into contracts that provide firm processing rights and firm transportation capacity on pipeline systems 
the remaining terms on these contracts range from one to years and require us to pay transportation demand and processing charges regardless of the amount of pipeline capacity utilized by us 
trends and uncertainties regulatory trends our future rocky mountain operations and cost of doing business may be affected by changes in regulations and the ability to obtain drilling permits 
our properties located in colorado are subject to the authority of the cogcc 
the cogcc has the authority to regulate oil and gas activities to protect public health  safety and welfare  including the environment and wildlife 
in  the colorado legislature approved legislation changing the composition of the cogcc to reduce industry representation and to add the heads of the cdnr and the cdphe plus other stakeholders 
in addition  the legislation required the cogcc to promulgate rules in consultation with cdphe  to provide cdphe an opportunity to provide comments on public health issues during the cogcc s decision making process and in consultation with the cdow  to establish standards for minimizing adverse impacts to wildlife resources affected by oil and gas operations and to ensure the proper reclamation of wildlife habitat during and following such operations 
these rules become effective april  for the majority of our operations area 
we believe the revised rules will cause additional costs and may cause delay in our operations in colorado 
the rules require consultation with the cdow and cdphe prior to drilling and completion operations in our piceance basin and for the portion of the paradox basin located in colorado 
the requirements for this consultation are open ended and resulting permit restrictions remain subject to appeal by the cdow  cdphe and the surface owner 
the cdow may attempt to prohibit drilling and completion operations for some period corresponding to wildlife s use of the habitat 
cdphe may choose to impose costly conditions of approval and limit the areas that can be developed 
if we were not able to avoid adverse requirements  our piceance basin and  if our paradox basin exploratory activities are successful  the colorado portion of our paradox basin production and production growth would be reduced 
in addition  the costs of these and the other proposed rules could add substantial increases in incremental well costs in our colorado operations 
the rules also would impact the ability and extend the time necessary to obtain drilling permits  which creates substantial uncertainty about our ability to obtain sufficient permits in a timely fashion in order to meet future drilling plans and thus production and capital expenditure targets 
it is also possible that similar rules will be proposed in the other states in which we operate  further impacting our operations 
the regulatory environment continues to become more restrictive  which limits our ability and increases the cost to conduct our operations 
areas in which we operate are subject to federal  state  local and tribal regulations 
all these jurisdictions have imposed additional and more restrictive regulations recently and there are initiatives underway to implement additional regulations and prohibitions on oil and gas activities 

table of contents federal 
at the federal level  the new presidential administration and its appointees to the department of interior and other posts have made public statements that indicate a more restrictive regulatory environment for oil and gas activities is in effect and that additional restrictions can be expected 
secretary of the interior salazar ordered the review of many actions undertaken under the previous administration and directed the blm not to issue oil and gas leases in utah that were auctioned in december and to return the bid money paid for those leases 
as a result  we will not receive leases on prospective leases near our west tavaputs project for which we were the high bidder 
the auction of these leases also was challenged by environmental groups in a court action filed in federal court in washington  dc and a temporary injunction previously was issued barring the issuance of the leases 
this lawsuit also seeks review of federal resource management plans prepared by the blm for areas of utah  including areas in which we operate 
if this challenge is successful  it could impact our ability to operate and the issuance of the eis for our west tavaputs full field development 
based on public statements by environmental groups and their fundraising efforts  we expect additional litigation seeking to halt our and other companies exploration and development activities in the west tavaputs area and throughout the rocky mountain region 
the blm and the us forest service also have withdrawn parcels from planned lease sales in other states near our areas of operations 
legislative proposals of the previous congress to regulate hydraulic fracturing under the clean drinking water act  cause expiration of undeveloped leases  eliminate funding for processing of federal drilling permits  and to eliminate categorical exclusions for oil and gas activities are likely to be reintroduced 
based on the actions of the secretary of interior and other officials  we expect additional restrictions  delays or prohibitions to be implemented 
in addition  the issuance of the record of decision to approve the environmental impact study prepared over the past four years for our west tavaputs full field development has been delayed pending the appointment of new management at the blm and department of interior as part of the transition of the administration of president obama 
state 
we also are experiencing increased attempts to more strictly regulate oil and gas activities at the state level 
recent regulation includes changes in the makeup of the colorado oil and gas conservation commission  or cogcc  and new rules imposed by the cogcc as described above under regulatory  and proposals in the colorado  wyoming and utah legislatures affecting oil and gas activities 
legislation has been introduced in other states that mimics that passed in colorado and several states have proposed severance tax increases local 
counties in colorado and other states regulate oil and gas activities through local land use rules 
garfield county  colorado  where our piceance basin operations are located  has begun requiring special use permits for activities that previously were regulated by the cogcc  adding new requirements and delays over previous operations 
we expect additional attempts to regulate activities related to oil and gas operations by counties and local governments 
tribal 
we have experienced delays in obtaining permits to drill wells on tribal property  including our lake canyon and black tail ridge projects 
the failure to obtain permits has led us to declare a force majeure event in order to protect our rights under our black tail ridge exploration and development agreement 
because of the current staffing of the permitting authority  we believe that delays in obtaining permits will continue for the foreseeable future  which will delay our ability to drill wells in these areas 
potential impacts of regulatory trends 
the increase in regulatory burdens and potential for continued lawsuits seeking to block activities as described above is likely to cause delays to our planned activities and could prevent some of these activities 
this is expected to increase our costs and could result in lower production and reserves as our properties naturally decline without replacement production and reserves from new wells as well as a reduction in the value of our accumulated leases  especially federal leases which make up approximately of our leasehold 
we currently are unable to estimate the magnitude of these potential losses 

table of contents declining commodity prices in the last several months  we have experienced steep declines in natural gas and oil prices 
if this trend continues  or the current relatively low prices persist  it could increase the likelihood of impairments and write downs of properties  reduce our reserves and thus the borrowing base of our amended credit facility and have a significant negative impact on our cash flows used to fund operations and capital expenditures 
critical accounting policies and estimates the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
certain accounting policies involve judgments and uncertainties to such an extent that there is reasonable likelihood that materially different amounts could have been reported under different conditions  or if different assumptions had been used 
we evaluate our estimates and assumptions on a regular basis 
we base our estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates and assumptions used in preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
we provide expanded discussion of our more significant accounting policies  estimates and judgments below 
we believe these accounting policies reflect our more significant estimates and assumptions used in preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of additional accounting policies and estimates made by management 
oil and gas properties our natural gas and oil exploration and production activities are accounted for using the successful efforts method 
under this method  all property acquisition costs and costs of exploratory and development wells are capitalized when incurred  pending determination of whether the property has proved reserves 
if an exploratory well does not find proved reserves  the costs of drilling the well are charged to expense and included within cash flows from investing activities in the consolidated statements of cash flows pursuant to sfas no 
 financial accounting and reporting by oil and gas producing companies 
the costs of development wells are capitalized whether productive or nonproductive 
oil and gas lease acquisition costs are also capitalized 
if it is determined that these properties will not yield proved reserves  the related costs are expensed in the period in which that determination is made 
interest cost is capitalized as a component of property cost for significant exploration and development projects that require greater than six months to be readied for their intended use 
the application of the successful efforts method of accounting requires managerial judgment to determine the proper classification of wells designated as developmental or exploratory  which will ultimately determine the proper accounting treatment of the costs incurred 
in addition to development on exploratory wells  we may drill scientific wells that are only used for data gathering purposes 
the costs associated with these scientific wells are expensed as incurred as geological and geographical expense 
the results from a drilling operation can take considerable time to analyze and the determination that commercial reserves have been discovered requires both judgment and industry experience 

table of contents other exploration costs  including certain geological and geophysical expenses and delay rentals for gas and oil leases  are charged to expense as incurred 
the sale of a partial interest in a proved property is accounted for as a cost recovery and no gain or loss is recognized as long as this treatment does not significantly affect the unit of production amortization rate 
a gain or loss is recognized for all other sales of proved properties and is classified in other operating revenues 
maintenance and repairs are charged to expense  and renewals and betterments are capitalized to the appropriate property and equipment accounts 
unevaluated oil and gas property costs are transferred to proved oil and gas properties if the properties are subsequently determined to be productive 
proceeds from sales of partial interests in unproved leases are accounted for as a recovery of cost without recognizing any gain until all costs are recovered 
unevaluated oil and gas properties are assessed periodically for impairment on a property by property basis based on remaining lease terms  drilling results  reservoir performance  commodity price outlooks or future plans to develop acreage 
during the year ended december   we recognized a non cash impairment charge of million primarily on the carrying value of unevaluated oil and gas properties in the talon field located in the wind river basin 
we review our proved natural gas and oil properties for impairment whenever events and circumstances indicate that a decline in the recoverability of their carrying value may have occurred 
we estimate the expected future cash flows of our gas and oil properties and compare these future cash flows to the carrying amount of the gas and oil properties to determine if the carrying amount is recoverable 
if the carrying amount exceeds the estimated undiscounted future cash flows  we will adjust the carrying amount of the natural gas and oil properties to fair value 
the factors used to determine fair value include  but are not limited to  recent sales prices of comparable properties  the present value of future cash flows  net of estimated operating and development costs using estimates of proved reserves  future commodity pricing  future production estimates  anticipated capital expenditures  and various discount rates commensurate with the risk associated with realizing the expected cash flows projected 
for  our impairment testing required us to take a non cash impairment charge to our proved oil and gas properties in the cooper reservoir field  located in the wind river basin  of million  which was primarily the result of geologic and engineering reevaluations  as well as lower oil and gas prices 
both the talon and cooper reservoir fields are not considered strategic areas for future operations 
in  based upon our fair value analysis  we recognized a million non cash impairment charge associated with our tri state properties within the dj basin 
we sold these properties in the successful efforts method of accounting can have a significant impact on the operational results reported when we are entering a new exploratory area in anticipation of finding a gas and oil field that will be the focus of future development drilling activity 
the initial exploratory wells may be unsuccessful and will be expensed 
seismic costs can be substantial  which will result in additional exploration expenses when incurred 
our investment in natural gas and oil properties includes an estimate of the future costs associated with dismantlement  abandonment and restoration of our properties 
these costs are recorded as provided in sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations 
the present value of the estimated future costs to dismantle  abandon and restore a well location are added to the capitalized costs of our oil and gas properties and recorded as a long term liability 
the capitalized cost is included in the natural gas and oil property costs that are depleted over the life of the assets 
the recognition of an asset retirement obligation  or aro  requires that management make numerous estimates  assumptions and judgments regarding such factors as amounts  future advances in technology  timing of settlements  the credit adjusted risk free rate to be used and inflation rates 
in periods subsequent to initial measurement of the aro  we must recognize period to period changes in the liability resulting from the passage of time  revisions to either the amount of the original estimate 
table of contents of undiscounted cash flows or changes in inflation factors and changes to our credit adjusted risk free rate as market conditions warrant 
any such changes that result in upward or downward revisions in the estimated obligation will result in an adjustment to the related capitalized asset and corresponding liability on a prospective basis and an adjustment in our dd a expense in future periods 
the provision for depletion of oil and gas properties is calculated on a field by field basis using the unit of production method 
oil is converted to natural gas equivalents  mcfe  at the rate of one barrel to six mcf 
our rate of recording dd a is dependent upon our estimates of total proved and proved developed reserves  which incorporate assumptions regarding future development and abandonment costs as well as our level of capital spending 
if the estimates of total proved or proved developed reserves decline  the rate at which we record dd a expense increases  reducing our net income 
this decline may result from lower market prices  which may make it uneconomic to drill for and produce higher cost fields 
we are unable to predict changes in reserve quantity estimates as such quantities are dependent on the success of our exploitation and development program  as well as future economic conditions 
oil and gas reserve quantities our estimate of proved reserves is based on the quantities of oil  natural gas and natural gas liquids which geological and engineering data demonstrate with reasonable certainty to be commercially recoverable in future years from known reservoirs under existing economic and operating conditions 
our proved reserves are reviewed on a well by well basis by an independent engineering firm 
reserves and their relation to estimated future net cash flows impact our depletion and impairment calculations 
as a result  adjustments to depletion and impairment are made concurrently with changes to reserve estimates 
we prepare our reserve estimates  and the projected cash flows derived from these reserve estimates  in accordance with sec guidelines 
the independent engineering firms adhere to the same guidelines when reviewing our reserve reports 
the accuracy of our reserve estimates is a function of many factors including the following the quality and quantity of available data  the interpretation of that data  the accuracy of various mandated economic assumptions and the judgments of the individuals preparing the estimates 
the process of estimating oil and natural gas reserves is very complex  requiring significant decisions in the evaluation of all available geological  geophysical  engineering and economic data 
the data for a given field may also change substantially over time as a result of numerous factors  including additional development activity  evolving production history and continued reassessment of the viability of production under varying economic conditions 
as a result  material revisions to existing reserve estimates may occur from time to time 
although every reasonable effort is made to ensure that the reported reserve estimates represent the most accurate assessments possible  the subjective decisions and variances in available data for various fields make these estimates generally less precise than other estimates included in our financial statements 
as such  reserve estimates may materially vary from the ultimate quantities of oil  natural gas and natural gas liquids eventually recovered 
as of december   we revised our proved reserves upward by bcfe  excluding pricing revisions  primarily as a result of adding increased density in proved undeveloped locations in the piceance and west tavaputs fields and improved production performance by wells located in each of our major producing basins wind river  uinta  powder river and piceance 
the pricing revision at year end at prices of per mmbtu and per barrel of oil  relative to the year end prices of per mmbtu and per barrel of oil  was downward bcfe 
year end prices were adjusted by lease for quality  transportation fees and regional price differences 
as of december   we revised our proved reserves upward by bcfe  excluding pricing revisions  primarily as a result of adding increased density proved undeveloped locations in the west tavaputs field and continued improved performance of wells drilled in the west tavaputs and piceance 
table of contents fields 
we also revised our year end proved reserves upward by bcfe  as year end pricing was per mmbtu and per barrel of oil  relative to year end at prices of per mmbtu of gas and per barrel of oil 
year end prices were adjusted by lease for quality  transportation fees and regional price differences 
as of december   we revised our proved reserves upward by bcfe  excluding pricing revisions 
this revision was primarily the result of increased performance of wells drilled during the last half of and the first half of the pricing revision at year end at prices of per mmbtu of gas and per barrel of oil  relative to year end prices of per mmbtu and per barrel of oil  was downward bcfe 
year end prices were adjusted by lease for quality  transportation fees and regional price differences 
revenue recognition we record revenues from the sales of natural gas and oil when in the month that delivery to the customer has occurred and title has transferred 
this occurs when natural gas or oil has been delivered to a pipeline or a tank lifting has occurred 
we receive payment from one to three months after delivery 
at the end of each month  we estimate the amount of production delivered to purchasers and the price we will receive 
variances between our estimated revenue and actual payment are recorded in the month the payment is received 
historically  any differences have been insignificant 
we may have an interest with other producers in certain properties  in which case we use the sales method to account for natural gas imbalances 
under this method  revenue is recorded on the basis of natural gas actually sold by us 
in addition  we record revenue for our share of natural gas sold by other owners that cannot be volumetrically balanced in the future due to insufficient remaining reserves 
we also reduce revenue for other owners natural gas sold by us that cannot be volumetrically balanced in the future due to insufficient remaining reserves 
our remaining over and under produced gas balancing positions are considered in our proved reserves 
gas imbalances as of december  and were not significant 
derivative instruments and hedging activities we periodically use derivative financial instruments to achieve a more predictable cash flow from our natural gas and oil production by reducing our exposure to price fluctuations 
we also enter into derivative contracts to mitigate the risk of interest rate fluctuations 
for the year ended december   these transactions included swaps  basis only swaps and cashless collars 
we account for these activities pursuant to sfas no 
 as amended 
this statement establishes accounting and reporting standards requiring that derivative instruments including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts be recorded at fair market value and included in the balance sheet as assets or liabilities 
the accounting for changes in the fair value of a derivative instrument depends on the intended use of the derivative and the resulting designation  which is established at the inception of a derivative 
sfas no 
requires a company to formally document  at the inception of a hedge  the hedging relationship and the entity s risk management objective and strategy for undertaking the hedge  including identification of the hedging instrument  the hedged item or transaction  the nature of the risk being hedged  the method that will be used to assess effectiveness and the method that will be used to measure hedge ineffectiveness of derivative instruments that receive hedge accounting treatment 
for derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges  changes in fair value  to the extent the hedge is effective  are recognized in other comprehensive income until the hedged item is recognized in earnings 
hedge effectiveness is assessed at least quarterly based on total changes in the derivative s fair value 
any ineffective portion of the derivative instrument s change in fair value is recognized immediately in earnings 

table of contents we use derivative financial instruments which have not been designated as hedges under sfas no 
because they still protect us from changes in commodity prices 
these instruments are marked to market with the resulting changes in fair value recorded in earnings 
the estimates of the fair values of our derivative instruments require substantial judgment 
these values are based upon  among other things  option pricing models  futures prices  volatility  time to maturity and credit risk 
the values we report in our financial statements change as these estimates are revised to reflect actual results  changes in market conditions or other factors  many of which are beyond our control 
changes in estimates of fair value have only a minimal impact on our liquidity  capital resources or results of operations  as long as the derivative instruments qualify for cash flow hedge accounting treatment 
changes in the fair values of derivatives that do not qualify for cash flow hedge accounting treatment can have an impact on our results of operations  but generally will not impact our liquidity or capital resources 
settlements of derivative instruments  regardless of whether they qualify for hedge accounting  do have an impact on our liquidity and results of operations 
generally  if actual market prices are higher than the price of the derivative instruments  our net earnings and cash flow from operations will be lower relative to the results that would have occurred absent these instruments 
as of december   the fair value of all of our derivative instruments  including basis only swaps and interest rate derivatives  was a net asset of million  comprised of current and noncurrent assets and liabilities 
the deferred income tax effect on the fair value of the cash flow hedge derivatives at december  totaled million  which is recorded in current and noncurrent deferred tax liabilities 
income taxes and uncertain tax positions income taxes are provided for the tax effects of transactions reported in the financial statements and consist of taxes currently payable plus deferred income taxes related to certain income and expenses recognized in different periods for financial and income tax reporting purposes 
deferred income tax assets and liabilities represent the future tax return consequences of those differences  which will either be taxable or deductible when assets are recovered or settled 
deferred income taxes are also recognized for tax credits that are available to offset future income taxes 
deferred income taxes are measured by applying currently enacted tax rates to the differences between financial statement and income tax reporting 
we routinely assess the realizability of our deferred tax assets 
if we conclude that it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized under accounting standards  the tax asset would be reduced by a valuation allowance 
we consider future taxable income in making such assessments 
numerous judgments and assumptions are inherent in the determination of future taxable income  including factors such as future operating conditions particularly as related to prevailing oil and natural gas prices 
there can be no assurance that facts and circumstances will not materially change and require us to establish deferred tax asset valuation allowances in a future period 
stock based compensation we account for stock based compensation in accordance with sfas no 
r  which revised sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  and supersedes apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees 
this statement requires us to record expense associated with the fair value of stock based compensation 
however  for awards granted before we were a public company ie those granted prior to april   which is defined by sfas no 
r as the date we became a public company as a result of filing our form s registration statement with the sec we continue to use the minimum value method described under apb opinion no 
for awards granted after we were a public company ie those granted subsequent to april   and for new  modified  repurchased  
table of contents or cancelled awards on or subsequent to our adoption of sfas no 
r on october   we recognized share based employee compensation cost based on the fair value as computed under sfas no 
r 
we continue to account for certain stock options under the original provisions of apb opinion no 
because those options were issued prior to april  under apb opinion no 
 we recognize compensation expense only to the extent that the exercise price of the options granted exceeds the market value of the underlying common stock on the date of grant 
in applying the provisions of sfas no 
r  judgments and estimates are made regarding  among other things  the appropriate valuation methodology to follow in valuing stock compensation awards and the related inputs required by those valuation methodologies 
assumptions regarding expected volatility of our common stock  the risk free interest rates  expected term of the awards and other valuation inputs are subject to change 
any such changes could result in different valuations and thus impact the amount of stock based compensation expense recognized 
in total  under apb opinion no 
and sfas no 
r  we recorded non cash stock based compensation of million  million  and million in  and  respectively  for option grants  option modifications  nonvested equity shares of common stock and nonvested performance based equity shares of common stock 
acquisitions the establishment of our initial asset base since our founding in january has included material acquisitions of natural gas and oil properties  which have been accounted for using the purchase method of accounting 
under the purchase method  the acquiring company adds to its balance sheet the estimated fair values of the acquired company s assets and liabilities 
any excess of the purchase price over the fair values of the tangible and intangible net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill 
goodwill is assessed for impairment at least annually 
in each of our acquisitions to date we have determined that the purchase price did not exceed the fair value of the net assets acquired 
therefore  no goodwill was recorded 
there are various assumptions we made in determining the fair values of acquired assets and liabilities 
the most significant assumptions  and the ones requiring the most judgment  involve the estimated fair values of the natural gas and oil properties acquired 
to determine the fair values of these properties  we prepare estimates of natural gas and oil reserves 
these estimates are based on work performed by our engineers and that of outside consultants 
the fair value of reserves acquired in an acquisition must be based on our estimates of future natural gas and oil prices and not the prices at the time of the acquisition 
our estimates of future prices are based on our own analysis of pricing trends 
these estimates are based on current data obtained with regard to regional and worldwide supply and demand dynamics such as economic growth forecasts 
they also are based on industry data regarding natural gas storage availability  drilling rig activity  changes in delivery capacity  trends in regional pricing differentials and other fundamental analysis 
forecasts of future prices from independent third parties are noted when we make our pricing estimates 
we estimate future prices to apply to the estimated reserve quantities acquired  and estimate future operating and development costs  to arrive at estimates of future net revenues 
for estimated proved reserves  the future net revenues are then discounted using a rate determined appropriate at the time of the acquisition based upon our cost of capital 
we also apply these same general principles in arriving at the fair value of unevaluated properties acquired in an acquisition 
these unevaluated properties generally represent the value of probable and possible reserves 
because of their very nature  probable and possible reserve estimates are more 
table of contents imprecise than those of proved reserves 
to compensate for the inherent risk of estimating and valuing probable and possible reserves  we apply a risk weighting factor to probable and possible volumes to reduce the estimated reserve volumes 
additionally  we increase the discount factor  compared to proved reserves  to recognize the additional uncertainties related to determining the value of probable and possible reserves 
new accounting pronouncements in september  the fasb issued sfas no 
 fair value measurements 
sfas no

 which delayed the effective date of sfas no 
for all nonrecurring fair value measurements of nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities until fiscal years beginning after november  with partial adoption  we applied sfas no 
to recurring fair value measurements of financial and non financial instruments  which affected the fair value disclosures of our financial derivatives within the scope of sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
see footnote for fair value disclosures 
as of january   we fully adopted sfas no

 the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities  which permits entities to choose to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value 
this statement expands the use of fair value measurement and applies to entities that elect the fair value option 
we adopted this statement as of january   however  we did not elect the fair value option for any eligible financial instruments or other items 
therefore  the adoption of this statement did not impact our financial statements 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
revised  business combinations sfas no 
r  which replaces fasb statement no 
 business combinations 
this statement requires an acquirer to recognize the assets acquired  the liabilities assumed and any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree at the acquisition date  measured at their fair values as of that date  with limited exceptions specified in the statement 
this includes the measurement of the acquirer shares issued in consideration for a business combination  the recognition of contingent consideration  the accounting for pre acquisition gain and loss contingencies  the recognition of capitalized in process research and development  the accounting for acquisition related restructuring cost accruals  the treatment of acquisition related transaction costs and the recognition of changes in the acquirer s income tax valuation allowance and deferred taxes 
this statement applies prospectively and was effective for us beginning january  sfas no 
r will only impact us if and when we become party to a business combination 
in march  the fasb issued sfas no 
 disclosures about derivative instruments and hedging activities 
this statement is intended to improve financial reporting about derivative instruments and hedging activities by requiring companies to enhance disclosure about how these instruments and activities affect their financial position  performance and cash flows 
sfas no 
seeks to achieve these improvements by requiring disclosure of the fair values of derivative instruments and their gains and losses in a tabular format 
it also seeks to improve the transparency of the location and amounts of derivative instruments in a company s financial statements and how they are accounted

 the hierarchy of generally accepted accounting principles 
this statement is intended to improve financial reporting by identifying a consistent framework  or hierarchy  for selecting accounting principles to be used in preparing financial statements that are presented in conformity with gaap for nongovernmental entities 
prior to the issuance of sfas no 
 gaap hierarchy was defined in the american institute of certified public accountants aicpa statement on auditing standards sas no 
 the meaning of present fairly in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles 
sfas no 
was effective november  and did not have a material impact on our financial statements 
in may  the fasb adopted fsp apb  accounting for convertible debt instruments that may be settled in cash upon conversion including partial cash settlement 
fsp apb states that the accounting treatment for certain convertible debt instruments that may be settled in cash  shares of common stock or any portion thereof at the election of the issuing company be accounted for utilizing a bifurcation model under which the value of the debt instrument would be determined without regard to the conversion feature 
the difference between the issuance amount of the debt instrument and the value determined pursuant to fsp apb will be recorded as an equity contribution 
the resulting debt discount would be amortized over the period the convertible debt is expected to be outstanding as additional non cash interest expense 
fsp apb is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after december  we adopted fsp apb effective january  as early adoption was not permitted 
fsp apb must be applied retrospectively to all periods presented for any instrument within the scope of fsp apb that was outstanding during any of the periods presented 
fsp apb changes the accounting treatment for our convertible notes which were issued in march at adoption  fsp apb will retrospectively reduce the company s long term debt and increase the company s stockholders equity by approximately million and increase the company s non cash interest expense by approximately million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively

as it relates to the valuation of financial assets in a market that is not active for those financial assets 
this fsp is effective immediately and includes those periods for which financial statements have not been issued 
we currently do not have any financial assets that are valued using inactive markets  and as a result  we were not impacted by the issuance of fsp no 
fas on december   the sec published the final rules and interpretations updating its oil and gas reserves reporting requirements 
many of the revisions are updates to definitions in the existing oil and gas rules to make them consistent with the petroleum resource management system  which is a widely accepted set of evaluation guidelines that are designed to support assessment processes throughout the resource asset lifecycle 
these guidelines were prepared by the society of petroleum engineers  or spe  oil and gas reserves committee with cooperation from many industry organizations 
one of the key changes to the previous sec rules relates to using a month average commodity price to calculate the value of proved reserves versus the current method of using year end prices 
other key revisions include the ability to include nontraditional resources in reserves  the use of new technology for determining reserves  the opportunity to establish proved undeveloped reserves without the requirement of an adjacent producing well and permitting disclosure of probable and possible reserves 
the sec will require companies to comply with the amended disclosure requirements for registration statements filed after january   and for annual reports for fiscal years ending on or after december  early adoption is not permitted 
the company is currently assessing the impact that the adoption will have on the company s disclosures and financial statements 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk the primary objective of the following information is to provide forward looking quantitative and qualitative information about our potential exposure to market risks 
the term market risk refers to the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in natural gas and oil prices and interest rates 
the disclosures are not meant to be precise indicators of expected future losses  but rather indicators of reasonably possible losses 
this forward looking information provides indicators of how we view and manage our ongoing market risk exposures 
all of our market risk sensitive instruments were entered into for purposes other than speculative trading 
commodity price risk our primary market risk exposure is in the price we received for our natural gas and oil production 
realized pricing is primarily driven by the prevailing worldwide price for crude oil and spot regional market prices applicable to our us natural gas production 
pricing for natural gas and oil production has been volatile and unpredictable for several years  and we expect this volatility to continue in the future 
the prices we receive for production depend on many factors outside of our control  including volatility in the differences between product prices at sales points and the applicable index price 
based on our average daily production and our price swap and collar contracts in place during  our annual income before income taxes for the year ended december  would have decreased by approximately million for each decrease per mmbtu in natural gas prices and approximately million for each per barrel decrease in crude oil prices 
we routinely enter into and anticipate entering into financial hedging activities with respect to a portion of our projected natural gas and oil production through various financial transactions which hedge future prices received 
these transactions may include financial price swaps whereby we will receive a fixed price for our production and pay a variable market price to the contract counterparty and cashless price collars that set a floor and ceiling price for the hedged production 
if the applicable monthly price indices are outside of the ranges set by the floor and ceiling prices in the various collars  we and the counterparty to the collars would be required to settle the difference 
these financial hedging activities are intended to support natural gas and oil prices at targeted levels and to manage our exposure to natural gas and oil price fluctuations 
in addition to the swaps and collars discussed above  we also entered into basis only swaps 
with a basis only swap  we have hedged the difference between the nymex price and the price received for our natural gas production at the specific delivery location to protect against the risk of large differences between nymex henry hub and our primary sales point  cig 
large basis differentials have occurred recently due to pipeline infrastructure issues 
in addition to financial transactions  we are a party to various physical commodity contracts for the sale of natural gas that cover varying periods of time and have varying pricing provisions 
under sfas no 
 these physical commodity contracts qualify for the normal purchases and normal sales exception and  therefore  are not subject to hedge accounting or mark to market accounting 
the financial impact of physical commodity contracts is included in oil and gas revenues at the time of settlement  which in turn affects average realized natural gas prices 
for the calendar year  we currently have financial hedges in place for  mmbtu of natural gas production and  bbls of oil production 
as of january   we have hedges in place for  mmbtu of natural gas production and  bbls of oil production for and  mmbtu of natural gas production for in addition  we have basis only swaps in place for  mmbtu of natural gas for   mmbtu of natural gas for   mmbtu of natural gas for and  mmbtu of natural gas for these hedges are summarized in the table presented under item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations capital resources and liquidity cash flow from operating activities 

table of contents commodity hedges through a price swap  we have fixed the price we will receive on a portion of our natural gas and oil production 
in a swap transaction  the counterparty is required to make a payment to us for the difference between the fixed price and the settlement price if the settlement price is below the fixed price 
we are required to make a payment to the counterparty for the difference between the fixed price and the settlement price if the fixed price is below the settlement price 
through a basis only swap  we have fixed the price differential on our natural gas production between nymex and a specific delivery location 
in a basis only swap  the counterparty is required to make a payment to us if the price differential is greater than the fixed price 
we are required to make a payment to the counterparty if the price differential is less than the fixed price 
we intend to enter into hedge transactions based on a nymex price in the future with a volume equal to the volume for our basis only swaps  thereby effectively fixing a price for cigrm 
through cashless collars  we have fixed the minimum and maximum price we will receive on a portion of our natural gas and oil production 
in a cashless collar transaction  the counterparty is required to make a payment to us for the difference between the fixed floor price and the settlement price if the settlement price is below the fixed floor price 
we are required to make a payment to the counterparty for the difference between the fixed ceiling price and the settlement price if the fixed ceiling price is below the settlement price 
neither party is required to make a payment if the settlement price falls between the fixed floor and ceiling prices 
these hedges are summarized in the table presented under item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations capital resources and liquidity cash flow from operating activities 
interest rate risks at december   we had debt outstanding under our amended credit facility of million  which bears interest at floating rates in accordance with our amended credit facility 
the average annual interest rate incurred on this debt for the years ended december  and was and  respectively 
a increase in each of the average libor rate and federal funds rate for the year ended december  would have resulted in an estimated million increase in interest expense for the year ended december  we also had million principal amount of convertible notes outstanding at december   which have a fixed cash interest rate of per annum 
interest rate hedges through interest rate derivative contracts  we have attempted to mitigate exposure to changes in interest rates 
we entered into an interest rate swap for a notional amount of million for a fixed libor rate of through december we also entered into an interest rate collar for a notional amount of million in which the interest rate has fixed minimum and maximum libor rates of and  respectively  through december
