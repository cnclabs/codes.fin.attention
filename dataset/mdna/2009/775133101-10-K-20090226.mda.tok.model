item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read together with the selected financial data and our consolidated financial statements and the related notes that appear elsewhere in this form k 
business overview we are a global enterprise that provides our customers with innovative solutions and industry leading products in a variety of markets  including portable communications  communications infrastructure  consumer products  consumer electronics  semiconductors  mass transit  automotive  ground transportation  aerospace  defense and alternative energy 
we generate revenues and cash flows through the development  manufacture  and distribution of specialty material based products that are sold to multiple customers  primarily fabricators and contract manufacturers that  in turn  produce component products that are sold to original equipment manufacturers oem s for use in various applications 
as such  our business is highly dependent  although indirectly  on market demand for these oem s products 
our ability to forecast future sales and earnings results is largely dependent on management s ability to anticipate changing market conditions and how our customers will react to these changing conditions 
it is also highly limited due to the short lead times demanded by our customers and the dynamics of serving as a relatively small supplier in the overall supply chain for these end user products 
in addition  our sales represent a number of different products across a wide range of price points and distribution channels that do not always allow for meaningful quantitative analysis of changes in demand or price per unit with respect to the effect on forecasting 
our current focus is on worldwide markets that have an increasing percentage of materials being used to support growing high technology applications  such as cellular base stations and antennas  handheld wireless devices  satellite television receivers and automotive electronics 
we continue to focus on business opportunities around the globe and particularly in the asian marketplace  as evidenced by the continued investment in and expansion of our manufacturing facilities in suzhou  china  which functions as our manufacturing base to serve our customers in asia 
our goal is to become the supplier of choice for our customers in all of the various markets in which we participate 
to achieve this goal  we strive to make the best products in these respective markets and to deliver the highest level of service to our customers 
during  we began to feel the impact of the global recession on our business  as sales volumes declined significantly at the end of the fourth quarter 
in recessionary times such as these  our diversification and position in the overall supply chain typically help to mitigate the initial impact of a recession on us  as we typically see orders decline later than many other companies 
historically  this has also helped us to rebound from a recession earlier than other companies  as we provide materials and component products to our customers who in turn sell to an end user  although past history is not an indication of the current marketplace and what will occur in the future 
we believe that will be a challenging year as the uncertainty of the global recession will continue 
however  we do believe that we are well positioned to sustain our business through difficult times  as we have a strong balance sheet with no debt  strong cash flows  and a focus on working capital management 
overall in  sales declined from million to million 
the most significant declines were experienced in our custom electrical components reportable segment  where sales declined by approximately million  or  due primarily to the decline in electroluminescent el lamp sales as many applications in the portable communications market are reaching end of life  and our printed circuit materials reportable segment  where sales declined by million  or  due primarily to the decline in the flexible circuits market 
these declines were partially offset by growth in our high performance foams business  which experienced an increase in sales of approximately  or million in as compared to in  we continued our efforts to review our current product portfolio in order to streamline our business  which we believe will enable us to focus on the key strategic businesses that we believe will ultimately drive growth for the company 
as part of these efforts  we sold our induflex business  which was reported in our other polymer products reportable segment  in the fourth quarter of for approximately million  resulting in a net gain on the sale of approximately million 
this operating segment is classified as a discontinued operation in the consolidated financial statements 
over the past several years  we have worked to better align our business with our customers  which includes having manufacturing capacity close to our customers in order to be responsive to their needs 
we continue to invest in our operations in china  as many of our products  including el lamps  power distribution system products  elastomer components and floats  are currently being manufactured at our suzhou  china facility 
we continue to focus on this strategic facility  particularly as demand for our products increases in the asian marketplace 
in  we added additional capacity for our polyurethane foam products at our suzhou facility through our rogers inoac suzhou corporation ris joint venture to better meet the demand for our high end foam products in the asian marketplace 
in  we will continue to focus on positioning ourselves to take advantage of the potential opportunities that could arise if and when the global economy begins to shift in a positive direction 
we will focus on maintaining our strong balance sheet position  while continuing to manage our working capital requirements 
we will also focus on the future by continuing our efforts in new product development  as well as pursuing potential acquisitions that align with our strategic direction 
finally  we will make efforts to control our costs and operate as efficiently as possible to help mitigate the volume reductions we are currently experiencing 
we believe that all of these measures will help position ourselves to maintain our business through this economic downturn  as well as enable us to take advantage of opportunities when the economy begins to experience positive momentum 
results of continuing operations the following table sets forth  for the last three fiscal years  selected company operating data expressed as a percentage of net sales 
net sales gross margins selling and administrative expenses research and development expenses restructuring and impairment charges operating income equity income in unconsolidated joint ventures other income  net interest income  net income from continuing operations before income taxes income tax expense income from continuing operations vs 
net sales net sales in were million  a decrease of from million of sales in the decrease in sales is primarily due to a decrease in the custom electrical components reportable segment from million in to million in and in the printed circuit materials reportable segment of million  or  from million to million  partially offset by an increase in sales in our high performance foams reportable segment of million  or  from million to million 
the factors resulting in these changes in sales are discussed in greater detail in the segment sales and operations section below 
manufacturing margins manufacturing margins increased approximately basis points to in from in margins increased at our three strategic segments high performance foams  printed circuit materials and custom electrical components due in part to our focus on cost containment measures as well as gaining operational efficiencies in anticipation of the volume declines that occurred at the end of also  in  we recognized certain charges relating to our restructuring activities that included recognizing reserves on certain inventories at our durel and flexible circuit materials operating segments that negatively impacted our margins in a portion of this inventory reserved in was sold in which positively impacted our margins in by approximately basis points 
selling and administrative expenses selling and administrative expenses were million in  an increase of million from million in the results included approximately million in charges related to the settlement of and legal fees for our lawsuit with calamp see footnote to the consolidated financial statements in item of this form k for further discussion  as well as incentive compensation expense of approximately million 
these charges were partially offset by the cost containment initiatives and operating efficiency measures that were implemented this year 
the expense included approximately million of charges related to restructuring activities that were initiated in the second quarter of related to our durel and flexible circuit materials operating segments 
overall selling and administrative expenses increased as a percentage of sales from in to in research and development expenses research and development expenses decreased from million in to million in as a percentage of sales  expenses remained consistent at in both and our strategic plan is to invest an average of of net sales annually into research and development and it is expected that future expenditures will be consistent with this targeted investment level 
we continue to invest in research and development to improve our existing technologies and find new applications for these materials  as well as to explore new  emerging technologies  as well as existing technologies  that we believe will complement our existing product portfolio 
restructuring and impairment charges restructuring and impairment charges were million in  while there were no such charges in the charges in related primarily to our durel and flexible circuit materials operating segments 
the charges consisted of i accelerated depreciation and amortization on fixed assets and contracts million  ii an increase in inventory reserves million  iii severance costs related to a company wide headcount reduction million  and iv the impairment of goodwill related to our composite materials operating segment million 
for income statement presentation purposes  approximately million of these charges are included in cost of sales  million are included in selling and administrative expenses and million are included in restructuring and impairment charges 
further discussion of these amounts is as follows durel in  we recorded a non cash pre tax charge of million related to our durel operating segment  which is aggregated into our custom electrical components reportable segment 
this charge included a million restructuring charge related to the write down of inventory and accelerated depreciation on machinery and equipment related to the durel business and a million charge related to the accelerated expense recognition of a prepaid license associated with a certain flexible electroluminescent el lamp product 
these charges were partially offset by the sale of approximately million of inventory previously reserved for in the second quarter of these charges resulted from a significant change in the current outlook for existing and future el lamp programs during the second quarter of based on information related to certain program terminations from our most significant customer of el lamps in the portable communications market 
as a result of this change in business conditions  all remaining production of el lamps for the portable communications market that was located at durel s manufacturing facility in arizona was shifted to china by the end of the second quarter of as of year end  substantially all el production  including lamps for the automotive industry  shifted to our china facility 
the significant change in the outlook of el programs and the planned shift in el production to china was an indicator of impairment that triggered an impairment analysis on the long lived assets of the durel business in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets sfas 
the impairment analysis  which was completed as part of the second quarter of closing process with the assistance of an independent third party appraisal firm  led us to conclude that no impairment charge associated with the durel long lived assets was necessary 
as such  in accordance with sfas  we determined that it was appropriate to reduce the estimated useful lives of el lamp related equipment in durel s us manufacturing facility 
in addition  the reduced forecast of el lamp sales  specifically related to flexible el lamps for the portable communications market  caused us to accelerate the expense recognition of a prepaid license associated with flexible el lamps based on the current forecasted revenues 
we incurred charges of approximately million in related to these restructuring activities and sold approximately million of previously reserved inventory 
flexible circuit materials in  we recorded a non cash pre tax charge of million related to our flexible circuit materials operating segment  which was aggregated into our printed circuit materials reportable segment 
this charge related to the write down of inventory and accelerated depreciation on machinery and equipment related to the flexible circuit materials business and was partially offset by the sale of approximately million of inventory previously reserved for in the second quarter of flexible circuit materials  which are used in a variety of consumer electronic products  have become a commodity product with increased global competition and pricing pressure driven by excess capacity 
this commoditization has caused the operating results of the flexible circuit materials business to significantly decline in recent periods  which resulted in our revaluation of the strategic future viability of this business 
we determined that these market factors were an indicator of impairment that triggered an analysis of the long lived assets related to the flexible circuit materials business in accordance with sfas the impairment analysis  which was completed as part of the second quarter of closing process with the assistance of an independent third party appraisal firm  concluded that no impairment charge associated with the flexible circuit materials long lived assets was necessary 
as such  in accordance with sfas  we determined that it was appropriate to reduce the estimated useful lives of the equipment related to the flexible circuit materials operating segment 
we also determined  based on business conditions at that time that certain inventories associated with this business would not be saleable  and we reserved for these inventories accordingly 
we incurred minimal charges in related to these restructuring activities and sold approximately million of previously reserved inventory 
composite materials in  we recorded a non cash pre tax charge of million related to the impairment of the goodwill associated with the composite materials operating segment  which is aggregated into our other polymer products reportable segment 
the operating results of the composite materials business have gradually declined over the past few years 
during the second quarter of  a government program  which was material to the sales and earnings of the composite materials business  expired 
we determined that the loss of this program  which we had previously thought would be replaced with new business  was an indicator of impairment due to the significance of the program on the long term revenues of this business 
consequently  we performed an impairment analysis on the composite materials operating segment under sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas 
the impairment analysis  which was completed as part of the second quarter closing process with the assistance of an independent third party appraisal firm  resulted in us recording an impairment charge of million related to the goodwill associated with this business 
the analysis did not result in the impairment of any of the business other long lived assets 
no additional charges related to the impairment of the goodwill associated with the composite materials operating segment were recorded during the remainder of severance in  as part of the restructuring activities previously discussed  we took a number of actions to reduce costs  including a company wide headcount reduction 
in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities  and sfas no 
 employers accounting for postemployment benefits  we recorded million of severance charges in in addition  we made severance payments of million in and the remaining million was paid in equity income in unconsolidated joint ventures equity income in unconsolidated joint ventures decreased million from million in to million in joint venture sales were down across all businesses  which were primarily related to customers managing inventories caused by the softening in consumer demand 
most impacted were our polyurethane foam joint ventures with inoac corporation in japan and china  which experienced weakened demand  particularly in the gaming console and cell phone markets 
other income other income increased from million in to million in the increase is due in part to our foreign currency hedging program that was implemented in  which contributed approximately million in favorable foreign currency adjustments in  as well as an increase in commission income related to our pls joint venture million and the inclusion of certain one time charges associated with adjusting our legal entity structure in china that negatively impacted results  as well as certain other one time charges  that did not occur in income taxes our effective tax rate was in and in in and  our tax rate was favorably impacted by the tax benefit associated with certain discrete rate items recorded during the year and continued to benefit from favorable tax rates on certain foreign business activity and general business tax credits 
it is our policy  in accordance with apb  that no us taxes are provided on undistributed earnings of certain wholly owned foreign subsidiaries because substantially all such earnings are expected to be reinvested indefinitely 
we provide deferred taxes for the undistributed earnings of our japanese high performance foams joint venture as well as our taiwanese flexible circuit materials joint venture 
we are eligible for a tax holiday on the earnings of our subsidiaries in china 
under the business license agreement granted to rogers technologies suzhou company rsz  a wholly owned subsidiary of ours  the first two years of cumulatively profitable operations were taxed at a zero percent tax rate followed by a reduced tax rate in subsequent years 
in  the fourth year under this agreement  rsz reported pretax income of million  which was subject to a tax rate of  resulting in a decrease of percentage points in our effective tax rate 
in  the tax rate in effect will be and will increase each subsequent year until reaching the full rate of in  subject to local government approval 
under the business license agreement granted to rogers shanghai international trading company ltd 
rsh  we were subject to a rate of tax of in  which resulted in a decrease of percentage points in our effective tax rate based upon their pretax income of million 
in  the tax rate in effect will be  and will increase each subsequent year until reaching the full rate of in  subject to local government approval 
backlog our backlog of firm orders was million at december   as compared to million at december  the decrease at the end of was primarily related to the decrease in sales in the custom electrical components reportable segment  as backlog for electroluminescent lamps and inverters  primarily sold to manufacturers of portable communications equipment and automobiles  decreased by approximately million at year end as compared to year end vs 
net sales net sales in were million  a decrease of from million of sales in the decrease in sales is primarily due to a decrease in the custom electrical components reportable segment from million in to million in and in the printed circuit materials reportable segment of million  or  from million to million  partially offset by an increase in sales in our high performance foams reportable segment of million  or  from million to million 
the factors resulting in these changes in sales are discussed in greater detail in the segment sales and operations section below 
manufacturing margins manufacturing margins decreased approximately basis points to in from in margins decreased for all segments but primarily in the custom electrical components reportable segment  where lower volumes and increased pricing pressures eroded margins 
also  we encountered increased material costs across several of our businesses  as well as decreased operating leverage  particularly in our flexible materials business  which further impacted margins 
selling and administrative expenses selling and administrative expenses were million in  an increase of million from million in the results included million in costs associated with the acceleration of certain contract expenses and the accelerated depreciation of certain assets related to the second and third quarter restructuring activities 
the results also included additional costs related to professional services fees  contract expenses and stock compensation expense  partially offset by a decline in incentive compensation expense in as compared to overall selling and administrative expenses increased as a percentage of sales from in to in research and development expenses research and development expenses had a minimal increase from million in to million in as a percentage of sales  expenses increased slightly in to as compared to in our strategic plan is to invest an average of of net sales annually into research and development and it is expected that future expenditures will be consistent with this targeted investment level 
we continue to invest in research and development to improve our existing technologies and find new applications for these materials  as well as to explore new  emerging technologies that we believe will complement our existing product portfolio 
restructuring and impairment charges restructuring and impairment charges in were million as compared to million in the charges in related primarily to our durel and flexible circuit materials businesses 
the charges consisted of i accelerated depreciation and amortization on fixed assets and contracts million  ii increase in inventory reserves million  iii severance costs related to a company wide headcount reduction million  and iv the impairment of goodwill related to our composite materials operating segment million 
for income statement presentation purposes  approximately million of these charges are included in cost of sales  million are included in selling and administrative expenses and million are included in restructuring and impairment charges 
the charge in of million is related to the impairment of goodwill associated with our polyester based industrial laminates business and is included in restructuring and impairment charges in our statements of income 
further discussion of these amounts is as follows durel in  we recorded a non cash pre tax charge of million related to our durel operating segment  which is aggregated into our custom electrical components reportable segment

 employers accounting for postemployment benefits  we recorded million of severance charges in in addition  we made severance payments of million in equity income in unconsolidated joint ventures equity income in unconsolidated joint ventures decreased million from million in to million in this was primarily driven by a decline in our flexible circuit materials joint venture in taiwan  rcct  which is consistent with the results of our wholly owned flexible circuit materials business 
this decline was partially offset by the strong performance of our high performance foams joint ventures in japan and china 
other income other income decreased from million in to million in this decrease is primarily related to reduced royalty income as certain royalty agreements expired at the end of and certain one time costs associated with adjusting our legal entity structure in china 
income taxes our effective tax rate was in and in in  our tax rate was favorably impacted by the tax benefit associated with the restructuring  impairment and other one time charges as well as certain other discrete rate items recorded during the year

we are eligible for a tax holiday on the earnings of our subsidiaries in china 
under the business license agreement granted to rogers technologies suzhou company rsz  a wholly owned subsidiary  the first two years of cumulatively profitable operations were taxed at a zero percent tax rate 
in  the third year under this agreement  rsz reported pretax income of million  which was subject to a tax rate of  resulting in a decrease in our effective tax rate of percentage points 
under the business license agreement granted to rogers shanghai international trading company ltd 
rsh  we were subject to a rate of tax of in  which resulted in a decrease in our effective tax rate of based upon their pretax income of million 
backlog our backlog of firm orders was million at december   as compared to million at december  the increase at the end of was primarily related to the increase in sales in the custom electrical components reportable segment  as backlog for power distribution components  primarily sold in the ground transportation market  increased by approximately million at year end as compared to year end segment sales and operations printed circuit materials dollars in millions net sales operating income loss our printed circuit materials pcm reportable segment is comprised of high frequency circuit material products 
net sales in this segment decreased by in as compared to and by in as compared to the decline in sales and operating profits were primarily driven by reduced sales volumes of flexible circuit material products 
over time  the flexible circuit materials market has become more commoditized as global competition has increased 
this has resulted in pricing pressures partially driven by excess capacity  which has caused our sales volumes and margins to decline 
also contributing to the sales decline in were reduced sales of high frequency products into the satellite television market due in part to the decline in the housing market  partially offset by strong sales into the defense market 
in  sales declines in the flexible circuit material products were partially offset by an increase in sales of high frequency material products into the satellite television market due to the addition of new high definition service  as well as increased penetration into digital applications 
operating results include one time charges of approximately million for settlement costs and legal fees related to the calamp litigation 
results included one time charges of approximately million of net restructuring charges related to accelerated depreciation on certain equipment used to manufacture flexible circuit materials in the us  an increase in inventory reserves  and severance costs 
for further discussion of these charges  see restructuring and impairment charges section in item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in this form k 
high performance foams dollars in millions net sales operating income our high performance foams hpf reportable segment is comprised of poron urethane and bisco silicone foam products 
net sales in this segment have increased steadily over the last three years as sales increased by approximately in as compared to and by in as compared to operating profits have remained relatively consistent  although declining as a percentage of sales of the same time period due to an unfavorable sales mix and decreased operating leverage due to declines in production levels of certain higher margin products 
this segment continues to perform well with consistent growth driven by strong demand in the portable communications and transportation markets 
in  we added a second urethane foam manufacturing line in our suzhou  china campus under the management of our ris joint venture in order to better meet customer demand in the asian marketplace 
however  at the end of  sales across all markets declined as the global economic crisis and associated decline in consumer spending began to impact the business 
we believe that significant inventory build up existed in the portable communications market at the end of  particularly in asia  and we anticipate that this will negatively impact sales into this segment until inventories return to more normalized levels 
we continue to focus on new product development  which we believe will help drive sales in this segment once the economy  consumer spending and inventory levels regain positive momentum 
custom electrical components dollars in millions net sales operating income loss our custom electrical components cec reportable segment is comprised of electroluminescent lamps  inverters  and power distribution systems products 
net sales in this segment have decreased significantly since as the segment experienced a decline of approximately in as compared to and approximately in as compared to  while operating results declined substantially from a profit of million in to a loss of million in and a loss of million in the consistent decline in sales is directly attributable to the reduction in demand for el backlighting in the portable communications market 
in  as a result of this decline  we recorded a net restructuring charge of million  which were comprised of increased inventory reserves  accelerated depreciation related to idle equipment in the us  accelerated expense recognition of a prepaid license associated with certain el lamp product sales  and severance costs 
for further discussion of these charges  see restructuring and impairment charges section in item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in this form k 
we believe that the demand for el lamps will continue to lessen in the portable communications market and we are currently exploring other potential opportunities for this technology in advertising  as well as in the automotive and consumer electronics markets  among others 
the power distribution systems operating segment continues to perform well due to strong demand in the mass transit market as infrastructure build continues across the world  especially in china  as well as increased penetration in wind power applications 
other polymer products dollars in millions net sales operating income loss our other polymer products opp reportable segment consists of the following products elastomer rollers  floats  non woven materials  thermal management products  and polyester based industrial laminates 
net sales increased in as compared to  primarily due to the inclusion of a new operating segment in this reportable segment 
in  as previously disclosed  we restructured our flexible circuit materials operating segment and outsourced the majority of the manufacturing of these products to our joint venture  rcct 
as part of this restructuring  we agreed to distribute the products now produced by rcct  the related sales for which are included in this segment 
also as previously disclosed  we sold our induflex operating segment  which was previously reported in this reportable segment but is now reported as a discontinued operation for financial reporting purposes 
sales remained relatively consistent from to in this segment 
the segment s operating results declined in as compared to and from as compared to the decline in is primarily driven to start up costs associated with our new thermal management systems operating segment  as well as losses associated with the new flexible circuit materials distribution segment mentioned above 
in  this segment s results included approximately million in restructuring charges related to the impairment of goodwill related to our composite materials business 
for further discussion of these charges  see the restructuring and impairment charges section in item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in this form k 
also in  we formally divested our polyolefin foam operation  which is now classified as a discontinued operation for financial reporting purposes and is not included in the results presented here 
we continuously evaluate the viability of the product portfolio in this segment as it relates to our long term strategic and operational focus  as evidenced by the disposition of our induflex operating segment in joint ventures rogers inoac corporation ric ric  our joint venture with japan based inoac corporation  was established over years ago and manufactures high performance poron urethane foam materials in japan 
sales increased from to and from to the increase experienced in and early in was primarily driven by new lcd gasket design wins in portable communications and electronic games for the domestic japanese market 
however  sales volumes declined at the end of due to softening demand  particularly in gaming consoles 
rogers inoac suzhou corporation ris ris  our joint venture agreement with inoac corporation for the purpose of manufacturing poron urethane foam materials in china  began operations in sales decreased from to and increased from to the decline in sales for is a result of the softening market during the fourth quarter of rogers chang chun technology co  ltd 
rcct rcct  our joint venture with chang chun plastics co  ltd  was established in late to manufacture flexible circuit materials for customers in taiwan 
sales decreased from to and from to the decreases experienced in and were primarily driven by the overall global decline in the flexible circuit materials market 
polyimide laminate systems  llc pls pls  our joint venture with mitsui chemicals  inc  sells adhesiveless laminates for trace suspension assemblies 
sales increased by in as compared to and decreased by in as compared to the increase in was due to strong demand in the first half of the year in the personal computer market  however demand declined significantly by the end of the decrease in was due to end of life and product cycle phase outs of maturing first generation programs and a slight delay in volume production increases of second generation programs 
discontinued operations on october   we closed on an agreement to sell the shares of our induflex subsidiary to bv capital partners 
under the terms of the agreement  rogers received approximately million euros us million at the october  spot price  which represents the purchase price of approximately million euros plus other amounts due under the agreement 
in addition to this purchase price  there is an opportunity for rogers to receive additional earnout amounts over the next three years based on the future performance of the divested business 
this subsidiary had been aggregated in our other polymer products reportable segment 
net income of million  million and operating loss of million  have been reflected as discontinued operations in the accompanying consolidated statements of income for the years ended december   december  and december   respectively 
the net gain reflected as discontinued operations at december  includes a million gain related to the sale of induflex 
net sales associated with the discontinued operations were million  million and million for the years ended december   december  and december   respectively 
the tax related to the discontinued operations was million  million and million of tax expense for december   december  and december   respectively 
on july   we completed the closure of the operations of the polyolefin foams operating segment  which had been aggregated in our other polymer products reportable segment 
for the fiscal years ended  and  million of net income  million and million of net loss  respectively  have been reflected as discontinued operations in the accompanying consolidated statements of income 
net sales associated with the discontinued operations were million  million and million for  and  respectively 
in the third quarter of  we ceased operations of the polyolefin foams operating segment and there were no net sales associated with the discontinued operations for the second half of see note discontinued operations for further discussion 
product and market development our research and development team is dedicated to growing our businesses by developing cost effective solutions that enable or improve the performance of customers products 
research and development as a percentage of sales was approximately in as compared to in and in our strategic plan is to invest an average of of net sales annually into research and development and it is expected that future expenditures will be consistent with this targeted investment level 
we continue to invest in research and development to expand product offerings based on existing platforms  improving existing products and developing new platforms 
we introduced a variety of new products during for our high performance foams business  we introduced a new thin and highly compressible dust seal material for displays that incorporates adhesive for ease of assembly  a new foam product that meets requirements for more environmentally friendly products in the footwear industry  a new cost effective  high performance backer cushion for corrugated box printing and a new silicone foam product for rail car subfloors that meets new flame  smoke and toxicity requirements 
for our custom electrical components business  we introduced a new multisegment driver for electroluminescent lamps  electroluminescent lamps for out of home advertising and a packaged led driver with dimming capability 
we also introduced new power distribution assemblies with increased thermal performance for mass transit applications 
for our printed circuit materials business  we introduced new products with lower dielectric constant and lower thermal expansion for improved electrical performance and higher reliability in avionic applications and new thin high dielectric constant substrates for ic packaging applications 
we also introduced a new thermally and electrically conductive adhesive for high frequency printed circuit board assemblies 
liquidity  capital resources  and financial position we believe that our ability to generate cash from operations to reinvest in the business is one of our fundamental strengths  as demonstrated by our financial position remaining strong throughout we have remained debt free since and continue to finance our operational needs through internally generated funds 
we believe that over the next twelve months  our cash position and internally generated funds during the year will be sufficient to meet the capital expenditures and ongoing financial needs of the business 
in addition  we continue to have availability to substantial lines of credit should any unforeseen need impact the period 
we continually review and evaluate the adequacy of our lending facilities and relationships 
cash flows from operating  investing and financing activities at december   december  and december  we had cash and cash equivalents of million  million and million  respectively  and working capital of million  million and million  respectively 
cash flows from operating activities were million in compared to million in and million in significant items that impacted operating cash flows included the following a decrease in inventories of million in as compared to a decrease of million in and an increase of million in the continuing decline from to is the result of the sales declines in the customer electrical components and printed circuit materials reportable segments  as well as a focused effort to reduce inventory levels to improve cash flows and strengthen our working capital position 
a decrease in accounts receivable of million in as compared to a decrease of million in and an increase of million in the decrease in and versus the increase in is primarily due to lower sales volumes in addition to concentrated collection efforts made in order to strengthen our working capital position 
a decrease in accounts payable and other accrued liabilities of million in as compared to a decrease of million in and an increase of million in the decrease in  which has continued since  is primarily attributable to the decrease in raw material purchases related to the decreased production levels which is further evidenced by the decrease in inventory balances over the comparable period as discussed above 
during  we used million in cash for investing activities as compared to million in and million in the decrease in cash used for investing activities in and versus is primarily attributable to the sale of short term investments during in  our short term investments were classified as long term marketable securities because they were auction rate securities deemed to be illiquid 
in addition  capital expenditures were million  million and million in  and  respectively  and in we had net proceeds of million related to our induflex subsidiary 
the higher capital spending was driven by our continuing investment in china  as we continued to build manufacturing capacity in suzhou  china 
cash generated from our operating activities exceeded capital spending in all three years  and spending was financed through these internally generated funds 
net cash used in financing activities was million in as compared to cash used by financing activities of million in and cash provided by financing activities of million in the use of cash in and was driven primarily by our stock repurchase program  as million and million were spent to reacquire stock in and  respectively 
we did not repurchase stock in the activity in  of million  is primarily related to the proceeds from the sale of capital stock  as a result of the exercise of stock options 
credit facilities we have a multicurrency revolving credit agreement with rbs citizens  national association bank  a successor in interest to citizens bank of connecticut credit agreement 
the credit agreement provides for two credit facilities 
one facility credit facility a is available for loans or letters of credit up to million  and the second facility credit facility b is available for loans of up to million 
credit facility a is a five year facility and credit facility b is a day facility 
both are multi currency facilities under which we may borrow in us dollars  japanese yen  euros or any other currency freely convertible into us dollars and traded on a recognized interbank market 
under the terms of the credit agreement  we have the right to incur additional indebtedness outside of the credit agreement through additional borrowings in an aggregate amount of up to million 
credit facility a expires on november  credit facility b was renewed on november   and we expect to renew it annually  subject to the conditions of the credit markets 
the rate of interest charged on any outstanding loans can  at our option and subject to certain restrictions  be based on the prime rate or at rates from to basis points over a libor loan rate for credit facility a  and from to basis points for credit facility b 
the spreads over the libor rate for credit facility a are based on our leverage ratio 
under the arrangement  the ongoing commitment fee varies from zero to basis points of the maximum amount that can be borrowed  net of any outstanding borrowings and the maximum amount that beneficiaries may draw under outstanding letters of credit 
there were no borrowings pursuant to the credit agreement at december  and december   respectively 
the credit agreement contains restrictive covenants primarily related to total indebtedness  interest expense  and capital expenditures 
we were in compliance with those covenants at december  and december  at december  we had certain standby letters of credit loc and guarantees that were backed by the credit facility million irrevocable standby loc to guarantee rogers self insured workers compensation plan million irrevocable standby loc guarantees a payable obligation of rogers belgian subsidiary million letter guarantee to guarantee a payable obligation for a chinese subsidiary rogers shanghai million letter guarantee to guarantee a payable obligation for a chinese subsidiary rogers suzhou no amounts were owed on the locs as of december  the volatility in the credit markets has generally diminished liquidity and capital availability in worldwide markets 
we are unable to predict the likely duration and severity of the current disruptions in the credit and financial markets and adverse global economic conditions 
however  we believe that our existing sources of liquidity and cash expected to be generated from future operations  together with existing and anticipated available long term financing  will be sufficient to fund operations  capital expenditures  and research and development efforts for at least the next twelve months 
financial position the following discusses the significant fluctuations on our balance sheet at december  as compared to december  decrease in inventories of is the result of our efforts to reduce inventory levels in order to strengthen our working capital position and better align our inventory levels with our expected sales levels 
decrease in accounts receivable of is primarily attributable to lower sales volumes in addition to our concentrated collection efforts in order to strengthen our working capital position 
increase in accrued employee benefits and compensation of is a result of the increased annual incentive compensation and commission payouts for  which did not occur in decrease in accounts payable of is primarily attributable to the decrease in raw material purchases to support current production levels as further evidenced by the decrease in inventory balances over the comparable period as discussed above  as well as the timing of payments at year end 
decrease in additional paid in capital of is primarily related to the stock repurchases that we made during the year 
auction rate securities as of december   we held approximately million of auction rate securities at par value as compared to approximately million as of december  at the end of  these securities were classified as available for sale and recorded at fair value based on market valuations at that time level input in accordance with the statement of financial accounting standards no 
 fair value measurements sfas 
however  in the first quarter of  the markets in which these securities traded became illiquid  causing us to reclassify these securities from a level input to a level input  as an active market no longer existed for these securities  so we had to base our valuations on unobservable inputs in accordance with sfas accordingly  our asset value was determined considering several factors  including an estimated time horizon for redeeming such securities  a discount factor to determine the present value of such securities  as well as the quality of the underlying securities  most of which were backed by investment grade student loans or municipalities 
our initial valuations utilized a discount period of approximately two years  which represented our best estimates of the time period over which these securities would be redeemed 
however  as progressed  we determined that  based on the market conditions at the time that the estimated time horizon for redemption of such securities would be greater than two years and  in the fourth quarter of  we adjusted our assumptions for this consideration 
the total fair value of the auction rate securities at december   was million 
these securities are classified as long term assets  except for those that are scheduled to be redeemed within the next three months  which are classified as short term investments 
also  any gains losses resulting from the valuation of these securities are deemed to be not other than temporary and are recorded in other comprehensive income 
the assumptions utilized in the valuation  as well as in the not other than temporary determination  will continue to be reviewed and  as market conditions continue to evolve and change  we will adjust our assumptions accordingly  which could result in either positive or negative valuation adjustments in the future 
currently  we believe that we have the ability and intent to hold these securities until recovery 
we also do not believe that the illiquid nature of these securities will negatively impact our business  as we believe we have the ability to generate sufficient cash to fund the operations and future growth of the business absent these securities 
contractual obligations the following table summarizes our significant contractual obligations as of december  dollars in thousands payments due by period total within year years years after years operating leases inventory purchase obligations capital commitments pension and retiree health and life insurance benefits total pension benefit payments  which amount to million  are expected to be paid through the utilization of pension plan assets  retiree health and life insurance benefits  which amount to million  are expected to be paid from operating cash flows 
effects of inflation we do not believe that inflation has had a material impact on our business  sales  or operating results during the periods presented 
off balance sheet arrangements we do not have any off balance sheet arrangements that have  or are in the opinion of management reasonably likely to have  a current or future effect on our financial condition or results of operations

accounting for uncertainty in income taxes in june  the fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb no 
fin 
fin prescribes a recognition threshold and a measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
for those benefits to be recognized  a tax position must be more likely than not to be sustained upon examination by taxing authorities 
the amount recognized is measured as the largest amount of benefit that is greater than percent likely of being realized upon settlement 
fin is effective for accounting periods commencing after december  we adopted the provisions of fin on january  upon adoption  an increase of million was recorded in the liability for unrecognized tax benefits  which was recorded through a decrease in retained earnings 
critical accounting policies our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles  which require management to make estimates  judgments and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances and believe that appropriate reserves have been established based on reasonable methodologies and appropriate assumptions based on facts and circumstances that are known  however  actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
an accounting policy is deemed to be critical if it requires an accounting estimate to be made based on assumptions that are highly judgmental and uncertain at the time the estimate is made  if different estimates could reasonably have been used or if changes to those estimates are reasonably likely to periodically occur that could affect the amounts carried in the financial statements 
these critical accounting policies are as follows environmental and product liabilities we accrue for our environmental investigation  remediation  operating and maintenance costs when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated 
for environmental matters  the most likely cost to be incurred is accrued based on an evaluation of currently available facts with respect to each individual site  including existing technology  current laws and regulations and prior remediation experience 
for sites with multiple potential responsible parties prp s  we consider our likely proportionate share of the anticipated remediation costs and the ability of the other parties to fulfill their obligations in establishing a provision for those costs 
where no amount within a range of estimates is more likely to occur than another  the minimum is accrued 
when future liabilities are determined to be reimbursable by insurance coverage  an accrual is recorded for the potential liability and a receivable is recorded for the estimated insurance reimbursement amount 
we are exposed to the uncertain nature inherent in such remediation and the possibility that initial estimates will not reflect the final outcome of a matter 
in late  we determined that it was reasonably prudent  based on facts and circumstances known to us at that time  to perform a formal analysis to determine our potential future liability and related insurance coverage for asbestos related matters 
the determination to perform this study was made based on several factors  including the growing number of asbestos related claims and recent settlement history 
projecting future asbestos costs is subject to numerous variables that are extremely difficult to predict  including the number of claims that might be received  the type and severity of the disease alleged by each claimant  the long latency period associated with asbestos exposure  dismissal rates  costs of medical treatment  the financial resources of other companies that are co defendants in claims  uncertainties surrounding the litigation process from jurisdiction to jurisdiction and from case to case  and the impact of potential changes in legislative or judicial standards  including potential tort reform 
furthermore  any predictions with respect to these variables are subject to even greater uncertainty as the projection period lengthens 
in light of these inherent uncertainties  our limited claims history and consultations with national economic research associates  inc nera  we believe that five years is the most reasonable period for recognizing a reserve for future costs  and that costs that might be incurred after that period are not reasonably estimable at this time 
as a result  we also believe that our ultimate net asbestos related contingent liability ie  its indemnity or other claim disposition costs plus related legal fees cannot be estimated with certainty 
the models developed for determining the potential exposure and related insurance coverage were developed by outside consultants deemed to be experts in their respective fields 
the models required us to make numerous assumptions that significantly impacted the results generated by the models 
we believe the assumptions made are reasonable at the present time  but are subject to uncertainty based on the actual future outcome of our asbestos litigation 
we believe  based on the limited amount of settlement and claims history currently known to us  that a reasonable future time frame to quantify our liability is five years  resulting in a liability at december  of approximately million  which is substantially offset by an insurance receivable of million 
if we were to adjust our assumptions related to the determination of these amounts  the impact of increasing the time frame for projected claims from five years to seven years would be an increase to the liability of million  which we believe would be substantially covered by insurance  conversely  the impact of changing this assumption from five years to three years would be a decrease to the liability of million 
given the inherent uncertainty in making future projections  we plan to have the projections of current and future asbestos claims periodically re examined  and we will update them if needed based on our experience  changes in the underlying assumptions that formed the basis for nera s and marsh risk consulting s marsh models  and other relevant factors  such as changes in the tort system 
there can be no assurance that our accrued asbestos liabilities will approximate our actual asbestos related settlement and defense costs  or that our accrued insurance recoveries will be realized 
we believe that it is reasonably possible that we will incur additional charges for our asbestos liabilities and defense costs in the future  which could exceed existing reserves  but cannot estimate such excess amounts at this time 
income taxes sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes sfas  establishes financial accounting and reporting standards to be used in determining the effect of income taxes 
the objective of accounting for income taxes is to recognize the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current fiscal year and the deferred tax assets and liabilities for the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements 
deferred tax assets and liabilities reflect temporary differences between amounts of assets and liabilities for financial and tax reporting 
such amounts are adjusted  as appropriate  to reflect changes in tax rates expected to be in effect when the temporary differences reverse 
we establish a valuation allowance to offset any deferred tax assets if  based upon the available evidence  it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
the determination of the amount of a valuation allowance to be provided on recorded deferred tax assets involves estimates regarding the timing and amount of the reversal of taxable temporary differences  expected future taxable income  and the impact of tax planning strategies 
in assessing the need for a valuation allowance  we consider all available positive and negative evidence  including past operating results  projections of future taxable income and the feasibility of ongoing tax planning strategies 
the projections of future taxable income include a number of estimates and assumptions regarding our volume  pricing and costs 
additionally  valuation allowances related to deferred tax assets can be impacted by changes to tax laws 
significant judgment is required in determining income tax provisions under sfas and in evaluating tax positions 
we establish additional provisions for income taxes when  despite the belief that tax positions are fully supportable  there remain certain positions that are likely to be challenged and that may not be sustained on review by tax authorities 
in the normal course of business  we are examined by various federal  state and foreign tax authorities 
we regularly assess the potential outcomes of these and any future examinations for the current or prior years in determining the adequacy of our provision for income taxes 
we continually assess the likelihood and amount of potential adjustments and adjust the income tax provision  the current tax liability and deferred taxes in the period in which the facts that give rise to a revision become known 
inventory allowances we maintain a reserve for obsolete and slow moving inventory 
products and materials that are specifically identified as obsolete are fully reserved 
in general  most products that have been held in inventory greater than one year are fully reserved unless there are mitigating circumstances  including forecasted sales or current orders for the product 
the remainder of the allowance is based on our estimates  and fluctuates with market conditions  design cycles and other economic factors 
risks associated with this allowance include unforeseen changes in business cycles that could affect the marketability of certain products and an unforecasted decline in current production 
we closely monitor the market place and related inventory levels and have historically maintained reasonably accurate allowance levels 
in addition  we value certain inventories using the last in  first out lifo method 
accordingly  a lifo valuation reserve is calculated using the link chain index method and is maintained to properly value these inventories 
our obsolescence reserve has ranged from to of gross inventory over the last three years 
a basis point adjustment to the december  obsolescence reserve would change the reserve by approximately million 
goodwill in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas  goodwill is subject to annual impairment tests  or earlier if events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may have been impaired 
determining the fair value of an operating segment is judgmental in nature and requires the use of significant estimates and assumptions  including revenue growth rates and operating margins  discount rates  and future market conditions  among others 
we believe that the assumptions and rates used in our annual impairment test under sfas are reasonable  but inherently uncertain 
the impairment test was performed in the fourth quarter of on the two operating segments for which we had goodwill recorded at that time and it did not result in an impairment charge 
the excess of fair value over carrying value for these operating segments ranged from approximately million to million 
in order to estimate the sensitivity of the analysis performed  we applied a hypothetical decrease to the fair values of each operating segment  which resulted in excess fair value over carrying value ranging from approximately million to million for each respective operating segment 
these valuations are based on a five year discounted cash flow analysis  which utilized a discount rate of approximately and a terminal year growth rate of long lived assets we review property  plant and equipment and identified intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of assets may not be recoverable 
recoverability of these assets is measured by comparison of their carrying value to future undiscounted cash flows the assets are expected to generate over their remaining economic lives 
if such assets are considered to be impaired  the impairment to be recognized in earnings equals the amount by which the carrying value of the assets exceeds their market value determined by either a quoted market price  if available  or a value determined by utilizing a discounted cash flow analysis 
we did not record any impairment charges in related to our property  plant and equipment and identified intangible assets 
pension and other postretirement benefits we provide various defined benefit pension plans for our us employees and sponsor three defined benefit healthcare and life insurance plans 
the costs and obligations associated with these plans are dependent upon various actuarial assumptions used in calculating such amounts 
these assumptions include discount rates  salary growth  long term rate of return on plan assets  mortality rates and other factors 
the assumptions used were determined as follows i the discount rate used is based on comparisons to the citigroup index and  to a lesser extent  the moody s aa bond index  ii the salary growth is based on our historical and projected level of salary increases  and iii the long term rate of return on plan assets is determined based on historical portfolio results  market conditions and our expectations of future returns 
the rates used to determine our costs and obligations under our pension and postretirement plans are disclosed in footnote of the consolidated financial statements of this form k 
each assumption has different sensitivity characteristics 
for the year ended december   a basis point increase in the discount rate would have decreased our net benefit cost by approximately million and a basis point reduction in the long term rate of return on plan assets would have increased our net benefit cost by approximately million 
allowance for doubtful accounts our allowance for doubtful accounts is determined based on a variety of factors that affect the potential collectibility of receivables  including length of time receivables are past due  customer credit ratings  financial stability of customers  specific one time events and past customer history 
in addition  in circumstances when we are made aware of a specific customer s inability to meet its financial obligations  a specific allowance is established 
the majority of accounts are individually evaluated on a regular basis and appropriate reserves are established as deemed appropriate based on the criteria previously mentioned 
the remainder of the reserve is based on our estimates and takes into consideration historical trends  market conditions and the composition of our customer base 
the risk with this estimate is associated with failure to become aware of potential collectibility issues related to specific accounts and thereby become exposed to potential unreserved losses 
historically  our estimates and assumptions around the allowance have been reasonably accurate and we have processes and controls in place to closely monitor customers and potential credit issues 
historically over the past three years  our allowance as a percentage of total receivables has ranged from to 
a basis point increase in our current year allowance to receivable ratio would increase our allowance reserve by approximately million 
forward looking information certain statements in this annual report on form k may constitute forward looking statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of such forward looking statements are based on management s expectations  estimates  projections and assumptions 
words such as expects  anticipates  intends  believes  estimates  and variations of such words and similar expressions are intended to identify such forward looking statements 
such forward looking statements involve known and unknown risks  uncertainties  and other factors that may cause our actual results or performance to be materially different from any future results or performance expressed or implied by such forward looking statements 
such factors include  but are not limited to  changing business  economic  and political conditions both in the united states and in foreign countries  increasing competition  changes in product mix  the development of new products and manufacturing processes and the inherent risks associated with such efforts  the outcome of current and future litigation  the accuracy of our analysis of our potential asbestos related exposure and insurance coverage  changes in the availability and cost of raw materials  fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates  and any difficulties in integrating acquired businesses into our operations 
such factors also apply to our joint ventures 
we make no commitment to update any forward looking statement or to disclose any facts  events  or circumstances after the date hereof that may affect the accuracy of any forward looking statements  unless required by law 
additional information about certain factors that could cause actual results to differ from such forward looking statements include  but are not limited to  those items described in item a to this form k  risk factors 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk currently  we are exposed to market risk from changes in foreign exchange rates 
we currently do not use derivative instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
we monitor foreign exchange and interest rate risks and manage such risks on specific transactions 
the risk management process primarily uses analytical techniques and sensitivity analysis 
we have various borrowing facilities where the interest rates  although not fixed  are currently relatively low 
currently  an increase in the associated interest rates would not significantly impact interest expense on these facilities  as we currently have no debt 
the fair value of our investment portfolio or the related interest income would not be significantly impacted by either a basis point increase or decrease in interest rates due mainly to the size and nature of our investment portfolio 
at the beginning of our short term investments were comprised of auction rate securities 
these investments had been classified as available for sale due to the short term nature of the investments  however  during the first quarter of we reclassified them to long term 
changes in market conditions during the first quarter of caused us to change the nature of these investments and record an impairment for the first quarter and each subsequent quarter of this impairment is classified as not other than temporary due to the liquidity of the company  and our intent and current ability are to hold the investments until they recover 
our financial results are affected by changes in foreign exchange rates and economic conditions in foreign countries in which we do business 
our primary overseas markets are in europe and asia  thus exposing us to exchange rate risk from fluctuations in the euro and the various currencies used in the far east 
exposure to variability in currency exchange rates is mitigated  when possible  through the use of natural hedges  whereby purchases and sales in the same foreign currency and with similar maturity dates offset one another 
we can initiate hedging activities by entering into foreign exchange forward contracts with third parties when the use of natural hedges is not possible or desirable 
in  a increase decrease in exchange rates would have resulted in an increase decrease to sales and net income of million and million  respectively
