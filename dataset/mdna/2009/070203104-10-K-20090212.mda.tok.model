item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview bassett furniture industries  incorporated together with its consolidated subsidiaries  bassett  we  our or the company  based in bassett  va  is a leading retailer  manufacturer and marketer of branded home furnishings 
our products are sold primarily through bassett furniture direct bfd and bassett home furnishings bhf stores  with secondary distribution through multi line furniture stores  many with in store bassett design centers 
bassettbaby cribs and casegoods are sold through specialty stores and mass merchants 
we were founded in and incorporated under the laws of virginia in our rich  year history has instilled the principles of quality  value  and integrity in everything that we do  while simultaneously providing us with the expertise to respond to ever changing consumer tastes and to meet the demands of a global economy 
two primary business developments continue to affect our business as they have for nearly a decade 
first  we created and re channeled sales through a vertically integrated retail store network 
bassett furniture direct bfd or store was created in as a single source home furnishings retail store that provides a unique combination of stylish  well made furniture and accessories with a high level of customer service 
this service includes complimentary room planning  in home design visits  quick delivery  and custom order furniture 
the retail store program had stores in operation at the end of  of which we own and operate 
second  the furniture industry continues to experience a shift from traditional domestic manufacturing to offshore sourcing in lower cost markets  primarily in china and other pacific rim countries 
this shift in sourcing has resulted in downward pressure on retail prices and reductions in traditional channels of sales distribution 
many retailers now source their own products rather than relying on a traditional domestic manufacturer or wholesaler to supply goods 
sales of imported products represented of our total wholesale volume in we have responded to these changes by reducing manufacturing production where we can more cost efficiently source product 
over the last seven years  we have reduced the number of facilities from to  and reduced our headcount from approximately  to  during  we closed our last large wood manufacturing facility in bassett  va 
we currently operate one wood assembly plant in martinsville  va  one fiberboard supply facility in bassett  va  and one upholstery facility in newton  nc we have closed and consolidated seven wood factories over the past eight years 
maintenance of a strong balance sheet is a stated management goal and vital to our retail growth strategy 
the store program entails key business risks  including the realization of receivables and the coverage of both direct and contingent liabilities primarily associated with retail real estate 
we have established decision criteria and business disciplines aimed at minimizing potential losses from these risks 
overall conditions for our industry and our company have been difficult over the past several years 
new housing starts are down significantly and consumers continue to be faced with general economic uncertainty fueled by deteriorating consumer credit markets and lagging consumer confidence as a result of volatile and often erratic financial markets 
all of this has significantly impacted big ticket consumer purchases such as furniture 
consequently  this has put pressure on certain of our dealers ability to generate adequate profits 
as a result  licensee owned stores were closed during and we incurred bad debt related losses with some of these dealers 
although management will continue to work closely with our licensees to ensure the success of both the licensee and bassett  we expect an additional eight to ten underperforming stores to close during we also expect to increase the number of company owned stores during  primarily through acquisitions of certain licensee owned stores 

table of contents given the difficult and somewhat unprecedented environment  we have had no choice but to take several important actions aimed at improving our results and liquidity in the short term 
these include aggressively working with certain licensees to close those stores that are underperforming thereby limiting further exposure in our accounts receivable 
reducing our inventory levels to improve working capital and cash flow 
right sizing our expense structure in both our wholesale and corporate retail divisions 
suspending our quarterly dividend and share repurchase program 
delaying certain capital expenditures 
concurrently with our implementation of this short term plan  we will continue pursuing our long term growth objectives by investing in store prototype conversions and remodels and working diligently with our network of licensees to improve their operating results 
with the existing and planned improvements in our retail program and our strong balance sheet  we believe we are well positioned not only to survive these turbulent times  but also to gain market share as some of our competitors exit the industry 
while retail traffic at the stores was under pressure in  traffic to the company s website  www 
bassettfurniture 
com  grew significantly 
bassett has worked diligently to strengthen the website s capabilities and ease of use and will continue to make improvements in in addition  bassett began in to sell its product online at our website 
bassett is leveraging its company owned and licensed store network to handle delivery and customer service for orders placed online 
critical accounting policies and estimates our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america which requires that certain estimates and assumptions be made that affect the amounts and disclosures reported in those financial statements and the related accompanying notes 
actual results could differ from these estimates and assumptions 
we use our best judgment in valuing these estimates and may  as warranted  solicit external advice 
estimates are based on current facts and circumstances  prior experience and other assumptions believed to be reasonable 
the following critical accounting policies  some of which are impacted significantly by judgments  assumptions and estimates  affect our consolidated financial statements 
consolidation the consolidated financial statements include the accounts of bassett furniture industries  incorporated and its majority owned subsidiaries for whom we have operating control 
we also consolidate variable interest entities for which we are the primary beneficiary 
allowance for accounts and notes receivable we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
the allowance for doubtful accounts is based on a review of specifically identified accounts and notes receivable in addition to an overall aging analysis 
we evaluate the collectibility of our receivables from our licensees on a quarterly basis 
our allowance for doubtful accounts represents our best estimate of potential losses on our accounts and notes receivables and is adjusted accordingly based on historical experience  current developments and economic trends 
actual losses could differ from those estimates 
inventories inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market 
cost is determined for domestic furniture inventories using the last in  first out method 
the cost of imported inventories is determined on a first in  first out basis 
we estimate an inventory reserve for excess quantities and obsolete items based on specific identification and historical write offs  taking into account future demand and market conditions 
if actual demand or market conditions in the future are less favorable than those estimated  additional inventory write downs may be required 

table of contents valuation allowances on deferred tax assets in accordance with sfas no 
accounting for income taxes sfas no 
 we evaluate our deferred income tax assets quarterly to determine if valuation allowances are required or should be adjusted 
sfas no 
requires that companies assess whether valuation allowances should be established against their deferred tax assets based on consideration of all available evidence  both positive and negative  using a more likely than not standard 
this assessment considers  among other matters  the nature  frequency and severity of recent losses  forecasts of future profitability  the duration of statutory carryforward periods  our experience with tax attributes expiring unused and tax planning alternatives 
in making such judgments  significant weight is given to evidence that can be objectively verified 
investments investments are marked to market and recorded at their fair value 
we account for the alternative asset fund by marking it to market value each month based on the net asset values provided by the general partner  adjusted for estimated liquidity discounts 
unrealized holding gains and losses  net of the related income tax effect  on available for sale securities are excluded from income and are reported as other comprehensive income in stockholders equity 
realized gains and losses from securities classified as available for sale are included in income and are determined using the specific identification method for ascertaining the cost of securities sold 
we also review our available for sale securities to determine whether a decline in fair value of a security below the cost basis is other than temporary 
should the decline be considered other than temporary  we writedown the cost of the security and include the loss in current earnings 
in determining whether a decline is other than temporary  we consider such factors as the significance of the decline as compared to the cost basis  the current state of the financial markets and the economy  the length of time for which there has been an unrealized loss and the relevant information regarding the operations of the investee 
goodwill as specified in statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for business combinations  goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the value assigned to tangible assets and liabilities and identifiable intangible assets of businesses acquired 
sfas no 
 goodwill and intangible assets  requires that goodwill be reviewed for impairment annually or whenever events or changes in business circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the assets may not be recoverable 
our policy is to perform the annual impairment analysis as of the beginning of our fiscal fourth quarter 
sfas no 
also requires that the assets and liabilities acquired and the resulting goodwill be allocated to the entity s respective reporting units 
we have identified three reporting units for our business wholesale  retail and real estate investments 
the required impairment test is a two step process 
the first step compares the carrying value of each reporting unit that has goodwill with the estimated fair value of the respective reporting unit 
should the carrying value of a reporting unit be in excess of the estimated fair value of that reporting unit  the second step is performed whereby we must calculate the implied fair value of goodwill by deducting the fair value of all tangible and intangible net assets of the reporting unit from the fair value of the reporting unit 
this second step represents a hypothetical purchase price allocation as if we had acquired the reporting unit on that date 
our impairment methodology uses a discounted cash flow analysis requiring certain assumptions and estimates to be made regarding future profitability of the reporting unit and industry economic factors 
while we believe such assumptions and estimates are reasonable  the actual results may differ materially from the projected amounts 
impairment of long lived assets we periodically evaluate whether events or circumstances have occurred that indicate long lived assets may not be recoverable or that the remaining useful life may warrant revision 
when such events or circumstances are present  we assess the recoverability of long lived assets by determining whether the carrying value will be recovered through the expected undiscounted future cash flows resulting from the use of the asset 
in the event the sum of the expected undiscounted future cash flows is less than the carrying value of the asset  an impairment loss equal to the excess of the asset s carrying value over its fair value is recorded 
revenue recognition revenue is recognized when the risks and rewards of ownership and title to the product have transferred to the buyer 
this generally occurs upon the shipment of goods to independent dealers 
table of contents or  in the case of company owned retail stores  upon delivery to the customer 
our terms vary from to days 
an estimate for returns and allowances has been provided in recorded sales 
the contracts with our licensee store owners do not provide for any royalty or license fee to be paid to us 
staff accounting bulletin no 
revenue recognition sab outlines the four basic criteria for recognizing revenue as follows persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  the seller s price to the buyer is fixed or determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
sab further asserts that if collectibility of all or a portion of the revenue is not reasonably assured  revenue recognition should be deferred until payment is received 
in our judgment  collectibility is not reasonably assured when the decision has been made to exit a dealer 
as part of our efforts to standardize wholesale pricing throughout the country  we began in july invoicing all of the store network and certain wholesale customers on a fully landed basis such that the invoice price includes the freight charge for delivery 
this business change resulted in approximately  and  of additional reported revenue and selling  general  and administrative expenses for and  respectively 
loss reserves we have a number of other potential loss exposures incurred in the ordinary course of business such as environmental claims  product liability  litigation  restructuring charges  and the recoverability of deferred income tax benefits 
establishing loss reserves for these matters requires estimates and judgment with regard to maximum risk exposure and ultimate liability or realization 
as a result  these estimates are often developed with the assistance of appropriate advisors  and are based on our current understanding of the underlying facts and circumstances 
because of uncertainties related to the ultimate outcomes of these issues or the possibilities of changes in the underlying facts and circumstances  additional charges related to these issues could be required in the future 
analysis of operations summarized consolidated operating information is as follows november  november  november  net sales gross profit sg a bad debt expense landed freight restructuring  asset impairment charges and other one time items  net operating loss other income loss  net tax expense benefit net income loss note for comparability purposes  we have presented our selling  general and administrative expenses above without consideration of the effects of the landed freight change and the bad debt expense 
sales for the year ended november  were  as compared to  for and  in  representing decreases of and  respectively 
the and reported sales were positively impacted by a change in our business practices with respect to freight for the delivery of wholesale furniture to our retail stores

this change positively impacted reported revenue by  and  in and  respectively

this significant increase over results from improved margins in both the wholesale and retail segments 
the gross margin increase in as compared to is due primarily to the inclusion of more retail stores which carry a higher gross margin and improved wholesale import product mix  partially offset by the wind down costs and inventory markdowns associated with the closure of the bassett plant 
selling  general and administrative expenses decreased  in as compared to due to lower spending in the wholesale segment 
bad debt expense increased due to store closings both completed and planned and the prolonged weak retail environment that is affecting our licensed retail network 
other income loss  net was   and  in   and  respectively 
the operating loss reported by the company in  exclusive of the impairment charges  is primarily due to losses incurred by the company s retail segment and to the reserves recorded for bad debts related to sales to certain licensee stores within its wholesale segment 
these losses reflect both the deteriorating home furnishings retail environment and the shortfall between the amount of sales required to breakeven on an average per store basis and the amount of sales that were actually written and delivered 
the company continues to take actions to improve per store sales performance including adding new more value oriented product offerings  strengthening its design and sales talent  and incorporating elements of the new store prototype into more of its stores 
in addition  we are closing underperforming stores that we do not believe will be able to meet their required breakeven sales levels 
further  we are reducing the cost and expense structure of our wholesale segment to reflect this lower level of sales and the reduced number of stores

the closure of the  square foot facility was completed during june of and affected approximately employees 
the company has sourced the majority of the products previously produced at this facility from overseas suppliers  continued to produce certain custom bedroom products domestically and discontinued providing certain slower selling items 
as a result of this decision  we recorded a  charge to write down the value of the plant and equipment and a charge for severance benefits 
we have disbursed all of the severance benefits 
during  we also reduced our leased showroom space in the international home furnishings center by approximately and recorded a charge to write off the net book value of the corresponding capitalized tenant improvements 
as part of our expense reduction initiatives  we concluded during that four of our leased store locations would no longer be used by us as retail furniture locations 
we have finalized sublease agreements for two of the stores thereby reducing our future cash outlays 
although no sublessee has been identified for the other store leases  we are actively marketing these locations 
in accordance with fasb statement no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities  we recorded a  charge to recognize the future obligations associated with the leases  net of estimated sublease income

segment information we have strategically aligned our business into three reportable segments wholesale  retail and investments real estate 
the wholesale home furnishings segment is involved principally in the design  manufacture  sourcing  sale and distribution of furniture products to a network of bassett stores licensee owned stores and company owned retail stores and independent furniture retailers 
our wholesale segment includes our wood and upholstery operations as well as all corporate selling  general and administrative expenses  including those corporate expenses related to both company and licensee owned stores

selling  general and administrative expenses decreased  primarily due to lower spending as we continue to adjust our cost structure to match the size of the operations

although this segment does not have operating earnings  income from the segment is included in income from investments in our consolidated statements of operations 
our equity investment in ihfc is not included in the identifiable assets of this segment since it has a negative book value and is therefore included in the long term liabilities section of our consolidated balance sheet 
income and expense items for fiscal  and are as follows income loss from investments other than temporary impairment of investments income from unconsolidated affiliated companies  net interest expense other other income loss  net income loss from investments for included  in losses from the alternative asset fund partially offset by  of dividend income and net realized gains from our marketable security portfolio 
historically  the alternative asset fund has produced returns in excess of the relevant market indices 
see item a for a further discussion of the alternative asset fund 
in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities  we review our marketable securities to determine whether a decline in fair value of a security below the cost basis is other than temporary 
should the decline be considered other than temporary  we write down the cost basis of the security and include the loss in current earnings as opposed to an unrealized holding loss 
due to the significant decline in the financial markets during the fiscal fourth quarter  many of our holdings sustained significant losses 
consequently  we recorded  in losses in our consolidated statement of operations in income from unconsolidated affiliated companies  net includes income from our investment in ihfc as well as income loss from other equity method investments 
we recognized income from ihfc of   and  in  and  respectively 
significant fluctuations in the earnings losses of our other investments have been primarily caused by losses recognized related to our previous investment in bfd northeast  llc bfdne of and  in and  respectively 
on february   we entered into an agreement with bfdne whereby we contributed our interest in bfdne to bfdne in exchange for certain assets primarily inventory and leasehold improvements of bfdne s two stores in boston  massachusetts

accounting for income taxes sfas no 
 we evaluate our deferred income tax assets quarterly to determine if valuation allowances are required or should be adjusted 
sfas no 
requires that companies assess whether valuation allowances should be established against their deferred tax assets based on consideration of all available evidence  both positive and negative  using a more likely than not standard 
this assessment considers  among other matters  the nature  frequency and severity of recent losses  forecasts of future profitability  the duration of statutory carryforward periods  our experience with tax attributes expiring unused and tax planning alternatives 
in making such judgments  significant weight is given to evidence that can be objectively verified 
due to the losses in the fourth quarter of  we are in a cumulative loss position for the past three years which is considered significant negative evidence that is difficult 
table of contents to overcome on a more likely than not standard through objectively verifiable data 
while our long term financial outlook remains positive and we have certain strategies that could produce taxable income and depending on timing  may help us to realize our deferred tax assets 
however  we concluded that our ability to rely on our long term outlook and forecasts as to future taxable income was limited 
due to the weight of the negative evidence  including the cumulative losses and a market capitalization well below our book value  we recorded a  charge to establish a valuation allowance against substantially all of our deferred tax assets during the fourth quarter of we will continue to evaluate the need for the allowance on a quarterly basis and if additional positive evidence is obtained such as the company returning to profitability  the valuation allowance could decrease 
our effective income tax rate was for excluding the charge noted above to record a valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets  our effective rate would have been 
the effective rate was favorably impacted by exclusions for dividends received from our investment in ihfc and unfavorably impacted by the write off of goodwill associated with the wholesale segment and charges associated with equity method investees 
our effective income tax rate was and and the effective tax rate in both years was lower than the statutory rate primarily due to exclusions for dividends received from our investment in ihfc 
in addition  we recorded a tax charge of  in associated with the write off of deferred tax assets due to the termination of the lrg partnership 
our effective rate for was also increased by the write off of goodwill associated with our retail segment as it was not tax deductible 
see also note to the consolidated financial statements for a full reconciliation of the effective income tax rate for  and adoption of fin effective november   we adopted financial accounting standards board fasb interpretation no 
fin  accounting for uncertainty in income taxes  an interpretation of fasb statement no 
 accounting for income taxes  which provides a comprehensive model for the recognition  measurement  presentation  and disclosure in a company s financial statements of uncertain tax positions taken  or expected to be taken  on a tax return 
under fin  if an income tax position exceeds a more likely than not ie greater than probability of success upon tax audit  based solely on the technical merits of the position  the company is to recognize an income tax benefit in its financial statements 
the tax benefits recognized are to be measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement 
if it is not more likely than not that the benefit will be sustained on its technical merits  no benefit is to be recorded 
uncertain tax positions that relate only to timing of when an item is included on a tax return are considered to have met the recognition threshold for purposes of applying fin therefore  if it can be established that the only uncertainty is when an item is taken on a tax return  such positions have satisfied the recognition step for purposes of fin and uncertainty related to timing should be assessed as part of measurement 
fin requires that a liability associated with an unrecognized tax benefit be classified as a long term liability  except for the amount for which a cash payment is expected to be made within one year 
further  companies are required to accrue interest and related penalties  if applicable  on all tax exposures consistent with the respective jurisdictional tax laws 
the adoption of fin resulted in a non cash transition cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle adjustment of which was recorded as a decrease to beginning retained earnings 
the transition adjustment is a result  primarily  of tax positions associated with state income tax exposures and interest on certain temporary differences 
our continuing practice is to recognize interest and penalties related to income tax matters as a component of income tax expense 

table of contents as of the adoption date of fin  we had unrecognized income tax benefits totaling  of which would impact our effective income tax rate if recognized 
unrecognized tax benefits at november  gross increases gross decreases balance at november  we recognize interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense 
during  we recognized of interest expense recovery and of penalty expense recovery related to the unrecognized benefits noted above in our consolidated statement of operations 
the consolidated balance sheet includes accrued interest of and penalties of due to unrecognized tax benefits 
significant judgment is required in evaluating the company s federal and state tax positions and in the determination of its tax provision 
despite our belief that the liability for unrecognized tax benefits is adequate  it is often difficult to predict the final outcome or the timing of the resolution of any particular tax matter 
we may adjust these liabilities as relevant circumstances evolve  such as guidance from the relevant tax authority  or resolution of issues in the courts 
these adjustments are recognized as a component of income tax expense entirely in the period in which they are identified 
the company also cannot predict when or if any other future tax payments related to these tax positions may occur 
currently  there are no examinations in process of any of the company s income tax returns 
we remain subject to examination for tax years through for all of our major tax jurisdictions 
liquidity and capital resources the company is committed to maintaining a strong balance sheet in order to weather the current difficult industry conditions  to allow it to take advantage of opportunities as market conditions improve  and to execute its long term retail growth strategies 
during the year  we returned significant amounts of capital to our shareholders in the form of dividends and an increased share repurchase program 
in addition to our regular quarterly dividends of  we paid out a special dividend of  or per share 
we also spent  under the share repurchase plan 
the funding for the return to the shareholders has been from the orderly liquidation of our alternative asset fund investment and net liquidations of our marketable securities portfolio 
during  we received  from the alternative asset fund and  from liquidations of marketable securities 
due to unprecedented turmoil in the financial markets  further erosion of home furnishings sales  and general uncertainty regarding the depths to which current economic conditions could worsen  the board announced on october  that it had decided to suspend making any decision with respect to the per share second special dividend and declared a regular quarterly dividend of or less than the previous dividend 
subsequent to year end  we announced that the board of directors did not declare a regular quarterly dividend for the second quarter of conserving approximately  of cash 
we also received  or of the net asset value of our investment in styx partners  lp we expect to receive the remaining portion by the end of net cash used in operating activities was   and  in fiscal and  and  respectively 
our operating cash requirements for were funded through  of additional borrowings under the revolving credit facility   in dividends from our investment in the international home furnishings center ihfc and the remaining proceeds from our net investment liquidations 
cash requirements for were primarily funded through investment sales  dividends from ihfc and additional borrowings on the revolving credit facility 
cash requirements for were primarily funded through investment sales and dividends from ihfc 
we used  of cash in operating activities during fiscal primarily due to the continued difficult environment at retail as well as increased payments to fund the inventory build at the end of and the 
table of contents beginning of due to the january new product rollout 
due to the lead time to source the majority of the new product  inventory and accounts payable balances were unusually high at the end of fiscal our inventory levels peaked in january and began returning to more normalized levels during february 
although we plan additional product introductions in  they will not be as extensive as the rollout in early we expect overall inventory levels to decrease during  generating additional positive cash flow 
our accounts payable balance was reduced by  during fiscal and has returned to a more normalized level 
due to the continued housing slump and the fourth quarter deterioration in the major financial markets and the overall recessionary economic environment  consumer spending has decreased resulting in financial losses for us and damaging the ability of certain of our licensees to generate sufficient cash flow in their businesses 
currently  we are aggressively pursuing expense reduction and cash preservation initiatives throughout all parts of the business to enhance our cash flow 
as part of the improvement plans with certain of our licensees  we converted  of trade accounts receivable to long term interest bearing notes during the year ended november  we continually assess our level of bad debt reserves and recorded  in provisions for losses on accounts and notes receivable in  a  increase over a continuing difficult and weak retail environment could result in further bad debt expenses  reduced revenue and store real estate charges  including lease termination and impairment charges 
although we believe we have adequate reserves for bad debts  we will continue to work with our licensees to help limit bad debt exposure 
we expect eight to ten underperforming stores to close during we currently have  outstanding on our revolving credit facility with  of availability 
we amended our facility in august by extending the maturity date an additional two years and amending certain covenants 
the credit facility  as amended  provides for borrowings of up to  at a variable interest rate of libor plus on november  
the facility is secured by a pledge of certain of our marketable securities and substantially all of our receivables and inventories 
to the extent the value of the marketable securities falls below  our borrowing base  as defined  is decreased by of the difference between  and the actual value of those securities 
this facility contains  among other provisions  certain defined financial requirements including a maximum ratio of debt to equity and a minimum level of net worth 
due to the charges recorded in the fourth quarter of  the company s net worth decreased below the levels specified in the revolving credit facility 
subsequent to year end  we received a waiver of the violation from our bank and a reduction of the net worth covenant requirements for fiscal and the other relevant terms in the facility including the interest rate were not significantly amended 
we lease land and buildings that are used in the operation of our company owned retail stores as well as in the operation of licensee owned stores 
we had obligations of  at november  for future minimum lease payments under non cancelable operating leases having remaining terms in excess of one year 
we also have guaranteed certain lease obligations of licensee operators 
lease guarantees range from one to ten years 
we were contingently liable under licensee lease obligation guarantees in the amount of  at november  we have also guaranteed loans of certain of our licensees to finance initial inventory packages for those stores 
the total contingent liabilities with respect to these loan guarantees were  at november  in the fourth quarter of  we announced the acquisition of the operations of two stores in the charleston  south carolina area from a former licensee and that we had begun the process of acquiring the land and building of those stores
