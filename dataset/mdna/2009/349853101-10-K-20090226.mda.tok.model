item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview and executive summary our operations can be broadly classified into two principal segments forward air and fasi 
through our forward air segment  we are a leading provider of time definite surface transportation and related logistics services to the north american deferred air freight market 
we offer our customers local pick up and delivery forward air complete and scheduled surface transportation of cargo as a cost effective  reliable alternative to air transportation 
we transport cargo that must be delivered at a specific time  but is less time sensitive than traditional air freight 
this type of cargo is frequently referred to in the transportation industry as deferred air freight 
we operate our forward air segment through a network of terminals located on or near airports in cities in the united states and canada  including a central sorting facility in columbus  ohio and regional hubs serving key markets 
we also offer our customers an array of logistics and other services including expedited truckload brokerage tlx  dedicated fleets  warehousing  customs brokerage  and shipment consolidation  deconsolidation and handling 
on july   through our subsidiary and reporting segment  fasi  and in conjunction with the acquisition of usac  we began providing pool distribution services throughout the mid atlantic  southeast  midwest and southwest continental united states 
pool distribution involves managing high frequency handling and distribution of time sensitive product to numerous destinations in specific geographic regions 
our primary customers for this product are regional and nationwide distributors and retailers  such as mall  strip mall and outlet based retail chains 
we service these customers through a network of terminals and service centers located in cities 
our operations  particularly our network of hubs and terminals  represent substantial fixed costs 
consequently  our continued growth depends in significant part on our ability to increase the amount of freight and the revenue per pound for the freight shipped through our networks and to grow other lines of businesses  such as tlx  which will allow us to maintain revenue growth in challenging shipping environments 
trends and developments acquisitions during the year ended december  we experienced revenue growth across all product lines and segments 
the revenue growth was primarily driven by our and acquisitions and was partially offset by the challenging economic conditions of on september   we acquired certain assets and liabilities of service express 
service express was a privately held provider of pool distribution services primarily in the mid atlantic and southeastern continental united states 
service express generated approximately million in revenue during the year ended december  the acquisition of service express pool distribution services added to the geographic footprint of the fasi segment in the mid atlantic and southeastern united states 
on march   we acquired certain assets and liabilities of pinch 
pinch was a privately held provider of pool distribution  airport to airport  truckload  custom  and cartage services primarily to the southwestern continental united states 
pinch generated approximately million in revenue during the year ended december  the acquisition of pinch s pool distribution services expanded the geographic footprint of the fasi segment in the southwestern united states 
in addition  it provided additional tonnage density to the forward air airport to airport network  and the acquisition of pinch s cartage and truckload business provided an opportunity for forward air to expand its service options in the southwestern united states 
further  on december  we acquired certain assets and liabilities of black hawk for approximately million to increase the penetration of our airport to airport network in the midwest continental united states 
also  on july   we acquired certain assets and liabilities of usac for approximately million 
through this acquisition we began providing pool distribution services throughout the southeast  midwest and southwest continental united states 
while providing different benefits  these acquisitions fit into our completing the model strategic initiative of using acquisitions to grow our existing business and to expand into new services and lines of business that will provide for revenue growth in any market conditions 
we will continue to evaluate potential acquisitions that can increase our penetration of a geographic area  add new customers  increase freight  or enable us to offer additional services 
results of operations during the year ended december   despite the increase in revenue driven primarily by the above acquisitions  we experienced a year over year decrease in our income from operations 
the year over year decrease in income from operations was largely due to the current economic recession and the resulting decrease in our business levels during the fourth quarter of the depressed fourth quarter earnings were driven by the decrease in airport to airport revenue during the fourth quarter of versus the same period in and lower than expected fasi revenue and results of operations 
the significant decline in airport to airport revenue was driven by an over decrease in the tonnage shipped through our network during the fourth quarter of compared to the same period in the decline in airport to airport tonnage was directly related to the current economic recession 
the economic recession was also largely responsible for lower than expected revenue and reduced year over year fourth quarter earnings in our fasi segment 
fasi s net income was approximately million less in the fourth quarter of versus the fourth quarter of as depressed revenues due to the economic environment prevented us from achieving results comparable with increases in revenues from our logistics services  mainly tlx  and fasi offset the decline in airport to airport revenue  however these services  are not as profitable and did not generate comparable operating results with our airport to airport business 
we expect these year over year decreases to continue into  as our airport to airport business continues to experience large year over year decreases in business levels 
also  declining fuel prices may adversely affect our revenues in our net fuel surcharge revenue is the result of our fuel surcharge rates  which are set weekly using the national average for diesel price per gallon  and the tonnage transiting our network 
the decline in tonnage levels combined with the year over year decline in diesel fuel prices could result in a significant reduction in our net fuel surcharge revenue during segments effective july   in conjunction with fasi s acquisition of certain assets and liabilities of usac  we began reporting our operations as two segments forward air and fasi 
our forward air segment includes our airport to airport  forward air complete  and tlx services as well as our other accessorial related services such as warehousing  customs brokerage  and value added handling services 
our fasi segment includes our pool distribution business and the related assets and liabilities purchased from usac  pinch and service express

revenue for forward air complete  our pick up and delivery service for the airport to airport network increased million in over due to increased customer utilization of the service 
also  net fuel surcharge revenue increased million in over primarily driven by the increase in tonnage and fuel prices during the second and third quarters of these increases were slightly offset by a million decrease in our base airport to airport revenue 
the increase in tonnage that transited our network was offset by a decrease in average revenue per pound before fuel surcharge and forward air complete revenues 
the increase in tonnage was primarily driven by the increased activity resulting from our acquisitions of pinch and black hawk in march and december  respectively  offset by the impact of the economic recession on our airport to airport network during the second half of  but most acutely in the fourth quarter of average revenue per pound before net fuel surcharge and forward air complete revenues decreased due to a shift in our business mix to shorter distance lower price per pound routes 
this shift was primarily the result of new business obtained with the pinch and black hawk acquisitions as well as increased business from international and domestic airlines 
logistics revenue  which is primarily truckload brokerage tlx and priced on a per mile basis  increased million  or  to million in the year ended december  from million in the year ended december  the increase in logistics revenue is the result of our continuing efforts as part of our completing the model strategic initiative to grow tlx and million in new revenue from service lines obtained through the pinch and black hawk acquisitions 
we continue to place emphasis on capturing a larger percentage of truckload opportunities and correspondingly increasing our access to sufficient truckload capacity through the expansion of our owner operator fleet and the use of third party transportation providers 
through these efforts  we increased the number of miles driven to support our tlx revenue by during the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  the average revenue per mile of our tlx product  including the impact of fuel surcharges  increased for the year ended december  versus the year ended december  the increase in revenue per mile is mainly attributable to increased fuel surcharges to offset increased fuel costs 
other revenue  which includes warehousing services and terminal handling  accounts for the final component of forward air operating revenue 
other revenue increased million to million for the year ended december   a increase from million for the year ended december  the increase was primarily due to increased cartage  handling and storage revenue due to new services offered through our recently expanded facilities 
the increased cartage revenue is also the result of new business obtained in conjunction with the pinch and black hawk acquisitions 
fasi fasi operating revenue increased million to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the increase in revenue is the result of additional activity from the pinch acquisition on march  and the service express acquisition on september  in addition  the year ended december  includes a full twelve months of revenue compared to only five months for the year ended december   as fasi began operations on july  in conjunction with the acquisition of usac 
intercompany eliminations intercompany eliminations of million are the result of truckload and airport to airport services forward air provided to fasi during the year ended december  fasi also provides cartage services to forward air 
purchased transportation purchased transportation increased by million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  as a percentage of total operating revenue  purchased transportation was during the year ended december  compared to for the year ended december forward air forward air s purchased transportation increased by million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the increase in purchased transportation is primarily attributable to an increase of approximately in miles driven in addition to a increase in the total cost per mile for the year ended december  versus the year ended december  as a percentage of segment operating revenue  forward air purchased transportation was during the year ended december  compared to for the year ended december  purchased transportation costs for our airport to airport network increased million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  for the year ended december   purchased transportation for our airport to airport network decreased to of airport to airport revenue from for the year ended december  the million increase is attributable to a increase in miles driven by our network of owner operators or third party transportation providers plus a increase in cost per mile 
the change in miles increased purchased transportation by million while the change in cost per mile increased purchased transportation million 
miles driven by our network of owner operators or third party transportation providers increased to support the increased revenue activity  mainly in the first half of as discussed above 
the increase in cost per mile is attributable to increased customer utilization of forward air complete mitigated by increased utilization of our network of owner operators as opposed to more costly third party transportation providers 
additionally  the increase in cost per mile was also offset by the increased use of company employed drivers 
the increase in the number of company employed drivers and their use in the airport to airport network is mainly a result of the pinch and black hawk acquisitions 
the cost for the company employed drivers is included in salaries  wages and benefits instead of purchased transportation 
purchased transportation costs for our logistics revenue increased million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  for the year ended december   logistics purchased transportation costs represented of logistics revenue versus for the year ended december  the increase is partially attributable to a million increase in costs associated with new logistics business obtained through the acquisition of pinch and black hawk 
the remaining increase is attributable to a increase in miles driven by our network of owner operators or third party transportation providers plus a increase in the related cost per mile 
miles driven by our network of owner operators or third party transportation providers increased to support our continuing efforts to grow our tlx business as discussed above  and accounted for million of the increase in logistics purchased transportation 
the change in the cost per mile increased the logistics purchased transportation by million 
the increase in cost per mile was mostly the result of increased rates from third party transportation providers mostly offset by increased use of our network of owner operators 
the decrease in logistics transportation as a percentage of revenue is the result of the favorable change in business mix as well as the addition of the new services from the pinch and black hawk acquisitions 
purchased transportation costs related to our other revenue increased million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  other purchased transportation costs as a percentage of other revenue decreased to of other revenue for the year ended december  from for the year ended december  the improvement in other purchased transportation costs as a percentage of other revenue is attributable to the use of company employed drivers to provide the transportation services associated with new business obtained from the pinch and black hawk acquisitions 
fasi fasi purchased transportation increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  fasi purchased transportation as a percentage of revenue was for the year ended december  compared to for the year ended december  the increase in purchased transportation is mainly due to our continued expansion of the fasi business through the acquisitions of pinch and service express in march and september  respectively 
in addition  the year ended includes a full twelve months of fasi activity compared to only five months for the year ended december   as fasi began operations on july  purchased transportation has increased as a percentage of fasi revenue mainly due to the increased use of owner operators particularly in conjunction with the acquisition of pinch 
intercompany eliminations intercompany eliminations increased to million and are the result of truckload and airport to airport services forward air provided to fasi during the year ended december  during the year ended december   fasi also provided cartage services to forward air 
salaries  wages  and benefits salaries  wages and employee benefits increased by million  or  to million in the year ended from million in the same period of as a percentage of total operating revenue  salaries  wages and employee benefits was during the year ended december  compared to for the same period in forward air salaries  wages and employee benefits of forward air increased by million  or  to million in the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  salaries  wages and employee benefits were of forward air s operating revenue in the year ended december  compared to for the year ended december  the increase in salaries  wages and employee benefits as a percentage of revenue was the result of increases in health insurance costs and share based compensation offset by decreases in workers compensation and employee incentive costs 
employee incentives decreased million  or as a percentage of revenue for the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  the decrease was due to a reduction of annual incentives for key employees due to failures to achieve performance goals 
during the fourth quarter of  salaries  wages and employee benefits were reduced by million as we reduced accruals for annual senior management incentives as annual earnings goals were not met 
comparatively  we increased salaries  wages and employee benefits by million during the fourth quarter of for annual incentives to senior management 
workers compensation costs decreased approximately million  or as a percentage of forward air operating revenue 
the year over year difference is primarily due to a million increase in our workers compensation loss reserves recorded in that resulted from an actuarial analysis 
the remaining decrease is due to reductions in our workers compensation loss reserves as a result of lower claims experience than projected in previous periods 
share based compensation increased million  or as a percentage of forward air operating revenue  due to the annual grants of stock options and non vested shares of common stock to key members of management and non employee directors from to the present 
health insurance costs increased million and as a percentage of forward air operating revenue 
the increase is driven by an increase in plan participants primarily as a result of our pinch and black hawk acquisitions in march and december  respectively 
the remaining increase in total dollars is attributable to the increased headcount of mainly terminal and company employed drivers associated with our acquisitions of pinch and black hawk 
fasi fasi salaries  wages and employee benefits increased to million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  the million increase is mainly attributable to the year ended including twelve months of expense while included only five months  as fasi was not operating until july  as a percentage of fasi operating revenue  salaries  wages and benefits increased to for the year ended december  compared to for the year ended december  fasi salaries  wages and employee benefits are higher as a percentage of operating revenue than our forward air segment  as a larger percentage of the transportation services are performed by company employed drivers as opposed to independent owner operators 
the increase in salaries  wages and employee benefits as a percentage of revenue is attributable to the acquisition of service express in september the terminals we acquired with the service express acquisition utilize a much higher percentage of contract labor for its dock personnel than used by preexisting fasi terminals 
contract labor is more expensive in the short term than company employed cargo handlers and dock personnel 
we will evaluate the proper utilization of contract labor in these terminals during the first quarter of operating leases operating leases increased by million  or  to million in the year ended december  from million in the year ended december  operating leases  the largest component of which is facility rent  were of consolidated operating revenue for the year ended december  compared with for the year ended december  forward air operating leases increased million and to million in the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  operating leases were of forward air operating revenue for the year ended december  compared with for the year ended december  the increase in operating leases in total dollars was attributable to million in higher facility rent expense associated with the assumption of additional facilities as a result of the pinch and black hawk acquisitions and the expansion of certain facilities 
operating leases also increased million for trailer and tractor leases assumed in conjunction with the acquisitions of pinch and black hawk 
fasi fasi operating lease expense increased million to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  approximately million of the increase was attributable to higher facility rent expense due to the increased number of terminals resulting from the pinch and service express acquisitions 
operating leases also increased million for trailer  tractor  and straight truck leases assumed in conjunction with the acquisitions of pinch and service express 
the increase in operating lease expense  both for facilities and equipment  is also attributable to the year ended including twelve months of lease expense while included only five months  as fasi was not operating until july  the increase in lease expense for tractors  straight trucks and trailers is the primary reason for the increase in operating leases as a percentage of revenue 
depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization increased million  or  to million in the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  depreciation and amortization was of consolidated operating revenue for the year ended december  compared with for the year ended december  forward air depreciation and amortization expense as a percentage of forward air operating revenue was in the year ended december  compared to for the year ended december  the increase in depreciation and amortization expense as a percentage of revenue is primarily due to a million  or as a percentage of revenue  increase in amortization expense for intangible assets associated with the acquisitions of pinch and black hawk 
the remaining increase represents depreciation on new forklifts and other miscellaneous equipment and assets 
fasi fasi depreciation and amortization increased million to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  depreciation and amortization expense as a percentage of fasi operating revenue was in the year ended december  compared to for the year ended december  the increase in depreciation and amortization expense as a percentage of revenue is partially due to a million  or as a percentage of revenue  increase in amortization expense for intangible assets associated with the service express  pinch and usac acquisitions 
the remainder of the increase is attributable to a full year of depreciation on assets acquired from usac and increased depreciation from tractors  trailers and other equipment assumed in conjunction with our acquisitions of pinch and service express 
insurance and claims insurance and claims expense increased million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  insurance and claims were of consolidated operating revenue during compared with in forward air insurance and claims as a percentage of forward air operating revenue was in the year ended december  compared to for the year ended december  the million and increase in insurance and claims for the year ended compared to the year ended december  is the result of increased insurance premiums resulting from the increased number of owner operators  company employed drivers  and rolling stock equipment in our fleet 
fasi fasi insurance and claims increased million to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  as a percentage of operating revenue  insurance and claims was for the year ended december  compared to for the year ended december  the decrease as a percentage of revenue is attributable to the increase in revenue outpacing the increase in claims and insurance premiums 
fuel expense fuel expense increased million  to million in the year ended december  from million in the year ended december  fuel expense was of consolidated operating revenue for the year ended december  compared with for the year ended december  forward air fuel expense was of forward air operating revenue in the year ended december  compared to in the year ended december  the million increase was primarily attributable to the increased number of company employed drivers and company owned or operated equipment as a result of the pinch and black hawk acquisitions in march and december  respectively 
also increasing fuel expense was the significant year over year increase in average diesel fuel prices during the second and third quarters of fasi fasi fuel expense increased million  to million in the year ended december  from million in the year ended december  fuel expenses were of fasi operating revenue in the year ended december  compared to for the year ended december  fasi fuel expense is significantly higher as a percentage of operating revenue than forward air s fuel expense  as fasi utilizes a higher ratio of company employed drivers and company owned or leased vehicles in its operations than forward air 
the increase in fasi fuel expense was attributable to the increase in owned and leased tractors assumed with the pinch and service express acquisitions 
the increase is also attributable to the year ended including a full year of fasi activity as opposed to only five months for also increasing fuel expense was the significant year over year increase in average diesel fuel prices during the second and third quarters of other operating expenses other operating expenses increased million  or  to million in the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  other operating expenses were of consolidated operating revenue for the year ended december  compared with in the same period of forward air other operating expenses were of forward air operating revenue in the year ended december  compared to for the year ended december  the decrease in other operating expenses as a percentage of operating revenue is the result of efforts to control discretionary costs by reducing expenses such as management training  marketing and travel 
in addition  during the year ended december  other operating expenses were reduced by million related to the reversal of previous accruals for fines and penalties associated with the settlement of a dispute with a state taxing authority 
the dispute was settled with the state taxing authority for less than the amount previously reserved 
fasi fasi other operating expenses increased million to million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  the million increase is mainly attributable to the year ended  including twelve months of expense while included only five months  as fasi was not operating until july  fasi other operating expenses for the year ended december  were of the segment s operating revenue compared to for the december  other operating expenses are higher as a percentage of revenue than our forward air segment due to the higher utilization of company owned or leased vehicles resulting in higher maintenance and related expenses 
income from operations income from operations decreased by million or  to million for the year ended december  compared with million for the year ended december  income from operations was of consolidated operating revenue for the year ended december  compared with for the year ended december  forward air income from operations increased by million  or  to million for the year ended december  compared with million for the year ended december  the increase in income from operations was primarily a result of increased revenues partially offset by increased costs for salaries  wages and benefits  operating leases and depreciation and amortization 
income from operations as a percentage of forward air operating revenue was for the year ended december  compared with for the year ended december  the decrease in income from operations as a percentage of revenue was the result of increasing volumes from our lower margin services  such as tlx  and declining airport to airport volumes mainly during the fourth quarter of due to the economic recession 
fasi fasi results from operations decreased approximately million to a million loss from operations for the year ended december  from income of operations of million for the year ended december  the decrease in fasi results from operations is mainly driven by integration costs that resulted from the march  acquisition of pinch 
these costs primarily impacted salaries  wages  and employee benefits  operating leases and other operating expenses 
the loss from operations as a percentage of fasi operating revenue was for the year ended december  compared with income from operations as a percentage of revenue for the year ended december  as discussed above  the pool distribution business is highly seasonal and as a result of the timing of the usac acquisition  our results primarily included peak seasonal activity 
consequently  our results were better than we would expect for a full year of operations  such as  which would include less positive results from the non peak periods of operations 
in addition  fasi s fourth quarter of income from operations of million was million less than the million of income from operations for the fourth quarter of this was primarily the result of lower peak season volumes than anticipated due to the current economic recession 
interest expense interest expense increased million to million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  the increase in interest expense was mostly the result of net borrowings under our line of credit facility used to fund our acquisitions of service express  pinch and black hawk in september  march and december  respectively 
these increases were net of a million reduction of interest expense resulting from the settlement of a dispute with a state taxing authority during the year ended december  the dispute was settled with the state taxing authority for less than the amount previously reserved 
other income  net other income  net was million for the year ended december  compared with million for the year ended december  the decrease in other income was attributable to reduced tax exempt interest income due to decreased average cash and investment balances as a result of cash used for the acquisition of usac in july and stock repurchases during the fourth quarter of provision for income taxes the combined federal and state effective tax rate for the year ended was compared to a rate of for the year ended december  our effective federal and state rate increased to provide for the decrease in tax exempt interest income as discussed above and the disallowance of share based compensation on qualified stock options 
however  during the year ended december  we reduced the provision for state income taxes by million  net of federal benefit  for the settlement of a dispute with a state taxing authority 
the dispute was settled with the state taxing authority for less than the previously reserved amount

during  we increased the number of miles driven to support our logistics revenue by 
the average revenue per mile of our logistics product  including the impact of fuel surcharges  decreased for versus the decrease in our revenue per mile is largely due to the weak shipping environment and the change in our business mix resulting from our efforts to capture additional truckload opportunities as well as utilizing truckload opportunities to cost effectively position our owner operators within our airport to airport network 
other revenue  which includes warehousing services and terminal handling increased million to million  a increase from million for the same period in the increase was primarily due to increased handling and storage revenue due to new services offered through our newly expanded facilities 
fasi fasi operating revenue of million represents revenue earned through our new pool distribution service acquired with the acquisition of certain assets and liabilities of usac on july  the pool distribution business is seasonal and operating revenues tend to be higher in the third and fourth quarters than the first and second quarters 
typically  this pattern is the result of factors such as national holidays  customer demand and economic conditions 
additionally  a significant portion of fasi s revenue is derived from customers whose business levels are impacted by the economy

a increase in miles driven for the airport to airport network accounted for million of the increase in airport to airport purchased transportation 
the increase in airport to airport miles was due to changes in forward air s shipping patterns during the first half of as a result of changes in business mix  such as increased shipments from our west coast terminals 
approximately million of the increase in airport to airport purchased transportation is attributable to a increase in cost per mile 
the increase in the cost per mile is the result of increased customer utilization of forward air complete  which was introduced during the second half of purchased transportation costs related to forward air s logistics revenue increased million  or  to million for from million for for  logistics purchased transportation costs represented of logistics revenue versus for during  forward air increased the number of miles driven to support logistics revenue by 
the increase in miles accounted for a million increase in logistics purchased transportation 
however  the increase in logistics purchased transportation due to miles was partially offset by a million decrease in logistics purchased transportation as a result of a decrease in the logistics cost per mile 
logistics cost per mile decreased due to increased capacity resulting in improved purchasing power from third party transportation providers and to a lesser extent increased use of our less costly owner operator network 
the increase in logistics purchased transportation costs as a percentage of revenue resulted from lower revenue per mile as discussed above partially offset by the decrease in our logistics cost per mile

net income as a result of the foregoing factors  net income decreased by million  or  to million for compared to million for discussion of critical accounting policies our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with united states generally accepted accounting principles gaap 
the preparation of financial statements in accordance with gaap requires our management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
our estimates and assumptions are based on historical experience and changes in the business environment 
however  actual results may differ from estimates under different conditions  sometimes materially 
critical accounting policies and estimates are defined as those that are both most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results and require management s most subjective judgments 
allowance for doubtful accounts we evaluate the collectibility of our accounts receivable based on a combination of factors 
in circumstances in which management is aware of a specific customer s inability to meet its financial obligations to us for example  bankruptcy filings or accounts turned over for collection or litigation  we record a specific reserve for these bad debts against amounts due to reduce the net recognized receivable to the amount we reasonably believe will be collected 
for all other customers  we recognize reserves for these bad debts based on the length of time the receivables are past due 
specifically  amounts that are days or more past due are reserved at for forward air and for fasi 
if circumstances change ie  we experience higher than expected defaults or an unexpected material adverse change in a customer s ability to meet its financial obligations to us  the estimates of the recoverability of amounts due to us could be changed by a material amount 
accounts are written off after all means of collection  including legal action  have been exhausted 
allowance for revenue adjustments our allowance for revenue adjustments consists of amounts reserved for billing rate changes that are not captured upon load initiation 
these adjustments generally arise i when the sales department contemporaneously grants small rate changes spot quotes to customers that differ from the standard rates in the system  ii when freight requires dimensionalization or is reweighed resulting in a different required rate  iii when billing errors occur  and iv when data entry errors occur 
when appropriate  permanent rate changes are initiated and reflected in the system 
we monitor the manual revenue adjustments closely through the employment of various controls that are in place to ensure that revenue recognition is not compromised and that fraud does not occur 
during  average revenue adjustments per month were approximately million  on average revenue per month of approximately million approximately of monthly revenue 
in order to estimate the allowance for revenue adjustments related to ending accounts receivable  we prepare an analysis that considers average monthly revenue adjustments and the average lag for identifying and quantifying these revenue adjustments 
based on this analysis  we establish an allowance for approximately days dependent upon experience in the last twelve months of average revenue adjustments  adjusted for rebates and billing errors 
the lag is periodically adjusted based on actual historical experience 
additionally  the average amount of revenue adjustments per month can vary in relation to the level of sales or based on other factors such as personnel issues that could result in excessive manual errors or in excessive spot quotes being granted 
both of these significant assumptions are continually evaluated for validity 
self insurance loss reserves given the nature of our operating environment  we are subject to vehicle and general liability  workers compensation and health insurance claims 
to mitigate a portion of these risks  we maintain insurance for individual vehicle and general liability claims exceeding million and workers compensation claims and health insurance claims exceeding approximately million  except in ohio  where we are a qualified self insured entity with an approximately million self insured retention 
the amount of self insurance loss reserves and loss adjustment expenses is determined based on an estimation process that uses information obtained from both company specific and industry data  as well as general economic information 
the estimation process for self insurance loss exposure requires management to continuously monitor and evaluate the life cycle of claims 
using data obtained from this monitoring and our assumptions about the emerging trends  management develops information about the size of ultimate claims based on its historical experience and other available market information 
the most significant assumptions used in the estimation process include determining the trend in loss costs  the expected consistency in the frequency and severity of claims incurred but not yet reported to prior year claims  changes in the timing of the reporting of losses from the loss date to the notification date  and expected costs to settle unpaid claims 
management also monitors the reasonableness of the judgments made in the prior year s estimation process referred to as a hindsight analysis and adjusts current year assumptions based on the hindsight analysis 
additionally  we utilize actuarial analysis to evaluate open vehicle liability and workers compensation claims and estimate the ongoing development exposure 
revenue recognition operating revenue and related costs are recognized as of the date shipments are completed 
the transportation rates we charge our customers consist of base transportation rates and fuel surcharge rates 
the revenues earned and related direct freight expenses incurred from our base transportation services are recognized on a gross basis in revenue and in purchased transportation 
transportation revenue is recognized on a gross basis as we are the primary obligor 
the fuel surcharges billed to customers and paid to owner operators and third party transportation providers are recorded on a net basis in revenue as we are not the primary obligor with regards to the fuel surcharges 
income taxes the company accounts for income taxes using the liability method  whereby deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on differences between financial reporting and tax basis of assets and liabilities and are measured using the enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when the differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
effective january   we adopted fin accordingly  we report a liability for unrecognized tax benefits resulting from uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
we recognize interest and penalties  if any  related to unrecognized tax benefits in interest expense and operating expenses  respectively 
valuation of goodwill in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas  we conduct an annual or more frequently if circumstances indicate possible impairment impairment test of goodwill for each reportable segment at the end of the second quarter of each year 
the tests are based on judgments regarding the market value of our common stock  ongoing profitability and cash flow of the reportable segments and underlying assets 
changes in strategy or market conditions could significantly impact these judgments and require adjustments to recorded asset balances 
for example  if we had reason to believe that our recorded goodwill had become impaired due to decreases in the fair market value of the underlying business  we would have to take a charge to income for that portion of goodwill that we believe is impaired 
the annual impairment test was conducted and it did not result in any impairment charges 
in addition  at december   we considered whether any impairment indicators existed and no impairment charges were incurred 
share based compensation prior to january   as permitted by sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation sfas  as amended by sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure  we accounted for share based payments to employees using accounting principles board apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees 
as such  we generally recognized no compensation cost for employee stock options as options granted had exercise prices equal to the fair market value of our common stock on the date of grant 
we also recorded no compensation expense in connection with our employee stock purchase plan as the purchase price of the stock paid by employees was not less than of the fair market value of our common stock at the beginning and at the end of each purchase period 
effective january   we adopted sfas no 
r  share based payment sfas r and elected the modified prospective transition method 
under the modified prospective transition method  awards that are granted  modified  repurchased or canceled after the date of adoption should be measured and accounted for in accordance with sfas r 
share based awards that are granted prior to the effective date should continue to be valued in accordance with sfas and stock option expense for unvested options must be recognized in the statement of income 
on december   our board of directors accelerated the vesting of all of our outstanding and unvested stock options awarded to employees  officers and non employee directors under our stock option award plans 
as a result of the acceleration of the vesting of our outstanding and unvested options in  the company recognized million of stock based compensation in  but there was no additional compensation expense recognized during the years ended december   and related to options granted prior to january  our general practice has been to make a single annual grant to key employees and to generally make other grants only in connection with new employment or promotions 
in addition  we make annual grants to non employee directors in conjunction with their annual election to our board of directors or at the time of their appointment to the board of directors 
prior to the implementation of sfas r  we utilized stock options as our sole form of share based awards 
during the year ended december   we granted non vested shares of common stock non vested shares to key employees  but returned to granting stock options during the year ended december  we returned to granting stock options to key employees  as we believe stock options more closely link long term compensation with our long term goals 
for non employee directors  we continued to issue non vested shares during the year ended december  stock options granted during the years ended december  and expire seven years from the grant date and vest ratably over a three year period 
the share based compensation for these stock options will be recognized  net of estimated forfeitures  ratably over the requisite service period  or vesting period 
based on our historical experience  forfeitures have been estimated 
we used the black scholes option pricing model to estimate the grant date fair value of options granted during the years ended december  and the fair value of non vested shares issued to employees during and non employee directors during  and were estimated using opening market prices for the business day of the grant 
the share based compensation for the non vested shares is recognized  net of estimated forfeitures  ratably over the requisite service period or vesting period 
forfeitures have been estimated based on our historical experience  but will be adjusted for future changes in forfeiture experience 
we estimate the forfeitures of dividends paid on non vested shares and record expense for the estimated forfeitures in accordance with sfas r 
under the espp  which has been approved by shareholders  we are authorized to issue shares of common stock to our employees 
these shares may be issued at a price equal to of the lesser of the market value on the first day or the last day of each six month purchase period 
common stock purchases are paid for through periodic payroll deductions and or up to two large lump sum contributions 
as the espp does not qualify as non compensatory under the requirements of sfas r  we recognize share based compensation on the date of purchase based on the difference between the purchase date fair market value and the employee purchase price 
sfas r also requires companies to calculate an initial pool of excess tax benefits available at the adoption date to absorb any unused deferred tax assets that may be recognized under sfas r 
the pool includes the net excess tax benefits that would have been recognized if we had adopted sfas for recognition purposes on its effective date 
we have elected to calculate the pool of excess tax benefits under the alternative transition method described in financial accounting standards board fasb staff position no 
fas r  transition election related to accounting for tax effects of share based payment awards  which also specifies the method we must use to calculate excess tax benefits reported on the statement of cash flows

sfas defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value in generally accepted accounting principles  and expands disclosures about fair value measurements 
in february  the fasb issued fasb staff position fas  effective date of fasb statement no 
which delayed the effective date of sfas for all non financial assets and liabilities  except those that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis  until january  we adopted sfas on january  for all financial assets and liabilities  but the implementation did not have a significant impact on our financial position or results of operations 
we have not fully determined the impact the implementation of sfas will have on our non financial assets and liabilities  which are not recognized or disclosed on a recurring basis 
however  we do not anticipate that the full adoption of sfas will significantly impact our consolidated financial statements 
during february  the fasb issued sfas no 
 the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities including an amendment of fasb statement no 
sfas  which permits entities to choose to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value 
the objective of sfas is to improve financial reporting by providing entities with the opportunity to mitigate volatility in reported earnings caused by measuring related assets and liabilities differently without having to apply complex hedge accounting provisions 
we adopted sfas on january   but did not elect the fair value measurement for any new assets or liabilities 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
revised  business combinations sfas r 
sfas r establishes principles and requirements for how an acquirer recognizes and measures in its financial statements the identifiable assets acquired  the liabilities assumed  any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree and the goodwill acquired 
sfas r also establishes disclosure requirements to enable the evaluation of the nature and financial effects of the business combination 
this statement is effective for us beginning january  the impact of sfas r will depend on the nature of any business combinations subsequent to january  in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
 noncontrolling interests in consolidated financial statements an amendment of accounting research bulletin no 
sfas 
sfas establishes accounting and reporting standards for ownership interests in subsidiaries held by parties other than the parent  the amount of consolidated net income attributable to the parent and to the noncontrolling interest  changes in a parent s ownership interest  and the valuation of retained noncontrolling equity investments when a subsidiary is deconsolidated 
sfas also establishes disclosure requirements that clearly identify and distinguish between the interests of the parent and the interests of the noncontrolling owners 
this statement is effective for us beginning january  the adoption of sfas will not have a significant impact on our financial position  results of operations and cash flows as we do not have any noncontrolling interests 
liquidity and capital resources we have historically financed our working capital needs  including capital expenditures  with cash flows from operations and borrowings under our bank lines of credit 
net cash provided by operating activities totaled approximately million for the year ended december  compared to approximately million for the year ended december  the million decrease in cash provided by operating activities for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  is mainly attributable to increased estimated income tax payments and prepaid expenses  such as rent  offset by increased cash from operations after non cash items 
the increase in cash paid for income taxes was the result of increased earnings expectations during which were mainly driven by our and acquisitions 
earnings shortfalls from expectations resulted in overpayment of income taxes and income tax receivable balances at december  the increase in prepaid assets was the result of increased activity  such as prepaid insurance premiums  attributable to our and acquisitions 
improvement in cash collected from accounts receivable was mostly offset by increases in cash payments to vendors for operating expenses 
net cash used in investing activities was approximately million for the year ended december  compared with approximately million used in investing activities during the year ended december  investing activities during the year ended december  consisted primarily of the acquisition of certain assets and liabilities of service express and pinch as well as capital expenditures  most of which were for our new terminal in dallas fort worth  texas

net cash provided by financing activities totaled approximately million for the year ended december  compared with approximately million used in financing activities for the year ended december  the change in cash provided by financing activities was primarily attributable to million reduction in share repurchases from to  net of a reduction in net borrowings under our line of credit in compared to current year net borrowings from our line of credit were used to partially fund the acquisitions of service express and pinch
