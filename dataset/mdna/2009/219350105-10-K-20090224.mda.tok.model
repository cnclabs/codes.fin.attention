item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations organization of information management s discussion and analysis provides a historical and prospective narrative on the company s financial condition and results of operations 
this discussion includes the following sections overview results of operations operating segments liquidity and capital resources environment critical accounting estimates new accounting standards forward looking statements overview corning delivered improved operating results for the full year of although results for the first and second half of the year were dramatically different 
in the first half of  our performance reflected strength in the majority of our segments while the downturn in global economic activity and disruption in the financial markets negatively impacted our performance in the second half 
declines in consumer retail markets caused a significant decrease in demand for products of our display and environmental technologies segments 
during  the company responded to the economic conditions that have affected demand for our products by scaling back manufacturing operations  curbing the rate of growth in research  development and engineering expenses  reducing capital spending  and reducing operating costs 
in january corning announced restructuring charges in the range of million to million primarily for costs associated with workforce reductions that will take place in corning s strategy to grow through global innovation while preserving our financial independence has served us well 
our key priorities for were unchanged from the previous three years protect our financial health  improve our profitability  and invest in the future 
we made significant progress on these priorities in financial health despite the uncertainty in the global economic environment  our financial position remained sound and we delivered strong cash flows from operating activities 
significant items in included the following our debt to capital ratio of reflected an improvement from at december   resulting primarily from solid earnings and the impact of certain tax related items 
operating cash flow for the year was billion which was more than our billion of capital spending 
we ended the year with billion of cash and short term investments 
profitability for the year ended december   we generated net income of billion or per share compared to net income of billion or per share for when compared to last year  the billion improvement in net income was due largely to the following items certain tax adjustments totaling billion which included the release of billion of valuation allowances resulting from a change in judgment about the realizability of us deferred tax assets in future years and the release of million of valuation allowances resulting from a change in estimate regarding current year us taxable income a credit to asbestos litigation expense of million in reflecting the change in the estimate of our asbestos litigation liability compared to expense of million last year 
in the first quarter of  corning reduced its liability for asbestos litigation by million as a result of the increase in the likelihood of a settlement under recently proposed terms and a corresponding decrease in the likelihood of a settlement under terms established in for additional information on this matter  refer to note investments to the consolidated financial statements and item legal proceedings 
higher net income in the display technologies segment driven by a stronger japanese yen and improvements in equity earnings from samsung corning precision  our equity affiliate located in korea 

table of contents investing in our future we continue to focus on the future and on what we do best creating and making keystone components that enable high technology systems 
we remain committed to investing in research  development  and engineering to drive innovation 
in  approximately one third of our total research  development and engineering expenditures was for research and new business development 
this spending related to our existing businesses  new business development  exploratory research  and early stage marketing 
we continue to work on technologies for glass substrates for active matrix lcds  diesel filters and substrates in response to tightening emissions control standards  and the optical fiber and cable and hardware and equipment that will enable fiber to the premises 
we continue to make investments in promising technologies such as the epic system  synthetic green lasers  silicon on glass  microreactors  thin film photovoltaics  and mercury abatement 
our research  development and engineering expenditures increased by million in when compared to but remained fairly constant as a percentage of net sales 
the largest driver of increased spending was for the development of new businesses 
we believe our spending levels are adequate to support our technology and innovation strategies 
our capital expenditures have been primarily focused on expanding manufacturing capacity in the display technologies segment in anticipation of a larger display market in and growing demand for corning s gorilla glass  an optical quality glass that is optimized for high end portable devices and touch screens 
in december  we announced a year capital expenditure plan to locate a glass manufacturing facility at sharp corporation s plant in sakai city  japan 
in february  we announced a million expansion of our lcd manufacturing facility in taichung  taiwan 
given the dramatic changes to the global economic landscape and resulting decline in demand for our products  we have stopped further expansion in taiwan 
we have  however  continued to advance our project in sakai city to align with sharp corporation s progress on their adjoining facility 
higher precious metals prices also impacted the growth in capital spending 
total capital expenditures for were billion  of which billion was directed toward our display technologies segment and million was invested in our environmental technologies segment 
we expect our capital spending to be about billion 
approximately million will be directed toward our display technologies segment  of which about million relates to construction completed in corporate outlook for  we believe our sales and profitability will continue to be negatively impacted by the global economic recession 
the restructuring plan we announced in january sizes the company to be profitable at a billion sales level 
although the current run rate of our sales is about billion  we believe that billion of sales is possible assuming the supply chain contraction in our display technologies segment ends by the second quarter of if we do not see an increase in our sales by the second quarter  we will take additional restructuring actions 
during these difficult economic times  the company is focused on three priorities preserving cash  restructuring the company to be profitable at a lower sales level  and accelerating new products while maintaining our emphasis on research and development investments for longer term growth 
although there is much uncertainty as we head into  we are confident about our financial health and the strength of our balance sheet 
we remain confident that our strategy to grow through global innovation while preserving our financial stability will enable our continued long term success

restructuring  impairment  and other charges and credits corning recorded restructuring  impairment  and other charges and credits in and in which affect the comparability of our results for the periods presented 
a description of those charges follows restructuring actions in the fourth quarter of  we recorded million of severance costs primarily for a restructuring plan in the telecommunications segment 
impairment charge for assets held for use in  we recorded an asset held for use impairment charge of million to impair certain long lived assets of our telecommunications segment in accordance with statement of financial accounting standard sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets sfas 
due to our lowered long term outlook for this business  we determined that an event of impairment  as defined by sfas  had occurred in that business  which further required us to test this asset group for impairment 
we assess recoverability of the carrying value of long lived assets at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities 
we estimated the fair value of the long lived assets for this business using a discounted expected cash flow approach as a measure of fair value 
as a result of our impairment evaluation  we recorded an impairment charge to write down the asset group to its estimated fair value 
asbestos litigation in the first quarter of  corning recorded a credit to asbestos litigation expense of million as a result of the increase in likelihood of a settlement under the amended pcc plan and a corresponding decrease in the likelihood of a settlement under the plan 
for the remainder of  corning recorded net credit adjustments of million to reflect the change in value of the estimated liability under an amended pcc plan 
the liability for the amended pcc plan and the non pcc asbestos claims was estimated to be million at december   compared with an estimate of liability under the original plan of billion at december  the entire obligation is classified as a non current liability as installment payments for the cash portion of the obligation are not planned to commence until more than months after the amended pcc plan is ultimately confirmed and the pce portion of the obligation will be fulfilled through the direct contribution of corning s investment in pce currently recorded as a non current other equity method investment

provision for income taxes our benefit provision for income taxes and the related effective income tax rates were as follows in millions years ended december  benefit provision for income taxes effective income tax benefit rate the effective income tax benefit rate for differed from the us statutory rate of primarily due to the following items the release of billion of valuation allowances attributable to a change in judgment about the realizability of us deferred tax assets in future years  described below  the impact of not recording net tax expense on income generated in the us  the benefit of tax holidays and investment and other credits in foreign jurisdictions  and a million benefit related to a favorable tax settlement with the canadian revenue agency 
the effective income tax rates for and differed from the us statutory rate of primarily due to the following items the impact of not recording net tax expense on income generated in the us  the release of valuation allowances on foreign deferred tax assets  and the benefit of tax holidays in foreign jurisdictions 
prior to  we recorded valuation allowances against our entire us deferred tax assets as a result of significant losses in the us in both and  we generated income from continuing operations in the us the tax expense on such income was fully offset by the tax benefit of releasing a portion of the valuation allowance to reflect the realization of deferred taxes resulting from the generation of us income 
in  we concluded that it was more likely than not that we will realize substantially all of our us deferred tax assets because we expect to generate sufficient levels of income in the us as a result  we released billion of valuation allowances on our us deferred tax assets in the second quarter of we considered all available evidence  both positive and negative  to determine whether  based on the weight of that evidence  a valuation allowance was needed 
the evaluation of the realizability of deferred tax assets is inherently subjective 
following are the key items that provided positive evidence to support the release of the valuation allowance for a large portion of our deferred tax assets in the second quarter of 
table of contents positive pre tax income in the us for the first half of and the preceding year 
the impact of positive results in the display technologies operating segment and the royalty income generated from the foreign locations in this segment 
a significant factor in our forecasts of future us tax profitability is the amount of assumed royalties to be paid by our display technologies subsidiaries to the us parent company 
the number of years remaining to utilize our net operating loss carryforwards 
corning has approximately years remaining to utilize the majority of our net operating loss carryforwards 
increased confidence in our longer term forecasted income levels which were supported by detailed sensitivity analyses 
our five year planning process which is completed annually in the second quarter  considered a number of possible scenarios which support the future realization of our us deferred tax assets 
in accordance with sfas  in the second half of we utilized a portion of the remaining valuation allowance to offset us income tax expense or benefit that would otherwise have been recorded on income or losses in the us in and therefore  reflected no net us income tax expense 
in the third and fourth quarters of  we released an additional million and million  respectively  of valuation allowances on our us deferred tax assets as a result of a change in our estimate of current year us taxable income 
in  we will begin providing us income tax expense or benefit on earnings losses 
in   and  we generated income from continuing operations in the us the tax expense on such income was fully offset by the tax benefit of releasing a portion of our existing valuation allowance to reflect the realization of deferred taxes resulting from the generation of us income 
the impact of the release of the valuation allowances  and thus not recording tax expense on income generated in the us  was a reduction in our effective tax rate of for and for both and certain shorter lived deferred tax assets such as those represented by capital loss carry forwards and state tax net operating loss carry forwards  as well as other federal and state tax credits  will remain with a valuation allowance recorded against them as of december   because we cannot conclude that it is more likely than not that we will earn income of the character required to utilize these assets before they expire 
the amount of us and foreign deferred tax assets that have valuation allowances at december  was million 
we do not provide income taxes on the post earnings of domestic subsidiaries that we expect to recover tax free without significant cost 
income taxes have been provided for post unremitted earnings of domestic corporate joint ventures that we do not expect to recover tax free 
unremitted earnings of domestic subsidiaries and corporate joint ventures that arose in fiscal years beginning on or before december  have been indefinitely reinvested 
we currently provide us income taxes on the earnings of foreign subsidiaries and affiliated companies to the extent these earnings are currently taxable or expected to be remitted 
as of december   us taxes have not been provided on approximately billion of accumulated foreign unremitted earnings which are expected to remain invested indefinitely 
in  we recorded valuation allowances against our entire german and australian deferred tax assets due to losses in recent years 
in  due to sustained profitability and positive earnings projections for our overall german operations  we concluded that it is more likely than not that the german national deferred tax assets are realizable and that the related valuation allowance was no longer required 
in  due to sustained profitability and positive earnings projections in australia and at certain of our german operations  we concluded that it was more likely than not that a portion of the german local and the entire australian deferred tax assets were realizable and that the related valuation allowances were no longer required 
the impact of the releases of the valuation allowances on our effective rate is a reduction in the rate of and for and  respectively 
certain foreign subsidiaries in china and taiwan are or were operating under tax holiday arrangements 
the nature and extent of such arrangements vary  and the benefits of such arrangements phase out in years to according to the specific terms and schedules of the relevant taxing jurisdictions 
the impact of the tax holidays on our effective rate is a reduction in the rate of   and  for   and  respectively

table of contents equity in earnings of affiliated companies  net of impairments the following provides a summary of equity earnings of affiliated companies  net of impairments in millions years ended december  samsung corning precision dow corning samsung corning all other total equity earnings the and increases in equity earnings of affiliated companies  net of impairments  reflected strong sales and earnings performance at samsung corning precision and at dow corning when compared to the previous years 
the change in equity earnings from samsung corning precision is explained in the discussion of the performance of the display technologies segment and in all other 
dow corning s performance was driven by sales growth in its traditional silicone product lines and in polysilicones for the semiconductor and solar energy industries 
dow corning sales grew in with the largest growth at hemlock semiconductor  dow corning s consolidated joint venture that makes high purity polycrystalline for the semiconductor and solar energy industries 
sales of dow corning s traditional silicone product lines were also higher when compared to last year 
net income at dow corning  and corning s resulting equity earnings from dow corning  increased in when compared to  reflecting the growth in net sales along with the positive impact from both a change in depreciation method and a change in the useful lives of certain fixed assets  offset in part by an other than temporary impairment for certain securities of fannie mae and freddie mac 
our share of this impairment was million 
although dow corning s full year results increased year over year  sales and earnings declined significantly in the fourth quarter when compared to the first three quarters of the year as demand in its silicone product lines fell dramatically 
in  dow corning s sales grew approximately when compared with the prior year due to growth in net sales from both their silicone and polysilicone product lines 
equity earnings from dow corning in were up when compared to due to the increase in sales offset in part by the non repeat of a million favorable irs settlement 
in  dow corning reached a settlement with the irs regarding liabilities for tax years to equity earnings reflected a million gain as a result of the settlement which resolved all federal tax issues related to dow corning s implant settlement 
sales at dow corning are expected to be lower in when compared to  driven by lower sales of silicone products offset somewhat by an increase in sales at hemlock semiconductor 
consequently  dow corning s net income  and corning s equity in earnings from dow corning  is expected to be lower as well

table of contents operating segments effective january   corning changed its internal reporting structure to better reflect the company s focus on new business development and later stage research projects and to provide more transparency on our specialty materials operating segment 
as a result  our segment reporting includes the following changes which are in accordance with sfas  disclosures about segments of an enterprise and related information we have provided separate financial information for the specialty materials operating segment 
this operating segment was previously included in all other 
certain later stage development projects  such as microreactors and green lasers  now meet the criteria for operating segments and are included in all other 
spending for these projects was previously part of exploratory research and was reported in the reconciliation of reportable segment net income to total net income 
certain other new product lines now meet the criteria for operating segments and are included in all other 
spending related to these businesses was previously included in our life sciences and display technologies operating segments 
our reportable operating segments are now as follows display technologies manufactures liquid crystal display glass for flat panel displays 
telecommunications manufactures optical fiber and cable and hardware and equipment components for the telecommunications industry 
environmental technologies manufactures ceramic substrates and filters for automotive and diesel applications 
this reportable operating segment is an aggregation of our automotive and diesel operating segments as these two segments share similar economic characteristics  products  customer types  production processes and distribution methods 
specialty materials manufactures products that provide more than material formulations for glass  glass ceramics and fluoride crystals to meet demand for unique customer needs 
life sciences manufactures glass and plastic consumables for scientific applications 
all other operating segments that do not meet the quantitative threshold for separate reporting have been grouped as all other 
this group is primarily comprised of development projects and results for new product lines 
we prepared the financial results for our reportable segments on a basis that is consistent with the manner in which we internally disaggregate financial information to assist in making internal operating decisions 
we included the earnings of equity affiliates that are closely associated with our operating segments in the respective segment s net income 
we have allocated certain common expenses among segments differently than we would for stand alone financial information prepared in accordance with gaap 
segment net income may not be consistent with measures used by other companies 
the accounting policies of our reportable segments are the same as those applied in the consolidated financial statements

net sales income before equity earnings equity earnings of affiliated companies net income vs 
the net sales increase for the display technologies segment in resulted from a slight improvement in volume measured in square feet of glass sold along with a million positive impact from movements in foreign exchange rates  offset by price declines of when compared to net sales of this segment are denominated in japanese yen and  as a result  are susceptible to movements in the us dollar japanese yen exchange rate 
in the first half of  glass volume of this segment increased by  when compared to the same period in driven by lcd television market growth and demand for lcd monitors and notebook computers 
because corning sells to panel makers and not to end market consumers  supply chain expansion and contraction for this industry is a key factor in corning s volume 
during  the lcd glass market underwent a supply chain contraction in the second half of the year that worsened as global economic conditions deteriorated and demand rapidly declined 
consequently  in the second half of  our lcd glass volume declined by when compared to the second half of the largest decline in our glass volume occurred in the fourth quarter when volume fell about when compared to the prior year 

table of contents the overall lcd glass market grew approximately in growth rates by region differed dramatically  resulting in volume in our wholly owned business increasing only while volume at samsung corning precision in korea increased compared to the lower growth rate in our wholly owned business was caused in part by a decline in volume in taiwan  particularly in the second half of the year  reflecting a number of key market dynamics 
first  taiwanese panel makers do not have as strong of brand recognition with consumers as do korean and japanese panel makers 
in addition  a number of taiwanese panel makers provide capacity to customers that also produce their own lcd panels  and as demand has slowed  purchases of this excess capacity have declined 
fluctuating exchange rates also appear to have made korean panel makers more competitive during the industry downturn 
finally  we believe the taiwanese panel makers had to reduce production to align their inventory levels with lower demand 
when compared to the prior year  income before equity earnings for was down primarily due to lower volume and price declines  offset somewhat by the positive impact of movements in foreign exchange rates  and strong manufacturing performance earlier in the year 
during the first half of  operating performance benefited from manufacturing facilities that were running at or near capacity 
as demand leveled off in the third quarter and then sharply declined in the fourth quarter  we temporarily idled certain production assets 
these actions resulted in accelerated depreciation for glass tanks that were taken out of production earlier than planned 
by the end of  more than half of the manufacturing capacity in our wholly owned business was temporarily idled 
this capacity is expected to be brought back on line when demand increases which could be as early as the second quarter of equity earnings from samsung corning precision s lcd business for increased by when compared to due to volume gains of  improved manufacturing performance  and the positive impact of movements in foreign exchange rates offset somewhat by price declines of 
samsung corning precision experienced a similar  but less severe  decline in second half performance 
at the end of  samsung corning precision had idled approximately of its capacity 
equity earnings for were positively impacted by approximately million due to movements in foreign exchange rates when compared to equity earnings from samsung corning precision are impacted by movements in both the us dollar japanese yen and us dollar korean won exchange rates 
the display technologies segment has a concentrated customer base comprised of lcd panel and color filter makers primarily located in japan and taiwan 
for  auo  chi mei optoelectronics corporation  and sharp corporation  which individually accounted for more than of segment net sales  accounted for of total segment sales when combined 
in addition  samsung corning precision s sales are concentrated across a small number of its customers 
in  sales to two lcd panel makers located in korea samsung electronics co  ltd 
and lg phillips lcd co  ltd 
accounted for approximately of samsung corning precision sales 
vs 
the net sales increase for reflected volume gains of offset somewhat by price declines of when compared to volume gains were driven by increased lcd monitor demand  continued demand for glass for notebook computers  and lcd television market growth 
the impact of foreign exchange rate movements on this segment s net sales was not material in when compared to when compared with  income before equity earnings for was up significantly due to higher net sales  lower manufacturing costs  and an increase in royalty income from samsung corning precision 
equity earnings for increased by when compared to due to volume gains of at samsung corning precision offset by price declines of and increased operating and royalty expenses 
the impact of foreign exchange rate movements on equity earnings was not material in when compared to other information corning has invested heavily to expand capacity to meet the demand for lcd glass substrates 
in and  capital spending in this segment was billion and million  respectively 
we expect capital spending for to be approximately million of which million relates to construction completed in corning licenses certain of its patents and know how to samsung corning precision  as well as to third parties  which generates royalty income 
refer to note investments to the consolidated financial statements for more information about royalty income from samsung corning precision and related party transactions 

table of contents in and  several of corning s customers entered into long term purchase and supply agreements in which corning s display technologies segment would supply large size glass substrates to these customers over periods of up to six years 
as part of the agreements  these customers agreed to advance cash deposits to corning for a portion of the contracted glass to be purchased 
we received our last deposit of million in july and do not expect to receive additional deposits related to these agreements 
in  we received million of customer deposits 
during   and  we issued million  million  and million  respectively  in credits that were applied to customer receivable balances when payments were due 
in the event customers do not purchase the agreed upon quantities of product  subject to specific conditions outlined in the agreements  corning may retain certain amounts of the customer deposits 
if corning does not deliver agreed upon product quantities  subject to specific conditions outlined in the agreements  corning may be required to return certain amounts of our customers deposits 
refer to note other liabilities to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 
outlook we expect the display technologies segment to continue to be impacted by the global recession 
in the first quarter of  we expect the supply chain contraction to continue and volume to be down in the range of to compared to the fourth quarter of we also expect price declines in the high single digits 
as part of the corporate wide restructuring plan  we will reduce our worldwide workforce in this segment in the first quarter 
with continued growth in demand at retail  we anticipate significant volume improvement in the second quarter of and we anticipate the rate of price declines will return to more normal levels 
we expect the overall lcd glass market in will be flat with  resulting from an increase in demand for lcd televisions and notebook computers offset by falling demand for lcd monitors 
in addition  we expect regional mix shifts as described above may cause an increase in volume at samsung corning precision with a corresponding decrease in volume for corning s wholly owned business 
although the lcd supply chain has been impacted by the current global recession  we believe that the long term drivers of this market  specifically increased penetration of lcd into the total television market  increased screen size and increased televisions per household  remain intact 
the end market demand for lcd televisions  monitors and notebooks is dependent on consumer retail spending  among other things 
we are cautious about the potential negative impacts that economic conditions  particularly the global economic recession  and world political tensions could have on consumer demand 
while the industry has grown rapidly in recent years  economic volatility along with consumer preferences for panels of differing sizes  prices  or other factors may lead to pauses in market growth 
therefore  it is possible that glass manufacturing capacity may exceed demand from time to time 
in addition  changes in foreign exchange rates  principally the japanese yen  will continue to impact the sales and profitability of this segment 
if we do not experience the expected recovery in volume in the second quarter  we may incur further charges to reduce our workforce and consolidate capacity

the reconciliation of this non gaap measure is included in the table above 
net income in increased when compared to due to improvements in segment sales  cost reductions  the impact of the million gain on the sale of the european submarine cabling business  and the absence of an impairment charge which totaled million in a favorable mix for optical fiber and cable products also contributed to improvements in segment net income

table of contents cash flows summary of cash flow data years ended december  net cash provided by operating activities net cash used in investing activities net cash used in provided by financing activities vs 
as the significant increase in net income was largely driven by two non cash items  operating cash increased only slightly when compared to the two non cash items were the release of billion of deferred tax asset valuation allowances and a million reduction in asbestos related liabilities 
in addition  cash from operating activities benefited from slower growth in working capital  higher dividends from equity affiliates  and lower contributions for retirement related benefits compared to these benefits were partially offset by an increase in taxes paid and customer deposit credits issued 
net cash used in investing activities in increased when compared to the previous year due to a million increase in capital spending largely attributable to higher spending in the display technologies segment and a smaller reduction in short term investments compared to net cash used in financing activities was higher when compared to the previous year due to an increase in repurchases of common stock and an increase in dividends paid 
corning began paying a quarterly dividend of per share in the third quarter of vs 
net cash from operating activities in increased when compared to due primarily to higher earnings after adjusting for noncash items and increased dividends from equity affiliates

off balance sheet arrangements off balance sheet arrangements are transactions  agreements  or other contractual arrangements with an unconsolidated entity for which corning has an obligation to the entity that is not recorded in our consolidated financial statements 
corning s off balance sheet arrangements include the following guarantee contracts that require applying the provisions of fasb interpretation no 
 guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others fin 
variable interests held in certain unconsolidated entities 
fin requires a company  at the time a guarantee is issued  to recognize a liability for the fair value or market value of the obligation it assumes 
in the normal course of our business  we do not routinely provide significant third party guarantees 
generally  third party guarantees provided by corning are limited to certain financial guarantees  including stand by letters of credit and performance bonds  and the incurrence of contingent liabilities in the form of purchase price adjustments related to attainment of milestones 
these guarantees have various terms  and none of these guarantees are individually significant 

table of contents refer to note commitments  contingencies  and guarantees to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 
corning leases certain transportation equipment from three trusts that qualify as variable interest entities under fasb interpretation r  consolidation of variable interest entities  an interpretation of accounting research bulletin no 
fin r 
the sole purpose of these entities is to lease transportation equipment to corning 
for variable interest entities  we assess the terms of our interest in each entity to determine if we are the primary beneficiary as prescribed by fin r 
the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity is the party that absorbs a majority of the entity s expected losses  receives a majority of its expected residual returns  or both  as a result of holding variable interests  which are the ownership  contractual  or other pecuniary interests in an entity that change with changes in the fair value of the entity s net assets excluding variable interests 
corning has performed the required fin r assessments and has identified three entities as being variable interest entities 
none of these entities are considered to be significant to corning s consolidated statements of position 
corning does not have retained interests in assets transferred to an unconsolidated entity that serve as credit  liquidity or market risk support to that entity

amounts above are stated at their maturity value 
at december   million of the million represents imputed interest 
the estimate of interest payments assumes interest is paid through the date of maturity expiration of the related debt  based upon stated rates in the respective debt instruments 
at december   million was included on our balance sheet related to uncertain tax positions 
of this amount  we are unable to estimate when million of that amount will become payable 
we have provided financial guarantees and contingent liabilities in the form of stand by letters of credit and performance bonds  some of which do not have fixed or scheduled expiration dates 
we have agreed to provide a credit facility related to dow corning discussed in note investments and note commitments  contingencies  and guarantees to the consolidated financial statements 
the funding of the dow corning credit facility will be required only if dow corning is not otherwise able to meet its scheduled funding obligations in its confirmed bankruptcy plan 
we believe the significant majority of these guarantees and contingent liabilities will expire without being funded 

table of contents environment we have been named by the environmental protection agency under the superfund act  or by state governments under similar state laws  as a potentially responsible party for active hazardous waste sites 
under the superfund act  all parties who may have contributed any waste to a hazardous waste site  identified by such agency  are jointly and severally liable for the cost of cleanup unless the agency agrees otherwise 
it is our policy to accrue for the estimated liability related to superfund sites and other environmental liabilities related to property owned and operated by us based on expert analysis and continual monitoring by both internal and external consultants 
at december  and  we had accrued approximately million undiscounted and million undiscounted  respectively  for the estimated liability for environmental cleanup and related litigation 
based upon the information developed to date  we believe that the accrued amount is a reasonable estimate of our liability and that the risk of an additional loss in an amount materially higher than that accrued is remote 
critical accounting estimates the preparation of financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect amounts reported therein 
the estimates  including future projections of performance and relevant discount rates  that required us to make difficult  subjective or complex judgments follow 
impairment of assets held for use sfas requires us to assess the recoverability of the carrying value of long lived assets when an event of impairment has occurred 
we must exercise judgment in assessing whether an event of impairment has occurred 
for purposes of recognition and measurement of an impairment loss  a long lived asset or assets is grouped with other assets and liabilities at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities 
we must exercise judgment in assessing the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities 
in certain circumstances  we concluded that locations or businesses which share production along the supply chain must be combined in order to appropriately identify cash flows that are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities 
once it has been determined that an impairment has occurred  an impairment assessment requires the exercise of judgment in assessing the future use of and projected value to be derived from the impaired assets to be held and used 
this may require judgment in estimating future cash flows and relevant discount rates and terminal values in estimating the current fair value of the impaired assets to be held and used 
restructuring charges and impairments resulting from restructuring actions sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities  requires us to assess whether and when a restructuring event has occurred and in which periods charges related to such events should be recognized 
we must estimate costs of plans to restructure including  for example  employee termination costs 
restructuring charges require us to exercise judgment about the expected future of our businesses  of portions thereof  their profitability  cash flows and in certain instances eventual outcome 
the judgment involved can be difficult  subjective and complex in a number of areas including assumptions and estimates used in estimating the future profitability and cash flows of our businesses 
restructuring events often give rise to decisions to dispose of or abandon certain assets or asset groups which  as a result  require impairment in accordance with sfas sfas requires us to carry assets to be sold or abandoned at the lower of cost or fair value 
we must exercise judgment in assessing the fair value of the assets to be sold or abandoned 
income taxes sfas requires us to exercise judgment about our future results in assessing the realizability of our deferred tax assets 
inherent in this estimation process is the requirement for us to estimate future book taxable income and possible tax planning strategies 
these estimates require us to exercise judgment about our future results  the prudence and feasibility of possible tax planning strategies  and the economic environments in which we do business 
it is possible that actual results will differ from assumptions and require adjustments to allowances 
in the second quarter of  we released billion of valuation allowances because we believe it is more likely than not that we will be able to generate sufficient levels of profitability in the us to realize substantially all of our us deferred tax assets 
in the third and fourth quarters of  we released an additional million  and million  respectively  of valuation allowances on our us deferred tax assets as a result of a change in our estimate of current year us taxable income 
a significant factor in our forecasts of future us tax profitability is the amount of assumed royalties to be paid by our display technologies businesses to the us 
table of contents in determining our provision for income taxes  we use an annual effective income tax rate based on full year income  permanent differences between book and tax income  and statutory income tax rates 
significant judgment is required in determining the company s worldwide income tax position as well as the effective tax rate 
fair value measures the company adopted statement of financial accounting standards sfas no  fair value measurements sfas effective january  the adoption of sfas was not material to corning s financial statements or results of operations 
the statement identifies two kinds of inputs that are used to determine the fair value of assets and liabilities observable and unobservable 
observable inputs are based on market data or independent sources while unobservable inputs are based on the company s own market assumptions 
once inputs have been characterized  sfas requires companies to prioritize the inputs used to measure fair value into one of three broad levels 
sfas applies whenever an entity is measuring fair value under other accounting pronouncements that require or permit fair value measurement and requires the use of observable market data when available 
corning s major categories of financial assets and liabilities required to be measured at fair value are short term and long term investments and derivatives 
these categories use observable inputs only and are measured using a market approach based on quoted prices in markets considered active or in markets in which there are few transactions 
derivative assets and liabilities may include interest rate swaps and forward exchange contracts which are measured using observable quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities 
in arriving at the fair value of corning s derivative assets and liabilities  we have considered the appropriate valuation and risk criteria  including such factors as credit risk of the relevant party to the transaction 
the amount recorded in the first quarter of related to credit risk was not material 
probability of litigation outcomes sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies  sfas requires us to make judgments about future events that are inherently uncertain 
in making determinations of likely outcomes of litigation matters  we consider the evaluation of legal counsel knowledgeable about each matter  case law  and other case specific issues 
see part ii item legal proceedings for a discussion of the material litigation matters we face 
the most significant matter involving judgment is the liability for asbestos litigation 
there are a number of factors bearing upon our potential liability  including the inherent complexity of a chapter filing  our history of success in defending asbestos claims  our assessment of the strength of our corporate veil defenses  our continuing dialogue with our insurance carriers and the claimants representatives 
the proposed asbestos resolution amended pcc plan is subject to a number of contingencies 
the approval of the amended pcc plan by the bankruptcy court is not certain and may face objections by some parties 
any approval of the amended pcc plan by the bankruptcy court is subject to appeal 
the proposed amended pcc plan will also be subject to a vote of pcc s creditors 
for these and other reasons  corning s liability for these asbestos matters may be subject to changes in subsequent quarters 
the estimate of the cost of resolving the non pcc asbestos claims may also be subject to change as developments occur 
management continues to believe that the likelihood of the uncertainties surrounding these proceedings causing a material adverse impact to corning s financial statements is remote 
other possible liabilities sfas and other similarly focused accounting literature require us to make judgments about future events that are inherently uncertain 
in making determinations of likely outcomes of certain matters  including certain tax planning and environmental matters  these judgments require us to consider events and actions that are outside our control in determining whether probable or possible liabilities require accrual or disclosure 
it is possible that actual results will differ from assumptions and require adjustments to accruals 
pension and other postretirement employee benefits opeb pension and opeb costs and obligations are dependent on assumptions used in calculating such amounts 
these assumptions include discount rates  health care cost trend rates  benefits earned  interest cost  expected return on plan assets  mortality rates  and other factors 
in accordance with gaap  actual results that differ from the assumptions are accumulated and amortized over future periods and  therefore  generally affect recognized expense and the recorded obligation in future periods 
while management believes that the assumptions used are appropriate  differences in actual experience or changes in assumptions may affect corning s pension and other postretirement obligations and future expense 
as of december   the projected benefit obligation pbo for us pension plans was  million 

table of contents the following information illustrates the sensitivity to a change in certain assumptions for us pension plans change in assumption effect on pre tax pension expense effective on december  pbo basis point decrease in discount rate million million basis point increase in discount rate million million basis point decrease in expected return on assets million basis point increase in expected return on assets million the above sensitivities reflect the impact of changing one assumption at a time 
note that economic factors and conditions often affect multiple assumptions simultaneously and the effects of changes in key assumptions are not necessarily linear 
these changes in assumptions would have no effect on corning s funding requirements 
in addition  at december   a basis point decrease in the discount rate would decrease stockholders equity by million before tax  a basis point increase in the discount rate would increase stockholders equity by million 
in addition  the impact of greater than a basis point decrease in discount rate would not be proportional to the first basis point decrease in the discount rate 
the following table illustrates the sensitivity to a change in the discount rate assumption related to corning s us opeb plans change in assumption effect on pre tax opeb expense effective on december  apbo basis point decrease in discount rate million million basis point increase in discount rate million million the above sensitivities reflect the impact of changing one assumption at a time 
note that economic factors and conditions often affect multiple assumptions simultaneously and the effects of changes in key assumptions are not necessarily linear 
revenue recognition the company recognizes revenue when it is realized or realizable and earned 
in certain instances  revenue recognition is based on estimates of fair value of deliverables as well as estimates of product returns  allowances  discounts  and other factors 
these estimates are supported by historical data 
while management believes that the estimates used are appropriate  differences in actual experience or changes in estimates may affect corning s future results 
stock compensation stock based compensation expense and disclosures are dependent on assumptions used in calculating such amounts 
these assumptions include risk free discount rates  expected term of the stock based compensation instrument granted  volatility of stock and option prices  expected time between grant date and date of exercise  attrition  performance  and other factors 
these assumptions require us to exercise judgment 
our estimates of these assumptions typically are based upon our historical experience  currently available market place data  and forward looking explanatory variables 
while management believes that the assumptions used are appropriate  differences in actual experience or changes in assumptions may affect corning s future stock based compensation expense and disclosures

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk s we operate and conduct business in many foreign countries and as a result are exposed to movements in foreign currency exchange rates 
our exposure to exchange rates has the following effects exchange rate movements on financial instruments and transactions denominated in foreign currencies which impact earnings  and exchange rate movements upon conversion of net assets and net income of foreign subsidiaries for which the functional currency is not the us dollar  which impact our net equity 
we have foreign currency exposure to the japanese yen  the new taiwan dollar  the korean won  and the euro 
we selectively enter into foreign exchange forward and option contracts with durations generally months or less to hedge our exposure to exchange rate risk on foreign source income and purchases 
these hedges are scheduled to mature coincident with the timing of the underlying foreign currency commitments and transactions 
the objective of these contracts is to neutralize the impact of exchange rate movements on our operating results 
we also enter into foreign exchange forward contracts when situations arise where our foreign subsidiaries or corning enter into lending situations  generally on an intercompany basis  denominated in currencies other than their local currency 
we do not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading purposes 
corning uses derivative instruments forwards to limit the exposure to foreign currency fluctuations associated with certain monetary assets and liabilities 
these derivative instruments are not designated as hedging instruments for accounting purposes and  as such  are referred to as undesignated hedges 
changes in the fair value of undesignated hedges  along with foreign currency gains and losses arising from the underlying monetary assets or liabilities  are recorded in current period earnings in other expense income  net in the consolidated statements of income 
equity in earnings of affiliated companies has historically contributed a significant amount to our income from continuing operations 
equity in earnings of affiliated companies  net of impairments was billion in and million in with foreign based affiliates comprising over of this amount in equity earnings from samsung corning and samsung corning precision totaled million for and million for exchange rate fluctuations and actions taken by management of these entities can affect the earnings of these companies 
we use a sensitivity analysis to assess the market risk associated with our foreign currency exchange risk 
market risk is defined as the potential change in fair value of assets and liabilities resulting from an adverse movement in foreign currency exchange rates 
at december   we had open forward contracts  and foreign denominated debt with values exposed to exchange rate movements  all of which were designated as hedges at december  a adverse movement in quoted foreign currency exchange rates could result in a loss in fair value of these instruments of million compared to million at december  specific to the japanese yen  a adverse movement in quoted yen exchange rates could result in a loss in fair value of these instruments of million compared to million at december  as we derive approximately of our net sales from outside the us  our sales and net income could be affected if the us dollar significantly strengthens or weakens against foreign currencies  most notably the japanese yen and euro 
our forecasts generally assume exchange rates during remain constant at january levels 
a plus or minus point movement in the us dollar japanese yen exchange rate would result in a change to net sales of approximately million and net income of approximately million 
a plus or minus point movement in the us dollar euro exchange rate would result in a change to net sales of approximately million and net income of approximately million 
interest rate risk management it is our policy to conservatively manage our exposure to changes in interest rates 
at december   our consolidated debt portfolio contained less than of variable rate instruments
