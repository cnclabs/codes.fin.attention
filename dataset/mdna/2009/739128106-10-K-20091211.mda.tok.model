table of contents of revenues decreased primarily due to our ability to leverage our existing infrastructure to support our increased production volume  along with the timing of commissions related to new orders 
interest income and expense interest expense was million in fiscal  a decrease of approximately million compared to fiscal the decrease in interest expense was primarily due to lower interest rates and the lower amounts outstanding under our credit facility during fiscal interest income was million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal this decrease resulted from lower interest rates being earned on amounts invested 
provision for income taxes our provision for income taxes reflects an effective tax rate on earnings before income taxes of in fiscal compared to in fiscal the decrease in the effective tax rate resulted primarily from an agreement reached with the taxing authorities in the united kingdom resulting in a reduction in tax expense of approximately  related to foreign tax credits from previous years 
net income in fiscal  we recorded net income of million  or per diluted share  compared to million  or per diluted share  in fiscal we generated higher revenues and improved gross profits for the company as a whole  while leveraging our existing infrastructure to support our increased production volume 
as previously discussed  net income in fiscal included the benefit of the million mediated settlement  reduced by legal and other expenses of approximately million  net of tax  related to a previously completed contract that was in dispute for several years 
backlog the order backlog at september   was million  compared to million at september  new orders placed during fiscal totaled million compared to million in fiscal our decline in backlog was due to the amount of projects completed being greater than the amount of orders received  and a number of our customers have delayed the start of new capital projects during the second half of fiscal fiscal compared to twelve months ended september  fiscal revenue and gross profit consolidated revenues increased million to million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal revenues increased as we responded to strong market demand by increasing our capacity and throughput

consolidated selling  general and administrative expenses consolidated selling  general and administrative expenses decreased to of revenues in fiscal compared to of revenues in fiscal selling  general and administrative expenses increased to million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal this increase is a result of increased commissions  salaries and incentive compensation due to increased volumes and earnings 
selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues decreased due to our ability to leverage our existing infrastructure to support our increased production volume 
interest income and expense interest expense was million in fiscal  a decrease of approximately million compared to fiscal the decrease in interest expense was primarily due to lower interest rates 
interest income was million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal this decrease resulted from lower interest rates and cash being used to fund working capital during fiscal provision for income taxes our provision for income taxes reflects an effective tax rate on earnings before income taxes of in fiscal compared to in fiscal our effective tax rate is impacted by income generated in the united kingdom  which has a lower statutory rate than the united states  as well as a mix of various state income taxes due to the relative mix of volume in the united states 
net income in fiscal  we recorded net income of million  or per diluted share  compared to million  or per diluted share  in fiscal as discussed above  we generated higher revenues and improved gross profits in all of our business segments  while leveraging our existing infrastructure to support our increased production volume 
backlog the order backlog at september   was million  compared to million at september  new orders placed during fiscal totaled million compared to million in fiscal 
table of contents liquidity and capital resources cash and cash equivalents increased to approximately million at september   as a result of cash flow provided by operations of approximately million for fiscal the approximately million of cash flow from operations resulted from net income and our increased efforts to manage inventory and billings to customers and was used to repay our us revolving credit facility and our revolving credit facility and term loan in the united kingdom  reducing total debt outstanding by approximately million  and to finance our operational activities 
as of september   current assets exceeded current liabilities by times and our debt to total capitalization ratio was 
at september   we had cash and cash equivalents of million  compared to million at september  we have a million revolving credit facility in the us and an additional million approximately million revolving credit facility in the united kingdom  both of which expire in december as of september   there were no amounts borrowed under these lines of credit 
total long term debt and capital lease obligations  including current maturities  totaled million at september   compared to million at september  letters of credit outstanding were million and at september  and  respectively 
amounts available under the us revolving credit facility and the revolving credit facility in the united kingdom were approximately million and million  respectively  at september  for further information regarding our debt  see notes h and k of notes to consolidated financial statements 
operating activities during fiscal  cash provided by operating activities was approximately million 
cash flow from operations is primarily influenced by demand for our products and services and is impacted as our progress payment terms with our customers are matched with the payment terms with our suppliers 
the increase in cash flow from operations resulted primarily from net income and our increased efforts to manage inventory and billings to customers 
during fiscal  cash used in operating activities was approximately million 
cash flow from operations was negatively impacted as accounts receivable and inventories increased due to higher volume as a result of demand for our products and services 
during fiscal  cash provided by operating activities was approximately million 
investing activities investments in property  plant and equipment during fiscal totaled approximately million compared to million and million in fiscal and  respectively 
our capital expenditures in fiscal related primarily to the expansion of one of our operating facilities and for upgrades to our enterprise resource planning system erp system 
the majority of our capital expenditures were used to continue the implementation of our new erp system  and the expansion of two of our operating facilities 
there were no material proceeds from the sale of fixed assets in fiscal or proceeds from the sale of fixed assets provided cash of approximately million in fiscal proceeds from the sale of fixed assets in fiscal and were primarily from the sale of idled manufacturing facilities and equipment 
financing activities net cash used in financing activities was approximately million in fiscal  because we paid down our revolving lines of credit and the term loan from the cash flow provided by our operating activities 
net cash provided by financing activities was approximately million in fiscal the primary source of cash in financing activities in fiscal was due to borrowings on the us revolving line of credit and proceeds from the exercise of stock options  which were used to fund operations and capital expenditures 
net cash used in financing activities was approximately million in fiscal the primary use of cash in financing activities in fiscal was due to payments on the us revolving line of credit 

table of contents contractual and other obligations at september   our long term contractual obligations were limited to debt and leases 
the table below details our commitments by type of obligation  including interest if applicable  and the period that the payment will become due in thousands 
long term operating as of september   debt lease payments due by period obligations obligations total less than year to years to years more than years total long term contractual obligations as of september   the total unrecognized tax benefit related to uncertain tax positions was approximately million 
we estimate that none of this will be paid within the next months 
however  we believe that it is reasonably possible that within the next months unrecognized tax benefits will decrease by approximately  due to the expiration of certain statutes of limitations 
we are unable to make reasonably reliable estimates regarding the timing of future cash outflows  if any  associated with the remaining unrecognized tax benefits 
other commercial commitments we are contingently liable for secured and unsecured letters of credit of million as of september   of which million reduces our borrowing capacity 
the following table reflects potential cash outflows that may result from a contingent event related to our letters of credit in thousands as of september   letters of payments due by period credit less than year to years to years more than years total long term commercial obligations we also had performance and maintenance bonds totaling approximately million that were outstanding at september  performance and maintenance bonds are used to guarantee contract performance to our customers 
outlook we participate in large capital intensive projects in the oil and gas  petrochemical  utility and transportation markets  which can take several years to plan and execute 
once our customers begin the construction phase  projects are typically completed 
our record revenues in fiscal were driven by the large number and size of capital projects that were planned and initiated over the past two years 
however  our backlog of orders going into our fiscal year fiscal is approximately million  a million decrease from the beginning backlog of orders going into fiscal throughout the second half of fiscal  an increasing number of our customers began to delay the start of new capital projects 
we believe these delays resulted from the short term reduction in the demand for oil  uncertainty in the worldwide economy and financial markets  as well as increasing uncertainty as to the impact that potential regulatory changes could have on their business 
we believe that this delay in capital project investment decisions will subside once financial markets begin to stabilize and the impact of regulatory changes can be predicted 

table of contents growth in demand for energy is expected to continue over the long term 
new infrastructure investments will be needed to ensure the available supply of petroleum products 
new power generation and distribution infrastructure will also be needed to meet the growing demand for electrical energy 
new power generation plants will also be needed to replace the aging facilities across the united states  as those plants reach the end of their life cycle 
a heightened concern for environmental damage  together with the uncertainty of gasoline prices  has expanded the popularity of urban transit systems and pushed ridership to an all time high  which will drive new investment in transit infrastructure 
opportunities for future projects continue  however  the timing of many of these projects is difficult to predict 
we believe that cash available and borrowing capacity under our existing revolvers should be sufficient to finance anticipated operational activities  capital improvements and debt repayments for the foreseeable future 
during this period of market uncertainty  we will continue to monitor the factors that drive our markets 
we will strive to maintain our leadership and competitive advantage in the markets we serve while aligning our cost structures with market conditions 
effects of inflation we have experienced significant price volatility related to raw materials  primarily copper  aluminum and steel  during the past three years 
fixed price contracts can limit our ability to pass cost increases to our customers  thus negatively impacting our earnings 
we anticipate that the volatility in commodity prices could impact our operations in fiscal critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and the disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates 
we believe the following accounting policies and estimates to be critical in the preparation and reporting of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition our revenues are primarily generated from engineering and manufacturing of custom products under long term contracts that may last from one month to several years  depending on the contract 
revenues from long term contracts are recognized on the percentage of completion method of accounting 
under the percentage of completion method of accounting  revenues are recognized as work is performed primarily based on the estimated completion to date calculated by multiplying the total contract price by percentage of performance to date  based on total costs or total labor dollars incurred to date to the total estimated costs or total labor dollars estimated at completion 
the method used to determine the percentage of completion is typically the cost method  unless the labor method is a more accurate method of measuring the progress of the project 
application of the percentage of completion method of accounting requires the use of estimates of costs to be incurred for the performance of the contract 
contract costs include all direct material  direct labor costs and those indirect costs related to contract performance  such as indirect labor  supplies  tools  repairs and all costs associated with operation of equipment 
the cost estimation process is based upon the professional knowledge and experience of the company s engineers  project managers and financial professionals 
factors that are considered in estimating the work to be completed and ultimate contract recovery include the availability and productivity of labor  the nature and complexity of the work to be performed  the effect of change orders  the availability of materials  the effect of any delays in our project performance and the recoverability of any claims 
changes in job performance  job conditions  estimated profitability and final contract settlements  including our estimate of liquidated damages  if any  may result in revisions to costs and income  with their effects being recognized in the period in which the revisions are determined 
whenever revisions of estimated contract costs and contract values indicate that the contract costs will exceed estimated revenues  thus creating a loss  a provision for the total estimated loss is recorded in that period 

table of contents revenues associated with maintenance  repair and service contracts are recognized when the services are performed 
expenses related to these types of services are recognized as incurred 
allowance for doubtful accounts we maintain and continually assess the adequacy of an allowance for doubtful accounts representing our estimate for losses resulting from the inability of our customers to pay amounts due to us 
this estimated allowance is based on historical experience of uncollected accounts  the level of past due accounts  the overall level of outstanding accounts receivable  information about specific customers with respect to their inability to make payments and expectations of future conditions that could impact the collectibility of accounts receivable 
however  future changes in our customers operating performance and cash flows  or in general economic conditions  could have an impact on their ability to fully pay these amounts  which  among other things  could have a material adverse impact on our operating results 
impairment of long lived assets we evaluate the recoverability of the carrying amount of long lived assets  including intangible assets with definite useful lives  whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be fully recoverable 
the review for impairment of these long lived assets takes into account estimates of future cash flows 
for assets held for sale or disposal  the fair value of the asset is measured using quoted market prices or an estimation of net realizable value 
an impairment loss exists when estimated undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition are less than its carrying amount 
intangible assets goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are no longer amortized  but are evaluated for impairment annually  or immediately if conditions indicate that impairment could exist 
the annual evaluation for impairment of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets is based on valuation models that incorporate assumptions and internal projections of expected future cash flows and operating plans 
the costs of intangible assets with determinable useful lives are amortized over their estimated useful lives 
when certain events or changes in operating conditions occur  an impairment assessment is performed and lives of intangible assets with determinable lives may be adjusted 
accruals for contingent liabilities from time to time  contingencies such as insurance and legal claims arise in the normal course of business 
pursuant to current accounting standards  we must evaluate such contingencies to subjectively determine the likelihood that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred at the date of the financial statements  as well as evaluating whether the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated 
if the likelihood is determined to be probable and it can be reasonably estimated  the estimated loss is recorded 
the amounts we record for insurance claims  warranties  legal and other contingent liabilities require judgments regarding the amount of expenses that will ultimately be incurred 
we use past experience and history  as well as the specific circumstances surrounding each contingent liability  in evaluating the amount of liability that should be recorded 
actual results could differ from our estimates 
warranty costs we provide for estimated warranty costs at the time of sale based upon historical rates applicable to individual product lines 
in addition  specific provisions are made when the costs of such warranties are expected to exceed accruals 
we use past experience and historical claims to determine the estimated liability 
actual results could differ from our estimate 

table of contents accounting for income taxes we account for income taxes under the asset and liability method  based on the income tax laws and rates in the countries in which operations are conducted and income is earned 
this approach requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the carrying amounts and the tax basis of assets and liabilities 
developing our provision for income taxes requires significant judgment and expertise in federal  international and state income tax laws  regulations and strategies  including the determination of deferred tax assets and liabilities and  if necessary  any valuation allowances that may be required for deferred tax assets 
we have not recorded any valuation allowances as of september   because we believe that future taxable income will  more likely than not  be sufficient to realize the benefits of those assets as the temporary differences in basis reverse over time 
our judgments and tax strategies are subject to audit by various taxing authorities 
we adopted new accounting guidance on the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes on october  this new accounting guidance addresses the determination of whether tax benefits claimed or expected to be claimed on a tax return should be recorded in the financial statements 
the company may recognize the tax benefit from uncertain tax positions only if it is at least more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities  based on the technical merits of the positions 
the tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such a position should be measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than fifty percent likelihood of being realized upon settlement with the taxing authorities 
this new accounting guidance also provides guidance on derecognition  classification  interest and penalties on income taxes  accounting in interim periods and requires increased disclosures 
foreign currency translation the functional currency for our foreign subsidiaries is the local currency in which the entity is located 
the financial statements of all subsidiaries with a functional currency other than the us dollar have been translated into us dollars 
all assets and liabilities of foreign operations are translated into us dollars using year end exchange rates  and all revenues and expenses are translated at average rates during the respective period 
the us dollar results that arise from such translation  as well as exchange gains and losses on intercompany balances of a long term investment nature  are included in the cumulative currency translation adjustments in accumulated other comprehensive income in stockholders equity 
derivative financial instruments as part of managing our exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates  we periodically utilize foreign exchange forward contracts 
the objective of these contracts is to minimize impacts to cash flows and profitability due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates on accounts receivable  accounts payable and forecasted cash transactions 
these contracts are recorded in the consolidated balance sheets at fair value  which is based upon an income approach consisting of a discounted cash flow model that takes into account the present value of the future cash flows under the terms of the contracts using current market information as of the reporting date  such as foreign currency spot and forward rates 
we formally document our hedging relationships  including identifying the hedging instruments and the hedged items  as well as our risk management objectives and strategies for undertaking the hedge transactions 
we also formally assess  both at inception and at least quarterly thereafter  whether the derivatives that are used in hedging transactions are highly effective in offsetting changes in the cash flows of the hedged item 
the effective portion of the change in fair value of a derivative is recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income in the consolidated balance sheets 
when the hedged item affects the income statement  the gain or loss included in accumulated other comprehensive income is reported on the same line in the consolidated statements of operations as the hedged item 
in addition  any ineffective portion of the changes in the fair value of derivatives used as cash flow hedges is reported in the consolidated statements of operations as the changes occur 
if it is determined that a derivative ceases to be a highly effective hedge  or if the anticipated transaction is no longer likely to occur  we discontinue hedge accounting and any unrealized gains or losses are recorded in the consolidated statements of operations 

table of contents on january   we adopted new accounting guidance that amended and expanded the disclosure requirements related to derivative instruments and hedging activities 
this guidance was issued in response to concerns and criticisms about the lack of adequate disclosure of derivative instruments and hedging activities 
the new guidance is focused on requiring enhanced disclosure on how and why an entity uses derivative instruments and hedging activities  how derivative instruments and related hedging activities are accounted for and how derivative instruments and related hedging activities affect an entity s cash flows  financial position and performance 
to accomplish the three objectives listed above  we are required to provide qualitative disclosures regarding the objectives and strategies for using derivative instruments and engaging in hedging activities in the context of our overall risk exposure  quantitative disclosure in tabular format of the fair values of derivative instruments and their gains and losses and disclosures about credit risk related contingent features in derivative instruments 
new accounting pronouncements the financial accounting standards board fasb has codified a single source of authoritative nongovernmental us gaap  the accounting standards codification codification 
while the codification does not change us gaap  it introduces a new structure that is organized in an easily accessible  user friendly on line research system 
the codification supersedes all existing accounting standards documents 
all other accounting literature not included in the codification will be considered nonauthoritative 
unless needed to clarify a point to readers  we will refrain from citing specific section references when discussing application of accounting principles or addressing new or pending accounting rule changes 
in december  the fasb issued new accounting guidance on business combinations 
the new guidance establishes principles and requirements for how an acquirer recognizes and measures in its financial statements the identifiable assets acquired  the liabilities assumed  any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree and the goodwill acquired 
the new accounting guidance also establishes disclosure requirements to enable the evaluation of the nature and financial effects of the business combination 
the new guidance is effective as of the beginning of an entity s fiscal year that begins after december   and will be adopted by us in the first quarter of fiscal we are currently unable to predict the potential impact  if any  of the adoption of this new accounting guidance on future acquisitions 
in december  the fasb issued new accounting guidance for noncontrolling interests in consolidated financial statements 
this new guidance establishes accounting and reporting standards for ownership interests in subsidiaries held by parties other than the parent  the amount of consolidated net income attributable to the parent and to the noncontrolling interest  changes in a parent s ownership interest and the valuation of retained noncontrolling equity investments when a subsidiary is deconsolidated 
the new accounting guidance also establishes disclosure requirements that clearly identify and distinguish between the interests of the parent and the interests of the noncontrolling owners 
the new guidance is effective as of the beginning of an entity s fiscal year that begins after december   and will be adopted by us in the first quarter of fiscal we are currently evaluating the potential impact of the adoption of this guidance on our consolidated results of operations and financial condition 
in april  the fasb issued new accounting guidance regarding the determination of useful lives of intangible assets that amends the factors that should be considered in developing renewal or extension assumptions used for purposes of determining the useful life of a recognized intangible asset 
this guidance is intended to improve the consistency between the useful life of a recognized intangible asset under accounting guidance related to goodwill and other intangible assets and the period of expected cash flows used to measure the fair value of the asset under accounting guidance related to business combinations and other us gaap 
this guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after december   and will be adopted by us in the first quarter of fiscal earlier application is not permitted 
we are currently evaluating the potential impact  if any  of the adoption of this new guidance on our consolidated results of operations and financial condition 
in june  the fasb issued new accounting guidance regarding share based payment transactions that addresses whether instruments granted in share based payment transactions are participating securities prior to vesting and therefore need to be included in the earnings allocation in calculating earnings per share under the two 
table of contents class method 
this new accounting guidance requires companies to treat unvested share based payment awards that have non forfeitable rights to dividends or dividend equivalents as a separate class of securities in calculating earnings per share 
this guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after december   and will be adopted by us in the first quarter of fiscal earlier application is not permitted 
we do not expect adoption of this guidance to have a material effect on our earnings per share 
in december  the fasb issued new accounting guidance on employers disclosures about postretirement benefit plan assets 
the disclosures about plan assets required by this new guidance shall be provided for fiscal years ending after december   and will be adopted by us in the first quarter of fiscal year we do not expect adoption of this new guidance to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in april  the fasb issued new accounting guidance addressing the interim disclosures about the fair value of financial instruments  which amended the previous disclosures regarding the fair value of financial instruments  and interim financial reporting 
this new guidance requires disclosures about the fair value of financial instruments in interim financial statements  in addition to the annual financial statements as already required 
this new accounting guidance became effective for interim periods ending after june   and was adopted by us in the third quarter of fiscal the adoption of this new guidance had no material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in april  the fasb issued new accounting guidance regarding the accounting for assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination due to contingencies 
this new guidance clarifies the initial and subsequent recognition  subsequent accounting and disclosure of assets and liabilities arising from contingencies in a business combination 
this new guidance requires that assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination that arise from contingencies be recognized at fair value  if the acquisition date fair value can be reasonably estimated 
if the acquisition date fair value of an asset or liability cannot be reasonably estimated  the asset or liability would be measured at the amount that would be recognized using the accounting guidance related to accounting for contingencies or the guidance for reasonably estimating losses 
this new accounting guidance becomes effective for us on october   however  as the provision of the guidance will be applied prospectively to business combinations with an acquisition date on or after the guidance becomes effective  the impact to us cannot be determined until a transaction occurs 
in april  the fasb issued new accounting guidance regarding the determination of fair value when the volume and level of activity for assets or liabilities have significantly decreased  and identifying transactions that are not orderly 
this guidance requires an evaluation of whether there has been a significant decrease in the volume and level of activity for the asset or liability in relation to normal market activity for the asset or liability 
if there has  transactions or quoted prices may not be indicative of fair value and a significant adjustment may need to be made to those prices to estimate fair value 
additionally  an entity must consider whether the observed transaction was orderly that is  not distressed or forced 
if the transaction was orderly  the obtained price can be considered a relevant observable input for determining fair value 
if the transaction is not orderly  other valuation techniques must be used when estimating fair value 
this new accounting guidance must be applied prospectively for interim periods ending after june   and was adopted by us effective june   but currently has no impact on our financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to certain market risks arising from transactions we have entered into in the normal course of business 
these risks primarily relate to fluctuations in interest rates  foreign exchange rates and commodity prices 
interest rate risk we are subject to market risk resulting from changes in interest rates related to our floating rate bank credit facility 
at september   million was outstanding  bearing interest at approximately per year 
a hypothetical basis point increase in variable interest rates would result in a total annual increase in interest expense of approximately  while we do not currently have any derivative contracts to hedge our exposure to interest rate risk  we have in the past and may in the future enter into such contracts 
during each of the past three years  we have not experienced a significant effect on our business due to changes in interest rates 

table of contents foreign currency transaction risk we have significant operations that expose us to currency risk in the british pound sterling and to a lesser extent the euro 
amounts invested in our foreign operations are translated into us dollars at the exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date 
the resulting translation adjustments are recorded as accumulated other comprehensive income loss  a component of stockholders equity in our consolidated balance sheets 
we believe the exposure to the effects that fluctuating foreign currencies have on our consolidated results of operations is limited because the foreign operations primarily invoice customers and collect obligations in their respective currencies or us dollars and a portion of our credit facility is payable in british pound sterling 
additionally  expenses associated with these transactions are generally contracted and paid for in the same local currencies 
a unfavorable change in the british pound sterling to us dollar exchange rate would not materially impact our consolidated balance sheet at september  during fiscal  we entered into four foreign currency forward contracts to manage the volatility of future cash flows on certain large contracts that are denominated in the british pound sterling 
the contracts are designated as cash flow hedges for accounting purposes 
the changes in fair value related to the effective portion of the hedges are recognized as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income on our consolidated balance sheets 
at september   a net liability of approximately million was recorded on our consolidated balance sheets related to these transactions 
commodity price risk we are subject to market risk from fluctuating market prices of certain raw materials 
while such materials are typically available from numerous suppliers  commodity raw materials are subject to price fluctuations 
we attempt to pass along such commodity price increases to our customers on a contract by contract basis to avoid a negative effect on profit margin 
while we may do so in the future  we have not currently entered into any derivative contracts to hedge our exposure to commodity risk 
we continue to experience price volatility with some of our key raw materials and components 
fixed price contracts may limit our ability to pass cost increases to our customers  thus negatively impacting our earnings 
fluctuations in commodity prices may have a material impact on our future earnings and cash flows 
market risk we are also exposed to general market and other risk and its potential impact on accounts receivable or costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings on uncompleted contracts 
the amounts recorded may be at risk if our customers ability to pay these obligations is negatively impacted by economic conditions 
our customers are typically oil and gas producers  oil and gas pipelines  refineries  petrochemical plants  electrical power generators  public and private utilities  co generation facilities  mining metals  pulp and paper plants  transportation authorities  governmental agencies and other large industrial customers 
we maintain on going discussions with customers regarding contract status with respect to payment status  change orders and billing terms in an effort to monitor collections of amounts billed
