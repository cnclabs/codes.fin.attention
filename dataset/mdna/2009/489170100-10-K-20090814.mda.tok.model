item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation the following discussion should be read in connection with the consolidated financial statements of kennametal inc and the related footnotes 
unless otherwise specified  any reference to a year is to a fiscal year ended june additionally  when used in this annual report on form k  unless the context requires otherwise  the terms we  our and us refer to kennametal inc and its subsidiaries 
overview kennametal inc is a leading global supplier of tooling  engineered components and advanced materials consumed in production processes 
we believe that our reputation for manufacturing excellence as well as our technological expertise and innovation in our principal products has enabled us to achieve a leading market presence in our primary markets 
we believe that we are one of the largest global providers of consumable metalcutting tools and tooling supplies 
we entered fiscal year after delivering record sales in our fiscal year ended june  our sales continued to grow during the first months of our fiscal year and we reported record september quarter sales for the three months ended september  following that  global economic conditions and industrial activity deteriorated substantially with a further downward acceleration in the march quarter 
this resulted in significantly lower industrial production and much lower demand for our products in all major geographic regions  as well as most industry and market sectors 
this had a corresponding effect on our sales levels  operating performance and financial results 
for the full fiscal year  our sales were billion  a decrease of percent from the record billion achieved in the prior fiscal year 
for  we recorded a net loss of million  or per diluted share 
included in our results were pre tax restructuring and asset impairment charges of million 
also included in our results was a loss on discontinued operations of million  including a loss on divestiture 
these items  along with other charges related to our restructuring programs  as well as the impact of the severe global economic downturn  were the primary drivers for the net loss that we recorded for benefits realized from our restructuring actions and other cost reduction actions  as well as higher price realization  helped to mitigate these items 
despite recording a net loss for the year  we generated cash flow from operating activities of million during also helping our cash flow  we reduced our capital expenditures by million from the prior year 
we also took other steps to improve our financial position and enhance our liquidity  including two significant actions taken in july which involved the amendment of our revolving credit facility and the issuance of million shares of our capital stock 
while undertaking our many actions to reduce costs and optimize cash flow during the challenging economic environment in  we took additional steps to further enhance our products and capabilities and preserve our competitive strengths 
as a result of all of our actions  we believe that we are well positioned and better prepared to perform well in an eventual economic upturn 
in response to the impact of the rapid and steep decline in global demand  we implemented and will continue to drive restructuring programs and other measures to reduce our manufacturing costs and operating expenses 
in april  we announced restructuring actions to rationalize certain manufacturing and service facilities  as well as other employment and cost reduction programs 
in january  we announced a global salaried workforce reduction 
in april  we announced further restructuring actions which involve additional employment and other cost reduction programs 
for our restructuring program in total  we realized approximately million in pre tax benefits from restructuring actions in and expect to realize approximately million of additional pre tax benefits from these actions in this would bring the total annual ongoing pre tax benefits from restructuring to approximately million 
in addition to our restructuring programs  we have taken and will continue to take other actions to adjust our costs and level of operations to the extent necessary and appropriate 
these other actions included employee furloughs from march through june and the suspension of matching contributions to certain employee benefit plans effective march we also implemented salary reductions effective july which will remain in effect until business conditions improve to a level that will permit partial or full restoration of the previous employee compensation levels 
as a result of the impact of the severe downturn in the global economy  we recorded a non cash pre tax impairment charge related to two businesses within our amsg segment during this charge amounted to million  of which million was for goodwill and million was for an indefinite lived trademark 

table of contents our sharp focus on cash flow generation and liquidity during included persistent diligence with receivable collection  close management of production and inventory levels and tight control over capital expenditures 
we reduced inventory in each of the final three quarters of despite the rapid and steep drop off in sales volumes 
this included a million inventory reduction in the second half of the fiscal year 
at the same time  we maintained high off the shelf inventory availability 
capital expenditures were reduced to million in the june quarter which is the lowest quarterly capital spending level since the december quarter 
also providing us with additional cash as well as taking another positive step in shaping our business portfolio was the completion of the divestiture of our high speed steel drills business  including related product lines and assets hss on june  the cash proceeds from this deal are million 
we received million of these cash proceeds prior to closing and another million in july we expect to receive the remaining balance in the december quarter 
for  this divested business generated sales of million and essentially breakeven results 
earlier in the fiscal year  we enhanced our business portfolio within the amsg segment with the acquisition of tricon  a leading supplier of custom wear solutions in the surface and underground mining markets 
in addition  we invested further in technology and innovation to continue delivering a high level of new products to our customers 
research and development expenses totaled million for in  we generated over percent of our sales from new products 
our financial position and liquidity were further bolstered by the amendment to our credit facility and the common stock issuance that we undertook in july restructuring actions during  we continued to implement restructuring plans to reduce costs and improve operating efficiencies 
these actions relate to the rationalization of certain manufacturing and service facilities as well as other employment and cost reduction programs 
restructuring and related charges recorded in amounted to million 
this included million of restructuring charges of which million were related to inventory disposals and recorded as cost of goods sold 
restructuring related charges of million were recorded in cost of goods sold and a net restructuring benefit of million was recorded in operating expense 
see note in our consolidated financial statements set forth in item total restructuring and related charges since the inception of our restructuring plans through june  were million 
including these charges  we expect to recognize approximately million of pre tax charges related to our restructuring plans 
the majority of the remaining charges are expected to be incurred by december   most of which are expected to be cash expenditures 
we realized pre tax benefits of approximately million from these actions in fiscal and expect to realize approximately million of additional pre tax benefits in fiscal this would bring the annual ongoing pre tax benefits from these actions to approximately million 
acquisitions and divestitures on october   we acquired tricon metals and services inc tricon in our amsg segment for a net purchase price of million 
tricon is a leading supplier of custom wear solutions specializing in consumable proprietary steels for the surface and underground mining markets  including hard rock and coal 
during  we also made a small acquisition within our mssg segment 
during  we did not complete any material acquisitions or divestitures 
however  we made two small acquisitions in europe  both within our mssg segment 
also during  we divested two small  non core businesses from our mssg segment  one in the us and one in europe 
combined cash proceeds received were million and we recognized a combined loss on divestitures of million 
during  we completed five acquisitions 
three of these acquisitions were in our amsg segment and two were within our mssg segment 

table of contents discontinued operations on june   we divested hss from our mssg segment as part of our continuing focus to shape our business portfolio and rationalize our manufacturing footprint 
this divestiture was accounted for as discontinued operations 
cash proceeds from this divestiture were million  of which million was received prior to closing and million was received in july we expect to receive the remaining million in proceeds in the december quarter 
for  this divested business generated sales of million and essentially breakeven results 
the pre tax loss on the sale and related pre tax charges of million  as well as the related tax effects  were recorded in discontinued operations 
we expect to incur additional pre tax charges related to this divestiture of million to million during the six months ending december during  we completed two other divestitures which were accounted for as discontinued operations 
see note in our consolidated financial statements set forth in item the following represents the results of discontinued operations for the years ended june in thousands sales loss income from discontinued operations before income taxes income tax benefit expense loss income from discontinued operations results of continuing operations sales sales of  million in decreased percent versus  million in the decrease in sales was primarily due to organic sales decline of million and unfavorable foreign currency effects of million  partially offset by the net favorable impact of acquisitions and divestitures of million 
as a result of the severe downturn in the global economy  organic sales declined in all major metalworking markets 
organic sales declined in our advanced materials business primarily due to lower sales in the surface finishing machines and services business  as well as the engineered products business 
sales of  million in increased percent versus  million in the increase in sales was primarily attributed to organic sales growth of million  the impact of acquisitions of million and favorable foreign currency effects of million 
regionally  organic sales growth was mostly driven by growth in european and asia pacific markets offset somewhat by weakness in the north american market 
organic sales growth by sector was led by year over year expansion in the aerospace  machine tools  general engineering  mining and highway construction markets 
gross profit gross profit decreased million to million in from million in the decrease was primarily due to lower organic sales volume  reduced absorption of manufacturing costs due to lower production levels  less favorable business unit mix  temporary disruption effects from restructuring programs  unfavorable foreign currency effects of million  an increase in restructuring and related charges of million 
improved price realization more than offset the impact of higher raw material costs 
in addition  the benefits of restructuring and other cost reduction actions  lower provisions for incentive compensation programs as well as the net favorable impact of acquisitions and divestitures helped to mitigate the impact of lower sales and production volumes 
the gross profit margin for decreased to percent from percent in gross profit increased million to million in from million in the percent increase was primarily due to organic sales growth  the effect of acquisitions  the effects of price increases and the impact of favorable foreign currency effects of million 
these benefits were partially offset by higher raw material costs  particularly products containing steel and cobalt  as well as a less favorable sales mix primarily due to a lower proportion of sales of energy related products and lower performance in our surface finishing machines and services business 
gross profit for included restructuring charges of million related to inventory write offs and million of other restructuring related charges 
the gross profit margin for decreased to percent from percent in operating expense operating expense in was million  a decrease of million  or percent  compared to million in the decrease is attributable to an million decrease in employment expenses driven by restructuring and cost management activities as well as lower provisions for incentive compensation programs of million  favorable foreign currency effects of million  a decrease in restructuring and related charges of million  and the impact of other cost reductions of million  offset somewhat by the net unfavorable impact of acquisitions and divestitures of million 

table of contents operating expense in was million  an increase of million  or percent  compared to million in the increase in operating expense was primarily due to unfavorable foreign currency effects of million  the impact of acquisitions of million  a million increase in employment costs and a million increase in professional fees  partially offset by a million decrease in other expenses 
operating expense for included restructuring related charges of million 
restructuring and asset impairment charges during  we initiated certain restructuring actions and recognized million of restructuring charges of which million were recorded as restructuring charges and million were related to inventory disposals and recorded in cost of goods sold 
see the discussion under the heading restructuring actions within this md a for additional information 
in the process of preparing our interim financial statements for the march quarter  we determined that the magnitude and duration of the economic downturn  as well as other factors  served as a triggering event for an impairment test of our surface finishing machines and services business as well as our engineered products business 
these businesses are both part of our amsg segment 
as a result of our test  we recorded a goodwill impairment charge of million 
of this amount  million related to our surface finishing machines and services business and million related to our engineered products business 
no goodwill remains on the books for our surface finishing machines and services business 
in addition  as a result of our impairment test  we recorded a million impairment charge for the indefinite lived trademark for our surface finishing machines and services business in we also recorded a goodwill impairment charge of million during for our surface finishing machines and services business 
the change was recorded as a result of a revised earnings forecast for the business due to a decline in operating performance and market weakness 
during  we completed our strategic analysis and plan for our widia brand 
as a key element of our channel and brand strategy  we decided to leverage the strength of this brand to accelerate growth in the distribution market 
since demand in the distribution market is mostly for standard products and to further our relationship with our widia distributors  we furthermore decided to migrate direct sales of widia custom solutions products to the kennametal brand 
as a result  we recorded a pre tax impairment charge of million related to our mssg widia trademark during loss on divestitures during  we completed the divestitures of two non core mssg businesses for proceeds of million and recognized a net loss on divestitures of million 
the results of operations for these businesses were not material and have not been presented as discontinued operations 
during  we recorded a loss on divestiture of million as a result of a post closing adjustment related to our divestiture of j l industrial supply 
amortization of intangibles amortization expense was million in  a decrease of million from million in the decrease was due to some intangibles becoming fully amortized in amortization expense was million in  an increase of million from million in the increase was due to the impact of acquisitions 
interest expense interest expense decreased million to million in  compared with million in this decrease was due to lower average interest rates on domestic borrowings of percent  compared to percent in the portion of our debt subject to variable rates of interest was approximately percent and percent at june  and  respectively 
the decrease in the portion of our debt subject to variable rates was due to the termination in february of interest rate swap agreements to convert million of our fixed rate debt to floating rate debt 
interest expense increased million to million in  compared with million in this increase was primarily due to an increase in average domestic borrowings of million  offset in part by the effect of lower average interest rates on domestic borrowings of percent  compared to percent in the portion of our debt subject to variable rates of interest was approximately percent and percent at june  and  respectively

income taxes the effective tax rate from continuing operations for was percent benefit on a loss compared to percent provision on income for the change in the effective rate from to was primarily driven by asset impairment charges in 
table of contents both periods 
in addition  the effective rate benefited from a valuation allowance adjustment in europe as well as the settlement of a routine audit examination in the us the effective rate was unfavorably impacted by a non cash income tax charge related to a german tax reform bill that was enacted in the first quarter of  but benefited from our dividend reinvestment plan in china 
the effective tax rate from continuing operations for was percent compared to percent for the decrease in the effective rate from to was primarily driven by a further increase in earnings under our pan european business strategy  the combined effects of other international operations  and a tax benefit associated with a dividend reinvestment plan in china 
the effects of these items were partially offset by the effect of the goodwill impairment charge related to our surface finishing machines and services businesses for which there was no tax benefit  and a non cash income tax charge related to a german tax reform bill that was enacted in the first quarter of during  we made a change in our determination with respect to cumulative undistributed earnings of international subsidiaries and affiliates whereby we now consider unremitted previously taxed income of our international subsidiaries to not be permanently reinvested 
as a result of this change  we accrued an income tax liability of million 
of this amount  million decreased accumulated other comprehensive income and million increased tax expense

during the year ended june   cash flow provided by operating activities was million  which exceeded our investment in capital expenditures and business acquisitions for the year 
as an additional source of funds to meet our cash requirements  we have a five year  multi currency  revolving credit facility entered into in march credit agreement that extends to march the credit agreement permits revolving credit loans of up to million for working capital  capital expenditures and general corporate purposes 
the credit agreement allows for borrowings in us dollars  euro  canadian dollars  pound sterling and japanese yen

discussion of critical accounting policies in preparing our financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  we make judgments and estimates about the amounts reflected in our financial statements 
as part of our financial reporting process  our management collaborates to determine the necessary information on which to base our judgments and develops estimates used to prepare the financial statements 
we use historical experience and available information to make these judgments and estimates 
however  different amounts could be reported using different assumptions and in light of different facts and circumstances 
therefore  actual amounts could differ from the estimates reflected in our financial statements 
our significant accounting policies are described in note we believe that the following discussion addresses our critical accounting policies 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue upon shipment of our products and assembled machines 
our general conditions of sale explicitly state that the delivery of our products and assembled machines is fob shipping point and that title and all risks of loss and damages pass to the buyer upon delivery of the sold products or assembled machines to the common carrier 
our general conditions of sale explicitly state that acceptance of the conditions of shipment is considered to have occurred unless written notice of objection is received by kennametal within calendar days of the date specified on the invoice 
we do not ship products or assembled machines unless we have documentation authorizing shipment to our customers 
our products are consumed by our customers in the manufacture of their products 
historically  we have experienced very low levels of returned products and assembled machines and do not consider the effect of returned products and assembled machines to be material 
we have recorded an estimated returned goods allowance to provide for any potential returns 
we warrant that products and services sold are free from defects in material and workmanship under normal use and service when correctly installed  used and maintained 
this warranty terminates days after delivery of the product to the customer  and does not apply to products that have been subjected to misuse  abuse  neglect or improper storage  handling or maintenance 
products may be returned to kennametal only after inspection and approval by kennametal and upon receipt by the customer of shipping instructions from kennametal 
we have included an estimated allowance for warranty returns in our returned goods allowance discussed above 
we recognize revenue related to the sale of specialized assembled machines upon customer acceptance and installation  as installation is deemed essential to the functionality of a specialized assembled machine 
sales of specialized assembled machines were immaterial for  and stock based compensation we recognize stock based compensation expense for all stock options  restricted stock awards and restricted stock units over the period from the date of grant to the date when the award is no longer contingent on the employee providing additional service substantive vesting period 
we continue to follow the nominal vesting period approach for unvested awards granted prior to the adoption of statement of financial accounting standard sfas no 
r  share based payment revised on july  we utilize the black scholes valuation method to establish the fair value of all awards 
accounting for contingencies we accrue for contingencies when it is probable that a liability or loss has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated 
contingencies by their nature relate to uncertainties that require the exercise of judgment in both assessing whether or not a liability or loss has been incurred and estimating the amount of probable loss 
the significant contingencies affecting our financial statements include environmental  health and safety matters and litigation 

table of contents long lived assets we evaluate the recoverability of property  plant and equipment and intangible assets that are amortized whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of any such assets may not be fully recoverable 
changes in circumstances include technological advances  changes in our business model  capital structure  economic conditions or operating performance 
our evaluation is based upon  among other things  our assumptions about the estimated future undiscounted cash flows these assets are expected to generate 
when the sum of the undiscounted cash flows is less than the carrying value  we will recognize an impairment loss to the extent that carrying value exceeds fair value 
we apply our best judgment when performing these evaluations to determine if a triggering event has occurred  the undiscounted cash flows used to assess recoverability and the fair value of the asset 
goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets we evaluate the recoverability of goodwill of each of our reporting units by comparing the fair value of each reporting unit with its carrying value 
the fair values of our reporting units are determined using a combination of a discounted cash flow analysis and market multiples based upon historical and projected financial information 
we apply our best judgment when assessing the reasonableness of the financial projections used to determine the fair value of each reporting unit 
we evaluate the recoverability of indefinite lived intangible assets using a discounted cash flow analysis based on projected financial information 
this evaluation is sensitive to changes in market interest rates 
pension and other postretirement and postemployment benefits we sponsor these types of benefit plans for a majority of our employees and retirees 
accounting for the cost of these plans requires the estimation of the cost of the benefits to be provided well into the future and attributing that cost over the expected work life of employees participating in these plans 
this estimation requires our judgment about the discount rate used to determine these obligations  expected return on plan assets  rate of future compensation increases  rate of future health care costs  withdrawal and mortality rates and participant retirement age 
differences between our estimates and actual results may significantly affect the cost of our obligations under these plans 
in the valuation of our pension and other postretirement and postemployment benefit liabilities  management utilizes various assumptions 
we determine our discount rate based on investment grade bond yield curves with a duration that approximates the benefit payment timing of each plan 
this rate can fluctuate based on changes in investment grade bond yields 
at june   a hypothetical basis point increase or decrease in our discount rates would increase or decrease  respectively  our pre tax income by approximately million 
the long term rate of return on plan assets is estimated based on an evaluation of historical returns for each asset category held by the plans  coupled with the current and short term mix of the investment portfolio 
the historical returns are adjusted for expected future market and economic changes 
this return will fluctuate based on actual market returns and other economic factors 
the rate of future health care cost increases is based on historical claims and enrollment information projected over the next fiscal year and adjusted for administrative charges 
this rate is expected to decrease until at june   a hypothetical percent increase or decrease in our health care cost trend rates would decrease or increase our pre tax income by million 
future compensation rates  withdrawal rates and participant retirement age are determined based on historical information 
these assumptions are not expected to significantly change 
mortality rates are determined based on a review of published mortality tables 
we expect to contribute million and million to our pension and other postretirement benefit plans  respectively  in allowance for doubtful accounts we record allowances for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
we assess the creditworthiness of our customers based on multiple sources of information and analyze additional factors such as our historical bad debt experience  industry and geographic concentrations of credit risk  current economic trends and changes in customer payment terms 
this assessment requires significant judgment 
if the financial condition of our customers was to deteriorate  additional allowances may be required  resulting in future operating losses that are not included in the allowance for doubtful accounts at june  inventories inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market 
we use the last in  first out method for determining the cost of a significant portion of our us inventories 
the cost of the remainder of our inventories is determined under the first in  first out or average cost methods 
when market conditions indicate an excess of carrying costs over market value  a lower of cost or market provision is recorded 
excess and obsolete inventory reserves are established based upon our evaluation of the quantity of inventory on hand relative to demand 

table of contents income taxes realization of our deferred tax assets is primarily dependent on future taxable income  the timing and amount of which are uncertain in part due to the expected profitability of certain foreign subsidiaries 
a valuation allowance is recognized if it is more likely than not that some or all of a deferred tax asset will not be realized 
as of june   the deferred tax assets net of valuation allowances relate primarily to net operating loss carryforwards  accrued employee benefits and inventory reserves 
in the event that we were to determine that we would not be able to realize our deferred tax assets in the future  an increase in the valuation allowance would be required

item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk we are exposed to certain market risks arising from transactions that are entered into in the normal course of business 
as part of our financial risk management program  we use certain derivative financial instruments to manage these risks 
we do not enter into derivative transactions for speculative purposes and therefore hold no derivative instruments for trading purposes 
we generally use derivative financial instruments to provide predictability to the effects of changes in foreign exchange rates on our consolidated results and to achieve our targeted mix of fixed and floating interest rates on outstanding debt 
our objective in managing foreign exchange exposures with derivative instruments is to reduce volatility in cash flow  allowing us to focus more of our attention on business operations 
with respect to interest rate management  these derivative instruments allow us to achieve our targeted fixed to floating interest rate mix as a separate decision from funding arrangements in the bank and public debt markets 
we measure hedge effectiveness by assessing the changes in the fair value or expected future cash flows of the hedged item 
the ineffective portions are recorded in other income  net 
see notes and in our consolidated financial statements set forth in item we are exposed to counterparty credit risk for nonperformance of derivative contracts and  in the event of nonperformance  to market risk for changes in interest and currency rates  as well as settlement risk 
we manage exposure to counterparty credit risk through credit standards  diversification of counterparties and procedures to monitor concentrations of credit risk 
we do not anticipate nonperformance by any of the counterparties 
the following provides additional information on our use of derivative instruments 
included below is a sensitivity analysis that is based upon a hypothetical percent weakening or strengthening in the us dollar compared to the june  foreign currency rates and the effective interest rates under our current borrowing arrangements 
we compared the contractual derivative and borrowing arrangements in effect at june  to the hypothetical foreign exchange or interest rates in the sensitivity analysis to determine the effect on interest expense  pre tax income or accumulated other comprehensive income 
our analysis takes into consideration the different types of derivative instruments and the applicability of hedge accounting 
cash flow hedges currency a portion of our operations consists of investments in foreign subsidiaries 
our exposure to market risk for changes in foreign exchange rates arises from these investments  intercompany loans utilized to finance these subsidiaries  trade receivables and payables and firm commitments arising from international transactions 
we manage our foreign exchange transaction risk to reduce the volatility of cash flows caused by currency fluctuations through natural offsets where appropriate and through foreign exchange contracts 
these contracts are designated as hedges of transactions that will settle in future periods and otherwise would expose us to foreign currency risk 

table of contents our foreign exchange hedging program minimizes our exposure to foreign exchange rate movements 
this exposure arises largely from anticipated cash flows from cross border intercompany sales of products and services 
this program utilizes range forwards and forward contracts primarily to sell foreign currency 
the notional amounts of the contracts translated into us dollars at june  and rates were million and million  respectively 
we would have received million at june  and paid million at june   respectively  to settle these contracts  which represent the fair value of these agreements 
at june   a hypothetical percent strengthening or weakening of the us dollar would change accumulated other comprehensive income loss  net of tax  by million 
in addition  we may enter into forward contracts to hedge transaction exposures or significant cross border intercompany loans by either purchasing or selling specified amounts of foreign currency at a specified date 
at june  and  we had several outstanding forward contracts to purchase and sell foreign currency  with notional amounts  translated into us dollars at june  and rates  of million and million  respectively 
at june   a hypothetical percent change in the year end exchange rates would result in an increase or decrease in pre tax income of million related to these positions 
interest rate our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our long term debt obligations 
we seek to manage our interest rate risk in order to balance our exposure between fixed and floating rates while attempting to minimize our borrowing costs 
to achieve these objectives  we primarily use interest rate swap agreements to manage exposure to interest rate changes related to these borrowings 
we had no such agreements in place at june  or june  fair value hedges interest rate as discussed above  our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our long term debt obligations 
we seek to manage this risk through the use of interest rate swap agreements 
at june   we had no such agreements in place 
in february  we terminated interest rate swap agreements that we had in place at that time and at june  these previous agreements were in place to convert a notional amount of million of our fixed rate debt to floating rate debt 
debt and notes payable at june  and  we had million and million  respectively  of debt  including capital leases and notes payable outstanding 
effective interest rates as of june  and were percent and percent  respectively  including the effect of interest rate swaps 
a hypothetical change of percent in interest rates from june  levels would increase or decrease annual interest expense by approximately million 
on july   the company entered into an amendment to its existing million revolving bank credit agreement  which expires on march  the amendment  among other things  retains the current size and maturity of the credit facility while providing additional flexibility with respect to financial covenants 
the amendment includes an increase in interest rates on borrowings of approximately basis points 
also during july  the company completed the issuance of million shares of its common stock generating net proceeds of million which were used to pay down outstanding indebtedness under the revolving credit facility 
foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations have materially increased earnings in  and foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations may have a material impact on future earnings in the short term and long term
