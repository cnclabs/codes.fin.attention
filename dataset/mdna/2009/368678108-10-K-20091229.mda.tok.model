overview gencor industries  inc  the company is a leading manufacturer of heavy machinery used in the production of highway construction materials  synthetic fuels  and environmental control equipment 
the company s core products include asphalt plants  combustion systems and fluid heat transfer systems 
the company s products are manufactured in two facilities in the united states 
because the company s products are sold primarily to the highway construction industry  the business is seasonal in nature 
traditionally  the company s customers do not purchase new equipment for shipment during the summer and fall months to avoid disrupting their peak season for highway construction and repair work 
the majority of orders for the company s products are thus received between october and february  with a significant volume of shipments occurring prior to may 
the principal factors driving demand for the company s products are the overall economic conditions  the level of government funding for domestic highway construction and repair  infrastructure development in emerging economies  the need for spare parts  fluctuations in the price of crude oil liquid asphalt as well as fuel costs  and a trend towards larger plants resulting from industry consolidation 
in august  the federal government passed the safe  accountable  flexible and efficient transportation equity act a legacy for users safetea lu 
this bill appropriated a multi year guaranteed funding of billion for federal highway  transit and safety programs that expired on september  on february   president obama signed into law the american recovery and reinvestment act of  which included approximately billion for highway and bridge construction activities 
the company believes that its customers are waiting on the states to move forward with the projects as their purchasing decisions are significantly influenced by the federal government s legislation on federal road building funding 
any new funding will have a positive impact on the company s financial performance although the magnitude of that improvement cannot be determined 
the reduction in sales of the company s larger equipment has resulted in part in an increase in sales of components  aftermarket parts  and ancillary services in fiscal as many customers are choosing to maintain versus replace or upgrade their equipment 
in january  the canadian government announced its economic action plan to stimulate economic growth which included a billion two year investment in new infrastructure including roads  bridges and other infrastructure 
the company believes that certain programs associated with this funding will have a positive impact on its financial performance although the magnitude of that impact cannot be determined 

table of contents economic downturns like the one currently being experienced generally result in reduced purchasing within the company s served markets and thus have a direct impact on sales and tend to increase the pricing pressures on the company s products resulting in lower pricing and margins 
the company s typical sales of asphalt plants are in the to million range and may require the company s customers obtain some sort of financing 
the current state of the financial industry  the tightening of the credit markets and the higher interest rates  have had an adverse impact on the company s customers attitudes toward purchasing new equipment 
on the positive side  the reduced value of the us dollar has resulted in more interest from international customers 
in addition to government funding and the overall economic conditions  fluctuations in the price of oil  which is a major component of asphalt mix  may affect the company s financial performance 
an increase in the price of oil increases the cost of manufacturing asphalt and could therefore decrease demand for asphalt and certain of the company s products 
the company does not currently foresee the fluctuations in oil prices having a significant impact on its financial performance 
steel is a major component used in manufacturing the company s equipment 
steel prices were at historically high levels during and the company increased sales prices during to offset the rising steel costs 
during the fourth quarter of  steel prices retreated sharply from their highs and continued the downward trend through the first half of moderate increases have occurred during the past several months and are expected to continue for the remainder of in the current economy and competitive environment  the company does not expect to be able to raise prices to cover the increasing costs of steel and its financial results could be negatively affected 
for the long term  the company believes the strategy of continuing to invest heavily in product engineering and development and its focus on delivering a high quality product and superior service will strengthen the company s market position when demand for capital equipment rebounds 
in response to the short term outlook  the company has taken aggressive actions to conserve cash  right size its operations and cost structure  and will continue to do so based on its forecasts 
these actions included adjustments to workforce and staffing  reduced purchases of raw materials and reductions in selling  general  and administrative expenses 
the company continues to review its internal processes to identify efficiencies and cost reductions and will continue scrutinizing its relationships with external suppliers to ensure the company is achieving the highest quality products and services at the most competitive cost

table of contents in terms of financing activities  there were no cash disbursements or receipts during the year ended september  critical accounting policies  estimates and assumptions the company believes the following discussion addresses its most critical accounting policies  which are those that are most important to the portrayal of the company s financial condition and results of operations and require management s most difficult  subjective  or complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
accounting policies  in addition to the critical accounting policies referenced below  are presented in note to the consolidated financial statements  accounting policies 
estimates and assumptions in preparing the consolidated financial statements  the company uses certain estimates and assumptions that may affect reported amounts and disclosures

the company believes that the estimates and assumptions made in preparing the consolidated financial statements are reasonable  but are inherently uncertain and unpredictable 
assumptions may be incomplete or inaccurate and unanticipated events may occur 
the company is subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ from estimated results

due to the level of risk associated with certain investment securities and the level of uncertainty related to changes in the value of securities  it is possible that changes in these risk factors could have an adverse material impact on the company s results of operations or equity 
the company s sensitivity analysis for interest rate risk excludes accounts receivable  accounts payable and accrued liabilities because of the short term maturity of such instruments 
the analysis does not consider the effect on other variables such as changes in sales volumes or management s actions with respect to levels of capital expenditures  future acquisitions or planned divestures  all of which could be significantly influenced by changes in interest rates
