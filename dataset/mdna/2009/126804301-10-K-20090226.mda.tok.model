in  our financial services business completed two term securitizations totaling million  added two variable funding facilities totaling million  and renewed a million variable funding facility 
we expect these additional liquidity sources  as well as the brokered and non brokered certificates of deposit market  to provide adequate liquidity to this segment for on february   moody s investors service announced that it had downgraded the ratings on classes of asset backed notes issued by the trust of our financial services business segment 
moody s investors service is one of three rating agencies that rate our financial services business term securitizations 
we do not believe that this downgrade will have a significant impact on the ability of our financial services business to complete other securitization transactions on acceptable terms or to access financing 
our retail and direct business segments and our financial services business segment have significantly differing liquidity and capital needs 
the primary cash requirements of our merchandising business relate to capital for new retail stores  purchases of inventory  investments in our management information systems and infrastructure  purchases of economic development bonds related to the construction of new retail stores  and general working capital needs 
we historically have met these requirements with cash generated from our merchandising business operations  borrowing under revolving credit facilities  issuing debt and equity securities  obtaining economic development grants from state and local governments in connection with developing our retail stores  collecting principal and interest payments on our economic development bonds  and from the retirement of economic development bonds 
retail and direct business segments the cash flow we generate from our merchandising business is seasonal  with our peak cash requirements for inventory occurring from april through november 
while we have consistently generated overall positive annual cash flow from our operating activities  other sources of liquidity are required by our merchandising business during these peak cash use periods 
these sources historically have included short term borrowings under our revolving credit facility and access to debt markets 
while we generally have been able to manage our cash needs during peak periods  if any disruption occurred to our funding sources  or if we underestimated our cash needs  we would be unable to purchase inventory and otherwise conduct our merchandising business to its maximum effectiveness  which could result in reduced revenue and profits 
our million unsecured revolving credit facility and unsecured senior notes contain certain financial covenants  including the maintenance of minimum debt coverage  a fixed charge coverage ratio  a cash flow leverage ratio  and a minimum tangible net worth standard 
in the event that we failed to comply with these covenants and the failure to comply would go beyond days  a default would trigger and all principal and outstanding interest would immediately be due and payable 
at december   we were in compliance with all financial covenants under our credit agreements and unsecured notes 
we anticipate that we will continue to be in compliance with all financial covenants under our credit agreements and unsecured notes throughout in addition  recent and unprecedented distress in the worldwide credit markets has had an adverse impact on the availability of credit 
although our million unsecured revolving credit facility does not expire until june  continued market deterioration could jeopardize the counterparty obligations of one or more of the banks participating in our facility  which could have an adverse effect on our business if we are not able to replace such credit facility or find other sources of liquidity on acceptable terms 
we currently expect all participating banks to provide funding as needed pursuant to the terms of our credit facility 
financial services business segment world s foremost bank or wfb the primary cash requirements of wfb relate to the financing of credit card loans 
these cash requirements will increase if our credit card originations increase or if our cardholders balances or spending increase 
wfb sources operating funds in the ordinary course of business through various financing activities  which includes funding obtained from securitization transactions  borrowing under its credit agreement or federal funds purchase agreements  obtaining brokered and non brokered certificates of deposit  and generating cash from operations 
wfb plans to fund more of its credit card portfolio through certificates of deposit primarily due to the current weakness and higher borrowing costs of the securitization market 
we expect wfb s certificates of deposit funding strategy to continue in until the securitization market returns to a more normalized level 
in addition  our existing credit agreement limits the amount of capital we can contribute to wfb to million in any fiscal year or million in the aggregate 
in december  we made a million capital contribution to wfb through a convertible participating preferred stock investment 
wfb is prohibited by regulations from lending money to cabela s or other affiliates 
wfb is subject to capital requirements imposed by nebraska banking law and the visa membership rules  and its ability to pay dividends is also limited by nebraska and federal banking law 
with the current disruptions in the credit markets  our financial services business  like many other financial institutions  has increased its funding from certificates of deposits 
with the increase in other financial institutions relying on the deposits market for liquidity and funding  competition in the deposits market may increase resulting in less funds available or at unattractive rates 
our ability to issue certificates of deposit is reliant on our current regulatory capital levels 
if our bank subsidiary were to be classified as an adequately capitalized bank  we would be required to obtain a waiver from the fdic in order to continue to issue certificates of deposits 
while we intend to finance our growth initiatives and operations with existing cash  cash flow from operations  and borrowings under our existing revolving credit facility  we may require additional financing to support our growth initiatives and operations 
however  due to the existing uncertainty in the capital and credit markets  our access to capital may not be available on terms acceptable to us or at all 
further  the ability of our financial services business to engage in securitization transactions on favorable terms or at all could be adversely affected by further disruptions in the capital markets or other events  which could materially affect our business and cause our financial services business to lose an important source of capital 
in addition to the non brokered certificates of deposit market to fund growth and maturing securitizations  we have access to the brokered certificates of deposit market through multiple financial institutions for liquidity and funding purposes 
furthermore  poor performance of wfb s securitized credit card loans  including increased delinquencies and credit losses  lower payment rates  or a decrease in excess spreads below certain thresholds  could result in a downgrade or withdrawal of the ratings on the outstanding securities issued in wfb s securitization transactions  cause early amortization of these securities  or result in higher required credit enhancement levels 
on february   moody s investors service announced that it had downgraded the ratings on classes of asset backed notes issued by the trust of our financial services business 
downgrades could negatively impact the ability of our financial services business to complete other securitization transactions on acceptable terms or at all and force our financial services business to rely on other potentially more expensive funding sources  to the extent available  which would decrease our profitability 
we do not believe that this downgrade will have a significant impact on the ability of our financial services business to complete other securitization transactions on acceptable terms or to access financing 
the proposed amendments issued by the financial accounting standards board to fas and fasb interpretation no 
r  if adopted  could require us to consolidate the assets and liabilities of our bank subsidiary s securitization trusts 
this could cause us to breach certain financial covenants in our revolving credit facility and unsecured notes 
this could also have a significant effect on our financial condition and ability to meet the capital maintenance requirements of our bank subsidiary  as affected off balance sheet loans would be recorded on our consolidated balance sheet and could be subject to regulatory capital requirements 
if the proposed amendments are adopted  we may have to contribute capital to wfb  which may require us to raise additional debt or equity capital and or divert capital from our retail and direct businesses  which in turn could significantly alter our growth initiatives 
operating  investing and financing activities the following table presents changes in our cash and cash equivalents for the years ended in thousands net cash derived from operating activities   net cash used in investing activities    net cash provided by financing activities    versus operating activities cash derived from operating activities increased million for compared to inventory balances decreased million at the end of over  resulting in a net improvement in cash due to a net change in cash flows of million between years in inventory

in addition  long term debt decreased million comparing years due to prepayment of debt at the end of partially offsetting these decreases was an increase of million in time deposits at the end of compared to  which wfb utilized to help fund its credit card operations  resulting in a net change in cash flows of million between years

in addition  wfb has total borrowing availability of million under its transferor s interest credit agreement million and agreements to borrow federal funds million 
wfb entered into a credit agreement in for a million variable funding facility secured by a participation interest in the bank s transferor s interest of the cabela s master credit card trust 
in may  this credit facility was modified to a million commitment and was extended to may  these funds were used to fund continued growth of wfb s credit card portfolio 
at the end of december  the full million of borrowing capacity was available to wfb 
in  we issued million of unsecured senior notes to institutional buyers 
scheduled principal repayments of million are payable beginning january   and annually thereafter until their maturity at january  interest is payable semi annually 
we used the proceeds to pay down existing debt and for general corporate purposes 
in  we issued million aggregate principal amount of unsecured senior notes 
we used the proceeds from this offering for new retail store expansion  including property and equipment additions  purchase of economic development bonds  and general corporate purposes 
our million credit agreement requires that cabela s comply with certain financial and other customary covenants  including a fixed charge coverage ratio as defined of no less than to as of the last day of any quarter  a cash flow leverage ratio as defined of no more than to as of the last day of any quarter  and a minimum tangible net worth standard as defined 
in addition  certain of the long term debt agreements contain various covenants and restrictions such as the maintenance of minimum debt coverage  net worth  and financial ratios 
the significant financial ratios and net worth requirements in the long term debt agreements are a limitation of funded debt to be less than of consolidated total capitalization  cash flow fixed charge coverage ratio  as defined  of no less than to as of the last day of any quarter  and a minimum consolidated adjusted net worth as defined 
also  the debt agreements contain cross default provisions to other outstanding credit facilities 
in the event that we failed to comply with these covenants and the failure to comply would go beyond days  a default would trigger and all principal and outstanding interest would immediately be due and payable 
at december   we were in compliance with all financial covenants under our credit agreements and unsecured notes 
we anticipate that we will continue to be in compliance with all financial covenants under our credit agreements and unsecured notes throughout versus operating activities cash derived from operating activities decreased million for compared to this net decrease in cash was primarily due to a net change of million in inventories  as inventory balances increased million over due to more new store openings in the inventory increase was funded by accounts payable  which had a net increase of million compared to the net increase in accounts payable was impacted by a million decrease compared to due to a decrease in the payable to the third party processor for wfb s credit card transactions 
in addition  land held for sale or development was up million over as we increased our holdings in land investment 
these uses of cash from operating activities were partially offset by an million net increase between years related to wfb s funding from securitization transactions 
for  wfb used cash for credit card originations net of cash received from collections  proceeds from new securitizations  and changes in retained interests of million compared to million in we received million in tenant allowances during  which accounts for most of the net increase of million in other long term liabilities  and the liability for gift certificates and credit card reward points increased million over from increased sales of gift cards 
in addition  depreciation and amortization increased million offsetting cash used in operating activities 
investing activities cash used in investing activities increased million for compared to this net increase was primarily due to expenditures related to the development and construction of new retail stores in for  cash paid for property and equipment additions totaled million 
economic development bonds totaling million relating to our lehi  utah  retail store were redeemed in in addition  economic development bonds totaling million and million relating to our wheeling  west virginia  retail store and distribution center were retired during and  respectively 
financing activities cash provided by financing activities increased million for compared to this net increase from financing activities comparing periods was due to a net increase of million in time deposits  with wfb increasing its short term borrowings to million to fund its credit card operations  and a net increase of million in borrowings primarily on lines of credit related to new stores which opened in in addition  unpresented checks net of bank balance increased million due to timing of when checks cleared our bank 
partially offsetting these increases was a net decrease of million in long term debt million borrowed in used to support our retail store expansion 
grants and economic development bonds in the past  we have negotiated economic development arrangements relating to the construction of a number of our new retail stores  including free land  monetary grants  and the recapture of incremental sales  property  or other taxes through economic development bonds  with many local and state governments 
we design our retail stores to provide exciting tourist and entertainment shopping experiences for the entire family 
our retail stores also employ many people from the local community  draw customer traffic from a broad geographic range  and serve as a catalyst for the opening of additional retail businesses such as restaurants  hotels  and gas stations in the surrounding areas 
we believe these factors increase the revenue for the state and the local municipality where the retail store is located  making us a compelling partner for community development and expansion 
where appropriate  we intend to continue to utilize economic development arrangements with state and local governments to offset some of the construction costs and improve the return on investment of our new retail stores 
grants we generally have received grant funding in exchange for commitments made by us to the state or local government providing the funding 
the commitments  such as assurance of agreed employment and wage levels at our retail stores or that the retail store will remain open  typically phase out over approximately five to ten years 
if we fail to maintain the commitments during the applicable period  the funds we received may have to be repaid or other adverse consequences may arise  which could affect our cash flows and profitability 
as of december   the total amount of grant funding subject to a specific contractual remedy was million 
economic development bonds through economic development bonds  the state or local government sells bonds to provide funding for land acquisition  readying the site  building infrastructure and related eligible expenses associated with the construction and equipping of our retail stores 
in the past  we have primarily been the sole purchaser of these bonds 
the bond proceeds that are received by the governmental entity are then used to fund the construction and equipping of new retail stores and related infrastructure development 
while purchasing these bonds involves an initial cash outlay by us in connection with a new store  some or all of these costs can be recaptured through the repayments of the bonds 
the payments of principal and interest on the bonds are typically tied to sales  property  or lodging taxes generated from the store and  in some cases  from businesses in the surrounding area  over periods which range between and years 
in addition  some of the bonds that we have purchased may be repurchased for par value by the governmental entity prior to the maturity date of the bonds 
however  the governmental entity from which we purchase the bonds is not otherwise liable for repayment of principal and interest on the bonds to the extent that the associated taxes are insufficient to pay the bonds 
after purchasing the bonds  we typically record them on our consolidated balance sheet classified as available for sale and value them based upon management s projections of the amount of tax revenue expected to be generated to support principal and interest payments on the bonds 
because of the unique features of each project  there is no independent market data for valuation of these types of bonds 
if sufficient tax revenue is not generated by the subject properties  we will not receive scheduled payments and will be unable to realize the full value of the bonds carried on our consolidated balance sheet 
as of december   million of economic development bonds were recorded on our consolidated balance sheet 
the negotiation of these economic development arrangements has been important to our retail store expansion in the past  and these arrangements may be an important factor in our retail store expansion strategy in certain locations because they allow us to avoid or recapture a portion of the costs involved with opening a new store 
securitization of credit card loans wfb historically has funded most of its growth in credit card loans through an asset securitization program 
asset securitization is a practice commonly used by credit card issuers to fund credit card loans at attractive rates 
wfb enters into asset securitization transactions  which involve the two tier sale of a pool of credit card loans from wfb to a wholly owned special purpose entity  and from that wholly owned special purpose entity to a second special purpose entity that is organized as a trust 
the trust is administered by an independent trustee 
because the trust qualifies as a qualified special purpose entity within the meaning of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for transfers and servicing of financial assets and extinguishments of liabilities fas  its assets and liabilities are not consolidated in our balance sheet in accordance with fas the trust issues to outside investors various forms of notes each of which has an undivided interest in the assets of the trust 
the trust pays to the holders of the notes a portion of future scheduled cash flows under preset terms and conditions  the receipt of which is dependent upon cash flows generated by the underlying performance of the assets of the trust 
wfb retains a transferor s interest in the securitized loans  which ranks equal with the investor certificates and notes  an interest only strip  which represent the right to receive excess cash available after repayment of all amounts to the investors  servicing rights  cash reserve accounts and cash accounts in some cases as added protection for investors  and asset backed securities in three of the securitizations 
neither the investors nor the trust have recourse against wfb beyond the assets of the trust  other than for breaches of certain customary representations  warranties  and covenants and minimum account balance levels which must be maintained to support our retained interests 
these representations  warranties  covenants  and the related indemnities do not protect the trust or the outside investors against credit related losses on the loans 
wfb records its interest only strips as an asset at fair value  which is an amount equal to the estimated present value of cash flows to be received by wfb over the expected outstanding period of the loans 
these cash flows essentially represent finance charges and late fees in excess of the amounts paid to note holders  credit losses  and servicing and administration fees 
wfb uses certain valuation assumptions related to the average lives of the loans sold and anticipated credit losses  as well as a discount rate commensurate with the risks involved  in determining the estimated present value of the interest only strips 
changes in the average life of the loans sold  discount rate  and credit loss percentage could adversely impact the actual value of the interest only strips 
accordingly  actual results could differ materially from the estimates  and changes in circumstances could result in significant future changes to the assumptions currently being used 
gains on securitization transactions  fair value adjustments  and earnings on our securitizations are included in consolidated revenue in the consolidated statement of income 
the cash accounts  asset backed securities  the interest only strips  and cash reserve accounts are included on our consolidated balance sheet as retained interests in securitized loans 
all of wfb s securitization transactions are currently accounted for as sale transactions 
as a result  the loans relating to those pools of assets are not reflected on our consolidated balance sheet  other than wfb s transferor s interest  cash reserve accounts  asset backed securities and interest only strips 
a credit card loan represents a financial asset 
unlike a mortgage or other closed end loan account  the terms of a credit card account permit a customer to borrow additional amounts and to repay each month an amount the customer chooses  subject to a monthly minimum payment requirement 
the credit card account remains open after repayment of the balance and the customer may continue to use it to borrow additional amounts 
wfb reserves the right to change the credit card account terms  including interest rates and fees  in accordance with the terms of the credit card agreement and applicable law 
the credit card account is  therefore  separate and distinct from the loan 
in a credit card securitization  the credit card account relationships are not sold to the securitization entity 
wfb retains ownership of the credit card account relationship  including the right to change the terms of the credit card account 
wfb sells our credit card loans in the ordinary course of business through a commercial paper conduit program and longer term fixed and floating rate securitization transactions 
in a conduit securitization  credit card loans of wfb are converted into securities and sold to commercial paper issuers  which pool the securities with those of other issuers 
the amount securitized in a conduit structure is allowed to fluctuate within the terms of the facility  which may provide greater flexibility for liquidity needs 
the total amounts and maturities for the credit card securitizations of wfb as of december   were as follows initial expected final series type amount interest rate maturity dollars in thousands series i term  fixed march series ii term  floating march series i term  fixed october series i term  floating october series iii term  fixed october series iii term  floating october series i term  fixed december series i term  floating december series iv term  fixed september series iv term  floating september total term  series i variable funding  floating october series ii variable funding  floating june series iii variable funding  floating july total variable  total available  the trust entered into an interest rate swap agreement to convert the floating rate notes with a notional amount of million into a fixed rate obligation 
we have been  and will continue to be  particularly reliant on funding from securitization transactions for wfb 
a failure to renew existing facilities or to add additional capacity on favorable terms as it becomes necessary could increase our financing costs and potentially limit our ability to grow the business of wfb 
unfavorable conditions in the asset backed securities markets generally  including the unavailability of commercial bank liquidity support or credit enhancements  could have a similar effect 
during  wfb completed two term securitizations totaling million  added two variable funding facilities totaling million  and renewed a million variable funding facility 
we expect these additional liquidity sources and the certificates of deposit market to provide adequate liquidity to wfb for furthermore  poor performance of wfb s securitized credit card loans  including increased delinquencies and credit losses  lower payment rates  or a decrease in excess spreads below certain thresholds  could result in a downgrade or withdrawal of the ratings on the outstanding securities issued in wfb s securitization transactions  cause early amortization of these securities  or result in higher required credit enhancement levels 
on february   moody s investors service announced that it had downgraded the ratings on classes of asset backed notes issued by wfb s securitization trust 
downgrades could negatively impact wfb s ability to complete other securitization transactions on acceptable terms or at all and force wfb to rely on other potentially more expensive funding sources  to the extent available  which would decrease our profitability 
we do not believe that this downgrade will have a significant impact on the ability of our financial services business to complete other securitization transactions on acceptable terms or to access financing 
certificates of deposit wfb utilizes brokered and non brokered certificates of deposit to partially finance its operating activities 
wfb issues certificates of deposit in a minimum amount of one hundred thousand dollars in various maturities 
as of december   wfb had million of certificates of deposit outstanding with maturities ranging from january to april and with a weighted average effective annual fixed rate of 
this outstanding balance compares to million at december   with a weighted average effective annual fixed rate of 
impact of inflation we do not believe that our operating results have been materially affected by inflation during the preceding three years 
we cannot assure  however  that our operating results will not be adversely affected by inflation in the future 
contractual obligations and other commercial commitments the following tables provide summary information concerning our future contractual obligations at the end of thereafter total in thousands long term debt     interest payments        capital lease obligations        operating leases        time deposits by maturity      obligations under new store and expansion arrangements    purchase obligations      deferred compensation    unrecognized tax benefits   total       includes million owed under our million credit agreement  and million owed under our million credit agreement for operations in canada 
excludes amounts owed under capital lease obligations 
these amounts do not include estimated interest payments due under our revolving credit facilities because the amount that will be borrowed under these facilities in future years is uncertain 
at december   obligations for new store and expansion arrangements include approximately million of estimated contractual obligations and commitments associated with the completion of our store expansion obligations  projected retail store related expansion  and certain obligations under economic development bonds 
the table does not include any amounts for contractual obligations and commitments associated with retail store locations where we are in the process of certain negotiations 
our purchase obligations relate primarily to purchases of inventory  shipping  and other goods and services in the ordinary course of business under binding purchase orders or contracts 
the amount of purchase obligations shown is based on assumptions regarding the legal enforceability against us of purchase orders or contracts we had outstanding at the end of under different assumptions regarding our rights to cancel our purchase orders  or different assumptions regarding the enforceability of the purchase orders under applicable laws  the amount of purchase obligations shown in the preceding table would be less 
the following tables provide summary information concerning other commercial commitments at the end of in thousands letters of credit  standby letters of credit  revolving line of credit for boat and atv inventory  open account document instructions  bank federal funds total  our credit agreement allows for maximum borrowings of million including lender letters of credit and standby letters of credit 
at december   the total amount of borrowings under this revolving line of credit  including lender letters of credit and standby letters of credit  was million 
our credit agreement for operations in canada is for million  with million available for borrowing at december  the line of credit for boat and atv financing is limited by the aforementioned million revolving line of credit to million of secured collateral 
the maximum amount that can be borrowed on the federal funds agreements is million 
off balance sheet arrangements operating leases we lease various items of office equipment and buildings 
rent expense for these operating leases is recorded in selling  distribution  and administrative expenses in the consolidated statements of income 
future obligations are shown in the preceding contractual obligations table 
credit card limits wfb bears off balance sheet risk in the normal course of its business 
one form of this risk is through wfb s commitment to extend credit to cardholders up to the maximum amount of their credit limits 
the aggregate of such potential funding requirements totaled billion above existing balances as of december  these funding obligations are not included on our consolidated balance sheet 
while wfb has not experienced  and does not anticipate that it will experience  a significant draw down of unfunded credit lines by its cardholders  such an event would create a cash need at wfb which likely could not be met by our available cash and funding sources 
wfb has the right to reduce or cancel these available lines of credit at any time 
securitizations all of wfb s securitization transactions have been accounted for as sales transactions and the credit card loans relating to those pools of assets are not reflected in our consolidated balance sheet 
critical accounting policies and use of estimates our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america which requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
management has discussed the development  selection  and disclosure of critical accounting policies and estimates with the audit committee of cabela s board of directors 
while our estimates and assumptions are based on our knowledge of current events and actions we may undertake in the future  actual results may ultimately differ from our estimates and assumptions 
our estimation processes contain uncertainties because they require management to make assumptions and apply judgment to make these estimates 
should actual results be different than our estimates  we could be exposed to gains or losses from differences that are material 
for a summary of our significant accounting policies  please refer to note of our consolidated financial statements 
we believe the accounting policies discussed below represent accounting policies we apply that are the most critical to understanding our consolidated financial statements 
merchandise revenue recognition revenue is recognized on our internet and catalog sales when merchandise is delivered to customers at the point of delivery  with the point of delivery based on our estimate of shipping time from our distribution centers to the customer 
we recognize reserves for estimated product returns based upon our historical return experience and expectations 
had our estimate of merchandise in transit to customers and our estimate of product returns been different by at the end of  our operating income would have been higher or lower by approximately million 
sales of gift instruments are recorded in merchandise revenue when the gift instruments are redeemed in exchange for merchandise and as a liability prior to redemption 
we recognize breakage on gift instruments as revenue when the probability of redemption is remote 
historically  the company recognized breakage seven years after the issuance of a gift certificate or gift card 
in the fourth quarter of  we began recognizing breakage income on gift instruments four years after issuance as a result of changes in historical trends in the types of gift instruments issued and the related redemption rates 
the impact of the change in estimate in the fourth quarter of was an increase in revenue and operating income of approximately million 
had our estimate of breakage on our recorded liability for gift instruments been different by of the recorded liability at the end of  our operating income would have been higher or lower by approximately million 
inventories we estimate provisions for inventory shrinkage  damaged goods returned values  and obsolete and slow moving items based on historical loss and product performance statistics and future merchandising objectives 
while we do not believe there is a reasonable likelihood there will be a material change in the future impacting these estimates  actual losses can be higher or lower based on future merchandising decisions and retail economic trends 
had our estimated inventory reserves been different by at the end of  our cost of sales would have been higher or lower by approximately million 
catalog costs deferred catalog costs consist of incremental internal and third party direct costs incurred in the development  production  and circulation of our direct mail catalogs  composed principally of creative design  prepress production  paper  printing  postal  and mailing costs 
deferred catalog costs are amortized over their expected period of future benefit or twelve months  whichever is shorter  based upon sales forecasts developed using historical sales for similar catalog offerings 
deferred catalog expenses are evaluated for recoverability at each reporting period by comparing the carrying amount associated with each catalog to actual sales data and to projected future cash flows 
had our amortization estimate of deferred catalog costs been different by for  our catalog costs expense would have been higher or lower by approximately million 
economic development bonds we recognize economic development bond investments based on estimates of the discounted future cash payments to be received under these bonds 
these estimates are also the basis for our recognition of deferred grant revenue to be received under the economic development grants as an offset to construction costs which is amortized over the asset lives of the development 
these cash flow estimates are dependent on property and or sales tax collections derived from our operations  and potentially other businesses  some of which may be in the development stage 
had our fair value estimates been lower by as of the end of  the value of economic development bonds reflected in our consolidated financial statements would have been approximately million less with the unrealized loss reflected in comprehensive income loss if the loss was deemed to be temporary 
any declines in the fair value of held to maturity and available for sale economic development bonds below cost that are deemed to be other than temporary are reflected in earnings as realized losses 
gains and losses on sales are recorded on the trade date and determined using the specific identification method 
asset securitization wfb securitizes the majority of its credit card loans  and recognizes gains or losses on the sales  as well as records certain retained interests  including transferor s interest  interest only strips  cash reserve accounts  cash accounts  and asset backed securities  which are all subject to significant valuation assumptions 
the interests in securitized receivables  including the transferor s interest  interest only strips  cash reserve accounts  cash accounts and asset backed securities  are reported at fair value or cost in the consolidated balance sheets 
certain estimates used in the determinations of gains on sales  and the related fair values of the asset accounts  are influenced by factors outside of our control  and as a result  such estimates could materially change in the near term 
on a quarterly basis  we review and adjust  as appropriate  the assumptions and estimates used in determining the fair value of the related accounts recognized in connection with these securitization transactions 
if these assumptions change  or actual results differ from projected results  asset balances and securitization income would be affected 
if we had made different assumptions for the periods covered by the consolidated financial statements  wfb s financial position and results of operations could have differed materially 
certain of these assumptions and estimates will change in the future with changes in market and economic conditions 
for example  rates paid to investors  as well as projected interest income  are primarily variable rates which change with market interest rate changes  and loan payment rates could fluctuate based on general economic conditions 
changes in these factors may result in future estimates of the excess spread and payment rates being materially different from the estimates used in refer to note for the sensitivity analysis of the current fair value of retained interests and the impact on fair value from an immediate adverse change of and in the key economic assumptions used to determine fair value

this fsp delays the effective date of fas to fiscal years beginning after november   and interim periods within those fiscal years for all nonfinancial assets and liabilities  except those that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis at least annually 
the partial adoption of fas did not have any impact on our financial position or results of operations 
we do not believe that the adoption of fas  as it relates to nonfinancial assets and liabilities  will have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations

fas  accounting for transfers of financial assets and repurchase financing transactions 
the objective of this fsp is to provide implementation guidance on accounting for a transfer of a financial asset and repurchase financing 
the fsp presumes that an initial transfer of a financial asset and a repurchase financing are considered part of the same arrangement linked transaction under fas however  if certain criteria are met  the initial transfer and repurchase financing shall not be evaluated as a linked transaction and shall not be evaluated under fas fsp fas is effective for fiscal years beginning after november  we do not believe that the adoption of this statement will have a material effect on our financial position or results of operations

since the provisions of this statement are disclosure related  we do not believe that the adoption of this statement will have a material effect on our financial position or results of operations 
on september   the fasb issued two exposure drafts proposing amendments to fas  accounting for transfers and servicing of financial assets and extinguishments of liabilities and fasb interpretation no 
r  consolidation of variable interest entities 
currently  the transfers of our bank subsidiary s credit card receivables in securitization transactions qualify for sale accounting treatment 
the trusts used in our bank subsidiary s securitizations are not consolidated with us for financial reporting purposes because the trusts are qualifying special purpose entities 
because the transfers qualify as sales and the trusts are not subject to consolidation  the assets and liabilities of the trusts are not reported on our consolidated balance sheet under generally accepted accounting principles 
under the proposed amendments  the concept of a qspe would be eliminated and would modify the consolidation model for variable interest entities and require continual reassessment of consolidation conclusions 
as proposed  these amendments would be effective for us at the beginning of our fiscal year 
the proposed amendments  if adopted  could require us to consolidate the assets and liabilities of our bank subsidiary s securitization trusts 
this could cause us to breach certain financial covenants in our credit agreements and unsecured notes 
this could have a significant effect on our financial condition and ability to meet the capital maintenance requirements of our bank subsidiary  as affected off balance sheet loans would be recorded on our consolidated balance sheet and may be subject to regulatory capital requirements 
additionally  if wfb does not meet the requirements for the well capitalized category under the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action  the ability to obtain certificates of deposit could be affected 
on december   the fasb issued fasb staff position no 
fas and fin r  disclosures by public entities enterprises about transfers of financial assets and interests in variable interest entities

the staff position is effective for the first interim period or fiscal year ending after december   and each interim and annual period thereafter until the effective date of the amendments to fas and interpretation r  which are still being deliberated 
the new requirements include disclosure objectives as well as required specified disclosures 
the specified disclosures focus both on continuing involvement with transferred financial assets  including involvement related to securitizations or asset backed financing arrangements  and on a company s involvement with vies 
the company has included the required disclosures in note of our consolidated financial statements

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to interest rate risk through our bank s operations and  to a lesser extent  through our merchandising operations 
we also are exposed to foreign currency risk through our merchandising operations 
financial services interest rate risk interest rate risk refers to changes in earnings or the net present value of assets and off balance sheet positions  less liabilities termed economic value of equity due to interest rate changes 
to the extent that interest income collected on managed credit card loans and interest expense do not respond equally to changes in interest rates  or that rates do not change uniformly  securitization earnings and economic value of equity could be affected 
our net interest income on managed credit card loans is affected primarily by changes in short term interest rate indices such as libor 
at the end of  the variable rate credit card loans were indexed to the prime rate 
to mitigate our interest rate risk  beginning january  the variable rate credit loans were indexed to one month libor and the credit card portfolio was segmented into risk based pricing tiers each with a different interest margin 
securitization notes are indexed to libor based rates of interest and are periodically repriced 
certificates of deposit are priced at the current prevailing market rate at the time of issuance 
we manage and mitigate our interest rate sensitivity through several techniques  but primarily by indexing the customer rates to the same index as our cost of funds 
additional techniques we use include managing the maturity  repricing  and distribution of assets and liabilities by issuing fixed rate securitization notes and entering into interest rate swaps 
the table below shows the mix of our credit card account balances at the years ended as a percentage of total balances outstanding balances carrying interest rate based upon the the national prime lending rate balances carrying an interest rate of balances carrying an interest rate of balances not carrying interest because their previous month s balance was paid in full charges on the credit cards issued by our financial services segment were priced at a margin over the defined national prime lending rate  subject to certain interest rate floors 
no interest is charged if the account is paid in full within days of the billing cycle  which represent of total balances outstanding 
credit card balances with a zero percentage interest rate have increased over prior years due to an increase in promotional merchandise offers 
some of the zero percentage promotion expenses are passed through to the merchandise vendors for each specific promotion offered 
management has performed several interest rate risk analyses to measure the effects of the timing of the repricing of our interest sensitive assets and liabilities 
based on these analyses  we believe that an immediate basis point  or  increase in market rates for which our assets and liabilities are indexed would cause a pre tax decrease to income of million for our financial services segment over the next twelve months  which could have a material effect on our operating results 
merchandising business interest rate risk the interest payable on our line of credit is based on variable interest rates and therefore affected by changes in market interest rates 
if interest rates on existing variable rate debt increased  our interest expense and results from operations and cash flows would not be materially affected 
foreign currency risk we purchase a significant amount of inventory from vendors outside of the united states in transactions that are primarily u 
s 
dollar transactions 
a small percentage of our international purchase transactions are in currencies other than the u 
s 
dollar 
any currency risks related to these transactions are immaterial to us 
a decline in the relative value of the u 
s 
dollar to other foreign currencies could  however  lead to increased merchandise costs 
for our retail store in canada  we intend to fund all transactions in canadian dollars  and we will utilize our unsecured revolving credit agreement of million to fund such operations
