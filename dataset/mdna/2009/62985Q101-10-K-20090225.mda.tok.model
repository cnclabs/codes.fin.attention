use of non gaap financial measures direct contribution  ebitda  adjusted ebitda and free cash flow are measures used by management to evaluate operating performance 
adjusted ebitda is also used to determine our compliance with financial covenants and our ability to engage in certain activities such as incurring additional debt and making certain payments 
direct contribution is defined as net sales  less cost of product sold  selling and service expenses  marketing expenses  research expenses and capital charges an internal non gaap charge based on trade accounts receivable  inventories and equipment specifically identifiable to each of our operating segments 
ebitda is defined as net earnings loss plus interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization 
adjusted ebitda is defined as ebitda further adjusted for certain cash and non cash charges  as permitted under our senior discount note  senior note and senior subordinated note indentures and our senior credit facility 
free cash flow is defined as net cash provided by operating activities  less capital expenditures and minority interest charges 
direct contribution provides investors with the measurement used by our management to evaluate the performance of our segments 
we believe ebitda is useful to the investors because it is frequently used by securities analysts  investors and other interested parties in the evaluation of companies in our industry 
we consider the inclusion of supplementary adjustments to ebitda applied in presenting adjusted ebitda appropriate to provide additional information to investors to demonstrate compliance with our financing covenants 
we believe free cash flow provides investors with a measure of our ability to generate cash for the repayment of debt 
direct contribution  ebitda  adjusted ebitda and free cash flow are not recognized terms under us gaap and do not purport to be alternatives to net earnings as an indicator of operating performance or to cash flows from operating activities as a measure of liquidity 
direct contribution is reconciled to consolidated earnings loss before income taxes and minority interests in note of our consolidated financial statements included in item of this annual report 
the most direct comparable gaap financial measures of each other non gaap financial measure  as well as the reconciliation between each other non gaap financial measure and the gaap financial measure  are presented in the discussions of the non gaap financial measures below 
because not all companies use identical calculations  our measures may not be comparable to other similarly titled measures of other companies 
critical accounting policies and estimates revenue recognition revenue from sales of products  including chemicals and equipment  is recognized at the time persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  ownership and all risks of loss have been transferred to the buyer  which is generally upon shipment  the price is fixed and determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
revenue from services is recognized when the services are provided to the customer 
significant estimates used in recognizing revenues include the delay between the time that chemicals equipment are shipped and when they are received by customers and title transfers and the amount of credit memos to be issued in subsequent periods 

table of contents we provide our chemical and equipment offerings to our customers using various commercial arrangements  but the following are most commonly used ship and bill arrangements 
following the receipt of a purchase order from the customer  we invoice the customer at the time that the chemicals equipment are shipped  based on agreed pricing and the volume of chemicals shipped or units of equipment shipped 
at the end of each period  for those shipments where title to the product and the risks of loss and rewards of ownership do not transfer until the product has been received by the customer  adjustments to revenues and cost of product sold are made to account for the delay between the time that the chemicals equipment are shipped and when they are received by the customer 
our sales policy does not provide for general rights of return and does not contain customer acceptance clauses 
usage with level billing arrangements 
at the beginning of the contractual relationship  we prepare an estimate of the chemicals that will be used by the customer 
as agreed with the customer  a fixed amount is invoiced monthly based on this estimate 
at the end of each quarter  we reconcile the actual amount of chemicals used by the customer and bill the customer for products actually used during that period 
revenue is recognized to reflect actual usage 
for any products not consumed in the customer s operations in a particular period  we retain ownership of such products on a consigned basis and do not recognize any revenue 
fixed fee arrangements 
at the beginning of the contractual relationship  we prepare an estimate of the chemicals that will be used by the customer during the contractual period  which is usually twelve months 
a fixed amount is automatically invoiced to the customer on a periodic basis  typically monthly 
we retain ownership  on a consigned basis  of any inventory at the customer site that is not consumed in the customer s operations in a particular period 
revenue is recognized on a ratable basis over the contractual period  which is generally consistent with the customer s usage of the chemicals 
under these arrangements  as part of the sales cycle for our chemical programs  our technical and sales representatives may visit our customers facilities to develop and monitor the chemical programs 
typically  there is no contractual obligation for these visits  or any penalty for not visiting the customer sites 
during these visits  our employees perform routine testing activities to ensure that our chemical products functionalities are having the desired effect on the customers equipment eg  boilers  chillers and water treatment plants 
in the majority of instances  our customers perform the on going application of the chemicals 
at the same time  the sales representatives investigate and determine whether the customers have needs for additional applications from nalco 
we consider our technical and sales representatives activities in this regard to be an integral and inherent part of our selling process and not a separate deliverable for revenue recognition purposes 
some of our customers  however  look to us for our technical expertise only  without the purchase of chemicals equipment 
we offer specialized services designed to assess  control  and reduce risk from water borne pathogens such as legionella  and we provide other technical and analytical services 
we invoice for our services using various commercial arrangements  but the following arrangements are the most common perform and bill arrangements 
revenue is recognized in the same period that the related service is performed  based on the agreed pricing  which can be either a price per hour or a fixed fee 
fixed fee arrangements 
at the beginning of the contractual relationship  we estimate the saleable service that will be performed during a given period  usually twelve months 
a fixed amount is automatically invoiced to the customer on a periodic basis  which may be monthly  quarterly  or annually  either in arrears or in advance of the services provided 
because an unspecified number of similar acts are performed within a fixed period of performance  revenue is recognized ratably over the period of performance 

table of contents time and material arrangements 
the fee with the customer is structured on a time and material basis  and revenue is recognized in the same period that the work is completed 
in certain arrangements  which are usually reserved for our largest customers  we provide some combination or all of the following deliverables chemicals  equipment and on site technical expertise 
in these arrangements  we usually remain the owner of any equipment at the customer site 
at the end of the contractual relationship  the equipment is either recovered or sold to the customer or a competitor 
additionally  our representatives may have a regular presence at a customer s facility  which is provided under a contract 
over time  the representatives have gained a true expertise in the particular production water treatment process at the customer s facility  and are able to selectively apply our specific chemical programs given the customer environment water quality  equipment type  etc the regular presence of the representative permits us to closely track the results of the program and to make modifications to the program as necessary for the highest efficiency 
the following two types of commercial arrangements are the most commonly used for the sale of multiple deliverables production based arrangements 
our billing is based on a customer s production based formula eg  dollars per ton of paper produced within certain technical parameters 
we use a combination of our service chemicals  on site technical expertise and equipment to satisfy the customer requirement 
the chemicals and equipment used and on site technical expertise required are highly correlated with the customer s production 
revenue is recognized monthly based on the production based formula 
usage based arrangements 
for these arrangements  we invoice according to the consumption of chemicals by the customer 
the agreed price by kilogram or pound of chemical consumed also includes the availability of on site expertise and the use of equipment to satisfy the customer requirement 
revenue is recognized monthly based on the usage based formula 
for all of our commercial arrangements  we also record estimated reserves for anticipated non collectible accounts and for product returns and other credits at the time revenue is recognized 
impairment of long lived assets other than intangibles we conduct periodic reviews for idle equipment and review business plans for possible impairment implications 
porta feed stainless steel containers  utilized to ship chemicals  represent approximately of our property  plant and equipment and are managed globally to optimize the delivery of chemicals to customer and company sites around the world 
due to their high mobility  there is a risk that porta feeds could be damaged or lost in transit 
we perform continuous cycle counts of our porta feeds and when such counts are inconsistent with our tracking system  we investigate the discrepancy in order to locate the container 
if the porta feed is not found  we write off the asset immediately 
we capitalize qualifying costs incurred in the acquisition and development of software for internal use  including the costs of the software  materials  consultants  interest and payroll and payroll related costs for employees dedicated to the development 
we must use our judgment in determining whether the direct costs of materials and services consumed in developing or obtaining internal use computer software and an employee s time and travel expenses directly associated with developing software are recoverable and should be capitalized 
we base our determination on the nature and the extent of the activity that the employee is performing 
a significant portion of our capitalized software costs relates to our sap implementation 
goodwill and other intangible assets the carrying values of goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives are reviewed for possible impairment annually on the first day of our fourth quarter  october  or when events or changes in business circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
the carrying values of 
table of contents intangible assets with finite lives are reviewed for possible impairment when events or changes in business circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
we have defined our reportable segments as our reporting units for our goodwill impairment testing 
we use a two step process to test goodwill for impairment 
first  the reporting unit s fair value is compared to its carrying value 
fair value is estimated using a discounted cash flow approach 
if a reporting unit s carrying amount exceeds its fair value  an indication exists that the reporting unit s goodwill may be impaired  and the second step of the impairment test would be performed 
the second step of the goodwill impairment test is used to measure the amount of the impairment loss  if any 
in the second step  the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill is determined by allocating the reporting unit s fair value to all of its assets and liabilities other than goodwill in a manner similar to a purchase price allocation 
the implied fair value of the goodwill that results from the application of this second step is then compared to the carrying amount of the goodwill and an impairment charge would be recorded for the difference if the carrying value exceeds the implied fair value of the goodwill 
we test the carrying value of other intangible assets with indefinite lives by comparing the fair value of the intangible assets to the carrying value 
fair value is estimated using a relief of royalty approach  a discounted cash flow methodology 
the estimates and assumptions we use are consistent with the business plans and estimates we use to manage operations and to make acquisition and divestiture decisions 
the use of different assumptions could impact whether an impairment charge is required and  if so  the amount of such impairment 
future outcomes may also differ 
if we fail to achieve estimated volume and pricing targets  experience unfavorable market conditions or achieve results that differ from our estimates  then revenue and cost forecasts may not be achieved  and we may be required to recognize impairment charges 
we performed our annual impairment test during the fourth quarter the fair value of our reporting units was estimated based on a discounted projection of cash flows 
the rates used in determining discounted cash flows for each of our reporting units was a rate corresponding to our cost of capital  adjusted for risk where appropriate 
in determining estimated future cash flows  current and future levels of income were considered that reflected business trends and market conditions 
as a result of a significant decline in our stock price in the fourth quarter  and a sharp deterioration in conditions within the paper industry and the general economy during that quarter  our impairment test indicated the potential for impairment in our paper services reporting unit 
we performed the second step of the goodwill impairment test and determined that an impairment of goodwill existed 
accordingly  we recorded a non cash goodwill impairment charge of million in the fourth quarter  reducing the goodwill balance of our paper services reporting unit to zero 
the aggregate fair value of our reporting units as determined in the first step of our annual impairment test was reconciled to our market capitalization as of september  our market capitalization was higher than the aggregate fair value of our reporting units  which represented an implied control premium 
while lower than the control premiums of some chemical industry transactions announced earlier in  we believe it is reasonable in light of the changes in market and economic conditions subsequent to those announced transactions 
critical assumptions used in estimating the fair value of our reporting units for the impairment test included the discount rate and the terminal growth rate for each unit 
the following table summarizes those assumptions discount rate terminal growth rate industrial institutional services energy services paper services 
table of contents the following table presents the amount of headroom the percentage difference between each reporting unit s fair value and carrying value for each of our reporting units as of the date of our annual impairment test  october  headroom industrial institutional services energy services paper services headroom fair value carrying value carrying value 
the following table presents the impact on the resultant headroom if there was a one percentage point change in the discount rate and terminal growth rate from what was actually used for the impairment test headroom as of october  industrial institutional services energy services paper services one percentage point increase in discount rate decrease in discount rate increase in terminal growth rate decrease in terminal growth rate pensions accounting for pensions involves the selection of a discount rate and an expected rate of return that we apply to a market related value of plan assets 
this methodology generally reduces the volatility of pension expense that would have otherwise resulted from changes in the value of the pension plan assets and pension liability discount rates 
the discount rate used to determine the present value of our future us pension obligations is based on a yield curve constructed from a portfolio of high quality corporate debt securities with various maturities 
each year s expected future benefit payments are discounted to their present value at the appropriate yield curve rate  thereby generating the overall discount rate for us pension obligations 
the discount rates for our foreign pension plans are selected by reference to high quality corporate bond rates in those countries that have developed corporate bond markets 
in those countries where developed corporate bond markets do not exist  the discount rates are selected by reference to local government bond rates with a premium added to reflect the additional risk for corporate bonds 
the assets in the principal domestic pension plan are diversified across equity and fixed income investments 
the investment portfolio has target allocations of approximately equity  fixed income and alternative investments such as hedge funds and private equity 
other assets such as real estate may be used judiciously to enhance portfolio returns and diversification 
the expected long term rate of return on plan assets is established using historical market data for each asset class as well as the target allocation 
historical markets are analyzed and long term historical relationships between equity and fixed income investments are preserved consistent with the widely accepted capital market principle that assets with higher volatility will generate a greater return over the long run 
active management is employed in most asset classes  which also contributes to the return assumption 
the total weighted average return on each asset class supports our long term expected rate of return assumption 
we review our long term rate of return assumptions annually 
while we believe our assumptions of future returns are reasonable and appropriate  significant differences in our actual experience or significant changes in our assumptions may materially affect our pension obligations and our future 
table of contents pension expense 
the expected long term rate of return is applied to a calculated value of plan assets  which recognizes changes in the fair value of plan assets in a systematic manner over five years in determining pension expense 
for the year ended december   we recognized consolidated pension expense  including settlements  of approximately million 
we expect pension expense  including forecasted settlements  to decrease to about million in holding all other factors constant  an increase decrease in the discount rate used to measure plan liabilities of one quarter of a percentage point would decrease increase pension expense and the benefit obligation by approximately million and million  respectively 
also  holding all other factors constant  an increase decrease in the expected long term rate of return of one quarter of a percentage point would decrease increase pension expense by about million 
other postretirement benefits accounting for other postretirement benefits requires the selection of a discount rate and health care cost trend rates used to value benefit obligations 
the discount rate used to determine the present value of our future postretirement benefit obligations other than pensions is based on a yield curve constructed from a portfolio of high quality corporate debt securities with various maturities 
each year s expected future benefit payments are discounted to their present value at the appropriate yield curve rate  thereby generating the overall discount rate for our other postretirement benefit obligations 
we develop our estimate of the health care cost trend rates through review of our recent health care cost trend experience and discussions with our actuary regarding the experience of similar companies 
for the year ended december   we recognized consolidated other postretirement benefit expense of approximately million  and we expect it to remain about the same in holding all other factors constant  an increase decrease in the discount rate used to measure plan liabilities of one quarter of a percentage point would decrease increase other postretirement benefit expense by less than million 
see note of our consolidated financial statements included in item of this annual report for details of the impact of a one percentage point change in assumed health care cost trend rates on other postretirement benefit expense and the postretirement benefit obligation 
income taxes we estimate our income tax expense in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  which has been further clarified by interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes fin  an interpretation of sfas no 
this results in our recording deferred tax assets and liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet to recognize the temporary differences caused by the timing of recognition of income and expense for financial statement and tax purposes 
valuation allowances are recorded based on the realizability of the deferred tax assets 
relevant factors to determine the realizability of the assets include future taxable income  the expected timing of the reversal of temporary differences  tax planning strategies and the expiration dates of the various tax attributes 
valuation allowances are established for those assets that are determined to be more likely than not to expire without benefit  or for which income of the proper character is not anticipated 
the effect of a valuation allowance for a deferred tax asset that is expected to originate in the current year is included in the annual effective tax rate for the year 
the effect of a change in the beginning of the year balance of a valuation allowance resulting from a change in judgment about the realizability of the related deferred tax asset in future years is recognized in the interim period in which the change occurs 
the tax positions we take are based on our interpretations of tax laws and regulations in the applicable federal  state and international jurisdictions 
we believe that our tax returns properly reflect the tax 
table of contents consequences of our operations  and that our reserves for tax contingencies are appropriate and sufficient for the positions taken 
however  these positions are subject to audit and review by the tax authorities  which may result in future taxes  interest and penalties 
because of the uncertainty of the final outcome of these examinations  we have reserved for potential reductions of tax benefits including related interest for amounts that do not meet the more likely than not thresholds for recognition and measurement as required by fin the tax reserves are reevaluated throughout the year  taking into account new legislation  regulations  case law and audit results 
environmental our business and operations are subject to extensive environmental laws and regulations governing  among other things  air emissions  wastewater discharges  the use and handling of hazardous substances  waste disposal and the investigation and remediation of soil and groundwater contamination 
as with other companies engaged in similar manufacturing activities and providing similar services  some risk of environmental liability is inherent in our operations 
we have been named as a potentially responsible party  or prp  by the environmental protection agency or state enforcement agencies at seven waste sites where some financial contribution is or may be required 
these agencies have also identified many other parties who may be responsible for clean up costs at the waste disposal sites 
our financial contribution to remediate these sites is expected to be minor 
there has been no significant financial impact on us up to the present  nor is it anticipated that there will be in the future  as a result of these matters 
we have made and will continue to make provisions for these costs if our liability becomes probable and when costs can be reasonably estimated 
we have also been named as a defendant in a number of lawsuits alleging personal injury due to exposure to hazardous substances  including multi party lawsuits alleging personal injury in connection with our products and services 
while we do not believe that based upon present information that any of these suits will be material to us  there can be no assurance that these environmental matters could not have  either individually or in the aggregate  a material adverse effect on our future financial condition or results of operations 
historically  our expenditures relating to environmental compliance and clean up activities have not been significant 
the environmental reserves represent our current estimate of our proportional clean up costs and are based upon negotiation and agreement with enforcement agencies  our previous experience with respect to clean up activities  detailed review of known conditions  and information about other prps 
the reserves are not reduced by any possible recoveries from insurance companies or other prps not specifically identified 
although given the evolving nature of environmental regulations  we cannot determine whether or not a material effect on future operations is reasonably likely to occur  we believe that the recorded reserve levels are appropriate estimates of the potential liability 
although settlements will require future cash outlays  it is not expected that such outlays will materially impact our liquidity position  although there can be no assurance that such impacts could not occur 
executive level overview nalco delivered strong performance in against the top priorities we established nearly a year ago  particularly given the current economic environment  with organic sales growth that matches our best result of the decade 
we define organic growth as nominal  or actual  sales growth less the impacts of changes in foreign currency translation rates and acquisitions and divestitures 
nominally  sales for the year ended december  grew similarly at to  million from  million 

table of contents diluted earnings per share eps adjusted to exclude the after tax impacts of a goodwill impairment charge  business restructuring charges  and a divestiture gain increased to per share from the year earlier per share 
adjusted eps is reconciled to the reported eps as follows year ended december diluted net earnings loss  as adjusted restructuring expenses  net of tax gain on divestiture  net of tax impairment of goodwill  net of tax diluted net earnings loss  as reported excludes after tax impact of restructuring expenses  gain on divestiture  and impairment of goodwill  and reflects the additional dilutive effect of potentially dilutive securities 
adjusted ebitda increased to million from the base of million that excludes the results of our waste coal agglomeration synfuel business that ended with a december  tax code expiration 
this gain came despite increases in direct material and freight costs of million that were not fully offset by million in price capture 
we also delivered million in productivity improvements and cost savings well in excess of our million target 
energy services led organic sales growth for the year  up on continued strength in our oilfield business  and additionally in our adomite drilling related business  each with organic increases over industrial and institutional services i is grew a solid organically  led by the power and primary metals water treatment businesses 
paper services organic revenues were down for the year  and experienced declines in grades other than tissue and towel 
other segment sales grew organically  mainly as a result of year over year changes in revenue recognition adjustments 
direct contribution margins were in both energy services and i is  but continued product and freight cost escalation resulted in their margins declining from and reported in  respectively 
paper services direct contribution margins dropped to in from in  due to the combination of higher product and freight costs and declining sales 
regionally  organic sales in north america and latin america grew and  respectively  while the asia pacific region  the first and most impacted by the global economic downturn during the fourth quarter  grew organically for the year 
europe grew organically  after years of challenges in western europe 
free cash flow was million for the year ended december   a decrease of million or from the million of free cash flow generated in net cash provided by operating activities is reconciled to free cash flow as follows year ended december dollars in millions net cash provided by operating activities minority interests additions to property  plant  and equipment  net free cash flow among items that held cash generation to a reduced level in were a million use of cash to increase inventories and an optional million pension contribution using a portion of the proceeds from the third quarter divestiture of our finishing technologies business 
for the year  pension funding exceeded expense levels by million  inclusive of a million pension settlement charge 
an increase in days investment in inventory of days accounted for over million of the increase in inventories 

table of contents other notable aspects of our performance included the following we recorded a non cash goodwill impairment charge of million in the fourth quarter  thereby eliminating all goodwill that had been allocated to our paper services business at the time of our leveraged buyout 
a sharp deterioration in conditions within the paper industry and the general economy led to the impairment 
we completed the sale of our finishing technologies surface treatment business in september  which resulted in an after tax gain of million 
we repurchased an additional million shares at a cost of million during  as part of the million share repurchase authorization approved by our board of directors in mid through the end of  we have repurchased million shares at a cost of million 
outlook we are determined to take actions to deliver the best possible performance given the rapid  negative changes seen in external conditions that continue to worsen worldwide 
although world economies continue to weaken  we provide critical water treatment offerings that are needed almost independent of the business cycle 
nonetheless  will be a challenging year with expectations for negative foreign currency impacts  continued steep declines in paper markets  an accelerating pace of extended shutdowns and permanent closures among customers in steel  mining  auto  chemical and other markets 
virtually all industries are now being impacted by the recession 
given the breadth of the economic downturn and continued uncertainty as to its duration  our outlook will not provide specific financial guidance  but will describe where we will focus our efforts to drive our performance in this period of uncertainty 
in  we are focusing on five priorities clearly aligned with today s economic environment safety will be our top priority  as it is every year 
our second priority is to achieve improvements in productivity  with a goal of million in cost savings and efficiency gains and employee compensation increases for tied to achievement of this goal 
these payments will be in lieu of any merit increases 
a minimum of million in savings is required for any such compensation to be paid  with million in savings necessary to earn a bonus amount similar to what might have been earned in a normal merit increase year 
this broad employee bonus program tied to cost savings should be substantially more than self funding and aid our growth culture and productivity contemporaneously 
third  we will pursue profitable growth in a focused manner targeting our incremental resources toward technologies  geographies  and market segments that can have high growth  even during the economic crisis 
across segments  we will focus on increasing share with strong  solid growth customers 
we must also minimize the threat of bad debts reducing our performance by working with customers to make sure payments are current  reducing terms where possible  focusing growth efforts where we believe there is less risk  and by aligning sales incentives with the goal of ensuring payments 
cash flow improvement is our fourth priority 
as increased inventory was a significant reason for the decline in free cash flow during  we have reorganized in january to align supply chain practices with the direction of our business 
fifth  we will strengthen our future by enhancing our service offerings  driving our technology pipeline to the market  and strengthening and taking greater advantage of the nalco brand 
this remains a fundamentally sound business with a strong growth profile 
we expect to outperform relative to our competitors and achieve better free cash flow results than we delivered in  with cash generated by operating activities improved by inventory reduction efforts already underway 
we 
table of contents have established integrated business management structures that should drive improved working capital management as well as increased operating efficiency 
we also have taken steps to deliver improved operating results through restructuring and increasing our productivity expectations  linking compensation increases directly into our productivity goals  and being very focused on a few select markets where we invest for growth through redeployment of resources 
results of operations year ended december  compared to the year ended december  consolidated net sales for the year ended december   exceeding billion for the first time  were  million  an increase of over the  million reported for the year ended december  on an organic basis  which excludes the impacts of changes in foreign currency translation rates and acquisitions and divestitures  net sales were up 
every geographic region reported organic growth  including europe  where previous sales declines have been reversed  and asia pacific  where the economic downturn was experienced first and more severely than other regions 
gross profit  defined as the difference between net sales and cost of product sold  of  million for the year ended december  rose million  or  over the  million for on an organic basis  gross profit increased by 
contributing to the improvement were the impacts of higher sales volumes and cost savings  which were partly offset by higher product and freight costs 
a million business interruption insurance settlement from the us gulf hurricanes that we received in the fourth quarter also benefited the prior year 
gross profit margin for the year ended december  declined to compared to for the year ended december   mostly as the result of increases in direct material and freight costs of million that were not fully offset by million of price increases 
selling  administrative  and research expenses for the year ended december  of  million increased million  or  from  million for the year ended december  organically  selling  administrative  and research expenses grew by million  or 
the greatest portion of this increase was attributable to selling expense  as a result of our higher salaries  employee incentives  employee benefits  training  travel  and outside services  as we invested in the hiring and training of our sales force in growth markets 
administrative expenses actually declined by million on an organic basis  partly because expenses included million of compensation cost for a grant of nonvested common stock as part of an agreement with our former chairman and chief executive officer  dr 
william h 
joyce  who retired effective december  in addition  outside consulting costs related to our work process redesign and legal entity restructuring initiatives were significantly higher in amortization of intangible assets was million and million for the year ended december  and  respectively 
the decrease was attributable to lower amortization of customer relationships  which are amortized using an accelerated method that declines over time 
restructuring expenses  representing mostly employee severance and related costs associated with the continuing redesign and optimization of business and work processes  were million and million for the year ended december  and  respectively 
the increase was mainly the result of a reduction in force of more than positions begun during the fourth quarter of as part of an organizational realignment 
gain on divestiture of million in resulted from the sale of our finishing technologies surface treatment business to chemetall corp  a subsidiary of rockwood holdings 

table of contents impairment of goodwill of million in represents the write off of all goodwill previously allocated to paper services at the time of the acquisition in the impairment resulted from a sharp deterioration in conditions within the paper industry and the general economy in late other income expense  net was a net expense of million and million for the year ended december  and  respectively 
the million increase was mainly attributable to an unfavorable change in foreign currency transaction gains and losses of million 
net interest expense  defined as the combination of interest income and interest expense  of million for the year ended december  decreased by million from the million reported for the year ended december  translation rate changes due to the weaker us dollar versus the euro increased interest expense by million  and accretion of our senior discount notes was million higher than a year ago 
however  lower interest rates on our variable rate debt and slightly lower average debt levels compared to the year ago period more than offset these increases 
the tax provision for resulted in tax expense on a pretax loss primarily because of two transactions that resulted in expensing goodwill for book purposes that had very little tax basis 
the larger of the two transactions was the impairment of million of goodwill that only had million of tax basis 
as a result  pretax income was reduced by million  while the tax provision was only reduced million 
the second transaction was the sale of the finishing technologies surface treatment business  which resulted in million of goodwill being expensed with only million of tax benefit 
the overall finishing technologies sale resulted in million of pretax gain  and million of tax expense 
with these two transactions removed  the adjusted tax rate for the year is as shown below dollars in millions reported results goodwill impairment finishing technologies divestiture excluding impairment charge divestiture gain income loss before tax tax expense benefit effective tax rate we believe excluding these two items from the effective tax rate provides a better basis for comparison to other periods 
the adjusted effective tax rate of compares to the prior year rate of 
in  the effective tax varied from the us federal statutory rate of primarily due to incremental us federal income taxes on dividends received from non us subsidiaries  foreign taxes provided at other than the us statutory rate  us state income taxes  nondeductible expenses and other permanent differences between income and expense for financial statement and tax purposes 
except as described below  these differences also apply to during  our us tax position changed such that we are now able to credit rather than deduct certain foreign taxes 
the ability to credit removes nearly all of the incremental tax cost of repatriating dividends to the us from our foreign subsidiaries 
the ability to credit also reduces our expense related to most withholding taxes incurred by the us parent company

the effective tax rate was for the year ended december  compared to an effective tax rate of for the year ended december  the rate varies from the us federal statutory income tax rate of primarily due to the incremental us federal income tax on dividends received from non us subsidiaries  foreign taxes provided at other than the us statutory rate  us state income taxes  nondeductible expenses  and other permanent differences between income and expense for financial statement and tax purposes 
the aforementioned items also contributed to the variation between the us federal statutory income tax rate and our effective income tax rate for the year ended december  the year ended december  also included two discrete events related to our tax positions in the netherlands 
during the period  we completed our consultations with the tax authorities regarding their analysis of certain interest deductions incurred by two of our dutch subsidiaries 
the tax effect of these interest deductions represented million of previously unrecognized tax benefits 
the dutch tax authorities concluded that all of the interest deductions we considered at risk were valid deductions under the applicable law 
therefore  we reversed an existing tax reserve  and reduced tax expense during by million 
in addition  we determined that certain net loss carryforwards in the netherlands are likely to expire without being utilized 
therefore  we established valuation allowances on those losses  which resulted in million of additional tax expense during we also implemented various foreign reorganizations in that provided tax savings during  and are expected to provide on going savings in future years 
minority interest expense was million higher than the million for the year ended december  higher earnings by most of our non wholly owned subsidiaries  most notably saudi arabia and japan  accounted for the increase

liquidity and capital resources operating activities

we prepaid the remaining balance of million on the us dollar portion of our term loan a debt  made a scheduled payment on our euro denominated term loan a debt of million  and prepaid million of our term loan b borrowings 
our liquidity requirements are significant  primarily due to debt service requirements as well as research and development and capital investment

as part of the transactions  in november  nalco company issued million aggregate principal amount of us dollar denominated senior notes due  million aggregate principal amount of euro denominated senior notes due  million aggregate principal amount of us dollar denominated senior subordinated notes due and million aggregate principal amount of euro denominated senior subordinated notes due on january   our subsidiaries  nalco finance holdings llc and nalco finance holdings inc  issued million aggregate principal amount at maturity of senior discount notes due prior to february   interest will accrue on the notes in the form of an increase in the accreted value of such notes 
the accreted value of each note will increase from the date of issuance until february  at a rate of per annum  reflecting the accrual of non cash interest  such that the accreted value will equal the principal amount at maturity on february  cash interest payments on the notes will be due and payable beginning in our primary source of liquidity for such payments will be cash flow generated from the operations of subsidiaries  including nalco holdings and nalco company 
however  the terms of nalco company s senior credit agreement limit the amount of dividends and other transfers by nalco holdings and our other subsidiaries to the issuers of the senior discount notes 
in addition  the terms of certain of the indentures governing the existing senior notes and senior subordinated notes of nalco company significantly restrict nalco company and our other subsidiaries from paying dividends  making distributions and otherwise transferring assets to the issuers 
the ability of nalco company to make such payments is governed by a formula based on its consolidated net income 
in addition  as a condition to making such payments to the issuers based on such formula  nalco holdings must have an adjusted ebitda to interest expense ratio of at least to after giving effect to any such payments 
notwithstanding such restrictions  such indentures permit an aggregate of million of such payments to be made whether or not there is availability under the formula or the conditions to its use are met

covenant compliance 
the breach of covenants in our senior credit agreement that are tied to ratios based on adjusted ebitda could result in a default under that agreement and the lenders could elect to declare all amounts borrowed due and payable 
any such acceleration would also result in a default under our indentures 
additionally  under our debt agreements  our ability to engage in activities such as incurring additional indebtedness  making investments and paying dividends is also tied to ratios based on adjusted ebitda 
adjusted ebitda is used to determine our compliance with many of the covenants contained in the indentures governing the notes and in our senior credit agreement 
adjusted ebitda is defined as ebitda further adjusted to exclude unusual items and other adjustments permitted in calculating covenant compliance under the indentures and our senior credit facility 
we believe that the inclusion of supplementary adjustments to ebitda applied in presenting adjusted ebitda are appropriate to provide additional information to investors to demonstrate compliance with our financing covenants

failure to satisfy these ratio requirements would constitute a default under the senior credit agreement 
if our lenders failed to waive any such default  our repayment obligations under the senior credit agreement could be accelerated  which would also constitute a default under our indentures 
our ability to incur additional debt and make certain restricted payments under our indentures  subject to specified exceptions  is tied to an adjusted ebitda to fixed charge ratio of at least to  except that we may incur certain debt and make certain restricted payments and certain permitted investments without regard to the ratio  such as up to an aggregate principal amount of  million including million that was outstanding under our term loan facilities as of december  and investments in similar business and other investments equal to of nalco holding company consolidated assets

receivables facility 
in june  nalco company entered into a three year accounts receivable securitization facility with a commercial paper conduit sponsored by jpmorgan chase bank  one of the lenders under nalco company s senior credit facilities  which provided up to million in funding 
when that facility expired in june  nalco company entered into a new three year facility with a commercial paper conduit sponsored by bank of america  na  one of the other lenders under nalco company s senior credit facilities 
the new facility provides up to million in funding  based on availability of eligible receivables and satisfaction of other customary conditions 
under the facility  pursuant to a receivables purchase agreement  nalco company the seller sells trade accounts receivable the receivables to nalco receivables llc the transferor  a wholly owned bankruptcy remote special purpose limited liability company 
pursuant to a receivables transfer agreement  the transferor then transfers an undivided interest in the purchased receivables to the commercial paper conduit or the related bank sponsor the transferees in exchange for cash 
the transferor s purchase of receivables from the seller is financed through the simultaneous transfer of this undivided interest in the purchased receivables  together with cash contributed to it by nalco company and the advances made by the seller under an intercompany note 
nalco company  as the receivables collection agent  services  administers and collects the receivables under the receivables transfer agreement for which it receives a monthly servicing fee at a rate of per annum of the average daily outstanding balance of receivables 
borrowings under the receivables facility bear interest at a floating base rate plus a program fee 
the program fee varies based upon our leverage ratio as calculated under the senior credit facilities and is currently of the amount funded 
in 
table of contents addition  the transferor is required to pay a facility fee that varies based upon the same ratio and is currently of million 
these rates are per annum and payments of these fees are made to the lenders on the monthly settlement date 
availability of funding under the receivables facility depends primarily upon the outstanding trade accounts receivable balance from time to time 
aggregate availability is determined by using a formula that reduces the gross receivables balance by factors that take into account historical default and dilution rates  excessive concentrations and average days outstanding and the costs of the facility 
based on the terms of this facility and on the criteria described above  as of december   approximately million of our accounts receivable balance was considered eligible for financing under the program  of which approximately million would have been available for funding 
as of december   we had million of outstanding borrowings under this facility 
this facility is treated as a general financing agreement resulting in the funding and related receivables being shown as liabilities and assets  respectively  on our consolidated balance sheet and the costs associated with the receivables facility being recorded as interest expense

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are subject to inherent risks attributed to operating in a global economy 
we may utilize derivative financial instruments as necessary to manage foreign currency exchange rate risks 
we manage foreign currency exchange risk arising from financial activities pursuant to our corporate guidelines 
forward contracts and  occasionally  swaps and options are utilized to protect these cash flows from adverse movements in exchange rates  and we account for these instruments by marking them to market at each balance sheet date 
we may also employ hedge accounting as permitted by sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
in addition  we use certain foreign currency debt as a hedge of the foreign currency exposure of a portion of our net investment in foreign operations 
upon issuance  we designated the million aggregate principal amount of senior notes due  the million aggregate principal amount of senior subordinated notes due  and the million term loan as a hedge of our net investment in subsidiary companies whose assets  liabilities  and operations are measured using the euro as their functional currency 
because of the high degree of effectiveness between the hedging instruments and the exposure being hedged  fluctuations in the value of the euro denominated debt due to exchange rate changes are offset by changes in the net investment 
accordingly  changes in the value of the euro denominated debt are recognized in foreign currency translation adjustment  a component of accumulated other comprehensive income  to offset changes in the value of our net investment in subsidiary companies whose financial statements are measured using the euro as their functional currency 
we formally assess  on a quarterly basis  whether the euro denominated debt is effective at offsetting changes in the value of the underlying exposure 
for the year ended december   we recorded a million non cash pretax gain in the accumulated foreign currency translation adjustment account related to this hedge 
no hedge ineffectiveness was recorded in income 
we also manage operational transactional foreign currency risk  particularly in emerging markets  by closely managing both pricing and raw material sourcing 
risks associated with foreign exchange translation exposures are not hedged 
we have exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates 
based on our derivative foreign currency instruments outstanding at december  and  a strengthening or weakening in the value of the us dollar relative to the currencies in which those derivative foreign currency instruments are denominated would result in a gain or loss in fair values of less than million and million for the respective year 

table of contents at december   nalco company s forecasted natural gas utility requirements were approximately hedged utilizing natural gas forward contracts at an average cost of per mmbtu 
these contracts had a notional value of million and have delivery dates from january through december based on year end nymex prices  we had a net unrealized loss on our natural gas forward contracts at december  of million 
assuming that year end natural gas prices were to increase or decrease by  the gain or loss in fair value would be approximately million 
at december   we had 
million of variable rate debt 
a increase in the average interest rate would increase future interest expense by approximately million per year 
our sensitivity analysis of the effects of the changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates do not reflect the effect of such changes on the related hedged transactions or on other operating transactions 
the analysis also does not factor in a potential change in the level of variable rate borrowings or derivative instruments outstanding that could take place if these hypothetical conditions prevailed 
we are exposed to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by the other party to the derivative financial instruments 
we limit this exposure by entering into agreements directly with a number of major financial institutions that meet our credit standards and that are expected to satisfy fully their obligations under the contracts 
we view derivative financial instruments as a risk management tool and do not use them for speculative or trading purposes
