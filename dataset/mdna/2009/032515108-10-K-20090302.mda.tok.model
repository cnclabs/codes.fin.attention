item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
overview we are a leading provider of semiconductor solutions in the growing broadband wireless and wireline communications markets 
our products include power amplifiers  tuner integrated circuits  active splitters  line amplifiers and other components  which can be sold individually or packaged as integrated radio frequency and front end modules 
we believe that we are well positioned to capitalize on the high growth voice  data and video segments of the broadband wireless and wireline communications markets 
we offer g products that use the w cdma  edge and wedge standards  g products that use hspa and evdo standards  g products for wimax systems  wifi products that use the a b g and n mimo standards  catv cable modem and set top box products  catv infrastructure products and fttp products 
our business strategy focuses on developing rf front end solutions and partnering with industry leading wireless chipset providers to incorporate our solutions into their reference designs 
our integrated solutions enable our customers to improve rf performance  power efficiency  reliability  time to market and the integration of chip components into single packages  while reducing the size  weight and cost of their products 
we continue to focus on leveraging our technological advantages to remain a leading supplier of semiconductor solutions for broadband wireless and wireline communications 
we believe our patented ingap plus technology  which combines the bipolar technology of a pa hbt pa with the surface device technology of an rf active switch phemt on the same die  provides us with a competitive advantage in the marketplace 
for instance  we believe technologies such as help provide our customers a competitive advantage by enabling their g  g and g devices to consume less battery power and deliver longer talk time than comparable products in their markets 
our six inch diameter gaas fab located at our corporate headquarters in warren  new jersey  has been operational since we are actively exploring future sources of additional manufacturing capacity including pursuing relationships with foundries 
unlike traditional cmos silicon fabs that have short technology lifecycles and require frequent capital investments  gaas fabs are more similar to analog fabs that have long lifecycles and do not become quickly outdated 
our six inch wafer fab allows us to produce more than twice the rf die per wafer compared with the four inch wafer fabs still used by some of our competitors 
although we have achieved annual growth in revenue since  we have experienced a decline in quarterly revenue in the third and fourth quarters of  which has resulted from a combination of a reduction in market share with certain customers and an industry slowdown due to the current macroeconomic environment 
we expect a sequential revenue decline in the first quarter during the fourth quarter of  we announced the implementation of a workforce reduction which eliminated approximately positions 
the workforce reduction along with other cost reduction actions were initiated with a view to achieving annual savings of approximating million to million which we expect to be realized in additionally  in the fourth quarter  we re evaluated and cancelled our previous plans for expanding wafer manufacturing to a facility we were constructing in china 
after evaluating the recoverability of our capital investment in china  we recorded a million impairment charge on that investment 
additionally  after evaluating and discounting future cashflows underlying our goodwill and intangible assets associated with our wifi reporting unit  we have fully impaired those assets  resulting in impairment charges of million 
we believe our markets are  and will continue to remain  competitive which could result in continued quarterly volatility in our net sales 
this competition has resulted in  and is expected over the long term to continue to result in competitive or declining average selling prices for our products and increased challenges in maintaining or increasing market share 
we have only one reportable segment 
for financial information related to such segment and certain geographic areas  see note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
critical accounting policies significant estimates general we believe the following accounting policies are critical to our business operations and the understanding of our results of operations 
such accounting policies may require management to exercise a higher degree of judgment and make estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition revenue from product sales is recognized when title to the products is transferred to the customer  which occurs upon shipment or delivery  depending upon the terms of the sales order 
we sell to certain distributors who are granted limited contractual rights of return and exchange and certain pre negotiated individual product customer price protection 
revenue from sales of our products to distributors is recognized  net of allowances  upon shipment of the products to the distributors 
at the time of shipment  title transfers to the distributors and payment from the distributors is due on our standard commercial terms  payment terms are not contingent upon resale of the products 
revenue is appropriately reduced for the portion of shipments subject to return  exchange or price protection 
allowances for the distributors are recorded upon shipment and calculated based on the distributors indicated intent  historical data  current economic conditions and contractual terms 
we believe we can reasonably and reliably estimate allowances for credits to distributors in a timely manner 
we charge customers for the costs of certain contractually committed inventories that remain at the end of a product s life 
such amounts are recognized as cancellation revenue when cash is received 
the value of the inventory related to cancellation revenue may  in some instances  have been reserved during prior periods in accordance with our inventory obsolescence policy 
allowance for doubtful accounts we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from our customers failure to make payments 
if the financial condition of our customers were to erode  making them unable to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
warranty costs we provide for potential warranty claims by recording a current charge to income 
we estimate potential claims by examining historical returns and other information deemed critical and provide for an amount which we believe will cover future warranty obligations for products sold 
the liability for warranty costs is included in accrued liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets 
stock based compensation we account for stock based compensation costs in accordance with financial accounting standards board statement no 
r  share based payment fas r  which requires the measurement and recognition of compensation expense for all stock based payment awards made to our employees and directors 
under the fair value recognition provisions of fas r  stock based compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized as expense over the requisite service period which in most cases is the vesting period 
determining the fair value of certain awards at the grant date requires considerable judgment  including estimating expected volatility  expected term and risk free interest rate 
our expected volatility has been a combination of both company and peer company historical volatility  which at the time of grant  we deemed reflective of our development as a larger capitalization company 
the expected term of the stock options is based on several factors including historical observations of employee exercise patterns and expectations of employee exercise behavior in the future giving consideration to the contractual terms of the stock based awards 
the risk free interest rate assumption is based on the yield at the time of grant of a us treasury security with an equivalent remaining term 
if factors change and we employ different assumptions  stock based compensation expense may differ significantly from what we have recorded in the past 
marketable securities available for sale securities are stated at fair value  as determined by quoted market prices or  as needed  independent valuation models  with unrealized gains and losses reported in other accumulated comprehensive income or loss 
independent valuations developed to estimate the fair value of illiquid auction rate securities ars were determined using a combination of two calculations a discounted cash flow model  where the expected cash flows of the ars are discounted to the present value using a yield that incorporates compensation for illiquidity  and a market comparables method  where the ars are valued based on indications  from the secondary market  of what discounts buyers demand when purchasing similar ars 
the valuations include numerous assumptions such as assessments of the underling structure of each security  expected cash flows  discount rates  credit ratings  workout periods and overall capital market liquidity 
we review our investments on an ongoing basis for indications of possible impairment  and if an impairment is identified  we determine whether the impairment is temporary or other than temporary  in which case it is recorded as a charge to income 
determination of whether the impairment is temporary or other than temporary requires significant judgment 
unrealized losses are recognized in our consolidated statement of operations when a decline in fair value is determined to be other than temporary 
the primary factors we consider in classifying the impairment are the extent to which and period of time that the fair value of each investment has declined below its cost basis 
inventory inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market lcm  using the first in  first out method 
we capitalize production overhead costs to inventory on the basis of normal capacity of the production facility and in periods of abnormally low utilization we charge the related expenses as a period cost in the statement of operations 
in addition to lcm limitations  we reserve against inventory items for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventory 
the reserve for excess and obsolete inventory is primarily based upon forecasted short term demand for the product 
once established  these write downs are considered permanent adjustments to the cost basis of the excess inventory 
if actual demand and market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional inventory write downs may be required 
in the event we sell inventory that had been covered by a specific inventory reserve  the sale is recorded at the actual selling price and the related cost of goods sold at the full inventory cost  net of the reserve 
long lived assets long lived assets include fixed assets  goodwill and other intangible assets 
we regularly review these assets for indicators of impairment and assess the carrying value of the assets against market values 
when an impairment exists  we record an expense to the extent that the carrying value exceeds fair market value 
goodwill and intangibles impairment goodwill is required to be tested for impairment at the reporting unit level on an annual basis to assess whether the fair value of the reporting unit could be below its carrying value 
our goodwill represents the purchase price in excess of the net amount assigned to assets acquired and liabilities assumed 
the first step of the two step impairment test compares the carrying value of the reporting unit to its fair value calculated using the income approach based on the present value of estimated future cash flows 
the income approach is dependent on a number of significant management assumptions  including estimates of future revenue growth  other operating costs and discount rates 
if the fair value of the unit is less than the carrying value of its net assets  we perform step two of the impairment test 
in step two  we allocate the fair value of the reporting unit to its underlying assets and liabilities as if the reporting unit had been acquired in a business combination and the fair value of the unit was the price paid to acquire the reporting unit 
any excess of the fair value of the reporting unit over the amounts assigned to its assets and liabilities is the implied fair value of goodwill 
during the fourth quarter of  we performed an impairment test on our wifi reporting unit in which our step two analysis resulted in no implied fair value of goodwill and such value was expensed as an impairment charge in our statement of operations 
impairment of long lived assets we assess the impairment of long lived assets  including intangible assets  whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying value may not be recoverable 
factors which could trigger an impairment review include the following significant changes in the manner of use of the assets  significant underperformance relative to historical or projected future operating results  or significant negative industry or economic trends 
an impairment occurs when the future undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by those assets are less than the carrying amount of such assets 
cash flow estimates are based on historical results adjusted to reflect management s best estimate of future market and operating conditions 
the net carrying values of assets not recoverable through future cash flows are reduced to fair value 
estimates of fair value represent management s best estimates based on industry trends  and market rates and transactions 
in connection with completing step two of our goodwill impairment analysis during the fourth quarter of  we assessed the fair values of our related intangible assets  consisting principally of assembled workforce related to the wifi reporting unit and expensed such value as an impairment charge in the statement of operations 
during the fourth quarter of  we evaluated our future options with regard to our investment in constructing a wafer fabrication facility in kunshan china and subsequently estimated and evaluated future cashflows associated with this investment 
such estimates included significant assumptions on possible recoveries through a sale of the facility  further investment  and a return in demand for production capacity and discount rate 
after evaluating the discounted cash flows  we fully impaired the investment and charged such amounts within restructuring and impairment charges in our statement of operations 
long lived assets held for sale are reported at the lower of cost or fair value less costs to sell 
management considers sensitivities to capacity  utilization and technological developments in making its assumptions of fair value 
deferred taxes we record a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that some portion of the amount may not be realized 
during  we determined that it was no longer more likely than not that we would be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax asset in the future  and an adjustment to provide a valuation allowance against the deferred tax asset was charged to income 
we continue to maintain a full valuation allowance on our deferred tax assets 
while we have considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance  in the event we were to determine that we would be able to realize our deferred tax assets in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would increase income in the period such determination was made 
results of operations the following table sets forth statements of operations data as a percentage of net sales for the periods indicated net sales cost of sales gross profit research and development expense selling and administrative expenses restructuring and impairment charges operating loss income interest income interest expense other income loss income from continuing operations loss from discontinued operations net loss income compared to net sales 
net sales for the year ended december  increased to million  compared to net sales for the year ended december  of million 
the net sales improvement was primarily due to increased demand for wireless third generation technologies or g  most significantly wcdma 
net sales for the year ended december  for the company s wireless products increased to million compared to net sales for the year ended december  of million 
the net sales improvement was primarily due to increased demand for power amplifiers for g applications of million or  most significantly in wcdma applications 
the growth in g was partially offset by lower net sales in power amplifiers for gsm of million or  which resulted from the company s shift in market focus to g technologies 
net sales for the year ended december  for the company s broadband products increased to million or compared to net sales for the year ended december  of million 
the net sales improvement was due to increased demand for integrated circuits used in cable set top boxes of million or partly offset by a decline in cable infrastructure and wifi applications of million or 
gross margin 
gross margin for declined to of net sales  compared with of net sales in the prior year 
the decline in gross margin was impacted by million in charges principally comprised of production equipment purchase cancelation charges of million  impairment charges on equipment held for sale of million and million of inventory reserve charges on dedicated inventory which is surplus to reduced customer demand 
in addition  depreciation expense increased by million  which was partially offset by improvements in product mix 
research development 
company sponsored research and development expenses increased during to million from million during the increase was primarily due to an expansion and focus in research and development efforts on new product development  requiring increased staffing and support costs  including automated design tools 
in addition  our purchase of the rf group from fairchild semiconductor on september  which further added to our new product development capability  impacted the year on year comparison in the amount of million  such amount was primarily comprised of staffing related costs 
selling and administrative 
selling and administrative expenses increased during to million from million in the increase included million associated with the departure of our former chief executive officer  including million of stock based compensation upon accelerated vesting of certain equity awards 
the remaining increase was primarily driven by increased staff and outside advisors costs 
restructuring and impairment charges 
during the fourth quarter of  we implemented a workforce reduction which eliminated approximately positions resulting in a restructuring charge of million  principally for severance and related benefits 
during the fourth quarter of  we evaluated alternatives with regard to our investment in the construction of a wafer fabrication facility in kunshan china in light of surplus industry production capacity  reduced demand experienced by the company  as well as the broader macroeconomic environment 
we determined that the carrying amount of the china fabrication building was not recoverable as the carrying amount was greater than the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected from the use and disposition of these assets 
as a result of this impairment analysis  we recorded a full million impairment charge in the fourth quarter of our annual goodwill impairment test determined that the fair value of the wifi reporting unit was less than the carrying value of the net assets of the reporting unit  and thus we performed step two of the impairment test 
our step two analysis resulted in no implied fair value of goodwill and therefore  we recognized an impairment charge of million in the fourth quarter of  representing a write off of the entire amount of our previously recorded goodwill 
in connection with our goodwill impairment analysis  we also assessed the fair values of our related intangible assets  which carried an unamortized value of million consisting principally of assembled workforce related to the wifi reporting unit noting it was similarly impaired and charged the remaining unamortized carrying value to restructuring and impairment charges 
interest income 
interest income decreased to million during from million in the decrease was primarily due to lower interest rates globally as we reinvested funds and concentrated our investments in shorter term vehicles which carried federal deposit insurance 
interest expense 
interest expense was essentially flat at million in compared to million in the interest expense arises from obligations under our convertible senior notes due in october notes 
other expense 
other expense was million in compared to million in and included charges for other than temporary declines in value on certain auction rate securities ars held by the company of million and million respectively 
while interest continues to be paid currently by all the issuers of these ars  due to the severity of the decline in fair value and the duration of time for which these ars have been in a loss position  the company concluded that ars held at december  experienced an other than temporary decline in fair value and recorded impairment charges of million for the year ended december  additionally during  a corporate debt ars position was exchanged for the underlying year notes 
this debt trades in the market with a value of million against its face value of million 
due to the severity and duration of the decline  the company has recorded an impairment of million related to this security 
loss from discontinued operations 
loss from discontinued operations was million and included million loss on the sale of the majority of the operating assets of telcom devices inc upon its sale at the close of the first quarter of compared to net sales 
net sales for the year ended december  increased to million  compared to net sales for the year ended december  of million 
the net sales improvement was primarily due to increased demand for wireless third generation technologies or g consisting of cdma evdo  edge  wedge  and w cdma power amplifiers used in wireless handsets and hand held devices and increased demand for broadband products such as wifi power amplifiers used in wireless personal computer access and rf integrated circuits used in cable and broadband applications 
specifically  net sales for the year ended december  for the company s wireless products increased to million compared to net sales for the year ended december  of million 
the net sales improvement was primarily due to increased demand for power amplifiers for g applications of million or  which was partially offset by lower net sales in power amplifiers for gsm of million or  which resulted from the company s shift in market focus to g technologies 
specifically  net sales for the year ended december  for the company s broadband products increased to million or compared to net sales for the year ended december  of million 
the net sales improvement was primarily due to increased demand for power amplifiers for wifi applications of million or and integrated circuits used in cable and infrastructure applications of million or 
geographically  net sales in asia increased to million from million in the increase was primarily driven by the increased demand for our wifi and g products 
gross margin 
gross margin for improved to of net sales  compared with of net sales in the prior year 
the improvement in gross margin was primarily due to the product mix of g technologies and wifi applications further supported by improved cost absorption generated through increased production volumes 
research development 
company sponsored research and development expenses increased during to million from million during the increase was primarily due to an expansion and focus in research and development efforts on new product development  which required increased staffing costs 
additionally  on september  we purchased the rf group from fairchild semiconductor  which included the hiring a staff of employees 
non cash stock based compensation expense accounted for an increase of million in over selling and administrative 
selling and administrative expenses increased during to million from million in the increase was primarily due to increased sales and marketing efforts focused on addressing existing and potential market opportunities in g  wifi and broadband 
non cash stock based compensation expense accounted for an increase of million in over interest income 
interest income increased to million during from million in the increase was primarily due to higher average funds invested as a result of our underwritten public offering of million shares of common stock in march of the march offering and higher interest rates 
interest expense 
interest expense decreased to million in from million in in  interest expense arose from obligations under our convertible senior notes due in notes whereas in our convertible senior notes due in notes was also outstanding 
in november  we repaid the remaining million aggregate principal amount outstanding of our notes 
loss from discontinued operations 
loss from discontinued operations was million compared with million in the loss from discontinued operations in included million loss on the sale of telcom upon its sale at the close of the first quarter of other expense 
other expense was million in  for which  million was recorded for an other than temporary decline in value on certain auction rate securities held by the company 
this was partly offset by gains on foreign currency transactions 
liquidity and sources of capital at december  we had million of cash and cash equivalents on hand and million in marketable securities 
the cash and cash equivalents were primarily comprised of fully federally insured accounts and investments 
we had million aggregate principal amount of our notes outstanding as of december operations generated million in cash during  primarily as a result of our operating results adjusted for non cash expenses 
changes in operating assets and liabilities also provided cash as accounts receivable declined consistent with our revenue decline in the third and fourth quarters 
investing activities provided million of cash during  consisting principally of net sales of marketable securities of million  partially offset by purchases of equipment of million 
financing activities provided million of cash in  primarily consisting of proceeds received from employee stock option exercises 
at december   the company had unconditional purchase obligations of approximately million  of which million relates to capital equipment purchase requirements primarily over the first half of by february   we signed termination agreements with our development partner ksnd and construction contractor covering further development of our construction of a wafer fabrication facility in kunshan china 
those termination agreements limit obligations for further investment in the facility to those included within accrued liabilities in our december  financial statements 
we believe that our existing sources of capital  including our existing cash and marketable securities  will be adequate to satisfy operational needs  repayment of our million convertible notes and anticipated capital needs for at least the next twelve months 
our anticipated capital needs may include acquisitions of complimentary businesses or technologies  investments in other companies or repurchases of our outstanding debt or equity 
subject to liquidity considerations of our auction rate securities as discussed more fully in item a  we may elect to finance all or part of our future capital requirements through additional equity or debt financing 
there can be no assurance that such additional financing would be available on satisfactory terms

fas defines fair value as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date exit price 
fas classifies the inputs used to measure fair value into the following hierarchy level unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities level unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for similar assets or liabilities  or unadjusted quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active  or inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability level unobservable inputs for the asset or liability we endeavor to utilize the best available information in measuring fair value

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we have invested the primary portion of our cash and cash equivalents in fully federally insured accounts and investments to protect against risks associated with liquidity and credit quality 
our cash and available for sale securities are exposed to changes in short term interest rates 
our available for sale securities consist primarily of fixed income investments  including corporate bonds  certificates of deposit  a government sponsored enterprise security and certain auction rate securities discussed more specifically below 
we continually monitor our exposure to changes in interest rates and the credit ratings of issuers with respect to our available for sale securities 
accordingly  we believe that the effects of changes in interest rates and the credit ratings of these issuers are limited and would not have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations 
however  it is possible that we would be at risk if interest rates or the credit ratings of these issuers were to change in an unfavorable direction 
the magnitude of any gain or loss would be a function of the difference between the fixed rate of the financial instrument and the market rate and our financial condition and results of operations could be materially affected 
at december   we held marketable securities with an estimated fair value of million  of which million is fully guaranteed by the federal government 
our primary interest rate exposure results from changes in short term interest rates 
we do not purchase financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
all of our marketable securities are classified as available for sale securities 
the following table provides information about our marketable securities at december  estimated principal amount and weighted average stated interest rate by expected maturity value fair value s years total s principal weighted average stated interest rates the stated rates of interest expressed in the above table may not approximate the actual yield of the securities which we currently hold since we have valued some of our marketable securities at other than face value 
additionally  some of the securities represented in the above table may be called or redeemed  at the option of the issuer  prior to their expected due dates 
if such early redemptions occur  we may reinvest the proceeds realized on such calls or redemptions in marketable securities with stated rates of interest or yields that are lower than those of our current holdings  which would affect both future cash interest streams and future earnings 
we invest our cash in money market funds in order to maintain liquidity and access to federal insurance guarantees on these funds as well as fund operations and hold cash pending investments in marketable securities 
fluctuations in short term interest rates will affect the yield on monies invested in such money market funds 
such fluctuations can have an impact on our future cash interest streams and future earnings  but the impact of such fluctuations are not expected to be material 
all of our investment securities are classified as available for sale and therefore reported on our balance sheet at market value 
as of december   our investments included million of auction rate securities ars 
ars are debt instruments with a long term maturity and with an interest rate that is reset in short intervals through auctions 
during the second half of  certain auction rate debt and preferred securities failed to auction due to sell orders exceeding buy orders 
in february  liquidity issues in the global credit markets resulted in failures of the auction process for a broader range of ars  impacting all of the auction rate preferred equity  state and municipal and corporate debt securities the company held 
when there is insufficient demand for the securities at the time of an auction and the auction is not completed  the interest rates resets to predetermined higher rates default rates 
while certain issuers redeemed certain of their ars during  the market remained constrained by illiquidity and the lack of free trading 
the funds associated with the remaining failed auctions will not be accessible until a successful auction occurs  a buyer is found outside of the auction process or an issuer redeems its security 
if the credit ratings of the security issuers deteriorate and any decline in market value is determined to be other than temporary  we would be required to adjust the carrying value of the investment through an additional impairment charge 
to date  we have not realized any losses on ars held by the company or the notes received in exchange for an ars  but have recognized other than temporary impairments of million 
we may not be able to access cash by selling auction rate securities for which there is insufficient demand without the loss of principal until a future auction for these investments is successful  they are redeemed by their issuer or they mature 
if we are unable to sell these securities in the market or they are not redeemed  then we may be required to hold them to maturity perpetuity 
we do not have a need to access these funds for operational purposes for the foreseeable future 
we will continue to monitor and evaluate these investments on an ongoing basis for impairment or for short term classification 
based on our ability to access our cash and other short term investments  our expected operating cash flows  and our other sources of cash  we do not anticipate that the potential illiquidity of these investments will affect our ability to execute our current business plan 
our notes are convertible and bear a fixed rate of interest of 
a change in interest rates on long term debt is assumed to impact fair value but not earnings or cash flow because the interest rate is fixed 
at december   the fair value of our outstanding convertible notes  estimated based upon dealer quotes  was approximately million
