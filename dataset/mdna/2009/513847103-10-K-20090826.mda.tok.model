we then provide a review of the critical accounting policies and estimates that we believe are most important to an understanding of our md a and our consolidated financial statements 
we conclude our md a with information on recently issued accounting pronouncements 
the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the selected financial data and our consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto  all included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
the forward looking statements in this section and other parts of this report involve risks and uncertainties including statements regarding our plans  objectives  goals  strategies  and financial performance 
our actual results could differ materially from the results anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of factors set forth under the caption forward looking statements 
executive summary business overview lancaster colony corporation is a diversified manufacturer and marketer of consumer products focusing primarily on specialty foods for the retail and foodservice markets 
we also manufacture and market candles for the food  drug and mass markets 
less significantly  we are also engaged in the distribution of various products  including glassware and candles  to commercial markets 
our operations are organized in two reportable segments specialty foods and glassware and candles 
over of the sales of each segment are made to customers in the united states 
in recent years  our strategy has shifted away from operating businesses in a variety of industries towards emphasizing the growth and success we have achieved in our specialty foods segment 
fiscals and were significant years in implementing this strategy as we divested nonfood operations and focused our capital investment in the specialty foods segment 
in june  we sold substantially all of the assets of our remaining automotive operations 
in november  we sold most of our consumer and floral glass operating assets 
these transactions  combined with other strategic dispositions and investments in and  have resulted in transforming our company into a predominately food focused business 
see further discussion of these divestitures in note in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
in  approximately of our consolidated net sales and effectively all of our operating income were derived from the specialty foods segment 
for perspective  in  our specialty foods segment comprised approximately and of our reported consolidated net sales and operating income  respectively 
below is a list of the material transactions and other events in and that contributed toward our transition to a food focused business june sale of the remaining automotive operations  ending the previously reported automotive segment  november sale of substantially all of the operating assets of our consumer and floral glass operations  september substantial completion and operational start up of new frozen yeast roll facility in horse cave  kentucky 
this facility adjoins the dressing facility noted below and allows us to take advantage of various synergies  june sale of our automotive accessory operations based in coshocton  ohio and lagrange  georgia  
table of contents june acquisition of marshall biscuit company  inc marshall biscuit  march sale of automotive accessory operations in wapakoneta  ohio  march initiated closure of our industrial glass operations located in lancaster  ohio  and fall operational start up of new dressing facility in horse cave  kentucky 
although we have made substantial progress in implementing our new strategy  we continue to own the candle operations referred to above 
due to existing market conditions  further progress on our strategic evaluation of these operations may not be imminent 
however  we will continue to review our options and may revisit our efforts as market conditions improve 
our only other remaining nonfood operation is primarily engaged in distributing glassware  candles and other products to commercial markets 
this operation is not material to our consolidated operations  and we continue to review various strategic alternatives with respect to this operation 
our current strategy focuses our efforts on the most profitable part of our business and minimizes the amount of financial and management resources devoted to sectors that have trended toward lower growth potential and operating margins 
in  our results were adversely affected by high commodity and petroleum costs  but we took several steps  including initiating price increases  intended to mitigate these higher costs 
these steps proved successful in as our fiscal year net sales rose by and operating income rose to of net sales versus of net sales in the prior year 
without distraction from significant issues previously posed by our divested automotive and glassware businesses  we believe we are now better positioned to maximize the future potential of our specialty foods segment 
we view our food operations as having the potential to achieve future growth in sales and profitability due to attributes such as leading retail market positions in several branded products with a high quality perception  a broad customer base in both retail and foodservice accounts  well regarded culinary expertise among foodservice accounts  recognized leadership in foodservice product development  demonstrated experience in integrating complementary business acquisitions  and historically strong cash flow generation that supports growth opportunities 
our goal is to continue to grow our specialty foods retail and foodservice business by leveraging the strength of our retail brands to increase current product sales and introduce new products  continuing to grow our foodservice sales through the strength of our reputation in product development and quality  and pursuing acquisitions that meet our strategic criteria 
within retail markets  our specialty foods group utilizes numerous branded products to support growth and maintain market competitiveness 
we place great emphasis on our product innovation and development efforts so as to enhance growth by providing distinctive new products meeting the evolving needs and preferences of consumers 
our foodservice sales primarily consist of products sold to restaurant chains 
we have experienced broad based growth in our foodservice sales  as we build on our strong reputation for product development and quality 
we expect that part of our long term growth in the specialty foods segment will result from acquisitions 
we continue to review potential acquisitions that we believe will provide good complements to our existing product lines  enhance our gross margins or offer good expansion opportunities in a manner that fits our overall goals 
consistent with this strategy  in june  we acquired the principal assets of marshall biscuit  a privately owned producer and marketer of frozen yeast rolls and biscuits based in saraland  
table of contents alabama 
the purchase price was approximately million  and the transaction is discussed in further detail in note in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
as noted above  we recently made substantial capital investments to support our existing food operations and future growth opportunities 
in  we began production activities at a newly constructed dressing facility located in kentucky 
our investment in constructing this facility exceeded million 
during  we also commenced and largely completed construction of an adjacent facility for the manufacture of frozen yeast rolls 
this facility required a slightly smaller total investment and began operation in early both projects will help accommodate potential future sales growth and also provide greater manufacturing efficiencies 
based on our current plans and expectations  we believe that total capital expenditures for will be approximately million 
summary of results the following is an overview of our consolidated operating results for the year ended june  the prior year results reflect the classification of the sold automotive operations as discontinued operations 
there were no discontinued operations in consolidated net sales reached approximately  million during  increasing as compared to prior year sales of million  driven by growth coming from our specialty foods segment as partially offset by a decline in glassware and candles segment sales 
the specialty foods segment s growth benefited both from pricing actions  as well as higher volumes in both the retail and foodservice markets 
the decrease in sales of the glassware and candles segment is primarily attributable to the november sale of our consumer and floral glass operations  as well as the prior year disposition of inventory related to closing our industrial glassware facility 
net sales attributable to these divested and closed operations totaled approximately million in gross margin increased to approximately million from the prior year comparable total of million 
pricing actions taken during the year and a more favorable trend in raw material costs during the last six months of the year contributed to the higher gross margin 
overall results were also affected by the funds received under cdsoa 
in  we received approximately million under cdsoa  as compared to approximately million in and approximately million in for a more detailed discussion of cdsoa  see the subcaption other income continued dumping and subsidy offset act of this md a 
income from continuing operations for the current year was approximately million  or per diluted share  compared to million  or per diluted share  in the prior year 
net income totaled approximately million in  or per diluted share  compared to net income of million  or per diluted share  in  which was net of an after tax loss from discontinued operations of approximately million  or 
per diluted share 
the prior year loss on sale from discontinued operations was approximately million  or 
per diluted share 
net income in totaled approximately million  or per diluted share  and was inclusive of an after tax loss from discontinued operations of approximately million  or 
per diluted share 
the loss on the sale of discontinued operations was approximately million  or 
per diluted share 
looking forward even though the current general economic conditions pose various challenges to our markets  we hope to attain growth in consolidated sales during  primarily by introducing new products  pursuing growth with existing customers and expanding our market presence 
however  any revenue growth from additional sales may be at least partially offset by downward pricing adjustments in certain of our foodservice supply arrangements that occur as a result of lower key ingredient costs 
we will also continue to review acquisition opportunities within the specialty foods segment that are consistent with our growth strategy  represent good value or otherwise provide significant strategic benefits 
within our specialty foods segment  we anticipate that the comparatively lower ingredient costs we have seen in the last half of may generally persist and yield favorable comparisons during at least the first half of we also anticipate  however  that our year over year comparative benefit from past pricing 
table of contents actions is basically complete as we have lapped prior retail price increases 
in addition  it is possible that a recovery in general economic conditions and other changes in the economy and regulatory environment could cause a sharp increase in the costs of food commodities and other raw materials 
to help offset or stabilize the impact of rising commodity costs  we have pursued other operational strategies that we believe will aid our future results 
for instance  as part of our cost reduction efforts  we consolidated our atlanta production operations into our other existing facilities in early we are continuing to limit some of our exposure to volatile swings in food commodity costs through a structured purchasing program for certain future requirements 
with respect to our glassware and candles segment  we implemented higher pricing among selected products during we anticipate that may benefit from these pricing actions  higher production levels and the likelihood of somewhat lower wax costs attainable in at least the first half of for a more detailed discussion of the effect of commodity costs  see the impact of inflation section of this md a below 
in order to ensure that our capitalization is adequate to support our future internal growth prospects  acquire food businesses consistent with our strategic goals  and maintain cash returns to our shareholders through cash dividends and share repurchases  we will need to maintain sufficient flexibility in our future capital structure 
we will continue to reassess our allocation of capital periodically  as well as the timing  nature and extent of our share repurchase activities  to ensure that we maintain adequate operating flexibility while providing appropriate levels of cash returns to our shareholders 
review of consolidated operations segment sales mix the relative proportion of sales contributed by each of our business segments can impact a year to year comparison of the consolidated statements of income 
the following table summarizes the sales mix over each of the last three years segment sales mix specialty foods glassware and candles net sales and gross margin year ended june change dollars in thousands vs 
vs 
net sales specialty foods glassware and candles total gross margin gross margin as a percentage of sales consolidated net sales for the year ended june  increased to approximately  million from the prior year total of approximately million 
the sales growth was driven by increased sales in the specialty foods segment as partially offset by a decline in sales of the glassware and candles segment 
the specialty foods segment s growth benefited from pricing actions  as well as higher volumes in both the retail and foodservice markets 
all such growth was internally generated 
the decrease in net sales of the glassware and candles segment is primarily attributable to the november sale of our consumer and floral glass operations and the prior year disposition of inventory related to closing our industrial glassware facility 
net sales attributable to these divested and closed operations totaled approximately million in consolidated net sales for the year ended june  increased over the total of approximately million 
this increase was due to the same factors largely contributing to the increase over including higher specialty foods segment sales on increased pricing and volumes  offset

net sales attributable to the divested and closed businesses totaled approximately million in our gross margin as a percentage of net sales was approximately in compared with in and in in the specialty foods segment  gross margin percentages improved in  benefiting from both pricing actions and higher sales volumes  which offset the adverse impact of higher ingredient costs incurred during the first half of the fiscal year 
we estimate the year over year unfavorable impact of commodity costs at approximately million 
gross margin percentages in the glassware and candles segment declined from the prior year due to higher wax costs  declines in candle sales and lower capacity utilization within candle manufacturing operations 
relative to  we encountered markedly higher raw material costs in  especially for key food commodities and wax 
increased food pricing generally lagged the timing of cost increases and did not fully recover their impact 
also affecting results were a charge of approximately million recorded in cost of sales for the loss on the sale of our consumer and floral glass operations  a pension settlement charge of approximately million recorded in corporate expenses and income of approximately million to reflect a favorable adjustment of prior year self insured deductibles under our general liability insurance

we wrote off approximately million related to this bankruptcy in the decrease in selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales was influenced by the extent to which the higher sales leveraged our existing selling and organizational infrastructure 
restructuring and impairment charge specialty foods segment in the first quarter of  we began consolidating our atlanta dressing operation into our other existing food facilities as part of our cost reduction efforts within the specialty foods segment 
during  we recorded related restructuring and impairment charges of approximately million million after taxes 
the majority of these charges resulted in cash outlays and consisted of one time termination benefits 
this closure was essentially complete at september  the disposition of the associated real estate occurred in december and resulted in a gain of approximately million  which is recorded in cost of sales 
we do not expect any other costs or cash expenditures related to this closure

the operations of this closed unit have not been reclassified to discontinued operations under the guidance provided in sfas during  we recorded additional charges of approximately million million after taxes  including less than million recorded in cost of sales for the write down of inventories  for costs incurred during the period 
the majority of these charges were for disposal related activities associated with idle real property 
during  we recorded additional restructuring and impairment charges of approximately million million after taxes for costs incurred during the period 
the majority of these charges were for disposal related activities associated with idle real property 
these charges were recorded within corporate expenses as the remaining assets and liabilities from this closed operation are now considered corporate assets and liabilities 
the total costs associated with this plant closure were approximately million and include all of the above noted costs 
this closure was essentially complete at september  we do not currently expect other significant restructuring costs related to this closure

the total had decreased from operating income totaling approximately million 
see further discussion of operating results by segment following the discussion of net income below 
interest expense we incurred interest expense of approximately million in related to long term borrowings 
higher levels of indebtedness resulted in interest expense of approximately million in as compared to less than million in the current year decrease in interest expense was due to lower interest rates on our debt as well as an overall decrease in average borrowing levels 
we had no outstanding borrowings at june  other income continued dumping and subsidy offset act the cdsoa provides for the distribution of monies collected by us customs from antidumping cases to qualifying domestic producers 
our reported cdsoa receipts totaled approximately million  million and million in  and  respectively 
these remittances related to certain candles being imported from the people s republic of china 
legislation was enacted in february to repeal the applicability of the cdsoa to duties collected on products imported after september however  all duties collected on an entry filed before october  will continue to be available for distribution under former section c of the cdsoa 
accordingly  we may receive some level of annual distributions for an undetermined period of years in the future as the monies collected that relate to entries filed prior to october are administratively finalized by us customs 
without further legislative action  we expect these distributions will eventually cease 
the uncertainties surrounding the legislative and administrative challenges have been compounded by cases brought in us courts challenging the cdsoa 
in two separate cases  the cit ruled that the procedure for determining recipients eligible to receive cdsoa distributions is unconstitutional 
the us court of appeals for the federal circuit reversed one of the cit decisions in february  but the case remains subject to further appeal 
the second cit case has been stayed pending resolution of this appeal 
other cases remain pending that challenge certain aspects of the cdsoa  any of which could affect the amount of funds available for distribution  including funds relating to entries prior to october the extent to which we may receive any future cdsoa distributions is subject to the legal challenges and uncertainties described above 
accordingly  we cannot predict the amount of future distributions  and it is possible that we may not receive any further distributions 
any reduction in cdsoa distributions could reduce our earnings and cash flow

segment review specialty foods net sales of the specialty foods segment during surpassed the record level achieved in  and operating income of approximately million increased from the level of million 
the benefits from both pricing actions and higher sales volumes offset the adverse impact of higher ingredient costs incurred during the first half of the fiscal year 
net sales during totaled approximately million  a increase over the prior year total of million 
sales for increased over the total of approximately million 
the percentage of retail customer sales within the segment was approximately during and  as compared to in we estimate that more than half of the specialty foods segment s sales growth was derived from pricing actions  although we also attained higher volumes in both the retail and foodservice markets 
recently introduced new york brand products such as texas toast croutons  pizzeria dip n sticks and ciabatta cheese rolls contributed to the volume growth 
in foodservice markets  our sales increase was broad based with growth among various customers and product lines  including dressings and sauces  frozen rolls and frozen pasta 
in  net sales of the specialty foods segment also benefited from improved pricing and greater sales volumes of both retail and foodservice products 
the retail increases occurred 
table of contents among numerous product lines  including frozen yeast rolls  produce dressings and dips  and croutons 
retail sales in further benefited from the incremental sales totaling approximately million from marshall biscuit  which was acquired in june also influencing the relative comparability of was the adverse effect on prior year sales resulting from consumer food safety concerns regarding fresh produce  which indirectly affected sales of related products such as our retail produce dressings and vegetable dips 
the foodservice increases in occurred generally through broad foodservice growth and improved pricing 
operating income of the specialty foods segment in totaled approximately million  a increase from the total of million 
the level was lower than the level of million 
the increase primarily reflects higher pricing and greater sales volumes 
these improvements offset the adverse impact of higher ingredient costs incurred during the first half of the fiscal year 
we estimate the unfavorable year over year impact of commodity costs at approximately million 
substantially and broadly higher food commodity costs were a significant factor in our results 
many key commodities  such as soybean oil and flour  reached record highs 
we estimate that the extent of such increased costs exceeded the levels by more than million  and only about half of these increases could be recovered through higher pricing 
of much lesser impact were higher energy costs  increased segment depreciation and amortization  and start up costs in the first half of associated with the opening of a new frozen roll facility 
segment review glassware and candles glassware and candles segment sales totaled approximately million during  as compared to million in and million in the declines in net sales of the glassware and candles segment for and were influenced by the sale of our consumer and floral glass operations in november  as well as the earlier closure of our industrial glassware facility 
net sales attributable to these divested and closed operations totaled approximately million in and approximately million in the decline was also affected by lower candle sales 
unsettled economic and competitive retail market conditions contributed to this decline 
candle sales in were also adversely affected by softer holiday season sales  as influenced by certain seasonal programs from that were not repeated in and generally lackluster retail market conditions 
the segment recorded an operating loss of approximately million and million during and  respectively  decreasing from operating income of approximately million in the decline reflects the decrease in candle sales  higher wax costs and lower capacity utilization 
comparisons to were affected by the approximately million loss recorded in cost of sales from the november sale of our consumer and floral glass operations  as well as the loss of subsequent contribution from these operations over the balance of margins for as compared to were also adversely affected by rising wax input costs and lower candle production levels 
however  the results also reflected a restructuring charge of approximately million  including million recorded in cost of sales for the write down of inventories  related to the closure of our industrial glass manufacturing facility located in lancaster  ohio 
we began implementing higher pricing on various candle products during we anticipate that recent comparative declines in wax costs and improved capacity utilization may begin to benefit the segment s cost of goods sold in future results may also remain sensitive to capacity utilization rates due to the relatively high level of fixed manufacturing costs that exists in this segment 
corporate expenses the corporate expenses totaled approximately million as compared to million in and million in the decrease in the expenses of approximately million from relates to encompassing a pension settlement charge of approximately million associated with one of our divested automotive operations 
on a comparative basis  this decrease was somewhat offset by expenses including restructuring and other costs related to divested and closed operations 
the increase in the corporate expenses of approximately million as compared to primarily relates to the inclusion of the previously mentioned million pension settlement 
also contributing to this increase

financial condition liquidity and capital resources in order to ensure that our capitalization is adequate to support our future internal growth prospects  acquire food businesses consistent with our strategic goals  and maintain cash returns to our shareholders through cash dividends and share repurchases  we will need to maintain sufficient flexibility in our future capital structure 
our balance sheet retained fundamental financial strength during  and we ended the year with approximately million in cash and equivalents at june   along with shareholders equity in excess of million and no debt 
on october   we entered into a new unsecured revolving credit facility  which replaced the credit facility existing on september  under the new facility  we may borrow up to a maximum of million at any one time 
loans may be used for general corporate purposes 
we had no borrowings outstanding under this facility at june  the facility expires on october   and all outstanding amounts are due and payable on that day 
the facility contains certain restrictive covenants  including limitations on indebtedness  asset sales and acquisitions  and financial covenants relating to interest coverage and leverage 
at june   we were in compliance with all applicable provisions and covenants of the facility  and we met the requirements of the financial covenants by substantial margins 
we currently expect to remain in compliance with the facility s covenants for the foreseeable future 
a default under the facility could accelerate the repayment of our outstanding indebtedness and limit our access to additional credit available under the facility 
such an event could require curtailment of cash dividends or share repurchases  reduce or delay beneficial expansion or investment plans  or otherwise impact our ability to meet our obligations when due 
at june   we were not aware of any event that would constitute a default under the facility 
we believe that internally generated funds and our existing aggregate balances in cash and equivalents  in addition to our currently available bank credit arrangements  should be adequate to meet our foreseeable cash requirements 
if we were to borrow outside of our credit facility under current market terms  our average interest rate may increase significantly and have an adverse effect on our results of operations

cash flow generated from operations remains the primary source of financing for our internal growth 
cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations in totaled approximately million  an increase of as compared with the prior year total of million  which decreased from the total of million

based on our current plans and expectations  we believe that total capital expenditures for will be approximately million 
financing activities used net cash totaling approximately million  million and million in  and  respectively 
the decrease is due primarily to a decrease in treasury share repurchases and an increase in proceeds from the exercise of stock options  as partially offset by the net change in borrowing activity and a decrease in the cash overdraft balance 
the increase in cash used for financing activities is due primarily to increased treasury share repurchases as well as relative changes in net borrowing activities

impact of inflation our manufacturing costs during  and were influenced by substantially higher raw material costs  especially for various key food commodities and candle wax 
the year over year increases in raw material costs for the specialty foods segment is estimated at approximately million in and to have exceeded million in by the second half of  prices for food commodities turned favorable on a year over year basis for the first time since  but remained above long term  historic levels 
it appears that a long term trend toward markedly higher costs for certain commodities  such as soybean oil and flour  may be sustainable 
historically  our diversity of operations has helped minimize our exposure to some raw material costs 
as we focus more on our food operations  however  our results of operations have become more sensitive to increased prices in food commodities 
over the course of and  we adjusted various selling prices of food products to offset the effects of increased raw material costs 
however  these adjustments generally lagged the increase in our costs  having a net positive impact on our operating margins and a net negative impact in during  any revenue growth from additional sales may be at least partially offset by downward pricing adjustments in certain of our foodservice supply arrangements that occur as a result of lower key ingredient costs 
we also attempt to minimize the exposure to increased costs through our ongoing efforts to achieve greater manufacturing and distribution efficiencies through the improvement of work processes 
critical accounting policies and estimates this md a discusses our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires that we make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates and judgments  including  but not limited to  those related to accounts receivable  inventories  marketing and distribution costs  asset impairments and self insurance reserves 
we base our estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments 
table of contents about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
historically  the aggregate differences  if any  between our estimates and actual amounts in any year have typically not had a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements 
while a summary of our significant accounting policies can be found in note in the notes to the consolidated financial statements  we believe the following critical accounting policies  among others  affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue upon transfer of title and risk of loss provided evidence of an arrangement exists  pricing is fixed or determinable  and collectability is probable 
net sales are recorded net of estimated sales discounts  returns and certain sales incentives  including coupons and rebates 
receivables and the allowance for doubtful accounts we provide an allowance for doubtful accounts based on the aging of accounts receivable balances and historical write off experience and on going reviews of our trade receivables 
measurement of potential losses requires credit review of existing customer relationships  consideration of historical loss experience  including the need to adjust for current conditions  and judgments about the probable effects of relevant observable data  including present economic conditions such as delinquency rates and the economic health of customers 
in addition to credit concerns  we also evaluate the adequacy of our allowances for customer deductions considering several factors including historical losses and existing customer relationships 
valuation of inventory when necessary  we provide allowances to adjust the carrying value of our inventory to the lower of cost or net realizable value  including any costs to sell or dispose 
the determination of whether inventory items are slow moving  obsolete or in excess of needs requires estimates about the future demand for our products 
the estimates as to future demand used in the valuation of inventory are subject to the ongoing success of our products and may differ from actual due to such factors as changes in customer and consumer demand 
a decrease in product demand due to changing customer tastes  consumer buying patterns or loss of shelf space to competitors could significantly impact our evaluation of our excess and obsolete inventories 
long lived assets we monitor the recoverability of the carrying value of our long lived assets by periodically considering whether or not indicators of impairment are present 
if such indicators are present  we determine if the assets are recoverable by comparing the sum of the undiscounted future cash flows to the assets carrying amount 
our cash flows are based on historical results adjusted to reflect our best estimate of future market and operating conditions 
if the carrying amounts are greater  then the assets are not recoverable 
in that instance  we compare the carrying amounts to the fair value to determine the amount of the impairment to be recorded 
goodwill and intangible assets goodwill is not amortized 
it is evaluated annually  at april  through asset impairment testing as appropriate 
intangible assets with lives restricted by contractual  legal  or other means are amortized over their useful lives 
we periodically evaluate the future economic benefit of the recorded goodwill and intangible assets when events or circumstances indicate potential recoverability concerns 
carrying amounts are adjusted appropriately when determined to have been impaired 
accrued marketing and distribution various marketing programs are offered to customers to reimburse them for a portion or all of their promotional activities related to our products 
additionally  we often incur various costs associated with shipping products to the customer 
we provide accruals for the costs of marketing and distribution based on historical information as may be modified by estimates of actual costs incurred 
actual costs may differ significantly if factors such as the level and success of the customers programs  changes in customer utilization practices  or other conditions differ from expectations 

table of contents accruals for self insurance self insurance accruals are made for certain claims associated with employee health care  workers compensation and general liability insurance 
these accruals include estimates that may be based on historical loss development factors 
differences in estimates and assumptions could result in an accrual requirement materially different from the calculated accrual 
accounting for pension plans and other postretirement benefit plans to determine our ultimate obligation under our defined benefit pension plans and our other postretirement benefit plans  we must estimate the future cost of benefits and attribute that cost to the time period during which each covered employee works 
to record the related net assets and obligation of such benefit plans  we use assumptions related to inflation  investment returns  mortality  employee turnover  medical costs and discount rates 
to determine the discount rate  we  along with our third party actuaries  considered several factors  including the june  rates of various bond indices  such as the moody s aa long term bond index  yield curve analysis results from our actuaries based on expected cash flows of our plans  and the past history of discount rates used for the plan valuation 
we  along with our third party actuaries  review all of these assumptions on an ongoing basis to ensure that the most reasonable information available is being considered 
changes in assumptions and future investment returns could potentially have a material impact on pension expense and related funding requirements 
upon adoption in of sfas no 
 employers accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans  we recognized the overfunded or underfunded status of our defined benefit plans as an asset or liability in our consolidated balance sheet 
we recognize changes in that funded status  caused by subsequent plan revaluations  through comprehensive income 
as most of our defined benefit plans and post employment obligations relate to nonfood operations that have been divested or closed  we may also experience future plan settlements or curtailments having unanticipated effects on operating results

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we have exposure to market risks primarily from changes in interest rates and ingredient prices 
we have not had any material exposure to market risk associated with derivative financial instruments or derivative commodity instruments 
interest rate risk we are subject to interest rate risk primarily associated with our borrowings 
interest rate risk is the risk that changes in interest rates could adversely affect earnings and cash flows 
rates under our credit facility are set at the time of each borrowing and are based on predetermined formulas connected to certain benchmark rates 
increases in these rates could have an adverse impact on our earnings and cash flows 
at current borrowing levels  we do not believe that a hypothetical adverse change of in interest rates would have a material effect on our financial position 
at the end of  we had no borrowings outstanding under our credit facility 
the nature and amount of our borrowings may vary as a result of business requirements  market conditions and other factors 
commodity price risk we purchase a variety of commodities and other materials  such as soybean oil  flour  wax and packaging materials  which we use to manufacture our products 
the market prices for these commodities are subject to fluctuation based upon a number of economic factors and may become volatile at times 
while we do not use any derivative commodity instruments to hedge against commodity price risk  we do actively manage a portion of the risk through a structured purchasing program for certain future requirements 
this program gives us more predictable input costs  which may help stabilize our margins during periods of volatility in commodity markets
