ebitda is included in this annual report on form k because our management considers it an important supplemental measure of our performance and believes that it is frequently used by securities analysts  investors and other interested parties in the evaluation of companies in our industry  some of which present ebitda when reporting their results 
we regularly evaluate our performance as compared to other companies in our industry that have different financing and capital structures and or tax rates by using ebitda 
in addition  we use ebitda in evaluating acquisition targets 
management also believes that ebitda is a useful tool for measuring our ability to meet our future debt service  capital expenditures and working capital requirements  and ebitda is commonly used by us and our investors to measure our ability to service indebtedness 
ebitda is not a substitute for the gaap measures of earnings or of cash flow and is not necessarily a measure of our 
table of contents ability to fund our cash needs 
in addition  it should be noted that companies calculate ebitda differently and  therefore  ebitda has material limitations as a performance measure because it excludes interest expense  taxes  depreciation and amortization and minority interest

overview we are a leading provider of specialized services and products focused on helping oil and gas companies develop hydrocarbon reserves  reduce operating costs and enhance production 
we focus on basins within north america that we believe have attractive long term potential for growth  and we deliver targeted  value added services and products required by our customers within each specific basin 
we believe our range of services and products positions us to meet the many needs of our customers at the wellsite  from drilling and completion through production and eventual abandonment 
we manage our operations from regional field service facilities located throughout the us rocky mountain region  texas  oklahoma  louisiana  arkansas  pennsylvania  western canada  mexico and southeast asia 

table of contents we operate in three business segments completion and production services 
through our completion and production services segment  we establish  maintain and enhance the flow of oil and gas throughout the life of a well 
this segment is divided into the following primary service lines intervention services 
well intervention requires the use of specialized equipment to perform an array of wellbore services 
our fleet of intervention service equipment includes coiled tubing units  pressure pumping units  nitrogen units  well service rigs  snubbing units and a variety of support equipment 
our intervention services provide customers with innovative solutions to increase production of oil and gas 
downhole and wellsite services 
our downhole and wellsite services include electric line  slickline  production optimization  production testing  rental and fishing services 
we also offer several proprietary services and products that we believe create significant value for our customers 
fluid handling 
we provide a variety of services to help our customers obtain  move  store and dispose of fluids that are involved in the development and production of their reservoirs 
through our fleet of specialized trucks  frac tanks and other assets  we provide fluid transportation  heating  pumping and disposal services for our customers 
drilling services 
through our drilling services segment  we provide services and equipment that initiate or stimulate oil and gas production by providing land drilling  specialized rig logistics and site preparation throughout our service area 
our drilling rigs currently operate primarily in and around the barnett shale region of north texas 
product sales 
we provide oilfield service equipment and refurbishment of used equipment through our southeast asian business  and we provide repair work and fabrication services for our customers at a business located in gainesville  texas 
substantially all service and rental revenue we earn is based upon a charge for a period of time an hour  a day  a week for the actual period of time the service or rental is provided to our customer or on a fixed per stage completed fee 
product sales are recorded when the actual sale occurs and title or ownership passes to the customer 
our customers include large multi national and independent oil and gas producers  as well as smaller independent producers and the major land based drilling contractors in north america see customers in item of this annual report on form k 
the primary factor influencing demand for our services and products is the level of drilling complexity and workover activity of our customers  which in turn  depends on current and anticipated future oil and gas prices  production depletion rates and the resultant levels of cash flows generated and allocated by our customers to their drilling and workover budgets 
as a result  demand for our services and products is cyclical  substantially depends on activity levels in the north american oil and gas industry and is highly sensitive to current and expected oil and natural gas prices

we consider the drilling and well service rig counts to be an indication of spending by our customers in the oil and gas industry for exploration and development of new and existing hydrocarbon reserves 
these spending levels are a primary driver of our business  and we believe that our customers tend to invest more in these activities when oil and gas prices are at higher levels or are increasing 
we evaluate the utilization of our assets as a measure of operating performance 
this utilization can be impacted by these and other external and internal factors 
see item a 
risk factors 
we generally charge for our services either on a dayrate or per stage completed basis 
depending on the specific service  charges may include one or more of these components a set up charge  an hourly service rate based on equipment and labor  a stage completed charge  an equipment rental charge  a consumables charge  and a mileage and fuel charge 
we generally determine the rates charged through a competitive process on a job by job basis 
typically  work is performed on a call out basis  whereby the customer requests services on a job specific basis  but does not guarantee work levels beyond the specific job bid 
for contract drilling services  fees are charged based on standard dayrates or  to a lesser extent  as negotiated by footage contracts 
product sales are generated through our southeast asian business and through wholesale distributors  using a purchase order process and a pre determined price book 

table of contents outlook since our initial public offering  which became effective in april  our growth strategy has been focused on internal growth in the basins in which we currently operate  as we sought to maximize our equipment utilization  add additional like kind equipment and expand service and product offerings 
in addition  we have sought new basins in which to replicate this approach and augmented our internal growth with strategic acquisitions 
throughout  we continued to execute this strategy while evaluating the market trends in the oil and gas industry and communicating with our customers 
in late  we noticed a decline in drilling and exploration expenditures by our customers following the significant decline in oil and gas commodity prices 
although we do not know the extent of this downturn for  we expect to decrease our level of internal capital investment for relative to recent years  and to implement cost saving measures throughout  while remaining responsive to our customers needs for quality services 
internal capital investment 
our internal expansion activities have generally consisted of adding equipment and qualified personnel in locations where we have established a presence 
we have grown our operations in many of these locations by expanding services to current customers  attracting new customers and hiring local personnel with local basin level expertise and leadership recognition 
depending on customer demand  we will consider adding equipment to further increase the capacity of services currently being provided and or add equipment to expand the services we provide 
we invested million in equipment additions over the three year period ended december   which included million for the completion and production services segment  million for the drilling services segment  million for the product sales segment and million related to general corporate operations 
we expect to invest significantly less in capital equipment during the year ended december  external growth 
we use strategic acquisitions as an integral part of our growth strategy 
we consider acquisitions that will add to our service offerings in a current operating area or that will expand our geographical footprint into a targeted basin 
we have completed several acquisitions in recent years 
these acquisitions affect our operating performance period to period 
accordingly  comparisons of revenue and operating results are not necessarily comparable and should not be relied upon as indications of future performance 
we have invested an aggregate of million in acquisitions over the three year period ended december  of this amount  we invested an aggregate of million to acquire businesses during and million to acquire businesses during see significant acquisitions 
natural gas prices have declined from historical highs in and rotary rig counts have recently begun to decline 
the recent change in activity levels are likely the result of a number of macro economic factors  such as an excess supply of natural gas  lower demand for oil and gas  market expectations of weather conditions and the utilization of heating fuels  the cyclical nature of the oil and gas industry and other general market conditions for the us economy  including the current global financial crisis  which has contributed to significant reductions in available capital and liquidity from banks and other providers of credit 
we have experienced a significant decline in utilization of our assets during late and thus far in  and we anticipate that lower commodity prices and activity levels will continue to adversely impact our near term performance results due to pricing pressure and lower utilization rates 
due to the deteriorating market conditions  we recorded a non cash impairment charge of million at december  related to the write down of goodwill for various of our reporting units 
in  we recorded a non cash goodwill impairment charge of million for our canadian reporting unit 
although we cannot determine the depth or duration of the decline in activity in the oil and gas industry  we believe the overall long term outlook for north american oilfield activity and our business remains favorable  especially in the basins in which we operate 
our business continues to be impacted by seasonality and inclement weather including the effects of the normal second quarter canadian break up  as well as the impact of gulf of mexico tropical weather systems 
we  and many of our competitors  have invested in new equipment  some of which requires long lead times to manufacture 
as more of this equipment is available to be placed into service and oilfield activities decline  there will be excess capacity in the industry  which we believe may negatively impact our utilization rates and pricing for certain service offerings 
in addition  as new equipment enters the market  we must compete for employees to crew 
table of contents the equipment  which puts inflationary pressure on labor costs 
our equipment fleet is relatively new  as we have made significant investments in new equipment over the past few years 
we continue to monitor our equipment utilization and poll our customers to assess demand levels 
as equipment enters the marketplace or competition for existing customers increases  we believe our customers will rely upon service providers with local knowledge and expertise  which we believe we have and which constitutes a fundamental aspect of our growth strategy 
significant acquisitions during  we acquired substantially all the assets or all of the equity interests in four oilfield service companies  for million in cash  resulting in goodwill of approximately million 
several of these acquisitions are subject to final working capital adjustments 
on february   we acquired substantially all of the assets of kr fishing rental  inc for million in cash  resulting in goodwill of million 
kr fishing rental  inc is a provider of fishing  rental and foam unit services in the piceance basin and the raton basin  and is located in rangely  colorado

other recent acquisitions which are deemed to be significant include arkoma 
on june   we acquired certain operating assets of j m rental tool  inc dba arkoma machine fishing tools  arkoma machine shop  inc and n m supply  llc  collectively referred to as arkoma  a provider of rental tools  machining and fishing services in the fayetteville shale and arkoma 
table of contents basin  located in ft 
smith  arkansas 
we paid million in cash to acquire arkoma and recorded goodwill totaling million  which has been allocated entirely to the completion and production services business segment 
this acquisition provided a platform to further expand our presence in the fayetteville shale and arkoma basin and supplements our completion and production services business in that region

the turner group of companies turner is based in the texas panhandle in canadian  texas  and owns a fleet of well service rigs  and provides other wellsite services such as fishing  equipment rental  fluid handling and salt water disposal services 
we recorded goodwill totaling million associated with this purchase 
we have included the accounts of turner in our completion and production services business segment from the date of acquisition 
we believe this acquisition supplements our completion and production services business in the mid continent region

femco provides fluid handling  frac tank rental  propane distribution and fluid disposal services throughout southern central oklahoma 
we recorded goodwill totaling million associated with this purchase 
we have included the accounts of femco in our completion and production services business segment from the date of acquisition 
we believe this acquisition expands our presence in the fayetteville shale and enhances our completion and production services business in the mid continent region 
pumpco 
on november   we acquired all the outstanding equity interests of pumpco  a company located in gainesville  texas for approximately million in cash  net of cash acquired  and  shares of our common stock

pumpco provides pressure pumping  stimulation and cementing services used in the development and completion of gas and oil wells in the barnett shale play of north texas 
we recorded goodwill totaling million associated with this acquisition 
the purchase price allocation for pumpco was finalized in which resulted in a reclassification of million from goodwill to other intangible assets  and a reduction of goodwill of million related the deferred tax liabilities acquired which were deemed unnecessary based on our tax return filings in we have included the accounts of pumpco in our completion and production services business from the date of acquisition 
this acquisition expanded our presence in the barnett shale and expands the service offerings of our completion and product services business to include pressure pumping 
in addition  we completed several other smaller acquisitions in and  each of which has contributed to the expansion of our business into new geographic regions or enhanced our service and product offerings 
we have accounted for our acquisitions using the purchase method of accounting  whereby the purchase price is allocated to the fair value of net assets acquired  including intangibles and property  plant and equipment at depreciated replacement costs with the excess to goodwill 
results of operations related to each of the acquired companies have been included in our combined operations as of the date of acquisition 

table of contents in may  our board of directors authorized and committed to a plan to sell certain operations in the barnett shale region of north texas  consisting primarily of our supply store business  as well as certain non strategic drilling logistics assets and other completion and production services assets 
on may   we sold these operations to select energy services  llc  a company owned by a former officer of one of our subsidiaries  for which we received proceeds of million in cash and assets with a fair market value of million 
the carrying value of the net assets sold was approximately million  excluding million of allocated goodwill associated with the combination that formed complete production services  inc in september we recorded a loss on the sale of this disposal group totaling approximately million  which included million related to income taxes 
in accordance with the sales agreement  we agreed to sublet office space to select energy services  llc and to provide certain administrative services for an initial term of one year  at an agreed upon rate 
on october   we completed the sale of another disposal group which included certain manufacturing and production enhancement product operations of a subsidiary located in alberta  canada  as well as operations in south texas  for approximately million in cash  with an additional amount subject to a working capital adjustment  and a million canadian dollar denominated note which matures on october  and accrues interest at a specified canadian bank prime rate plus per annum 
we sold this disposal group to paintearth energy services  inc  an oilfield service company located in calgary  alberta  canada  that employs two of our former employees as key managers 
the carrying value of the related net assets was million on october  we recorded a loss on the sale of this disposal group totaling approximately million  which included a transaction gain associated with the release of cumulative translation adjustment associated with this business  and a million charge to expense related to capital taxes in canada 
the sales agreement allowed paintearth energy services  inc to use our subsidiary s trade name for a period of days from november  through february  on january   we amended the terms of the paintearth note receivable to extend the maturity date through october and amended the interest rate for each of the calendar years within the remaining term 
marketing environment we operate in a highly competitive industry 
our competition includes many large and small oilfield service companies 
as such  we price our services and products to remain competitive in the markets in which we operate  adjusting our rates to reflect current market conditions as necessary 
we examine the rate of utilization of our equipment as one measure of our ability to compete in the current market environment 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with gaap requires the use of estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances  and provide a basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily available through open market quotes 
estimates and assumptions are reviewed periodically  and actual results may differ from those estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we must use our judgment related to uncertainties in order to make these estimates and assumptions 
in the selection of our critical accounting policies  the objective is to properly reflect our financial position and results of operations for each reporting period in a consistent manner that can be understood by the reader of our financial statements 
our accounting policies and procedures are explained in note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements contained elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
we consider an estimate to be critical if it is subjective and if changes in the estimate using different assumptions would result in a material impact on our financial position or results of operations 
we have identified the following as the most critical accounting policies and estimates  and have provided a description  information about variability and our historical experience  including a sensitivity analysis  if applicable 

table of contents revenue recognition we recognize service revenue as services are performed and when realized or earned 
revenue is deemed to be realized or earned when we determine that the following criteria are met persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  the fee is fixed or determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
these services are generally provided over a relatively short period of time pursuant to short term contracts at pre determined dayrate fees  or on a day to day basis 
revenue and costs related to drilling contracts are recognized as work progresses 
progress is measured as revenue is recognized based upon dayrate charges 
for certain contracts  we may receive lump sum payments from our customers related to the mobilization of rigs and other drilling equipment 
under these arrangements  we defer revenues and the related cost of services and recognize them over the term of the drilling contract 
costs incurred to relocate rigs and other drilling equipment to areas in which a contract has not been secured are expensed as incurred 
revenues associated with product sales are recorded when product title is transferred to the customer 
under current gaap  revenue is to be recognized when it is realized or realizable and earned 
the sec s rules and regulations provide additional guidance for revenue recognition under specific circumstances  including bill and hold transactions 
there is a risk that our results of operations could be misstated if we do not record revenue in the proper accounting period 
the nature of our business has been such that we generally bill for services over a relatively short period of time and record revenues as products are sold 
we did not record material adjustments resulting from revenue recognition issues for the years ended december   and impairment of long lived assets we evaluate potential impairment of long lived assets and intangibles  excluding goodwill and other intangible assets without defined services lives  when indicators of impairment are present  as defined in sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
if such indicators are present  we project the fair value of the assets by estimating the undiscounted future cash in flows to be derived from the long lived assets over their remaining estimated useful lives  as well as any salvage value 
then  we compare this fair value estimate to the carrying value of the assets and determine whether the assets are deemed to be impaired 
for goodwill and other intangible assets without defined service lives  we apply the provisions of sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  which requires an annual impairment test  whereby we estimate the fair value of the asset by discounting future cash flows at a projected cost of capital rate 
if the fair value estimate is less than the carrying value of the asset  an additional test is required whereby we apply a purchase price analysis consistent with that described in sfas no 
if impairment is still indicated  we would record an impairment loss in the current reporting period for the amount by which the carrying value of the intangible asset exceeds its projected fair value 
our industry is highly cyclical and the estimate of future cash flows requires the use of assumptions and our judgment 
periods of prolonged down cycles in the industry could have a significant impact on the carrying value of these assets and may result in impairment charges 
if our estimates do not approximate actual performance or if the rates we used to discount cash flows vary significantly from actual discount rates  we could overstate our assets and an impairment loss may not be timely identified 
we tested goodwill for impairment for each of the years ended december   and management prepared a discounted cash flow analysis to determine the fair market value of each reportable unit as of the testing date  october of each year 
projected cash flows were based on certain management assumptions related to expected growth  capital investment and terminal value  discounted at a market participant weighted average cost of capital  refined to reflect our current and anticipated capital structure 
based on this analysis  management determined that goodwill was impaired in and in accordance with sfas no 
 management performed a step two analysis to calculate the amount by which the carrying value of the reporting units exceeded the projected fair market value of such units as of the annual testing date 
as a result of this testing in  management recorded an impairment charge which reduced goodwill in canada by million 
this annual testing was performed in and yielded another impairment for this canadian subsidiary as of the test date 
however  due to a decline in the overall us debt and equity markets and concerns over the availability of credit  we determined that a triggering event  as that term is defined in sfas no 
 had occurred during the 
table of contents fourth quarter of therefore  we performed our impairment calculations again as of december   incorporating our most recent assumptions of future earnings and cash flows 
based on this testing  we determined that the goodwill associated with most of our reporting units had been impaired 
we recorded an impairment charge of million at december  in calculating this impairment charge  management made assumptions about future earnings by reportable unit  which may differ from actual future earnings for these operations 
a significant decline in expected future cash flow  a further erosion of market conditions or a lower than expected recovery of the oil and gas industry activity levels in future years  could result in an additional impairment charge 
a impairment of total goodwill at december  would have decreased our operating income by million for the year then ended 
stock options and other stock based compensation we have issued stock based compensation to certain employees  officers and directors in the form of stock options and non vested restricted stock 
we adopted sfas no 
r  share based payment  on january   which impacted our accounting treatment of employee stock options 
as required by sfas no 
r  we continue to account for stock based compensation for grants made prior to september   the date of our initial filing with the sec  using the minimum value method prescribed by apb no 
 whereby no compensation expense is recognized for stock based compensation grants that have an exercise price equal to the fair value of the stock on the date of grant 
however  for grants of stock based compensation between october  and december  prior to adoption of sfas no 
r  we have utilized the modified prospective transition method to record expense associated with these options 
under this transition method  we did not record compensation expense associated with these stock option grants during the period october  through december   but will provide pro forma disclosure of this expense as appropriate 
however  we will recognize expense related to these grants over the remaining vesting period  based upon a calculated fair value 
for grants of stock based compensation on or after january   we apply the prospective transition method under sfas no 
r  whereby we recognize expense associated with new awards of stock based compensation  as determined using a black scholes pricing model over the expected term of the award 
in addition  we record compensation expense associated with non vested restricted stock which has been granted to certain of our directors  officers and employees 
in accordance with sfas no 
r  we calculate compensation expense on the date of grant number of options granted multiplied by the fair value of our common stock on the date of grant and recognize this expense  adjusted for forfeitures  ratably over the applicable vesting period 
gaap permits the use of various models to determine the fair value of stock options and the variables used for the model are highly subjective 
for purposes of determining compensation expense associated with stock options granted after january   we are required to determine the fair value of the stock options by applying a pricing model which includes assumptions for expected term  discount rate  stock volatility  expected forfeitures and a dividend rate 
the use of different assumptions or a different model may have a material impact on our financial disclosures 
for years ended on or before december   we determined the value of our stock options by applying the minimum value method permitted by apb no 
and  in connection with estimating compensation expense that would be required to be recognized under sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  we used a black scholes model including assumptions for expected term ranging from to years as of december   risk free rate based upon published rates for us treasury notes with a similar term  zero dividend rate and a volatility rate of zero 
for the years ended december  and  we applied a black scholes model with similar assumptions  except we estimated our stock volatility by examining the volatility rates of several peer companies  we estimated a forfeiture rate based upon our historical experience and we estimated the expected term of the options using a probability analysis 
beginning in july  we used our historical volatility rate as an assumption to determine the grant date fair value of our stock option grants during the third and fourth quarters of for the years ended december  and  we have recorded compensation expense totaling million and million  respectively  related to our stock option grants and million and million  respectively  related to our non vested restricted stock 

table of contents allowance for bad debts and inventory obsolescence we record trade accounts receivable at billed amounts  less an allowance for bad debts 
inventory is recorded at cost  less an allowance for obsolescence 
to estimate these allowances  management reviews the underlying details of these assets as well as known trends in the marketplace  and applies historical factors as a basis for recording these allowances 
if market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  or if our historical experience is materially different from future experience  additional allowances may be required 
there is a risk that management may not detect uncollectible accounts or unsalvageable inventory in the correct accounting period 
bad debt expense has been less than of sales for the years ended december   and if bad debt expense had increased by of sales for the years ended december   and  net income would have declined by million  million and million  respectively 
our obsolescence and other inventory reserves were approximately  and of our inventory balances at december   and  respectively 
a increase in inventory reserves  from to  at december  would have decreased net income by million for the year then ended 
property  plant and equipment we record property  plant and equipment at cost less accumulated depreciation 
major betterments to existing assets are capitalized  while repairs and maintenance costs that do not extend the service lives of our equipment are expensed 
we determine the useful lives of our depreciable assets based upon historical experience and the judgment of our operating personnel 
we generally depreciate the historical cost of assets  less an estimate of the applicable salvage value  on the straight line basis over the applicable useful lives 
upon disposition or retirement of an asset  we record a gain or loss if the proceeds from the transaction differ from the net book value of the asset at the time of the disposition or retirement 
gaap permits various depreciation methods to recognize the use of assets 
use of a different depreciation method or different depreciable lives could result in materially different results 
if our depreciation estimates are not correct  we could over or understate our results of operations  such as recording a disproportionate amount of gains or losses upon disposition of assets 
there is also a risk that the useful lives we apply for our depreciation calculation will not approximate the actual useful life of the asset 
we believe our estimates of useful lives are materially correct and that these estimates are consistent with industry averages 
we evaluate property  plant and equipment for impairment when there are indicators of impairment 
there have been no significant impairment charges related to our long term assets during the years ended december   and depreciation and amortization expense for the years ended december  and represented and of the average depreciable asset base for the respective years 
an increase in depreciation relative to the depreciable base of  from to  would have reduced net income by approximately million for the year ended december  self insurance on january   we began a self insurance program to pay claims associated with health care benefits provided to certain of our employees in the united states 
pursuant to this program  we have purchased a stop loss insurance policy from an insurance company 
our accounting policy for this self insurance program is to accrue expense based upon the number of employees enrolled in the plan at pre determined rates 
as claims are processed and paid  we compare our claims history to our expected claims in order to estimate incurred but not reported claims 
if our estimate of claims incurred but not reported exceeds our current accrual  we record additional expense during the current period 
there is a risk that we may not estimate our incurred but not reported claims correctly or that our stop loss provision may not be adequate to insure us against material losses in the future 
at december   we accrued million pursuant to this self insurance program 
a increase in this self insurance accrual would reduce our net income for the year ended december  by million 

table of contents deferred income taxes our income tax expense includes income taxes related to the united states  canada and other foreign countries  including local  state and provincial income taxes 
we account for tax ramifications using sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
under sfas no 
 we record deferred income tax assets and liabilities based upon temporary differences between the carrying amount and tax basis of our assets and liabilities and measure tax expense using enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when the differences are expected to reverse 
the effect of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period of the change 
furthermore  sfas no 
requires us to record a valuation allowance for any net deferred income tax assets which we believe are likely to not be used through future operations 
as of december   and  we recorded a valuation allowance of less than million related to certain deferred tax assets in canada 
if our estimates and assumptions related to our deferred tax position change in the future  we may be required to record additional valuation allowances against our deferred tax assets and our effective tax rate may increase  which could adversely affect our financial results 
as of december   we did not provide deferred us income taxes on approximately million of undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries in which we intend to indefinitely reinvest 
upon distribution of these earnings in the form of dividends or otherwise  we may be subject to us income taxes and foreign withholding taxes 
on january   we adopted financial interpretation no 
fin  which provides guidance to account for uncertain tax positions 
during  we performed an evaluation of our tax positions pursuant to financial interpretation no 
fin and determined that this pronouncement did not have a material impact on our financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
there is a risk that estimates related to the use of loss carry forwards and the realizability of deferred tax accounts may be incorrect  and that the result could materially impact our financial position and results of operations 
in addition  future changes in tax laws or gaap requirements could result in additional valuation allowances or the recognition of additional tax liabilities 
historically  we have utilized net operating loss carry forwards to partially offset current tax expense  and we have recorded a valuation allowance to the extent we expect that our deferred tax assets will not be utilized through future operations 
deferred income tax assets totaled million at december   against which we recorded a valuation allowance of million  leaving a net deferred tax asset of million deemed realizable 
changes in our valuation allowance would affect our net income on a dollar for dollar basis 
discontinued operations we account for discontinued operations in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
sfas no 
requires that we classify the assets and liabilities of a disposal group as held for sale if the following criteria are met management  with appropriate authority  commits to a plan to sell a disposal group  the asset is available for immediate sale in its current condition  an active program to locate a buyer and other actions to complete the sale have been initiated  the sale is probable  the disposal group is being actively marketed for sale at a reasonable price  and actions required to complete the plan of sale indicate it is unlikely that significant changes to the plan of sale will occur or that the plan will be withdrawn 
once deemed held for sale  we no longer depreciate the assets of the disposal group 
upon sale  we calculate the gain or loss associated with the disposition by comparing the carrying value of the assets less direct costs of the sale with the proceeds received 
in conjunction with the sale  we settle inter company balances between us and the disposal group and allocate interest expense to the disposal group for the period the assets were held for sale

during and  we completed a series of small acquisitions which provided incremental revenues for compared to due to the timing of those acquisitions 
revenue increases were partially offset by a general decline in oilfield activity which began during the fourth quarter of and pricing pressures in certain service offerings during the latter half of and throughout drilling services 
segment revenue increased million  or  for the year  primarily due to higher utilization rates and additional capital invested in our contract drilling business in and in early  we experienced lower pricing for our drilling services and lower utilization rates in our rig logistics operations primarily due to an increase in equipment placed into service by our competitors

completion and production services 
the increase in service and product expenses as a percentage of revenue for this business segment reflects pricing pressure for many of our service lines throughout 
table of contents resulting in less favorable operating margins on a year over year basis 
we incurred higher labor and fuel costs during  although fuel costs began to decline in the fourth quarter of  and we incurred higher sand and cement costs in our pressure pumping business 
start up costs associated with mobilizing a frac fleet in the bakken shale area of north dakota also impacted our operating margins 
cost increases were partially offset by the mix of services provided in compared to  a full year s benefit of capital invested throughout  additional equipment placed into service during and several acquisitions 
in late  we experienced lower utilization rates and an increase in pricing pressure in several service lines due to a general decline in oilfield activity which may stem from lower commodity prices and concerns over the broader us economy and the availability of credit for investment by our customers 
drilling services 
the increase in service and product expenses as a percentage of revenue for this business segment represented a decline in margin during compared to due to lower pricing for our contract drilling and drilling logistics businesses on a year over year basis  higher operating costs associated primarily with labor and fuel  and lower utilization of our equipment due primarily to more market competition 
product sales 
the increase in service and product expenses as a percentage of revenue for the products segments was primarily due to the mix of products sold  specifically the timing of equipment sales and refurbishment associated with our southeast asian operations which tend to be project specific and can fluctuate between periods depending upon the nature of the projects in process  and third party repair and fabrication work performed at our shop in north texas

on december   we acquired the remaining interest in this company 
liquidity and capital resources the recent and unprecedented disruption in the current credit markets has had a significant adverse impact on a number of financial institutions 
at this point in time  our liquidity has not been materially impacted by the current credit environment 
we are not currently a party to any interest rate swaps  currency hedges or derivative contracts of any type and have no exposure to commercial paper or auction rate securities markets 
we will continue to closely monitor our liquidity and the overall health of the credit markets 
however  we cannot predict with any certainty the impact that any further disruption in the credit environment would have on us 
our primary liquidity needs are to fund capital expenditures and general working capital needs 
in addition  we have historically obtained capital to fund strategic business acquisitions 
our primary sources of funds have historically been cash flow from operations  proceeds from borrowings under bank credit facilities  a private placement of debt which was subsequently exchanged for publicly registered debt and the issuance of equity securities in our initial public offering 
on april   we sold  shares of our 
par value common stock in an initial public offering at an initial offering price to the public of per share  which provided proceeds of approximately million net of underwriters fees 
we used these funds to retire principal and interest outstanding under our us revolving credit facility on april  totaling approximately million  to pay transaction costs of approximately million and invested the remaining funds in tax free and tax advantaged municipal bonds and similar financial instruments 
of this amount  we utilized million associated with acquisitions  including arkoma  turner and pinnacle  and the remainder was used for other general corporate purposes 
as of september  all proceeds from our initial public offering had been utilized 
we anticipate that we will rely on cash generated from operations  borrowings under our amended revolving credit facility  future debt offerings and or future public equity offerings to satisfy our liquidity needs 
we believe that funds from these sources should be sufficient to meet both our short term working capital requirements and our long term capital requirements 
we believe that our operating cash flows and availability under our amended revolving credit facility will be sufficient to fund our operations for the next twelve months 
if our plans or assumptions change  or are inaccurate  or if we make further acquisitions  we may have to raise additional capital 
our ability to fund planned capital expenditures and to make acquisitions will depend upon our future operating performance  and more broadly  on the availability of equity and debt financing  which will be affected by prevailing economic conditions in our industry  and general financial  business and other factors  some of which are beyond our control 
in addition  new debt obtained could include service requirements based on higher interest paid and shorter maturities and could impose a significant burden on our results of operations and financial condition 
the issuance of additional equity securities could result in significant dilution to stockholders 
the following table summarizes cash flows by type for the periods indicated in thousands year ended december  cash flows provided by used in operating activities investing activities financing activities net cash provided by operating activities increased million for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december   and increased million for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  these increases in net cash provided by operating activities 
table of contents were primarily due to increases in gross receipts as a result of increased revenues 
our gross receipts increased throughout the three years ended december  as demand for our services grew  we invested in more equipment and logged incremental billable hours  while we continued to expand our current business and enter new markets through acquisitions 
we expect to continue to evaluate acquisition opportunities for the foreseeable future 
this analysis will entail a review of available funds which will include our current operating cash flows  as well as other factors 
net cash used in investing activities decreased million for the year ended december  compared to the prior year  and decreased million for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december   primarily due to declines in the use of funds for acquisitions 
we invested million  million and million in business acquisitions for the years ended december   and  respectively 
during  these acquisitions were relatively large operations in recently active basins such as the marcellus shale and haynesville shale  as well as a targeted acquisition of a pressure pumping business in north texas 
for  our acquired businesses were generally smaller  niche companies which complemented our existing operations 
for  we used a portion of the proceeds from our initial public offering to purchase businesses that expanded our geographic reach in areas where we have operations and into new basins within north america 
in addition  we invested heavily in new equipment throughout this three year period  but to a lesser extent during due to concerns of over capacity in the industry and a general slowdown in oilfield activity in late we sold non strategic businesses in and and received proceeds of million and million  respectively 
in addition  in we invested million in short term investments  which were sold and used for the following purposes to acquire a series of businesses  to make scheduled principal and interest payments on our credit facility  to pay estimated federal income taxes  and for other general corporate purposes 
significant capital equipment expenditures in included pressure pumping equipment  well service rigs  coiled tubing equipment and two drilling rigs 
significant capital equipment expenditures in included five coiled tubing units and over forty well service rigs  as well as additional pressure pumping units 
significant capital equipment expenditures in included coiled tubing units  pressure pumping equipment  well services rigs  fluid handling equipment  rental equipment and drilling rigs 
see significant acquisitions above 
net cash provided by financing activities decreased by million for the year ended december  compared to the prior year  and declined million for the year ended december  compared to the primary source of funds from financing activities for was net borrowings under our revolving credit facilities of million  as well as funds obtained from the issuance of our common stock in connection with employee stock option exercises 
the primary source of funds from financing activities in was net borrowings under our revolving credit facilities to fund capital expenditures  acquisitions  semi annual interest payments on our senior notes and quarterly federal income tax payments 
however  in  the primary source of funds from financing activities was the receipt of the net proceeds from our initial public offering in april  which provided approximately million 
in addition  we received net proceeds of million from the issuance of senior notes in december  and we borrowed under our revolving credit facilities to fund various business acquisitions 
the primary use of funds from financing activities was to repay million outstanding under our us revolving credit facility as of april  with subsequent borrowings and repayments under this revolving credit facility throughout the year ended december   and the repayment of million under our term loan facility in  the majority of which was repaid in december from the proceeds of our senior note issuance 
our long term debt balances  including current maturities  were million and million as of december  and  respectively 
we expect to spend significantly less than we have in recent years for investment in capital expenditures  excluding acquisitions  during the year ended december  we believe that our operating cash flows and borrowing capacity will be sufficient to fund our operations for the next months 
in addition  we do not anticipate completing acquisitions for cash consideration until market conditions stabilize  but will continue to evaluate acquisitions of complementary companies 
we will evaluate each acquisition opportunity based upon the circumstances and our financing capabilities at that time

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the demand  pricing and terms for oil and gas services provided by us are largely dependent upon the level of activity for the us and canadian gas industry 
industry conditions are influenced by numerous factors over which we have no control  including  but not limited to the supply of and demand for oil and gas  the level of prices  and expectations about future prices  of oil and gas  the cost of exploring for  developing  producing and delivering oil and gas  the expected rates of declining current production  the discovery rates of new oil and gas reserves  available pipeline and other transportation capacity  weather conditions  domestic and worldwide economic conditions  political instability in oil producing countries  technical advances affecting energy consumption  the price and availability of alternative fuels  the ability of oil and gas producers to raise equity capital and debt financing  and merger and divestiture activity among oil and gas producers 
the level of activity in the us and canadian oil and gas exploration and production industry is volatile 
no assurance can be given that our expectations of trends in oil and gas production activities will reflect actual future activity levels or that demand for our services will be consistent with the general activity level of the industry 
any prolonged substantial reduction in oil and gas prices would likely affect oil and gas exploration and development efforts and therefore affect demand for our services 
a material decline in oil and gas prices or us and canadian activity levels could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
for the years ended december  and  approximately and of our revenues from continuing operations  respectively  and and of our total assets  respectively  were denominated in canadian dollars  our functional currency in canada 
as a result  a material decrease in the value of the canadian dollar relative to the us dollar may negatively impact our revenues  cash flows and net income 
each one percentage point change in the value of the canadian dollar would have impacted our revenues for the year ended december  by approximately million  or million net of tax 
we do not currently use hedges or forward contracts to offset this risk 
our mexican operation uses the us dollar as its functional currency  and as a result  all transactions and translation gains and losses are recorded currently in the financial statements 
the balance sheet amounts are translated into us dollars at the exchange rate at the end of the month and the income statement amounts are translated at the average exchange rate for the month 
we estimate that a hypothetical one percentage point change in the value of the mexican peso relative to the us dollar would have impacted our revenues for the year ended december  by approximately million  or million  net of tax 
currently  we conduct a portion of our business in mexico in the local currency  the mexican peso 
approximately of our debt at december  is structured under floating rate terms and  as such  our interest expense is sensitive to fluctuations in the prime rates in the us and canada 
based on the debt structure in place as of december   a basis point increase in interest rates relative to our floating rate obligations would increase interest expense by approximately million per year and reduce operating cash flows by approximately million  net of tax
