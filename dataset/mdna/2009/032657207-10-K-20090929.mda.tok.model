item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion provides an analysis of our financial condition and results of operations and should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
the discussion contains statements  which  to the extent that they are not a recitation of historical facts  constitute forward looking statements pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of all statements  other than statements of historical fact  including  without limitation  statements about product development  market and industry trends  strategic initiatives  regulatory approvals  sales  profits  expenses  price trends  research and development expenses and trends  and capital expenditures  we make in this document or in any document incorporated by reference are forward looking 
such forward looking statements involve known and unknown risks  uncertainties  and other factors  which may cause our actual results  performance  or achievements to differ from the projected results 
see risk factors in item a for a discussion of the primary risks and uncertainties known to us at this time 
our management s discussion and analysis is presented in six sections as follows business overview fiscal year overview results of operations 
table of contents liquidity and capital resources critical accounting policies new accounting pronouncements we report our financial condition and results of operations on a fiscal year basis ending july all dollar amounts in this item are in thousands except per share data 
business overview analogic is a high technology company that designs and manufactures advanced medical imaging and security systems and subsystems sold to oems and end users in the healthcare and homeland security markets 
we were incorporated in the commonwealth of massachusetts in november and are recognized worldwide for advancing state of the art technology in the areas of medical ct  mri  digital radiography  specialized ultrasound  and eds for airport security 
our oem customers incorporate our technology into systems they in turn sell for various medical and security applications 
we also sell our ultrasound products directly to specialized clinical end user markets through our direct worldwide sales force under the business name b k medical 
we operate within two major markets medical technology products and security technology products 
medical technology products consists of three reporting segments medical imaging products  digital radiography products  and b k medical 
a significant portion of our products are sold to oems  whose purchasing dynamics have an impact on our reported sales 
oems that purchase our medical imaging and digital radiography products generally incorporate those products as components in their systems  which are in turn sold to end users  primarily hospitals and medical clinics 
in our security technology products business  a major oem customer purchases and resells our products to end users including domestic and foreign airports as well as the transportation security administration tsa 
in security technology products  our oem customer s purchasing dynamics are affected by the level of government funding  the expansion of airport terminals and fluctuations in airline passenger volume 
fiscal year overview the following is a summary of the matters that management believes are most important in understanding our results of operations for the periods indicated 
this summary is not a substitute for the detail provided in the following pages or for the audited consolidated financial statements and notes that appear elsewhere in this document 
percentage change fiscal year total net revenue income loss from operations net income diluted net income per share the decline in net revenue  income from operations  net income  and diluted net income per share in fiscal year as compared to fiscal year was primarily related to the deterioration of global economic conditions during fiscal year  which reduced endowments and philanthropic funding of hospitals and medical clinics 
as a result  capital available for investment by these end users in new facilities  expansions  or upgrades was limited  thereby reducing immediate demand for our products and those of our oem customers 
in addition  the adoption of the dra in fiscal year reduced government reimbursement rates for doctors 
table of contents utilizing medical imaging procedures for their patients  which  in turn  reduced demand for our oem customers products 
both of these factors negatively impacted the performance of the medical imaging products segment during fiscal year partially mitigating this impact was the full year benefit in fiscal year of the copley business  which was acquired late in the third quarter of fiscal year in response to lower demand  we implemented cost control programs throughout fiscal year in the second quarter of fiscal year  we reduced our workforce by employees worldwide then of our total workforce and recorded a restructuring charge of  for severance and personnel related costs 
included in the workforce reduction were copley employees whose severance and personnel related costs of had been previously accrued in fiscal year in connection with the acquisition 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal year  we recorded a restructuring charge of  the restructuring charge was primarily related to  in severance and personnel related costs for the reduction of our workforce by employees worldwide of total workforce 
also included in the restructuring was  for facility exit costs  due primarily to our vacating of our office facility in canton  ma on july  as a result of moving certain operations to our peabody  ma facility 
the savings from both restructuring programs on an annual basis is estimated to be approximately  despite these programs  income from operations declined from  in fiscal year to a loss of  in fiscal year in august  we reached a settlement with a former distributor of medical imaging products  cas medical systems  inc cas  in which we agreed to pay cas the sum of in full satisfaction of all matters in dispute 
the was recorded in general and administrative expenses in fiscal year we and cas have negotiated an orderly conclusion to our contractual relationship by allowing cas to continue distributing products until july  in connection with the settlement agreement  we also incurred of related charges in fiscal year tax benefits more than offset the  loss from operations 
in fiscal year  we received irs refunds of  which included  of interest 
these refunds resulted in a reduction of unrecognized tax benefits by approximately  of which  was recorded as a tax benefit in fiscal year also contributing to the income tax benefit for fiscal year was the reversal of of tax reserves due to the expiration of statutes of limitations  and  for the reversal of a valuation allowance in belgium net operating loss carryforwards that management has determined are more likely than not to be realized 
we had cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities of  and  at july  and  respectively 
the interest earned on our cash and cash equivalents over the past months has been impacted by a reduction in interest rates 
we have historically invested in u 
s government backed securities  bonds  and certificates of deposit  the interest rates of which have declined significantly over the last year 
also contributing to the decline in interest income of approximately for fiscal year as compared to fiscal year were copley acquisition related costs of  in the third quarter of fiscal year and repurchases of common stock of  during fiscal year the following table sets forth an overview of cash flows for fiscal years and year ended july  net cash provided by operating activities net cash used for investing activities net cash used for financing activities effect of exchange rate changes on cash net decrease in cash and cash equivalents during fiscal year  we continued to generate cash from our operating activities 
the net cash provided by operating activities in fiscal year decreased from fiscal year due primarily to the decline in net 
table of contents income of  the most significant adjustments to reconcile net income to net cash provided by operating activities in fiscal year were depreciation and amortization of  share based compensation expense of  restructuring and voluntary retirement charges of  and a gain on sale of other investments of  partially offset by a net change in operating assets and liabilities of  the net cash used for investing activities in fiscal year was due primarily to the purchase of short term held to maturity marketable securities of  partially offset by the maturity of  of short term held to maturity marketable securities 
the net cash used for financing activities in fiscal year was due primarily to the repurchase of our common stock under a repurchase program authorized by our board on october  we completed the repurchase program  which was funded using our available cash  in the second quarter of fiscal year during fiscal year  we repurchased  shares of common stock under this repurchase program for  at an average purchase price per share of

july  july  cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities working capital current ratio to to 
table of contents the increase in the current ratio from july  to july  was due primarily to reductions in accounts payable and accrued liabilities 
the decrease in accounts payable was due to timing of vendor payments while the decrease in accrued liabilities was due primarily to a decline in accrued bonuses at july  as compared to july  we periodically review our investment portfolio to determine if any investments are impaired due to changes in credit risk or other potential valuation concerns 
we believe that our cash equivalents and marketable securities are appropriately valued at july  and are not aware of any market events to date that would impact their valuation 
this could change in the future should new developments arise in the credit markets 
we face exposure to financial market risks  including adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates  and changes in interest rates 
these exposures can change over time as business practices evolve and could have a material adverse impact on our financial results 
our primary exposure is related to fluctuations between the us dollar and local currencies for our subsidiaries in canada and europe 
our investment in international subsidiaries is sensitive to fluctuations in currency exchange rates 
the effect of a change in currency exchange rates on our net investment in international subsidiaries is reflected in the accumulated other comprehensive income component of stockholders equity 
a depreciation in the july  and functional currencies  relative to the us dollar  would result in a reduction of stockholders equity of  and  respectively 
the carrying amounts reflected in the consolidated balance sheets of cash and cash equivalents  trade receivables  and trade payables approximate fair value at july   due to the short maturities of these instruments 
cash and cash equivalents totaled  at july  and consisted entirely of highly liquid investments with maturities of three months or less from the time of purchase 
held to maturity marketable securities having maturities from the time of purchase in excess of three months  which totaled  at july   are stated at cost  which approximates fair value 
cash flows the following table summarizes our sources and uses of cash over the periods indicated year ended july  net cash provided by operating activities net cash used for investing activities net cash used for financing activities effect of exchange rate changes on cash net decrease in cash and cash equivalents the cash flows generated from operating activities in fiscal year were due primarily to net income of  a restructuring charge of  depreciation and amortization of  and share based compensation expense of  these amounts were partially offset by the benefit from deferred income taxes of  a gain on sale of other investments of  and a net change in operating assets and liabilities  net of acquired business  of  the net changes in operating assets and liabilities  net of acquired business  of  in fiscal year was due primarily to decreases in accounts payable  accrued liabilities  and advance payments and deferred revenue of   and  respectively 
these changes were partially offset by a decrease in refundable income taxes of  the decrease in accounts payable of  was due primarily to the timing of vendor payments 
the decrease in accrued liabilities of  was due primarily to a decline in accrued bonuses and profit sharing 
table of contents contributions at july  as compared to july  the decrease in refundable income taxes of  was due primarily to income tax refunds of  which included interest of  that were received in fiscal year the decrease in advanced payments and deferred revenue of  was due primarily to  of revenue recognized on security technology products shipped in fiscal year that was paid for in fiscal year the cash used for investing activities in fiscal year was due primarily to the purchase of short term held to maturity marketable securities  the acquisition of copley  net of cash acquired  capital expenditures  and capitalized software development costs of    and  respectively  partially offset by the maturities of held to maturity marketable securities of  and proceeds from the sale of other investment of net cash used for financing activities in fiscal year consisted of  to repurchase shares of common stock and  for dividends paid to stockholders 
we believe that our balances of cash  cash equivalents  and marketable securities  and cash flows expected to be generated by future operating activities will be sufficient to meet our cash requirements for at least the next months 
commitments  contractual obligations and off balance sheet arrangements our contractual obligations at july   and the effect such obligations are expected to have on liquidity and cash flows in future periods are as follows contractual obligation total less than year years more than years years more than years operating leases purchasing obligations as of july   the total liabilities associated with uncertain tax positions under fin no 
were  and were included in accrued income taxes and in refundable and deferred income taxes as a result of our adoption of fin no 
due to the complexity associated with our tax uncertainties  we cannot make a reasonably reliable estimate of the period in which we expect to settle the non current liabilities associated with these uncertain tax positions 
therefore  these amounts have not been included in the contractual obligations table 
we currently have approximately  in revolving credit facilities with banks available for direct borrowings 
our revolving credit facility agreements contain a number of covenants  including a covenant requiring us to maintain a tangible net worth as defined in the revolving credit facility agreement of no less than  as of the end of any fiscal quarter 
we were in compliance with this covenant at july  with a tangible net worth of approximately  as of july   there were no direct borrowings or off balance sheet arrangements

critical accounting policies management s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
our most critical accounting policies  and the estimates involved in their application  have a significant impact on the preparation of these consolidated financial statements 
these policies involve significant estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expense  and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities 
we continue to evaluate our estimates and judgments on an on going basis 
by their nature  the policies discussed below require management to make its most difficult and subjective estimates and judgments  often on matters that are inherently uncertain 
our estimates and judgments are based on our historical experience  terms of existing contracts  our observance of trends in the industry  information provided by our customers  and information available from other outside sources  as appropriate 
for a complete discussion of our significant accounting policies  see note  summary of business operations and significant accounting policies  of the notes to consolidated financial statements  included in item  exhibits and financial statements schedule  of this annual report on form k 
we believe the following accounting policies require management to make the most difficult estimates and judgments in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements and accordingly are critical to an understanding of our financial statements 
revenue recognition policy we provide engineering services to some of our customers on a contractual basis and generally recognize revenue using the percentage of completion method 
we generally estimate the progress towards completion on contracts with a fixed fee arrangement on a monthly basis utilizing costs incurred to date as a percentage of total estimated costs at completion of the project or on a milestone basis based on contractual terms  as appropriate 
when total cost estimates exceed revenues  we accrue for the estimated losses immediately 
judgments and uncertainties our revenue recognition accounting methodology for engineering services with a fixed fee arrangement involves uncertainties because it requires management to make estimates of our total estimated costs at completion of projects 
the timing of when revenue  profits  and loss reserves are recognized may fluctuate if changes to the estimates of costs at completion of projects are needed 
effect if actual results differ from assumptions we have not made any material changes in the accounting methodology used to determine our estimated costs at completion of projects during the past three fiscal years 
if actual results are not consistent with our estimates or assumptions  we may be exposed to losses or gains that could be material 
inventory reserves policy we value our inventory at the lower of the cost of the inventory or fair market value through the establishment of inventory writedowns 
management assesses the recoverability of inventory based on types and levels of inventory held  product life cycles  and changes in technology 
a variety of methodologies are used to determine the amount of inventory writedowns necessary for excess and obsolete inventory 
write 
table of contents downs are based upon the age of the inventory  lower of cost or market  along with significant management judgments concerning future demands for the inventory 
if actual demand for our products is less than our estimates  or we experience a higher incidence of inventory obsolescence because of rapidly changing technology and customer requirements  additional writedowns for existing inventories might be recorded in future periods 
once recorded  inventory valuation writedowns are not subsequently reversed until the inventory is used or disposed of 
judgments and uncertainties our inventory writedowns involve uncertainties because the calculation requires management to make assumptions and to apply judgment regarding inventory aging  forecasted customer demand  and technological obsolescence 
effect if actual results differ from assumptions we have not made any material changes in the accounting methodology we use to establish our inventory writedowns during the past three fiscal years 
if estimates regarding customer demand are inaccurate or changes in technology affect demand for certain products in an unforeseen manner  we may be exposed to losses that could be material 
a difference in our actual writedown at july   would have affected net earnings by approximately in fiscal year share based compensation policy we have share based compensation plans  which include stock options and unvested restricted stock awards  and an employee stock purchase plan 
we determine the fair value of our stock option awards at the date of grant using the black scholes option pricing models 
we determine the fair value of unvested time based and performance based restricted stock awards at the date of grant using the closing market price of our common stock on the date of grant 
we recognize the associated share based compensation expense for time based awards on a straight line basis over the vesting periods of the awards  net of estimated forfeitures 
forfeiture rates are estimated based on historical pre vesting forfeitures and are updated on the vesting dates to reflect actual forfeitures 
the amount of share based compensation expense for performance based unvested restricted stock awards that is recognized on a straight line basis over the performance period is based upon the number of shares that management ultimately expects to vest 
for performance based awards  management evaluates the probability of meeting the performance criteria at each balance sheet date and related compensation cost is amortized over the performance period on a straight line basis because such awards vest only at the end of the measurement period 
changes to the probability assessment and the estimate of shares expected to vest will result in adjustments to the related share based compensation expense that will be recorded in the period of the change 
if the performance is not achieved  no compensation cost is recognized and any previously recognized compensation cost is reversed 
judgments and uncertainties option pricing models and generally accepted valuation techniques require management to make assumptions and to apply judgment to determine the fair value of our awards 
these assumptions and judgments include estimating the future volatility of our stock price  expected dividend yield  future employee turnover rates and future employee stock option exercise behaviors 
performance based non vested restricted stock awards require management to make assumptions regarding the likelihood of achieving company or personal performance goals 
changes in these assumptions can materially affect the fair value estimate and the amount of compensation expense we recognize 
effect if actual results differ from assumptions we have not made any material changes in the accounting methodology we use to determine our share based compensation expense during the past three fiscal years 
if actual results are not consistent with our estimates or assumptions  particularly those used in determining the accrual percentage for performance based non vested restricted stock awards  we may be exposed to changes in share based compensation expense that could be material 
a change in our share based compensation expense for the year ended july   would have affected net earnings by approximately in fiscal year 
table of contents warranty reserves policy we estimate the costs of product warranties based on specific warranty claims  historical data  and engineering estimates  where applicable 
judgments and uncertainties our warranty reserve involves uncertainties because the calculation requires management to make assumptions based on specific warranty claims  historical data  and engineering estimates  where applicable 
effect if actual results differ from assumptions we have not made any material changes in the accounting methodology we use to establish our warranty reserves during the past three fiscal years 
if actual product failure rates or service delivery costs differ from our estimates  revisions to the estimated warranty liability would be required 
such revisions could adversely affect our operating results 
a change in our warranty reserve at july   would have affected net earnings by approximately in fiscal year purchase price allocation for business combinations policy we apply the purchase accounting method to account for business combinations  which requires extensive use of accounting estimates and judgments to allocate the purchase price to the fair market value of the assets and liabilities purchased  with the excess value  if any  being classified as goodwill 
for those assets with finite lives  useful lives are assigned to those intangibles and their values are amortized over their remaining life 
judgments and uncertainties our purchase price allocation methodology involves uncertainties because it requires management to make assumptions and to apply judgment to estimate the fair value of acquired assets and liabilities 
management estimates the fair value of assets and liabilities based upon the carrying value of the acquired assets and widely accepted valuation techniques  including discounted cash flows and market multiple analyses 
unanticipated events or circumstances may occur which could affect the accuracy of our fair value estimates  including assumptions regarding industry economic factors and business strategies 
effect if actual results differ from assumptions during the last three fiscal years  we completed one significant acquisition  which was the acquisition of copley in april for  including transaction costs 
see note  business combination  to the notes to consolidated financial statements  included in this annual report on form k  for the complete purchase price allocation 
if actual results are not consistent with our estimates or assumptions  accelerated amortization for intangible assets with finite lives or impairment charges for intangible assets or goodwill could be required 
impairment of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets policy we evaluate goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of the goodwill or other intangible assets may not be recoverable 
we conduct our impairment evaluation by performing internal valuation analyses  which consider both the market approach and income approach 
under the market approach  the fair value of the reporting unit is based on trading and acquisition multiples 
under the income approach  the fair value of the reporting unit is based on the present value of estimated future cash flows 
in the second quarter of fiscal year  we completed our annual impairment testing of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets using the methodologies described herein  and determined there was no impairment 
the carrying values of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets related to the acquisition of copley at july  were  and  respectively 
judgments and uncertainties the valuation analyses described above involve uncertainties because they require management to make assumptions and to apply judgment to estimate industry economic factors and the profitability of future business strategies 
it is our policy to conduct impairment testing based on our current business strategy in light of present industry and economic conditions  as well as our future expectations 

table of contents effect if actual results differ from assumptions if actual results are not consistent with our estimates or assumptions  we may be exposed to an impairment charge that could be material 
a change in our calculation of the fair value of the reporting unit at december  that includes the copley goodwill and indefinite lived intangible asset would have had no effect on net earnings in fiscal year income tax contingencies policy our income tax returns  like those of most companies  are periodically audited by domestic and foreign tax authorities 
these audits include questions regarding our tax filing positions  including the timing and amount of deductions and the allocation of income among various tax jurisdictions 
at any one time  multiple tax years are subject to audit by the various tax authorities 
in evaluating the exposures associated with our various tax filing positions  we record a liability for exposures subject to a minimum threshold of more likely than not before any benefit is recognized 
a number of years may elapse before a particular matter  for which we have established a liability  is audited and fully resolved or clarified 
we adjust our liability for unrecognized tax benefits and income tax provision in the period in which an uncertain tax position is effectively settled  the statute of limitations expires for the relevant taxing authority to examine the tax position or when more information becomes available 
in fiscal year  we adopted fin no 
 which requires management to perform a two step evaluation of all tax positions  ensuring that these tax return positions meet the more likely than not recognition threshold and can be measured with sufficient precision to determine the benefit recognized in the financial statements 
these evaluations provide management with a comprehensive model for how a company should recognize  measure  present  and disclose in its financial statements certain tax positions that we have taken or expect to take on our income tax returns 
judgments and uncertainties our liability for unrecognized tax benefits involves uncertainties because management is required to make assumptions and to apply judgment to estimate the exposures associated with our various filing positions 
effect if actual results differ from assumptions although we believe that the judgments and estimates discussed herein are reasonable  actual results could differ  and we may be exposed to losses or gains that could be material 
to the extent we prevail in matters for which a liability has been established  or are required to pay amounts in excess of our established liability  the effective income tax rate in a given financial statement period could be materially affected 
an unfavorable tax settlement generally would require use of our cash and result in an increase in our effective income tax rate in the period of resolution 
a favorable tax settlement would be recognized as a reduction in our effective income tax rate in the period of resolution 
deferred tax valuation allowances policy we are required to estimate on our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions within which we operate 
this process involves assessing temporary differences resulting from different treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included within the balance sheet 
we must then assess the likelihood that the deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and  to the extent that recovery is not more than likely  a valuation allowance must be established 
to the extent a valuation allowance is established  we must include an expense within the tax provision in the statement of operations 
judgments and uncertainties our effective income tax rate is affected by changes in tax law  the tax jurisdiction of new business ventures  the level of earnings  and the results of tax audits 
our deferred tax valuation allowance involves uncertainties because the calculation requires management to make assumptions based on historical data  future book income  and tax planning strategies 

table of contents effect if actual results differ from assumptions we have not made any material changes in the accounting methodology we use to establish our deferred tax asset valuation allowances during the past three fiscal years 
in the event that actual results differ from the estimates and assumptions we use in determining our effective tax rate  the provision for income taxes and results of operations could be materially impacted 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk all dollar amounts in this item a are in thousands 
we place our cash investments in high quality financial instruments and  by policy  limit the amount of credit exposure to any one financial institution 
we face limited exposure to financial market risks  including adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates and changes in interest rates 
these exposures may change over time as business practices evolve and could have a material adverse impact on our financial results 
our primary exposure is related to fluctuations between the us dollar and local currencies for our subsidiaries in canada and europe 
our cash and investments include cash equivalents  which we consider to be investments purchased with original maturities of three months or less 
investments having original maturities in excess of three months are stated at amortized cost  which approximates fair value  and are classified as held to maturity 
total interest income for fiscal year was  an interest rate change of would not have a material impact on the fair value of our portfolio or on future earnings
