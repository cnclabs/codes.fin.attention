item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation general we develop  manufacture and sell high energy power systems utilizing our proprietary phosphate based lithium ion technology for diverse applications  with special emphasis on portable appliances and future generations of hybrid and electric vehicles 
our mission is to promote the wide adoption of high performance  safe  long cycle life  environmentally friendly  low cost energy storage systems and address the significant market opportunity we believe is available to us by drawing on the numerous benefits of our latest energy storage technology  deep intellectual property portfolio  and the extensive experience of our management team 
total revenue in fiscal was million  an increase of compared to the prior fiscal year 
we believe revenue will continue to grow in fiscal year from new customer sales from the increasing demand in the us and emea europe  middle east and africa markets for alternative energy solution systems 
we expanded the capacity of china manufacturing and support operations in our two wholly owned subsidiaries 
going concern as a result of our limited cash resources and history of operating losses there is substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern 
we presently have no further commitments for financing by our chairman carl berg and or his affiliates or any other source 
if we are unable to obtain financing from mr 
berg or others on terms acceptable to us  or at all  we may be forced to cease all operations and liquidate our assets 
our cash requirements may vary materially from those now planned because of changes in our operations  including the failure to achieve expected revenues  greater than expected expenses  changes in oem relationships  market conditions  the failure to timely realize our product development goals  and other adverse developments 
these events could have a negative impact on our available liquidity sources during fiscal highlights key product introductions and milestones based on our epoch and lithium iron magnesium phosphate technology during the current year include in march  we introduced a new revision of u charge  our third generation of lithium iron magnesium phosphate energy storage systems  which are expected to be commercially available in the second quarter of fiscal u charge features our safe  long life lithium phosphate technology which utilizes a phosphate based cathode material 
we believe that the improved features and functionality of the latest u charge lithium iron magnesium phosphate energy storage systems are well suited for ev  phev and similar applications 
u charge lithium phosphate energy storage systems address the safety and limited life weaknesses of other lithium technologies while offering a solution that is competitive in cost and performance 
this revision of u charge builds upon these features and adds improvements in state of charge  balancing and field repairability 
we have continued the development of our epoch technology 
the attributes embodied in epoch include communications  control  reliability  modularity and measurement feature enhancements 
we believe that epoch technology offers design and performance capabilities that will facilitate adoption in automotive  industrial  ups  telecommunications  aerospace and military markets not traditionally served by other lithium ion solutions 
this technology will allow us to offer customer focused solutions based upon proven technology 
our research and development efforts are focused on the design of new products utilizing our lithium iron magnesium phosphate chemistry  the continuous improvement of the manufacturing process of our second generation lithium phosphate technology  the development of different cell constructions to optimize power and size for new applications  as well as developing future materials based on the lithium iron magnesium phosphate technology platform

the increase in revenues in fiscal  compared to fiscal  was primarily due to additional sales of the large format batteries  to new and existing customers  which include u charge and custom batteries designed for segway 
we had approximately  and  in deferred revenue on our balance sheet at march  and march   respectively  primarily related to sales shipping in the end of the fourth quarter 
segway sales accounted for  and of our total product sales in  and  respectively 
we expect sales of the large format battery system to increase during fiscal  due to the growing demand of alternative energy storage systems and the fulfillment of current sales agreements 
the large format battery system sales represent   and of our total revenue for fiscal  and  respectively 
the growth in large format battery systems sales are due to the increase in demand in alternative energy solutions driven largely by the rising costs of fossil fuels and a market focus on environmentally friendly energy solutions 

table of contents licensing and royalty revenue licensing and royalty revenues relate to revenue from licensing agreements for our battery construction technology 
fiscal year licensing and royalty revenue was million  compared to  in fiscal year  and  in fiscal year licensing and royalty revenue increased during fiscal year from a new agreement with varta microbattery gmbh 
during fiscal year  we continued to receive revenue from the agreement with amperex technology limited

gross margin deficit gross margin as a percentage of revenue was for the fiscal year ended march  as compared to for the fiscal year ended march  and a gross margin of for the fiscal year ended march  during fiscal year  the gross margin decreased due to charges to cost of products sold related to the discontinued material costs of epochtm and n charge  totaling million  or of revenue  as compared to fiscal year in fiscal year  the improvement in our manufacturing efficiency contributed to the increase in our gross margin 
in addition  during fiscal year  a vendor agreed to provide a credit of approximately  for defective inventory that had been received and written off by the company in fiscal year as a result  included in fiscal year is  reduction of cost of goods which contributes to our improved gross margin 
we expect cost of sales  as a percentage of sales  to decrease as production volumes increase and as the lower cost strategy improves the manufacturing efficiency

research and product development expenses totaled million in fiscal year  million in fiscal year  and million in fiscal year during fiscal year  research and development costs increased by approximately million  or  as compared to fiscal year  primarily due to increases in wage and salary expenses  and increased product development expenses 
research and development expenses decreased from fiscal year to due to the reduction of consulting and material costs in our nevada facility 
during fiscal year  million of share based compensation was allocated to research and development expenses as compared to million in fiscal year  and million in fiscal we expect research and development expenses to remain relatively steady as we create and develop new products 
marketing marketing expenses consist primarily of costs related to sales and marketing personnel  and public relations and promotional materials 
marketing expenses of million in fiscal year were million  or higher than fiscal year the increase in cost during fiscal year  as compared to fiscal year  was primarily related to wage and salary expenses related to additional employees  and travel and trade show expenses

we expect general and administrative expenses to increase in line with our associated needs as the company grows 
other costs related to our manufacturing transition impairment charge there were impairment charges of approximately   and  recorded during fiscal years  and respectively 
the fiscal impairment charge relates to fixed assets that were purchased for the expansion of our production facilities in china 
these production assets were deemed to be impaired since the additional capacity provided by these assets will not be necessary to meet expected demand until later than previously expected 
the and impairment charges also relate to a write down of machinery and equipment 
gain loss on sale of assets loss on sales of assets amounted to approximately   and  in fiscal years   and  respectively  and resulted primarily from consolidating our china operations into two plants in suzhou  china

interest expense fluctuations are a result of changes in the underlying interest rate on one of the loans  which is indexed to the libor rate 
liquidity and capital resources at march   our principal source of liquidity was cash and cash equivalents of million 
we do not expect our cash and cash equivalents will be sufficient to fund our operating and capital needs for the next three to six months following march  nor do we anticipate product sales during fiscal will be sufficient to cover our operating expenses 
historically  we have relied upon management s ability to periodically arrange for additional equity or debt financing to meet our liquidity requirements 
unless our product sales are greater than management currently forecasts or there are other changes to our business plan  we will need to arrange for additional financing to fund operating and capital needs 
this financing could take the form of debt or equity 
given our historical operating results and the amount of our existing debt  as well as the other factors  we may not be able to arrange for debt or equity financing on favorable terms or at all

basis of presentation  critical accounting policies and estimates we prepare our consolidated financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the us the preparation of our financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts 
we believe our most critical accounting policies and estimates relate to revenue recognition  impairment of long lived assets  inventory reserves  inventory overhead absorption  warranty liabilities  and share based compensation expense 
our accounting policies are described in the notes to consolidated financial statements  note  summary of significant accounting policies 
the following further describes the methods and assumptions we use in our critical accounting policies and estimates 
revenue recognition we generate revenues from sales of products including batteries and battery systems  and from licensing fees and royalties per technology license agreements 
product sales are recognized when all of the following criteria are met persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  seller s price to the buyer is fixed and determinable  and collection is reasonably assured 
product shipments that are not recognized as revenue during the period shipped  primarily product shipments to resellers that are subject to right of return  are recorded as deferred revenue and reflected as a liability on our balance sheet 
products shipped with the rights of return are included in finished goods inventory as we retain title to the products 
for reseller shipments where revenue recognition is deferred  we record revenue and relieve inventory based upon the reseller supplied reporting of sales to their end customers or their inventory reporting 
for direct customers  we estimate a return rate percentage based upon our historical experience 
from time to time we provide sales incentives in the form of rebates or other price adjustments  these are generally recorded as reductions to revenue on the latter of the date the related revenue is recognized or at the time the rebate or sales incentive is offered 
licensing fees are recognized as revenue upon completion of an executed agreement and delivery of licensed information  if there are no significant remaining vendor obligations and collection of the related receivable is reasonably assured 
royalty revenues are recognized upon licensee revenue reporting and when collection is reasonably assured 
impairment of long lived assets we perform a review of long lived tangible and intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
recoverability of these assets is measured by comparison of their carrying amounts to 
table of contents future undiscounted cash flows that the assets are expected to generate 
if long lived assets are considered to be impaired  the impairment to be recognized equals the amount by which the carrying value of the assets exceeds its fair value and is recorded in the period the determination was made

recent accounting pronouncements in september  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas  fair value measurements 
this standard defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value in accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  and expands disclosure about fair value measurements 
this pronouncement applies under other accounting standards that require or permit fair value measurements 
accordingly  this statement does not require any new fair value measurement 
this statement is effective for fiscal years beginning after november   and interim periods within those fiscal years 
however  sfas is amended by financial statement position fsp fas  application of fasb statement to fasb statement and other accounting pronouncements that address fair value measurements for purposes of lease classification or measurement under statement  which excludes from the scope of this provision arrangements accounted for under sfas  accounting for leases 
sfas is also amended by fsp fas effective date of fasb statement no 
 which delays the effective date of sfas for all nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities  except those that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis at least annually 
this fsp partially defers the effective date of statement to fiscal years beginning after november   and interim periods within those fiscal years for items within the scope of this fsp 
sfas is also amended by fsp fas  determining the fair value of a financial asset when the market for that asset is not active  which clarifies the application of sfas in a market that is not active and provides an example to illustrate key considerations in determining the fair value of a financial asset when the market for that financial asset is not active 
we adopted sfas on april   except as it applies to those nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities as noted in fsp fas  fsp fas  and fsp fas the partial adoption of sfas did not have a material impact on the company s consolidated financial position or results of operations 
in february  the fasb issued sfas  the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities including an amendment of fasb statement this standard permits an entity to measure many financial instruments and certain other assets and liabilities at fair value on an instrument by instrument basis 
this statement is effective for fiscal years beginning after november  we adopted sfas on january  as required 
the adoption of sfas did not have a significant impact on our financial position or results of operations as we did not elect the fair value option for items within the scope of this statement 
in december  the fasb issued sfas r  business combinations a replacement of fasb statement  which significantly changes the principles and requirements for how the acquirer of a business recognizes and measures in its financial statements the identifiable assets acquired  the liabilities assumed  and any non controlling interest in the acquiree 
the statement also provides guidance for recognizing and measuring the goodwill acquired in the business combination and determines what information to disclose to enable users of the financial statements to evaluate the nature and financial effects of the business combination 
this statement is effective prospectively  except for certain retrospective adjustments to deferred tax balances  for fiscal years beginning after december  based on its current operations  the company does not expect that the adoption of fas r will have a material impact on its financial position or results of operations 
in april  the fasb issued fsp fas  determination of the useful life of intangible assets 
fsp fas amends the factors that should be considered in developing renewal or extension assumptions used to determine the useful life of a recognized intangible asset under fasb statement no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
fsp fas is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after december   and interim periods within those fiscal years

 the hierarchy of generally accepted accounting principles 
sfas identifies the sources of accounting principles and the framework for selecting the principles used in the preparation of financial statements of nongovernmental entities that are presented in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states the gaap hierarchy
