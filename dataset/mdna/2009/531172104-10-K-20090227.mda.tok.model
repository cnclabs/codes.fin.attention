impairment of real estate the company evaluates its real estate investments upon occurrence of significant adverse changes in operations to assess whether any impairment indicators are present that could affect the recovery of the recorded value 
indicators the company uses to determine whether an impairment evaluation is necessary includes the low occupancy level of the property  holding period for the property  strategic decisions regarding future development plans for a property under development and land held for development and other market factors 
if impairment indicators are present the company performs an undiscounted cash flow analysis and compares the net carrying amount of the property to the property s estimated undiscounted future cash flow over the anticipated holding period 
the company assesses the expected undiscounted cash flows based upon estimated capitalization rates  historic operating results and market conditions that may affect the property 
if any real estate investment is considered impaired  the carrying value of the property is written down to its estimated fair value 
fair value is estimated based on the discounting of future expected cash flows at a risk adjusted interest rate 
during the years ended december   and the company recognized impairment losses of million  million and million  respectively

in the event that a tenant terminates its lease  the unamortized portion of the intangible is written off 
the company assesses goodwill for impairment annually in november and in interim periods if certain events occur indicating the carrying value is impaired 
the company performs its analysis for potential impairment of goodwill in accordance with sfas  which requires that a two step impairment test be performed on goodwill 
in the first step  the fair value of the reporting unit is compared to its carrying value 
if the fair value exceeds its carrying value  goodwill is not impaired  and no further testing is required 
if the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value  then a second step must be performed in order to determine the implied fair value of the goodwill and compare it to the carrying value of the goodwill 
if the carrying value of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value then an impairment loss is recorded equal to the difference 
no impairment losses were recognized during the years ended december  or investments in unconsolidated joint ventures the company analyzes its investments in joint ventures under fasb interpretation no

 determining whether a general partner  or the general partners as a group  controls a limited partnership or similar entity when the limited partners have certain rights eitf to determine if the venture should be consolidated 
the company does not have any interests in variable interest entities 
the company accounts for its investments in unconsolidated joint ventures using the equity method of accounting as the company exercises significant influence  but does not control these entities 
these investments are recorded initially at cost  as investments in unconsolidated joint ventures  and subsequently adjusted for equity in earnings and cash contributions and distributions 
on a periodic basis  management assesses whether there are any indicators that the value of the company s investments in unconsolidated joint ventures may be impaired 
an investment is impaired only if management s estimate of the value of the investment is less than the carrying value of the investment  and such decline in value is deemed to be other than temporary 
to the extent impairment has occurred  the loss is measured as the excess of the carrying amount of the investment over the estimated fair value of the investment 
the company s estimates of fair value for each investment are based on a number of assumptions that are subject to economic and market uncertainties including  among others  demand for space  competition for tenants  changes in market rental rates  and operating costs 
as these factors are difficult to predict and are subject to future events that may alter management s assumptions  the values estimated by management in its impairment analyses may not be realized
