item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview emeritus is one of the nation s largest providers of assisted living and alzheimer s memory care services 
as of december   the company operated communities in states 
fiscal in review the year was marked by a weakening us and global economy and turmoil in the financial and housing markets that continues into despite these economic conditions  we weathered the challenges presented and continued to execute our strategic plan  which is discussed in detail under item  business business strategy  in this form k 
the volatility in our stock price in the second half of the year does not reflect the fact that our business fundamentals remain solid  as evidenced by growth in same community operating income compared to a summary of the year s events is as follows average occupancy on a same community basis increased to in from in and declined from to on a consolidated basis 
there is anecdotal evidence that the depressed housing market and economic downturn has resulted in some seniors delaying a move to assisted living 
we believe that our lead management and referral development systems and practices implemented in helped us to prevent significant slippage in our occupancy 
average monthly revenue per unit increased by on a same community basis and overall 
average monthly revenue per unit on a same community basis increased overall from the fourth quarter of to the fourth quarter of improvements in our resident assessment and care planning systems and practices allowed us to more effectively capture level of care revenues  especially evident in our quarter over quarter average revenue comparison 
additionally  we were able to increase rental rates in many markets 
our risk management outcomes continued to improve in  resulting in reduced premiums for both professional and general liability insurance and workers compensation coverage 
we were negatively impacted  however  by increases in labor  fuel and food costs 
we obtained favorable financing in order to purchase the real property underlying communities that we previously leased 
this was in line with our long term strategy of buying leased assets in transactions that create value over time by eliminating rent escalators and capturing the full future upside potential of the properties 
we paid off million of convertible debentures and refinanced or extended approximately million of other debt 
we extended the terms of million of debt due in and to and beyond 
we added new communities to our consolidated portfolio and sold two underperforming communities 
looking ahead to we cannot predict the depth and duration of the economic recession or its impact on our financial condition and results of operations 
however  we believe that the needs driven nature of our business  pent up demand and reduced supply of new senior housing in our sector will mitigate the effect of the weakness in the housing market 
we will continue to focus on the fundamentals of occupancy and rate growth as well as expense control 
in we implemented changes to our field oversight structure for management of revenue cycle systems and deployed a new system for tracking daily labor hours in order to improve operational efficiency 
we have spent the last year implementing scalable structures and systems to better monitor and manage our key business drivers and believe that we are now in a position to absorb additional capacity without significant changes to our overhead structure 
as part of our long term strategy  we intend to continue to selectively pursue potential acquisitions

table of contents our portfolio the following table sets forth a summary of our property interests 
as of december  as of december  as of december  buildings units buildings units buildings units owned leased consolidated portfolio managed admin services joint venture partnership operated portfolio percentage increase owned communities increased since december   primarily through the acquisition of communities we formerly operated under long term leases 
of those owned communities  three are in property held for sale on the balance sheet and included in discontinued operations on the income statements  representing units 
of the leased communities at december   are accounted for as operating leases  are accounted for as capital leases  and four are accounted for as owned due to sale lease back accounting requirements 
the percentage increase indicates the change from the prior year 
the total consolidated portfolio of  units at december   consists of the following unit types total units independent living assisted living alzheimer s care skilled nursing care operating units held for sale properties units taken out of service designed capacity units the units taken out of service represent rooms that have been converted for alternative uses  such as additional office space  and are not available for immediate occupancy  and therefore excluded from the calculation of occupancy percentage 
these units are put back into service as demand dictates

table of contents results of operations for the fiscal year  we recorded a net loss of million compared to net losses of million in and million in operating income from continuing operations  which excludes interest  equity earnings losses  and other nonoperating items  was million in compared to million in and million in total operating revenues increased to million in from million in and million in two of the important factors affecting our financial results are the rates we charge our residents and the occupancy levels we achieve in our communities 
we rely primarily on our residents ability to pay our charges for services from their own or family resources and expect that we will do so for the foreseeable future 
although care in an assisted living community is typically less expensive than in a skilled nursing facility  we believe that generally only seniors with income or assets meeting or exceeding the regional median can afford to reside in our communities 
in this context  we must be sensitive to our residents financial circumstances and remain aware that rates and occupancy are interrelated 
in evaluating the rate component  we generally rely on the average monthly revenue per unit  computed by dividing the total operating revenue for a particular period by the average number of occupied units for the same period 
in evaluating the occupancy component  we generally rely on an average occupancy rate  computed by dividing the average units occupied during a particular period by the average number of units available during the period 
we evaluate these and other operating components for our consolidated portfolio  which includes the communities we own and lease  and our operating portfolio  which also includes the communities we manage 
in our consolidated portfolio  our average monthly revenue per unit increased from  to  and to  in   and  respectively 
the change from to represents an increase of  or and from to  an increase of  or 
in our consolidated portfolio  our average occupancy rate in was and increased to in and declined to in we believe that this increase in occupancy rates in reflects industry wide factors  such as the declining supply of vacant units  as well as our own actions and policies 
we believe the decline in occupancy rate from to was predominately due to the general economic downturn in in spite of this  the occupancy rate at december  was back up to  primarily due to our efforts to keep the occupancy rate on an upward trend while  at the same time  we continued to realize increases in our average monthly rate per unit 
we continue to evaluate the factors of rate and occupancy to find the optimum balance in each community  as witnessed by the increase in occupancy rates and average monthly revenue per unit from through since our inception in  we have incurred cumulative operating losses totaling approximately million as of december  we believe that these losses have resulted from our early emphasis on expansion  financing costs arising from multiple financing and refinancing transactions related to this expansion  administrative and corporate expenses that we incurred in anticipation of further expansion and increased emphasis on risk management and financial reporting controls  the impact in the early years on many of our leases from capital and financing lease treatments  and occupancy rates remaining lower for longer periods than we anticipated 
while we have generally realized growth in both our occupancy and average monthly rates  we anticipate continued losses in the near term until such time as our occupancy stabilizes 
our current emphasis is on maximization of cash flows and cost containment as we work toward improvements in occupancy and average rates  selective growth  and changes in our capital structure  such as acquisition of leased properties and refinancing of existing debt

total operating revenues year ended december  d d in thousands community revenue management fees total operating revenues this increase in total community revenues of million is mostly due to additional revenues related to the acquisition or lease of communities from january   to the end of these additional communities represent an increase in revenue of approximately million for the remaining increase in revenues of million  or  is related to the remaining communities 
of this increase  million is primarily due to an increase in the average revenue per unit and million is due to an increase in occupancy for those remaining communities  despite the decrease in the occupancy rates for all consolidated communities as presented in the table below 
management fees increased by  in the year ended december   primarily due to the increase in management fees from the blackstone jv and the management fees from the stow jv starting in june year ended december  d d average monthly revenue per occupied unit average occupancy rate ppt percentage points we attribute the overall occupancy decline in to a combination of the addition of new communities with lower occupancy rates and  to a certain extent  the downturn in the economy and related credit market crisis  which may have resulted in seniors delaying the move from their homes into our communities 
emeritus corporation management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued december  
table of contents community operations year ended december  d d in thousands community operations as a percent of revenue ppt community operations expenses represent direct costs incurred to operate the communities and include costs such as resident activities  marketing  housekeeping  food service  payroll and benefits  facility maintenance  utilities  taxes  and licenses 
the increase in community operations expense of million is primarily due to the acquisition or leasing of the additional communities  which accounted for million of the increase 
the remaining increase of million  or  is primarily due to employee related expenses of million and a million net increase in various other community operating expenses primarily attributable to normal inflationary increases 
our professional and general liability insurance expense was million and million in and respectively  a  expense reduction 
this reduction in expense reflects the impact of our risk management efforts over the past few years to reduce both frequency and cost of claims  resulting in a decrease in actuarial projected losses for all open years from to we recorded expense reductions for prior year claims exposure of million and million in and  respectively 
total current year professional liability expense for and was million and million  respectively  exclusive of prior year adjustments 
while the decrease in annual professional liability expense from to was not significant when comparing the total from year to year  it was significant given the substantial growth of the company over that time  adding communities to our consolidated portfolio while reflecting an overall decrease in expense 
similarly  our worker s compensation expense was million and million in and  respectively  a  expense increase 
we recorded an expense reduction for prior year claims exposure of million in  and an increase of  in total current year workers compensation expense for and was million and million  respectively  exclusive of prior year adjustments 
the current year expense increase of million  or  grew at a much slower rate than our increase in total community operating costs of  which was primarily driven by the growth in communities included in our consolidated portfolio as discussed above 
this rate improvement as a percent of payroll dollars represents our revised estimates of the ultimate exposure under our workers compensation programs based upon actuarial valuation reports 
general and administrative year ended december  d d in thousands general and administrative as a percent of revenue ppt the increase in general and administrative expenses of million was primarily related to increased staffing costs for regional and corporate overhead positions  including approximately million in salaries and benefits  and million of incentive compensation expense 
the increase in salaries and benefits resulted from increases in the number of personnel and in average salaries 
much of the increase in personnel relates to the summerville acquisition  the effects of which are more pronounced in because the acquisition closed in september the remaining increase in general and administrative expenses consisted of travel of million  professional and emeritus corporation management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued december  
table of contents consulting fees of  accounting fees of  payroll processing of  and legal fees of  the remaining increase of million was comprised of increases and decreases in various other accounts 
included in general and administrative expenses is non cash stock compensation expense of million in and million in since of the communities we operate are managed rather than owned or leased at december   general and administrative expense as a percentage of operating revenues for all communities  including managed communities  may be more meaningful for industry wide comparisons 
general and administrative expense as a percentage of operating revenues for all communities decreased to from for the years ended december  and  respectively 
impairment loss on long lived assets year ended december  d d in thousands impairment loss on long lived assets   n a as a percent of revenue ppt the impairment loss recorded in is comprised of the following write down of three communities that we are currently in the process of selling million  write down of our purchase option intangible asset 
we recorded additional impairment losses of million on communities held for sale  which are included in loss from discontinued operations 
the fair value of the communities was determined based on recent offers from prospective purchasers 
the fair value of the purchase option was determined by applying a capitalization rate to the projected cash flows in the option year 
the decline in the fair value was based on a change in the company s estimate of the future results of operations and cash flows of the related community 
for a detailed discussion of these impairments and how they were calculated  see note  fair value measurements  in notes to consolidated financial statements included in this form k 
goodwill is tested for impairment annually and more frequently if facts and circumstances indicate goodwill carrying values exceed the estimated fair value of the company 
we performed the annual impairment test as of october   and concluded that no impairment charge was required 
as a result of a decline in our stock price in the fourth quarter  we tested goodwill for impairment again as of december   and determined that our goodwill was not impaired 
however  our stock closed at on march   thus triggering another impairment test as of march  if our stock price does not sufficiently increase by march   it is likely that a goodwill impairment charge will be recorded in the first quarter of emeritus corporation management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued december  
table of contents depreciation and amortization year ended december  d d in thousands depreciation and amortization as a percent of revenue ppt the increase in depreciation and amortization expense of million is primarily the result of an increase of million in depreciation and amortization from the summerville acquisition and the acquisitions of previously leased communities 
facility lease expense year ended december  d d in thousands operating lease expense above below market rent straight line rent total facility lease expense as a percent of revenue ppt total facility lease expense is comprised of rent expense under operating leases  which is adjusted by the amortization of above and below market rent intangibles and straight line rent deferrals 
the increases set forth in the table above are due primarily from the september acquisition of the summerville communities  partially offset by a decrease in operating lease expense due to the acquisition during and of communities formerly operated under operating leases 
we leased and communities under operating leases as of december  and  respectively 
interest income year ended december  d d in thousands interest income as a percent of revenue ppt interest income is primarily attributable to interest earned on invested cash balances and interest earned on restricted deposits

table of contents interest expense year ended december  d d in thousands interest expense as a percent of revenue ppt the increase in interest expense of million resulted primarily from an increase in interest expense of million from debt assumed or incurred related to the company s and acquisitions 
these increases were partially offset by reductions of million in other interest expense due to scheduled paydowns on loans and mortgages 
equity earnings losses in unconsolidated joint ventures year ended december  d d in thousands  except percentages equity earnings losses in unconsolidated joint ventures as a percent of revenue ppt equity losses in were primarily from blackstone jv equity losses of million and equity losses of  from the opening of a new community in our stow jv 
equity earnings in unconsolidated joint ventures of million for were primarily driven by net equity gains of million from our investment in senior med  principally from a gain recognized upon the company s divestiture of that investment  offset by equity losses from our blackstone jv of million 
the blackstone equity losses include non cash losses from the change in fair value of an interest rate swap of million and million in and  respectively 
exclusive of the interest rate swap charge  our equity loss from the blackstone jv improved by million

income taxes year ended december  d d in thousands provision for income taxes as a percent of revenue ppt the provision for income taxes for the year ended december   is principally due to estimated state income and franchise tax liabilities 
net loss and property related expense in comparing the net losses for and  management believes it is important to consider the impact of lease accounting on our property related expenses  which includes depreciation and amortization  facility lease expense  and interest expense that is directly related to our leased communities 
the property related expenses directly associated with our accounting for leases include operating leases  capital leases  financing leases  and straight line accounting for rent escalators for many of our operating leases 
these lease accounting treatments generally result in greater property related expense than actual lease payments made in the early years of the affected leases and less property related expense than actual lease payments made in later years

the impact of lease accounting increased by  in the current year from the comparable period last year due primarily to the summerville acquisition  partially offset by a reduction in interest expense on the capital leases in connection with the normal paydown of the lease obligation and the termination of leases related to the acquisition of the underlying real estate 
notwithstanding the effects of lease accounting treatment  the actual lease payments required under most of our leases will continue to increase annually and  as a result  we will need to improve our results from community operations to cover these increases

the table below shows the amounts and changes in average monthly revenue per occupied unit and occupancy rates year ended december  d d average monthly revenue per occupied unit average occupancy rate ppt one factor impacting the change in community operating expense between the periods was a reduction in workers compensation expense of approximately million in and million in due to revised estimates of our ultimate exposure under our workers compensation programs based upon an actuarial valuation report 
in addition  we had a reduction in our professional and general liability insurance of million in and  in based upon actuarial valuation reports 
exclusive of the workers compensation and professional and general liability insurance adjustments  community operating expenses would have increased approximately million primarily from increased costs for direct labor and related employee taxes and benefits of million 
the remaining net increase of million primarily reflects increased utilities  property taxes  contracted services  supplies  food costs  marketing  and other community operating expenses 
depreciation and amortization increased million  primarily as a result of the purchase of communities we had previously leased

exclusive of the workers compensation and professional and general liability insurance adjustments noted above  there would have been a decrease in operating results of approximately million 
we will continue our efforts to build our occupancy through increased marketing initiatives  programs that address resident mix and a focus on property improvements and other community level enhancements to attract additional long term residents and increase occupancy while maintaining growth in average monthly revenue per unit 
we believe that these initiatives will continue to have a positive impact on operating performance over time 
liquidity and capital resources the united states economy experienced a significant decline in the housing market and a related weakness in the availability and affordability of credit during that continued through we believe that the slowdown in the housing market and the constriction of credit are likely to continue throughout moreover  leading economic indicators such as employment levels and income growth indicate that the nation is in a recession 
however  we believe that need driven demand for our services continues to grow and remains resilient  in spite of the overall housing and economic concerns  as evidenced by the relative stability in occupancy  improvements in cash flows  and our ability to finance the acquisition of previously leased properties during and  including the acquisition of communities in at december   we had cash on hand of million compared to million at december  we had working capital deficits of million and million at december  and  respectively 
we have incurred significant operating losses since our inception 
due to the nature of our business  it is not unusual to operate in the position of a working capital deficit because revenues are collected much more quickly  often in advance  than obligations are required to be paid 
the result is a very low level of current assets to the extent cash has been deployed in business development opportunities or to pay down long term liabilities 
along those lines  the working capital deficit includes million of deferred revenue and unearned rental income 
the level of current liabilities is not expected to increase from year to year in such a way as to require the use of significant cash  except for debt obligations of million scheduled to mature in we intend to refinance these obligations prior to their respective due dates 
given the unprecedented instability in worldwide credit markets  there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain such refinancing

table of contents sources and uses of cash the following is a summary of information from our consolidated statement of cash flow for the three years ended december  in thousands 
year ended december  net cash provided by operating activities net cash used in investing activities net cash provided by used in financing activities net increase decrease in cash and cash equivalents cash and cash equivalents at the beginning of the period cash and cash equivalents at the end of the period in and each of the two previous years  we reported positive net cash from operating activities in our consolidated statements of cash flows 
the increase in cash provided by operating activities in compared to the prior year period is due primarily to the additional cash flow as a result of the completion of the summerville acquisition in september  the strength of the performance of the communities we operated during both periods  and fluctuations in the timing of receivables and payables 
both and were positively impacted by purchasing the real estate underlying leased facilities  whereby we replaced lease payments with lower levels of debt service and also avoided future scheduled lease escalators 
the decrease in cash used in investing activities was primarily due to the decrease in the number of current year acquisitions as compared to in  we purchased the real property underlying communities that we previously operated under lease agreements and purchased one additional community 
in  we purchased communities that we previously operated under lease agreements and eight communities previously leased by summerville and purchased one additional community 
as a result  cash paid for acquisitions of property and equipment including routine expenditures and construction projects amounted to million in compared to million in and million in in  our net capital expenditures excluding acquisition of communities totaled million  of which million was for routine capital requirements  million was for computer and related equipment to support new accounting  sales and marketing systems  and million  net of amounts financed with debt  was related to community expansion and development 
the decrease in net cash provided by financing activities is related to the decrease in acquisitions discussed above 
the acquisitions were financed in part with cash proceeds from the public offering of emeritus common stock 
proceeds from long term borrowings  net of repayments including convertible debentures  totaled million in compared to million in and  in in april  we refinanced the mortgage debt on of our existing properties  which provided net cash proceeds of million 
we also extended the term of a million note payable due in march to march  which in october was further extended to march we will need to continue our improvements in operating performance or seek other sources of cash to meet our payment obligations in future years 
on december   we refinanced or amended the terms of million of mortgage debt secured by communities  including the payoff of certain loans with general electric capital corporation and million of new mortgage debt with capmark bank through a freddie mac credit facility 
the net effect of this refinancing is to increase long term debt by approximately million  extend maturity dates to january and beyond  move emeritus corporation management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued december

we incurred approximately  in financing costs related to this debt restructuring 
for further details see note  long term debt  in the notes to consolidated financial statements in this form k 
at december   we had payment obligations for long term debt and capital  financing  and operating leases due in the next months totaling approximately million  including interest 
in addition  for the year ending december   we anticipate that we will make investments of approximately to million for capital expenditures  comprised of approximately million to million of net recurring capital expenditures including corporate capital expenditures and approximately million to million of net capital expenditures for community expansions 
payment commitments the following table summarizes our contractual obligations at december  in thousands principal and lease payments due by period after contractual obligations total year years years years long term debt  including current portion capital lease and financing obligations  including current portion operating leases liability related to unrecognized tax benefits we have recognized total liabilities related to unrecognized tax benefits of million as of december  the timing of payments related to these obligations is uncertain  however  none of of this amount is expected to be paid within the next year 
the following table summarizes interest on our contractual obligations at december  in thousands interest due by period after contractual obligations total year years years years long term debt capital lease and financing obligations as a consequence of our property and lease transactions in  our long term debt has increased from million at december   to billion at december  our obligations under operating leases have increased from million to billion primarily due to the summerville acquisition  and our capital lease and financing obligations have decreased from million to million primarily as a result of the acquisition of leased properties 
many of our debt instruments and leases contain cross default provisions pursuant to which a default under one obligation can cause a default under one or more other obligations 
such cross default provisions affect the majority of our properties and as a result  any event of default could cause a material adverse effect on our emeritus corporation management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued december  
table of contents financial condition 
defaults may be related to the maintenance of certain financial covenants  which generally include debt or lease coverage and cash flow ratios and material adverse changes 
in addition  we are required to maintain the leased properties in a reasonable and prudent manner 
at december   we were in violation of one or more covenants in two of our leases  but have cured the default in one lease with payment of an additional security deposit and obtained a waiver from the landlord on the other such that we were still deemed to be in compliance and thus  were not in default 
the waiver expires on january  we cannot say with certainty that we will be in compliance with all debt and lease covenants in  and if not  that we can obtain the necessary waivers 
on february   we entered into a credit agreement with wells fargo bank  na  which provides a million unsecured revolving line of credit 
the credit agreement permits us to borrow from time to time up to million on an unsecured basis 
the credit agreement also allows us to obtain letters of credit from the lender  provided that outstanding letters of credit and any borrowings outstanding do not exceed million 
there were no outstanding borrowings under the line of credit as of december  subsequent to december   the letter of credit was extended to june  we had million of available cash at december  to fund any payment requirements in excess of cash generated from operations 
management believes that we will be able to generate sufficient operating cash flows and will have adequate cash for all necessary operating  investing and financing activities  including required debt service and capital expenditures  for at least the next twelve months 
summary of critical accounting policies and use of estimates critical accounting policies are those that management believes are both most important to the portrayal of the company s financial condition and results of operations  and require management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
judgments and uncertainties affecting the application of those policies may result in materially different amounts being reported under different conditions or using different assumptions 
we believe that our accounting policies regarding long term investments  asset impairments  self insurance reserves  income taxes  lease accounting  and stock based compensation are the most critical in understanding the judgments involved in the preparation of our financial statements 
revisions in such estimates are reflected in income in the period in which the facts that give rise to the revision become known

impact of inflation inflation could affect our future revenues and operating income due to our dependence on the senior resident population  most of whom rely on relatively fixed incomes to pay for our services 
the monthly charges for the resident s unit and assisted living services are influenced by the location of the community and local competition 
our ability to increase revenues in proportion to increased operating expenses may be limited 
we typically do not rely to a significant extent on governmental reimbursement programs  which accounted for approximately of revenues for the year ended december  in pricing our services  we attempt to anticipate inflation levels  but there can be no assurance that we will be able to respond to inflationary pressures in the future 
the near term negative economic outlook in the united states may impact our ability to raise our prices

table of contents non gaap measures a non gaap financial measure is generally defined as one that purports to measure historical or future financial performance  financial position  or cash flows  but excludes or includes amounts that would not be included in most gaap measures 
in this report  we define and use the non gaap financial measure of adjusted ebitda ebitdar  as set forth below definition of adjusted ebitda ebitdar we define adjusted ebitda ebitdar as net loss adjusted for gains or losses from discontinued operations  provision or benefit for income taxes  equity earnings or losses in unconsolidated joint ventures  minority interests  gains or losses on sale of assets  termination of leases  or investments  write off of terminated development projects costs depreciation and amortization  straight line rent and above below market rent amortization deferred move in fee revenues  impairment losses  amortization of deferred gains  non cash stock based compensation expense  interest expense  change in fair value of interest rate swaps  loan prepayment fees and debt refinancing costs  interest income  and other non cash unusual adjustments definition of adjusted ebitdar we define adjusted ebitdar as adjusted ebitda adjusted for facility lease expense 
management s use of adjusted ebitda ebitdar we use adjusted ebitda ebitdar to assess our overall financial and operating performance 
we believe these non gaap measures  as we have defined them  are useful in identifying trends in our day to day performance because they exclude items that have little or no significance to our day to day operations 
these measures provide an assessment of controllable expenses and afford management the ability to make decisions  which are expected to facilitate meeting current financial goals  as well as achieve optimal financial performance 
these measures also provide indicators for management to determine if adjustments to current spending levels are needed 
adjusted ebitda ebitdar provide us with measures of financial performance  independent of items that are beyond the control of management in the short term  such as depreciation and amortization  taxation  interest expense  and lease expense associated with our capital structure 
these metrics measure our financial performance based on operational factors that management can influence in the short term  namely the cost structure or expenses of the organization 
adjusted ebitda ebitdar are some of the metrics used by senior management to review the financial performance of the business on a monthly basis and are used by research analysts and investors to evaluate the performance and value of the companies in our industry

table of contents limitations of adjusted ebitda ebitdar adjusted ebitda ebitdar have limitations as analytical tools 
material limitations in making the adjustments to our losses to calculate adjusted ebitda ebitdar and using this non gaap financial measure as compared to gaap net loss includes the items excluded from the calculation of adjusted ebitda ebitdar generally represent income or expense items that may have a significant effect on our financial results  items determined to be non recurring in nature could  nevertheless  re occur in the future  and depreciation and amortization  while not directly affecting our current cash position  does represent wear and tear and or reduction in value of our properties 
if the cost to maintain our properties exceeds our expected routine capital expenditures  then this could affect our ability to attract and retain long term residents at our communities 
an investor or potential investor may find this important in evaluating our performance and results of operations 
we use these non gaap measures to provide a more complete understanding of the factors and trends affecting our business 
adjusted ebitda ebitdar are not alternatives to net loss  loss from continuing operations  or cash flows provided by or used in operating activities as calculated and presented in accordance with gaap 
you should not rely on adjusted ebitda ebitdar as substitutes for any such gaap financial measure 
we strongly urge you to review the reconciliation of gaap net loss to adjusted ebitda ebitdar presented below  along with our consolidated balance sheets  statements of operations  and cash flows 
in addition  because adjusted ebitda ebitdar are not measures of financial performance under gaap and are susceptible to varying calculations  this measure as presented may differ from and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies

recurring routine capital expenditures include expenditures capitalized in accordance with gaap that are funded from cffo 
amounts excluded from recurring routine capital expenditures consist primarily of community purchases and or major projects or renovations that are funded using financing proceeds 
emeritus corporation management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued december  
table of contents management s use of cash from facility operations we use cffo to assess our overall liquidity 
this measure provides an assessment of controllable expenses and affords management the ability to make decisions which are expected to facilitate meeting current financial and liquidity goals as well as to achieve optimal financial performance 
it provides an indicator for management to determine if adjustments to current spending decisions are needed 
this metric measures our liquidity based on operational factors that management can impact in the short term  namely the cost structure or expenses of the organization 
cffo is one of the metrics used by our senior management and board of directors i to review our ability to service our outstanding indebtedness including our credit facilities and long term leases  ii our ability to make regular recurring routine capital expenditures to maintain and improve our communities on a period to period basis  iii for planning purposes  including preparation of our annual budget and iv in setting various covenants in our credit agreements 
these agreements generally require us to escrow or spend a minimum of between and per unit bed per year 
historically  we have spent in excess of these per unit bed amounts  however  there is no assurance that we will have funds available to escrow or spend these per unit bed amounts in the future 
if we do not escrow or spend the required minimum annual amounts  we would be in default of the applicable debt or lease agreement which could trigger cross default provisions in our outstanding indebtedness and lease arrangements 
limitations of cash from facility operations cffo has limitations as an analytical tool 
it should not be viewed in isolation or as a substitute for gaap measures of cash flow from operations 
cffo does not represent cash available for discretionary expenditures  since we may have mandatory debt service requirements or other non discretionary expenditures not reflected in the measure 
we believe cffo is useful to investors because it assists their ability to meaningfully evaluate our ability to service our outstanding indebtedness  including our credit facilities and capital and financing leases  and our ability to make regular recurring routine capital expenditures to maintain and improve our communities 
cffo is not an alternative to cash flows provided by or used in operations as calculated and presented in accordance with gaap 
you should not rely on cffo as a substitute for any such gaap financial measure 
we strongly urge you to review the reconciliation of cffo to gaap net cash provided by used in operating activities  along with our consolidated financial statements included herein 
we also strongly urge you to not rely on any single financial measure to evaluate our business 
in addition  because cffo is not a measure of financial performance under gaap and is susceptible to varying calculations  the cffo measure  as presented in this report  may differ from and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are subject to market risk from exposure to changes in interest rates due to our financing activities and changes in the availability of credit 
the table below provides information about our debt and capital lease and financing obligations  including weighted average interest rates on these obligations as of december  expected maturity date in thousands thereafter total fair value average interest rate long term debt capital lease and financing obligations our earnings are affected by changes in interest rates as a result of our short term and long term borrowings 
at december   we had approximately million of variable rate borrowings based on monthly libor 
of the total variable rate debt of million  million varies with monthly libor with no libor floors or ceilings 
for every change in the monthly libor rateon this million in variable rate debt  interest expense will either increase or decrease by  as of december   the weighted average variable rate is in excess of monthly libor on million of the variable rate debt  and the monthly libor rate was 
in addition  we have variable rate debt of million that has libor floors at a weighted average floor of and a weighted average spread of  for a total weighted average rate of 
the libor floors effectively make this debt fixed rate debt as long as the monthly libor rate is less than the weighted average floor 
increases or decreases to the monthly libor rate do not change interest expense on this variable rate debt until the monthly libor rate rises above the floor  and conversely  interest expense does not decrease when the monthly libor rates falls below the floor 
this analysis does not consider changes in the actual level of borrowings or operating lease obligations that may occur subsequent to december  this analysis also does not consider the effects of the reduced level of overall economic activity that could exist in such an environment  nor does it consider actions that management might be able to take with respect to our financial structure to mitigate the exposure to such a change 
we currently have two interest rate swap contracts with a combined notional amount of million 
a basis point increase in interest rates would increase the fair value of these swaps by approximately  and a basis point decrease in interest rates would decrease the fair value of these swap contracts by approximately the downturn in the united states housing market in and triggered a constriction in the availability of credit that is expected to continue in this could impact our ability to borrow money or refinance existing obligations at acceptable rates of interest 
thus far  we have experienced no significant barriers to obtaining credit
