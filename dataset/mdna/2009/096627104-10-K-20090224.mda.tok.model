item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes thereto  included in item  and with item a  risk factors 
overview through our subsidiaries  gulf crossing  gulf south and texas gas  we own and operate three interstate natural gas pipeline systems including integrated storage facilities 
our pipeline systems originate in the gulf coast region and extend northeasterly to the midwestern states of tennessee  kentucky  illinois  indiana and ohio 
our pipeline systems contain approximately  miles of pipeline  directly serving customers in twelve states and indirectly serving customers throughout the northeastern and southeastern us through numerous interconnections with unaffiliated pipelines 
in  our pipeline systems transported approximately tcf of gas resulting in average daily throughput of approximately bcf 
our natural gas storage facilities are comprised of eleven underground storage fields located in four states with aggregate working gas capacity of approximately bcf 
we conduct all of our natural gas transportation and integrated storage operations through our operating subsidiaries operating as one segment 
our transportation services consist of firm transportation  whereby the customer pays a capacity reservation charge to reserve pipeline capacity at certain receipt and delivery points along our pipeline systems  plus a commodity and fuel charge on the volume of natural gas actually transported  and interruptible transportation  whereby the customer pays to transport gas only when capacity is available and used 
we offer firm storage services in which the customer reserves and pays for a specific amount of storage capacity  including injection and withdrawal rights  and interruptible storage and pal services where the customer receives and pays for capacity only when it is available and used 
some pal agreements are paid for at inception of the service and revenues for these agreements are recognized as service is provided over the term of the agreement 
for the year ended december   the percentage of our total operating revenues associated with firm contracts was approximately 
we are not in the business of buying and selling natural gas other than for system management purposes  but changes in the price of natural gas can affect the overall supply and demand of natural gas  which in turn can affect our results of operations 
our business is affected by trends involving natural gas price levels and natural gas price spreads  including spreads between physical locations on our pipeline system  which affect our transportation revenues  and spreads in natural gas prices across time for example summer to winter  which primarily affect our storage and pal revenues 
recent events as of february   we have substantially completed our announced expansion projects  including recently placing the following assets in service phase iii of our western kentucky storage expansion  the first miles of our fayetteville lateral  which includes a temporary river crossing  the remaining compression related to our southeast expansion  the pipeline portion of our gulf crossing project  and a portion of our greenville lateral 
for more information regarding our expansion projects see expansion projects in item of this report 
we recently signed precedent agreements for bcf per day of capacity that will support expanding our system from the haynesville production area in northwest louisiana to perryville  louisiana 
this project will consist of adding compression to our gulf south system at an estimated cost of up to million 
we expect to finance this project with additional debt and expect to place this project in service in the fourth quarter  subject to regulatory approvals 
on february   we announced a quarterly distribution of per unit  payable on february  to unitholders of record as of february  in january  we borrowed the remaining unfunded commitments under our revolving credit facility  which increased borrowings under the facility to million 
factors that impact our results of operations a significant portion of our operating revenues is derived from reservation charges under multi year firm contracts  therefore the risk of revenue fluctuations due to near term changes in natural gas supply and demand conditions  competition and price volatility is significantly mitigated 
for the year ended december   of our operating revenues were associated with reservation charges under firm contracts which do not vary based on capacity utilization 
excluding contracts associated with our expansion projects currently under construction  the weighted average contract life of our contracts is approximately years 
regardless of these factors  our business can be impacted by shifts in supply and demand dynamics  the mix of services requested by customers and by competition and regulatory requirements  particularly when accompanied by downturns or sluggishness in the economy  especially over a longer term 
changing customer mix and credit profile after completion of our expansion projects  producers will comprise a larger portion of our revenues  both as a group and separately 
we expect producers as a group to contribute a much more significant portion of our future revenues  and one producer to represent over of our revenues 
historically producers have had lower credit ratings than ldcs and ldc sponsored marketing companies  which have typically accounted for a large portion of our revenues 
therefore the expected change in our customer base could result in higher total credit risk 
current economic conditions also indicate that many of our customers may encounter increased credit risk in the near term 
we actively monitor the credit status of our counterparties and to date have not had any significant credit defaults associated with our transactions 
however  given the current volatility in the financial markets  we cannot be certain that we will not experience such losses in the future 
item a  risk factors  of this report contains more information regarding the risks related to our customer base 
competition and contract renewals we compete primarily with other interstate and intrastate pipelines in the transportation and storage of natural gas  particularly in the midwest and gulf coast states where we compete with numerous existing pipelines and will compete with pipelines under construction such as the rockies express pipeline and the mid continent express pipeline 
we compete for renewals of expiring transportation and storage contracts  as well as new transportation contracts that will support growth projects 
despite these competitive conditions  substantially all of the operating capacity on our expansion projects is sold out and our legacy systems are supported by long term contracts having an average remaining life of years 
however  as of december   approximately of the firm contract load on our pipeline systems  excluding agreements related to the expansion projects not yet in service  was due to expire on or before december  in addition  approximately of our long term contracts with firm deliveries to lebanon  ohio  the northeastern terminus of our pipeline system  will expire or become terminable by the customer by the end of in  we were successful in remarketing and renewing the approximately of our firm contract load that was due to expire during that year  in many cases obtaining favorable rates and extended contract terms 
notwithstanding that success  however  the and contract expirations and termination rights create uncertainty as we cannot give assurances that we will successfully remarket this capacity 
our ability to remarket available capacity will be impacted by additional competition from newly constructed pipelines  fluctuating commodity prices  a recessionary economy which could impact demand for and supply of natural gas and numerous other factors beyond our control 
item a  risk factors  contains more information regarding the risks related to competition in our industry 
natural gas prices high natural gas prices in recent years have driven increased production levels in producing locations such as the bossier sands and barnett shale gas producing regions in east texas  which have resulted in widened basis differentials on our systems and have benefited our transportation revenues 
the high natural gas prices have also driven increased production in regions such as the fayetteville shale in arkansas and the caney woodford shale in oklahoma  which  together with the higher production levels in east texas  have formed the basis for several pipeline expansion projects including those constructed and being undertaken by us 
the price for natural gas has declined since its peak in the late summer  although average prices continue to remain at elevated levels from those seen historically 
many of our customers have been negatively impacted by these recent declines in natural gas prices as well as current conditions in the capital markets  which factors have caused several of our producer customers to announce plans to decrease drilling levels and  in some cases  to consider shutting in natural gas production from some producing wells  which could adversely affect the volumes of natural gas we transport 
while the majority of our revenue is derived from capacity reservation charges that are not impacted by the volume of natural gas transported  a significant portion of our revenue  approximately in  is derived from charges based on actual volumes transported under firm and interruptible services 
as a result  lower volumes of natural gas transported would result in lower revenues from natural gas transportation operations 
based on the significant level of revenue we receive from reservation capacity charges under long term contracts and our review of the recent announcements of drilling plans by our customers  we do not expect the current level of natural gas prices to have a significant adverse effect on our operating results 
however  we cannot give assurances that this will be the case  or that commodity prices will not decline further  which could result in a further reduction in drilling activities by our customers 
in addition  spreads in natural gas prices between time periods  such as winter to summer  impact our pal and interruptible storage revenues 
these period to period price spreads  which were favorable for our pal and interruptible storage services during and early  decreased substantially in and continued to decrease into  which resulted in reduced pal and interruptible storage revenues for those periods 
we cannot predict future time period spreads or basis differentials 
reduction of operating pressures on expansion pipelines  applications for special permits from phmsa as discussed elsewhere in this report  we have discovered anomalies in a small number of pipe segments on our east texas pipeline 
as a result  and as a prudent operator  we have elected to reduce operating pressures on that pipeline to below its previous operating level  which was below the pipeline s maximum non special permit operating pressures 
operating at lower pressures reduces the amount of gas that can flow through a pipeline and therefore will reduce our expected revenues and cash flow 
we do not expect to return to normal operating pressures  or to operate at higher pressures under the special permit discussed below  until after we have completed our investigation and remediation measures  as appropriate  and phmsa has concurred with our determination to increase pressures 
we will also incur costs to replace defective pipe segments on the east texas pipeline  some of which may be reimbursable from vendors  and expect to temporarily shut down that pipeline when performing the necessary remedial measures  up to and including replacing certain pipe segments 
we will work with phmsa to return the east texas pipeline to its previous status under the special permit after we have completed our investigation and remediation 
we cannot determine at this time the amount of costs we will incur or when we might raise operating pressures 
we have not completed testing on all of our expansion pipelines and could find anomalies on other pipelines which could have similar impacts with respect to those pipelines 
our ability to transport a portion of the expected maximum capacity on each of our expansion project pipelines is contingent upon our receipt of authority to operate these pipelines at higher operating pressures under special permits issued by phmsa 
we have received authority to operate the east texas pipeline under a special permit and have received the special permits for our southeast  gulf crossing and fayetteville and greenville laterals  but we have not received authority to operate under these permits 
phmsa retains discretion as to whether to grant  or to maintain in force  authority to operate any of our pipelines at higher operating pressures 
absent such authority  we will not be able to transport all of the contracted for quantities of natural gas on these pipelines 
to the extent that phmsa does not grant us authority to operate any of our expansion pipelines under a special permit or withdraws previously granted authority to operate under a special permit  transportation capacity made available to the market and our transportation revenues and cash flows would be reduced 
for additional information  see item business expansion projects and item a risk factors a portion of the expected maximum daily capacity of our pipeline expansion projects is subject to our obtaining and maintaining authority from phmsa to operate under higher operating pressures 
credit and capital markets disruption current economic conditions have made it difficult for companies to obtain funding in either the debt or equity markets 
the current constraints in the capital markets may affect our ability to obtain funding through new borrowings or the issuance of equity in the public markets 
in addition  we expect that  to the extent we are successful in arranging new debt financing  we will incur increased costs associated with these debt financings 
as of december   in addition to million of cash on hand and short term investments  we had available capacity under our credit facility of million which we subsequently fully borrowed against 
we expect to utilize these resources  along with cash from operations and proceeds from debt and equity offerings  to fund our growth capital expenditures and working capital needs during see liquidity and capital resources expansion capital expenditures below for a discussion of our financing plans for our current expansion projects 
financial analysis of operations we derive our revenues primarily from the interstate transportation and storage of natural gas for third parties 
transportation and storage services are provided under firm and interruptible service agreements 
our operating costs and expenses typically do not vary significantly based upon the amount of gas transported  with the exception of fuel consumed at our compressor stations  which is included in fuel and gas transportation expenses on our consolidated statements of income 
the following analysis discusses our financial results of operations for the years  and compared with our net income for the year ended december  increased million  or  to million compared to million for the year ended december  the primary drivers for the increase were higher revenues from services associated with our expansion projects and gains from the disposition of coal reserves  gas sales associated with our storage expansion and the settlement of a contract claim 
the favorable drivers were partly offset by lower pal revenues due to unfavorable natural gas price spreads and higher depreciation and property tax expense due to an increase in our asset base from expansion 
the period was unfavorably impacted by a million impairment charge related to the magnolia storage facility 
operating revenues for the year ended december  increased million  or  to million  compared to million for the year ended december  gas transportation revenues  excluding fuel  increased million  primarily from our expansion projects and higher no notice and interruptible services on our existing assets 
fuel revenues increased million due to expansion related throughput and higher natural gas prices 
gas storage revenues increased million related to an increase in storage capacity associated with our western kentucky storage expansion 
these increases were partially offset by lower pal revenues of million due to unfavorable natural gas price spreads 
operating costs and expenses for the year ended december  increased million  or  to million  compared to million for the year ended december  the primary drivers were increased depreciation and other taxes  comprised primarily of property taxes  of million associated with an increase in our asset base  increased fuel costs of million mainly from providing service on our expansion projects and higher natural gas prices and million of third party transportation costs associated with providing customers of our expansion projects access to off system markets 
administrative and general expenses increased million due to increased outside services mainly due to legal matters  information technology related expenses from infrastructure improvements  corporate services  higher property insurance from an increase in rates and asset base and a bad debt recovery that favorably impacted the period 
the increases to operating expenses were offset by gains of million from the disposition of coal reserves  million on the sale of gas related to our western kentucky storage expansion and million from the settlement of a contract claim 
additionally  in the fourth quarter  we changed our employee paid time off benefits  resulting in a reduction in operation and maintenance expenses of million and a reduction of administrative and general expenses of million 
the period was unfavorably impacted by a million impairment charge related to our magnolia storage project 
total other deductions increased by million  or  to million for the year ended december   compared to million for the period  primarily as a result of million of decreased interest income due to lower average cash balances available for investment  partly offset by a million reduction in interest expense from higher capitalized interest associated with our expansion projects 
compared with our net income for the year ended december  increased million  or  to million compared to million for the year ended december  the primary drivers for the increase were higher revenues from strong demand for firm transportation services  including pipeline system expansion and related fuel revenues 
higher operating expenses driven by a variety of factors  mainly charges for impairment and remediation costs associated with certain assets  increased fuel and higher depreciation and amortization were substantially offset by higher interest income 
the results were also favorably impacted by a gain on the sale of gas associated with a storage expansion project  which was accounted for as a reduction of operating expenses 
total operating revenues increased million  or  to million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december  gas transportation revenues increased million due to higher firm transportation rates  including million from new contracts associated with a pipeline expansion which was in service for all of fuel revenues increased million due to increased retained volumes from higher system utilization including amounts associated with pipeline expansion 
operating costs and expenses increased million  or  to million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december  the primary drivers were impairment charges of million related to the magnolia storage facility and million associated with offshore pipeline assets in the south timbalier bay area  and an million increase in depreciation and other taxes associated with an increase in our asset base from expansion 
other increases included fuel costs of million due to an increase in gas usage  a million charge related to re covering offshore assets and a million charge related to the termination of an agreement with a construction contractor on the southeast expansion project 
these increases were offset by a million gain on the sale of gas associated with the western kentucky storage expansion project which was reported in net gain on disposal of operating assets and related contracts 
total other deductions declined by million  or  to million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december  the reduction was primarily due to an increase in interest income of million as a result of higher levels of invested cash which we accumulated through sales of our debt and equity to finance the cost of our expansion projects 
liquidity and capital resources we are a partnership holding company and derive all of our operating cash flow from our operating subsidiaries 
our principal sources of liquidity include cash generated from operating activities  our revolving credit facility  debt issuances and sales of limited partner units 
our operating subsidiaries use funds from their respective operations to fund their operating activities and maintenance capital requirements  service their indebtedness and make advances or distributions to boardwalk pipelines 
boardwalk pipelines uses cash provided from the operating subsidiaries and  as needed  borrowings under its revolving credit facility discussed below  to service its outstanding indebtedness and  when available  make distributions or advances to us to fund our distributions to unitholders 
we have no material guarantees of debt or other similar commitments to unaffiliated parties 
our operating subsidiaries participate in an intercompany cash management program to the extent they are permitted under ferc regulations 
under the cash management program  depending on whether a participating subsidiary has short term cash surpluses or cash requirements  boardwalk pipelines either provides cash to them or they provide cash to boardwalk pipelines 
beginning in and continuing in  the capital markets have been impacted by macroeconomic  liquidity  credit and recessionary concerns 
during this period  we have continued to have access to the majority of our credit facility to fund our short term liquidity needs 
in  we issued common units and class b units and received additional contributions from our general partner 
we also received net proceeds of million from the issuance of long term debt in march see discussion below under equity and debt financing 
our ability to continue to access capital markets for debt and equity financing under reasonable terms depends on our financial condition  credit ratings and market conditions 
we anticipate that our existing capital resources  ability to obtain financing and cash flow generated from future operations will enable us to maintain our current level of operations and our planned operations  including capital expenditures  for maintenance capital expenditures maintenance capital expenditures were million  million and million in  and we expect to fund our maintenance capital expenditures of approximately million from our operating cash flows 
expansion capital expenditures we are currently engaged in several pipeline expansion projects  described in item i  our business expansion projects  of this report and expect the estimated total cost of these projects to be as follows in millions estimated total cost cash invested through december  southeast expansion gulf crossing project fayetteville and greenville laterals total our cost estimates are based on internally developed financial models and timelines 
factors in the estimates include  but are not limited to  those related to pipeline costs based on mileage  size and type of pipe  materials and construction and engineering costs 
based upon our current cost estimates  we expect to incur capital expenditures of approximately billion in and to complete our pipeline expansion projects 
the majority of the expenditures are expected to occur during the first half of  with the remaining costs associated with the construction of additional compression facilities for the gulf crossing project and the fayetteville and greenville laterals to be incurred in the latter half of and into we are also engaged in the western kentucky storage expansion project 
the cost of this project is expected to be approximately million 
through december   we spent million related to this project 
our cost and timing estimates for these projects are subject to a variety of risks and uncertainties  including obtaining regulatory approvals  adverse weather conditions  delays in obtaining key materials  shortages of qualified labor and escalating costs of labor and materials 
as the announced expansion projects move toward completion  the risks and uncertainties associated with the expansion projects are decreasing 
however  certain risks remain  primarily involving river crossings and receipt of regulatory authority to operate the pipelines at higher operating pressures 
we have financed our expansion capital costs through the issuance of equity and debt  including sales of debt by us and our subsidiaries  borrowings under our revolving credit facility and available operating cash flow in excess of our operating needs 
we anticipate we will need to finance an additional million to complete our expansion projects 
our largest unitholder  loews  has advised us that it is willing to provide the capital we need to complete the expansion projects to the extent the public markets remain unavailable on acceptable terms 
we have not committed to any transaction at this time  however  and any additional financing provided by loews would be subject to review and approval  as to fairness  by our independent conflicts committee 
item a  risk factors  contains more information regarding risks associated with our expansion projects and the related financing 
equity and debt financing in  we received net cash proceeds of approximately billion from the following equity and debt issuances which proceeds were used to fund a portion of the costs of our ongoing expansion projects and to repay amounts borrowed under our revolving credit facility in millions  except issue price month of issuance net cash proceeds received number of units issue price type of issuance october a private placement of common units to bphc june b private placement of class b units to bphc june c public offering of common units march n a n a public offering of debt securities a includes a million contribution received from our general partner to maintain its general partner interest 
b includes a million contribution received from our general partner to maintain its general partner interest 
c includes a million contribution received from our general partner to maintain its general partner interest 
we also borrowed under our revolving credit facility  to the extent necessary  to finance our expansion projects 
as discussed in expansion capital expenditures we have a committed sponsor in loews who has agreed to finance up to the remaining amount necessary to complete our expansion projects to the extent that the capital markets are not available on acceptable terms 
we do not have an immediate need to refinance any of our long term debt  including borrowings under our revolving credit facility  as the earliest maturity date of such indebtedness is in we believe that our cash flow from operations will be sufficient to support our ongoing operations and maintenance capital requirements 
credit facility we maintain a revolving credit facility which has aggregate lending commitments of billion  under which boardwalk pipelines  gulf south and texas gas each may borrow funds  up to applicable sub limits 
a financial institution which has a million commitment under the revolving credit facility filed for bankruptcy protection in the third quarter and has not funded its portion of our borrowing requests since that time 
interest on amounts drawn under the credit facility is payable at a floating rate equal to an applicable spread per annum over the london interbank offered rate or a base rate defined as the greater of the prime rate or the federal funds rate plus basis points 
the revolving credit facility has a maturity date of june  as of december   we had million of loans outstanding under the revolving credit facility with a weighted average interest rate on the borrowings of and had no letters of credit issued 
we were in compliance with all covenant requirements under our credit facility at december  subsequent to december   we borrowed all of the remaining unfunded commitments under the credit facility excluding the unfunded commitment of the bankrupt lender noted above which increased borrowings to million 
our revolving credit facility contains customary negative covenants  including  among others  limitations on the payment of cash dividends and other restricted payments  the incurrence of additional debt  sale leaseback transactions and transactions with our affiliates 
the facility also contains a financial covenant that requires us and our subsidiaries to maintain a ratio of total consolidated debt to consolidated earnings before income taxes  depreciation and amortization as defined in the credit agreement  measured for the preceding twelve months  of not more than five to one 
although we do not believe that these covenants have had  or will have  a material impact on our business and financing activities or our ability to obtain the financing to maintain operations and continue our capital investments  they could restrict us in some circumstances as stated in item a  risk factors 
in particular  maintaining compliance with the financial covenant may limit our ability to incur additional indebtedness to finance our growth projects  which could limit our growth opportunities or require the issuance of more equity securities by us than previously anticipated 
contractual obligations the following table summarizes significant contractual cash payment obligations under firm commitments as of december   by period in millions total less than year years years more than years principal payments on long term debt interest on long term debt capital commitments pipeline capacity agreements operating lease commitments total this includes our senior unsecured notes  having maturity dates from to and million of loans outstanding under our revolving credit facility  having a maturity date of june  interest obligations represent interest due on our senior unsecured notes at fixed rates 
future interest obligations under our revolving credit facility are uncertain  due to the variable interest rate and fluctuating balances 
based on a weighted average interest rate on amounts outstanding under our revolving credit facility as of december   million  million and million would be due under the credit facility in less than one year  years  and years 
capital commitments represent binding commitments under purchase orders for materials ordered but not received and firm commitments under binding construction service agreements existing at december  the amounts shown do not reflect commitments we have made after december  for information on these projects  please read expansion capital expenditures 
the amounts shown are associated with various pipeline capacity agreements on third party pipelines that allow our operating subsidiaries to transport gas to off system markets on behalf of our customers 
pursuant to the settlement of the texas gas rate case in  we are required to annually fund an amount to the texas gas pension plan equal to the amount of actuarially determined net periodic pension cost  including a minimum of million 
in  we expect to fund approximately million to the texas gas pension plan 
cash and cash equivalents and short term investments at december   we had million of cash and cash equivalents invested primarily in treasury funds and million of short term investments 
in december  we began investing a portion of our cash and cash equivalents in us government securities  primarily treasury notes  under repurchase agreements 
generally  we have engaged in overnight repurchase transactions where purchased securities are sold back to the counterparty the following business day 
pursuant to the master repurchase agreements  we take actual possession of the purchased securities 
in the event of default by the counterparty under the agreement  the repurchase would be deemed immediately to occur and we would be entitled to sell the securities in the open market  or give the counterparty credit based on the market price on such date  and apply the proceeds or deemed proceeds to the aggregate unpaid repurchase amounts and any other amounts owing by the counterparty 
note in item of this report contains more information about our short term investments 
changes in cash flow from operating activities net cash provided by operating activities increased million to million for the year ended december   compared to million for the comparable period  primarily due to a million increase in cash from the change in net income  excluding non cash items such as depreciation and amortization and the recognition of income previously deferred 
this increase was offset by an million decrease in cash due to the settlement of derivatives 
changes in cash flow from investing activities net cash used in investing activities increased  million to  million for the year ended december   compared to  million for the comparable period  primarily due to a  million increase in capital expenditures related to our expansion projects and a million purchase of short term investments in these increases in the use of cash from investing activities were offset by million in net proceeds from the sale of gas related to our storage expansion projects and the sale of an investment in coal reserves 
changes in cash flow from financing activities net cash provided by financing activities increased  million to  million for the year ended december   compared to million for the comparable period 
an increase of million resulted from net proceeds received from the issuance of common and class b units  including related general partner capital contributions 
net proceeds from the issuance of long term debt and borrowings under our revolving credit facility increased million 
these increases in cash from financing activities were partially offset by a million increase in distributions to our partners 
impact of inflation we have experienced increased costs in recent years due to the effect of inflation on the cost of labor  benefits  materials and supplies  and property  plant and equipment ppe 
a portion of the increased labor and materials and supplies costs have directly affected income through increased operating costs and depreciation expense 
the cumulative impact of inflation over a number of years has resulted in increased costs for current replacement of productive facilities 
the majority of our ppe and materials and supplies is subject to rate making treatment  and under current ferc practices  recovery is limited to historical costs 
amounts in excess of historical cost are not recoverable unless a rate case is filed 
however  cost based regulation  along with competition and other market factors  may limit our ability to price jurisdictional services to ensure recovery of inflation s effect on costs 
off balance sheet arrangements at december   we had no guarantees of off balance sheet debt to third parties  no debt obligations that contain provisions requiring accelerated payment of the related obligations in the event of specified levels of declines in credit ratings  and no other off balance sheet arrangements 
critical accounting policies certain amounts included in or affecting our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures must be estimated  requiring us to make certain assumptions with respect to values or conditions that cannot be known with certainty at the time the financial statements are prepared 
these estimates and assumptions affect the amounts we report for assets and liabilities and our disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities in our financial statements 
we evaluate these estimates on an ongoing basis  utilizing historical experience  consultation with third parties and other methods we consider reasonable 
nevertheless  actual results may differ significantly from our estimates 
any effects on our business  financial position or results of operations resulting from revisions to these estimates are recorded in the periods in which the facts that give rise to the revisions become known 
regulation pursuant to ferc regulations certain revenues that we collect may be subject to possible refunds to our customers 
accordingly  during an open rate case  estimates of rate refund reserves are recorded based on regulatory proceedings  advice of counsel and estimated risk adjusted total exposure  as well as other factors 
at december  and  there were no liabilities for any open rate case recorded on our consolidated balance sheets 
currently  neither gulf south nor texas gas is involved in an open general rate case  however gulf crossing will either have to file a rate case or justify its initial firm transportation rates within three years after the pipeline is fully placed in service 
our subsidiaries are regulated by ferc 
sfas no 
 accounting for the effects of certain types of regulation  requires certain rate regulated entities to account for and report assets and liabilities consistent with the economic effect of the manner in which independent third party regulators establish rates 
sfas no 
is applicable to operations of our texas gas subsidiary which record certain costs and benefits as regulatory assets and liabilities  respectively  in order to provide for recovery from or refund to customers in future periods 
the provisions of sfas no 
are not applicable to operations associated with the texas gas fayetteville and greenville laterals project and phase iii of the western kentucky storage expansion project due to the regulatory treatment and contractual rates associated with the projects 
the provisions of sfas no 
are not applicable to gulf crossing due to discounts under negotiated rate agreements  or gulf south because competition in the market areas of gulf south has resulted in discounts from the maximum allowable cost based rates being granted to customers and certain services provided by gulf south are priced using market based rates  such that the application of the standard would not be appropriate 
we monitor the regulatory and competitive environment in which we operate to determine that any regulatory assets continue to be probable of recovery 
if we were to determine that all or a portion of our regulatory assets no longer met the criteria for recognition as regulatory assets under sfas no 
 that portion which was not recoverable would be written off  net of any regulatory liabilities 
note in item of this report contains more information regarding our regulatory assets and liabilities 
in the course of providing transportation and storage services to customers  the pipelines may receive different quantities of gas from shippers and operators than the quantities delivered by the pipelines on behalf of those shippers and operators 
this results in transportation and exchange gas receivables and payables  commonly known as imbalances  which are primarily settled through the receipt or delivery of gas in the future or with cash 
settlement of imbalances requires agreement between the pipelines and shippers or operators as to allocations of volumes to specific transportation contracts and timing of delivery of gas based on operational conditions 
the receivables and payables are valued at market price for operations where sfas no 
is not applicable and are valued at the historical value of gas in storage for operations where sfas no 
is applicable  consistent with the regulatory treatment and the settlement history 
environmental liabilities our environmental liabilities are based on management s best estimate of the undiscounted future obligation for probable costs associated with environmental assessment and remediation of our operating sites 
these estimates are based on evaluations and discussions with counsel and operating personnel and the current facts and circumstances related to these environmental matters 
at december   we had accrued approximately million for environmental matters 
our environmental accrued liabilities could change substantially in the future due to factors such as the nature and extent of any contamination  changes in remedial requirements  technological changes  discovery of new information  and the involvement of and direction taken by the environmental protection agency  ferc and other governmental authorities on these matters 
we continue to conduct environmental assessments and are implementing a variety of remedial measures that may result in increases or decreases in the total estimated environmental costs 
impairment of long lived assets we periodically evaluate whether the carrying value of long lived assets has been impaired when circumstances indicate the carrying value of those assets may not be recoverable in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
this evaluation is based on undiscounted cash flow projections expected to be realized over the remaining useful life of the asset 
the carrying amount is not recoverable if it exceeds the undiscounted sum of cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the asset 
if the carrying value is not recoverable  the impairment loss is measured as the excess of the asset s carrying value over its fair value 
in  we completed a review of our non contiguous offshore assets and provided notice to the other interest holders of our intent to discontinue any use of our portion of the capacity available to us as a result of our investment in the assets 
as a result  we reviewed the assets for recoverability and recorded an impairment charge of approximately million representing the book value of the assets 
we were developing a salt dome storage cavern near napoleonville  louisiana 
operational tests  which were completed in july  indicated that due to geological and other anomalies that could not be corrected  we would be unable to place the cavern in service as expected 
as a result  we elected to abandon that cavern and are exploring the possibility of securing a new site on which a new cavern could be developed 
in accordance with the requirements of sfas no 
 the carrying value of the cavern and related facilities was tested for recoverability 
in the second quarter  we recognized an impairment charge to earnings of approximately million  representing the carrying value of the cavern  the fair value of which was determined to be zero based on discounted expected future cash flows 
we expect to use the other assets associated with the project  which include pipeline  compressors  and other equipment and facilities  in conjunction with a replacement storage cavern to be developed 
if we determine in the future that the assets cannot be used in conjunction with a new cavern or a new cavern cannot be secured in the same area  we may be required to record an additional impairment charge at the time that determination is made 
additional costs to abandon the impaired cavern may be incurred due to regulatory or contractual obligations  however  the amounts are inestimable at this time 
goodwill as of december   we had million of goodwill recorded as an asset on our consolidated balance sheets 
sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  requires the evaluation of goodwill for impairment at least annually or more frequently if events and circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired 
an impairment test performed in accordance with sfas no 
requires that a reporting unit s fair value be estimated 
we used a discounted cash flow model to estimate the fair value of the reporting unit  and that estimated fair value was compared to the carrying amount  including goodwill 
the estimated fair value was in excess of the carrying amount at december   and accordingly no impairment was recognized 
judgments and assumptions were used in management s estimate of discounted future cash flows used to calculate the fair value of the reporting unit  including our five year financial plan operating results  the long term outlook for growth in natural gas demand in the us and systematic or diversifiable risk used in the calculation of the applied discount rate under the capital asset pricing model 
the use of alternate judgments and or assumptions could result in the recognition of an impairment charge in the financial statements 
defined benefit plans we are required to make a significant number of assumptions in order to estimate the liabilities and costs related to our pension and postretirement benefit obligations to employees under our benefit plans 
the assumptions that have the most impact on pension costs are the discount rate  the expected return on plan assets and the rate of compensation increases 
these assumptions are evaluated relative to current market factors in the us such as inflation  interest rates and fiscal and monetary policies  as well as our policies regarding management of the plans such as the allocation of plan assets among investment options 
changes in these assumptions can have a material impact on pension obligations and pension expense 
in determining the discount rate assumption  we utilize current market information and liability information provided by our plan actuaries  including a discounted cash flow analysis of our pension and postretirement obligations 
in particular  the basis for our discount rate selection was the yield on indices of highly rated fixed income debt securities with durations comparable to that of our plan liabilities 
the moody s aa corporate bond index is consistently used as the basis for the change in discount rate from the last measurement date with this measure confirmed by the yield on other broad bond indices 
additionally  we supplement our discount rate decision with a yield curve analysis 
the yield curve is applied to expected future retirement plan payments to adjust the discount rate to reflect the cash flow characteristics of the plans 
the yield curve is developed by the plans actuaries and is a hypothetical aa aa yield curve represented by a series of annualized discount rates reflecting bond issues having a rating of aa or better by moody s investors service  inc or a rating of aa or better by standard poor s

forward looking statements investors are cautioned that certain statements contained in this report  as well as some statements in periodic press releases and some oral statements made by our officials and our subsidiaries during presentations about us  are forward looking 
forward looking statements include  without limitation  any statement that may project  indicate or imply future results  events  performance or achievements  and may contain the words expect  intend  plan  anticipate  estimate  believe  will likely result  and similar expressions 
in addition  any statement made by our management concerning future financial performance including future revenues  earnings or growth rates  ongoing business strategies or prospects  and possible actions by our partnership or its subsidiaries  are also forward looking statements 
forward looking statements are based on current expectations and projections about future events and are inherently subject to a variety of risks and uncertainties  many of which are beyond our control that could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated or projected 
these risks and uncertainties include  among others we may not complete projects  including growth or expansion projects  that we have commenced or will commence  or we may complete projects on materially different terms  cost or timing than anticipated and we may not be able to achieve the intended economic or operational benefits of any such projects  if completed 
the successful completion  timing  cost  scope and future financial performance of our expansion projects could differ materially from our expectations due to availability of contractors or equipment  ground conditions  weather  difficulties or delays in obtaining regulatory approvals or denied applications  land owner opposition  the lack of adequate materials  labor difficulties or shortages and numerous other factors beyond our control 
global financial markets and economic conditions have been  and continue to be  experiencing extraordinary disruption and volatility following adverse changes in global capital markets 
the cost of raising money in the debt and equity capital markets and commercial credit markets has increased substantially while the availability of funds from those markets has diminished significantly 
a portion of the transportation capacity on each of our expansion project pipelines that we expect will ultimately be available is contingent upon our receipt of authority to operate each of these pipelines at higher operating pressures under a special permit issued by phmsa 
to the extent that phmsa does not grant us authority to operate any of our expansion pipelines under a special permit or withdraws previously granted authority to operate under a special permit  transportation capacity made available to the market and transportation revenues received in the future could be reduced 
our ferc gas tariffs only allow us to require limited credit support in the event that our transportation customers are unable to pay for our services 
if any of our significant customers have credit or financial problems which result in a delay or failure to pay for services provided by us  or contracted for with us  or repay the gas they owe us  it could adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
the gas transmission and storage operations of our subsidiaries are subject to rate making policies and actions by ferc or customers that could have an adverse impact on the services we offer and the rates we charge and our ability to recover the full cost of operating our pipelines  including earning a reasonable return 
we are subject to laws and regulations relating to the environment and pipeline operations which may expose us to significant costs  liabilities and loss of revenues 
any changes in such regulations or their application generally or through enforcement actions could adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
our operations are subject to operational hazards and unforeseen interruptions for which we may not be adequately insured 
the cost of insuring our assets may increase dramatically 
because of the natural decline in gas production connected to our system  our success depends on our ability to obtain access to new sources of natural gas  which is dependent on factors beyond our control 
any decrease in supplies of natural gas in our supply areas could adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we may not be able to maintain or replace expiring gas transportation and storage contracts at favorable rates 
significant changes in natural gas prices could affect supply and demand  reducing system throughput and adversely affecting our revenues 
developments in any of these areas could cause our results to differ materially from results that have been or may be anticipated or projected

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk with the exception of our revolving credit facility  for which the interest rate is reset each quarter  our debt has been issued at fixed rates 
for fixed rate debt  changes in interest rates affect the fair value of the debt instruments but do not directly affect earnings or cash flows 
the following table presents market risk associated with our fixed rate long term debt at december in millions  except interest rates carrying value of debt fair value of debt basis point increase in interest rates and resulting debt decrease basis point decrease in interest rates and resulting debt increase weighted average interest rate at december   we had million outstanding under our revolving credit agreement at a weighted average interest rate of  which rate is reset each quarter 
a increase or decrease in interest rates would increase or reduce our cash payments for interest on the credit facility by million on an annual basis 
no amounts were borrowed under our revolving credit facility at december  at december   million of our undistributed cash  shown on the balance sheets as cash and cash equivalents  was invested in treasury fund accounts and million was invested in us treasury notes under repurchase agreements and shown as short term investments 
at december   all of our cash was invested in treasury fund accounts 
due to the short term nature of the treasury fund accounts  a hypothetical increase or decrease in interest rates would not have a material effect on the fair market value of our cash and cash equivalents 
since our investments under repurchase agreements are liquidated the following day at an established price  a hypothetical increase or decrease in interest rates would not have a material effect on the fair market value of our short term investments 
commodity risk certain volumes of our gas stored underground are available for sale and subject to commodity price risk 
at december  and  approximately million and million of gas stored underground  which we own and carry as current gas stored underground  was available for sale and exposed to commodity price risk 
we utilize derivatives to hedge certain exposures to market price fluctuations on the anticipated operational sales of gas 
our pipelines do not take title to the natural gas which they transport and store in rendering traditional firm and interruptible storage services  therefore they do not assume the related natural gas commodity price risk associated with that gas 
the derivatives related to the sale of natural gas and cash for fuel reimbursement generally qualify for cash flow hedge accounting under sfas no 
and are designated as such 
the effective component of related gains and losses resulting from changes in fair values of the derivatives contracts designated as cash flow hedges are deferred as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss income 
the deferred gains and losses are recognized in earnings when the anticipated transactions affect earnings 
generally  for gas sales and retained fuel  any gains and losses on the related derivatives would be recognized in operating revenues 
credit risk we are exposed to credit risk relating to the risk of loss resulting from the nonperformance by a customer of its contractual obligations 
we have established credit policies in the pipeline tariffs which are intended to minimize credit risk in accordance with ferc policies and actively monitor this portion of our business 
our credit exposure generally relates to receivables for services provided  as well as volumes owed by customers for imbalances or gas lent by us to them  generally under pal and no notice services 
natural gas price volatility has increased dramatically in recent years  which has materially increased credit risk related to gas loaned to customers 
if any significant customer of ours should have credit or financial problems resulting in a delay or failure to repay the gas they owe to us  this could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
as of december   the amount of gas loaned out by our subsidiaries or owed to our subsidiaries due to gas imbalances was approximately trillion british thermal units tbtu 
assuming an average market price during december of per million british thermal units mmbtu  the market value of this gas at december   would have been approximately million 
as of december   the amount of gas loaned out by our subsidiaries or owed to our subsidiaries due to gas imbalances was approximately tbtu 
assuming an average market price during december of per mmbtu  the market value of this gas at december   would have been approximately million 
more than of our revenues are derived from gas marketers  ldcs and producers  the majority of which have investment grade ratings 
although nearly all of our customers pay for our services on a timely basis  we actively monitor the credit exposure to our customers 
we include in our ongoing assessments amounts due pursuant to services we render plus the value of any gas we have lent to a customer through no notice or pal services and the value of gas due to us under a transportation imbalance 
our pipeline tariffs contain language that allow us to require a customer that does not meet certain credit criteria to provide cash collateral  post a letter of credit or provide a guarantee from a credit worthy entity in an amount equaling up to three months of capacity reservation charges 
for certain agreements associated with our expansion projects  we have included contractual provisions that require additional credit support should the credit ratings of those customers fall below investment grade 
after completion of our expansion projects  producers will comprise a larger portion of our revenues  both in aggregate as a group and separately 
we expect producers as a group to contribute a more significant portion of our future revenues and one producer to represent over of our total revenues 
historically producers have had lower credit ratings than ldcs and ldc sponsored marketing companies  therefore the expected change in our customer base could result in higher total credit risk 
we will continue to actively monitor the credit risks associated with our customer base 
market risk our primary exposure to market risk occurs at the time our existing transportation and storage contracts expire and are subject to termination or renegotiation 
in addition  we have market risk exposure if one of our transportation or storage customers defaults on a service agreement and we are unable to resell the capacity at the same or higher rate 
as a result of competition in the industry  we actively monitor future expiration dates associated with our contract portfolio 
as of december   approximately of the firm contract load on our pipeline systems  excluding agreements related to the expansion projects not yet in service  was due to expire on or before december  as of december   the firm contract load due to expire within one year was 
many of the contracts comprising the were renewed or remarketed at favorable terms and for extended terms  increasing our weighted average contract term
