we were founded in june by a team at deloitte touche llp  led by our chief executive officer  donald b 
murray  who was then a senior partner with deloitte touche 
our founders created resources connection to capitalize on the increasing demand for high quality outsourced professional services 
we operated as a part of deloitte touche from our inception in june until april in april  we completed a management led buyout 
in december  we completed our initial public offering of common stock and began trading on the nasdaq 
we currently trade on the nasdaq global select market 
in january  we announced the change of our operating entity name to resources global professionals to better reflect the company s international capabilities 
we operated solely in the united states until fiscal year  when we began to expand geographically to meet the demand for project professional services across the world and opened our first three international offices 
our most significant international transaction to date was the acquisition of our netherland practice in fiscal year as of may   we served clients through offices in the united states and offices abroad 
during fiscal  we continued our expansion around the world  acquiring practices in the netherlands  sweden and the united states 
on january   we acquired limbus holding bv limbus  a netherlands based provider of risk and compliance and process improvement consultancy services to financial institutions and the public sector 
the company paid approximately million for the acquisition  consisting of million in cash and million  shares of the company s treasury stock 
on december   the company acquired kompetensslussen x tern personalfunktion ab kompetensslussen  a sweden based provider of human capital services 
the company paid approximately million for the acquisition  consisting of  in cash and   shares of the company s treasury stock 
finally  on may   the company purchased intangible assets of xperianz  a cincinnati based provider of professional services to expand our presence in the ohio valley area 
the company paid cash of approximately  for the acquisition 
all of these acquisitions require certain earn out payments if particular economic goals are reached at future dates 
we expect to continue opportunistic international expansion while also investing in complementary professional services lines that we believe will augment our service offerings 
we primarily charge our clients on an hourly basis for the professional services of our consultants 
we recognize revenue once services have been rendered and invoice the majority of our clients on a weekly basis 
our clients are contractually obligated to pay us for all hours billed 
to a much lesser extent  we also earn revenue if a client hires one of our consultants 
this type of contractually non refundable revenue is recognized at the time our client completes the hiring process and represented  and of our revenue for the years ended may   may  and may   respectively 
we periodically review our outstanding accounts receivable balance and determine an estimate of the amount of those receivables we believe may prove uncollectible 
our provision for bad debts is included in our selling  general and administrative expenses 
the costs to pay our professional consultants and all related benefit and incentive costs  including provisions for paid time off and other employee benefits  are included in direct cost of services 
we pay most of our consultants on an hourly basis for all hours worked on client engagements and  therefore  direct cost of services tends to vary directly with the volume of revenue we earn 
we expense the benefits we pay to our consultants as they are earned 
these benefits include paid time off and holidays  a discretionary bonus plan  subsidized group health  dental  vision and life insurance programs  a matching k retirement plan  the ability to participate in the company s employee stock purchase plan espp  and professional development and career training 
in addition  we pay the related costs of employment  including state and federal payroll taxes  workers compensation insurance  
table of contents unemployment insurance and other costs 
typically  a consultant must work a threshold number of hours to be eligible for all of the benefits 
we recognize direct cost of services when incurred 
selling  general and administrative expenses include the payroll and related costs of our internal management as well as general and administrative  marketing and recruiting costs 
our sales and marketing efforts are led by our management team who are salaried employees and earn bonuses based on operating results for our company as a whole and within each individual s geographic market 
the company s fiscal year consists of or weeks  ending on the last saturday in may 
fiscal and consisted of weeks each 
for fiscal years of weeks  such as fiscal  the first three quarters consisted of weeks each and the fourth quarter consisted of weeks 
critical accounting policies the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with gaap in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
the following represents a summary of our critical accounting policies  defined as those policies that we believe a are the most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and b involve inherently uncertain issues that require management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments 
valuation of long lived assets we assess the potential impairment of long lived tangible and intangible assets periodically or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
our goodwill and certain other intangible assets are not subject to periodic amortization 
these assets are considered to have an indefinite life and their carrying values are required to be assessed by us for impairment at least annually 
depending on future market values of our stock  our operating performance and other factors  these assessments could potentially result in impairment reductions of these intangible assets in the future and this adjustment may materially affect the company s future financial results 
allowance for doubtful accounts we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from our clients failing to make required payments for services rendered 
we estimate this allowance based upon our knowledge of the financial condition of our clients  review of historical receivable and reserve trends and other pertinent information 
while such losses have historically been within our expectations and the provisions established  we cannot guarantee that we will continue to experience the same credit loss rates that we have in the past 
a significant change in the liquidity or financial position of our clients could cause unfavorable trends in receivable collections and additional allowances may be required 
these additional allowances could materially affect the company s future financial results 
income taxes in order to prepare our consolidated financial statements  we are required to make estimates of income taxes  if applicable  in each jurisdiction in which we operate 
the process incorporates an assessment of any current tax exposure together with temporary differences resulting from different treatment of transactions for tax and financial statement purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities that are included in our consolidated balance sheets 
the recovery of deferred tax assets from future taxable income must be assessed and  to the extent recovery is not likely  we will establish a valuation allowance 
an increase in the valuation allowance results in recording additional tax expense and any such adjustment may materially affect the company s future financial result 
if the ultimate tax liability differs from the amount of tax expense we have reflected in the consolidated statements of income  an adjustment of tax expense may need to be recorded and this adjustment may materially affect the company s future financial results 
revenue recognition we primarily charge our clients on an hourly basis for the professional services of our consultants 
we recognize revenue once services have been rendered and invoice the majority of our clients in the united states on a weekly basis 
some of our clients served by our international operations are billed on a monthly basis 
our clients are contractually obligated to pay us for all hours billed 
to a much lesser extent  we also earn 
table of contents revenue if a client hires one of our consultants 
this type of contractually non refundable revenue is recognized at the time our client completes the hiring process 
stock based compensation under our performance incentive plan  officers  employees  and outside directors have received or may receive grants of restricted stock  stock units  options to purchase common stock or other stock or stock based awards 
under our espp  eligible officers and employees may purchase our common stock in accordance with the terms of the plan 
effective may   the company adopted the fair value recognition provisions of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
revised  share based payment sfas r  using the modified prospective transition method  accordingly  prior periods have not been restated 
under the previously accepted accounting standards  there was no stock based compensation expense related to employee stock options and employee stock purchases recognized during prior periods 
the accounting required by sfas r requires that the company estimate a value for employee stock options on the date of grant using an option pricing model 
we have elected to use the black scholes option pricing model which takes into account assumptions regarding a number of highly complex and subjective variables 
these variables include the expected stock price volatility over the term of the awards and actual and projected employee stock option exercise behaviors 
additional variables to be considered are the expected term and risk free interest rate over the expected term of our employee stock options 
in addition  because stock based compensation expense recognized in the statement of income is based on awards ultimately expected to vest  it is reduced for estimated forfeitures 
sfas r requires forfeitures to be estimated at the time of grant and revised  if necessary  in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates 
forfeitures are estimated based on historical experience 
if facts and circumstances change and we employ different assumptions in the application of sfas r in future periods  the compensation expense recorded under sfas r may differ materially from the amount recorded in the current period 
the weighted average estimated value per share of employee stock options granted during the years ended may  and may  were and  respectively  using the black scholes model with the following assumptions year ended year ended may  may  expected volatility risk free interest rate expected dividends expected life years years the risk free interest rate assumption is based upon observed interest rates appropriate for the term of our employee stock options 
the dividend yield assumption is based on our previous history of not paying dividends and our expectation that the special dividend paid in august is an isolated event and not the commencement of a regular dividend policy 
the company s historical expected life of stock option grants is years for non officers and years for officers 
as permitted under staff accounting bulletin no 
 the company uses its historical volatility over the expected life of the stock option award to estimate the expected volatility of the price of its common stock 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions

revenue 
revenue decreased million  or  to million for the year ended may  from million for the year ended may  our revenue was adversely affected by a decline in the number of hours worked by our consultants offset by a minor increase in the average bill rate per hour in comparison to the prior year 
we believe the primary cause of the decrease in hours worked by our consultants is client uncertainty about the global economic environment  which is causing clients to approach their business more cautiously and to either defer  downsize or eliminate projects 
in addition  fiscal consisted of weeks while 
table of contents fiscal consisted of weeks 
revenues during the fifty third week of fiscal  which included the memorial day holiday in the united states  were million 
the number of hours worked in fiscal declined about from the prior year  while average bill rates increased by compared to the prior year 
the number of consultants on assignment at the end of fiscal was  compared to the  consultants engaged at the end of fiscal although we believe we have improved the awareness of our service offerings with clients and prospective clients through our previously completed engagements including sarbanes or related internal accounting control services  and that the significant changes taking place in the capital markets may present new opportunities going forward  there can be no assurance about the timing of such opportunities or whether we can successfully capitalize on them  especially given the current uncertain economic climate in the united states and international markets 
we operated and offices as of may  and may   respectively 
our clients do not sign long term contracts with us 
as such  there can be no assurance as to future demand levels for the services that we provide or that future results can be reliably predicted by considering past trends 
revenue for the company s major practice areas across the globe consisted of the following dollars in thousands revenue for the year ended of total may  may  may  may  change north america europe asia pacific total on a constant currency basis  international revenues would have been higher by million and lower by million in fiscal and  respectively  using the comparable fiscal and fiscal conversion rates 
we believe our revenues in the near term will continue to be impacted by the global economic environment which has reduced our clients demand for the services we provide 
direct cost of services 
direct cost of services decreased million  or  to million for the year ended may  from million for the year ended may  direct cost of services declined because of a decrease in hours worked compared to the prior year 
the average pay rate of our consultants was flat 
the direct cost of services as a percentage of revenue the direct cost of services percentage was and for the years ended may  and may   respectively 
although the direct cost of services percentage improved slightly over the prior year  a continuing lower level of revenues will put increased pressure on this calculation as consultants earn certain benefits  such as health care services  which are relatively fixed in terms of cost 
the cost of compensation and related benefits offered to the consultants of our international offices has been greater as a percentage of revenue than our domestic operations 
in addition  international offices use independent contractors more extensively 
thus  the direct cost of services percentage of our international offices has usually exceeded our domestic operation s targeted direct cost of services percentage of 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses s  g a decreased million  or  to million for the year ended may  from million for the year ended may  s  g a increased as a percentage of revenue from for the year ended may  to for the year ended may  management and administrative head count was at the end of fiscal but fell to at the end of fiscal s  g a decreases in fiscal as compared to fiscal included a reduction in marketing expenses  a reduction in recruiting and related expenses  salary  benefit and related costs  bonus expense and stock based compensation expense 
these decreases were partially offset by an increase of million in the company s provision for doubtful accounts after an evaluation of the company s 
table of contents client base  receivable balances and the current economic environment and the actions taken in the fourth quarter discussed in the following paragraph 
as a result of reduced revenue levels experienced beginning in the second quarter of fiscal  the company announced in its fourth quarter of fiscal a reduction in headcount and the consolidation of seven offices whose clients could be served from other offices within a close proximity 
in connection with these actions  the company recorded a charge in s  g a of approximately million in the fourth quarter of fiscal related to severance costs  leasehold improvements write offs and estimated lease termination accruals 
the company estimates these actions will result in annualized savings of approximately million 
amortization and depreciation expense 
amortization of intangible assets increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal the increase in fiscal is attributable to a full year of amortization related to identified intangible assets acquired its fiscal purchases of compliance solutions and domenica and amounts related to the fiscal acquisitions of limbus and kompetensslussen 
the company considered a number of factors in performing these studies  including the valuation of the identifiable intangible assets 
the total intangible assets acquired included for limbus  approximately million of goodwill   for customer relationships amortized over two years   for a non compete agreement amortized over one year and  for a database of potential consultants amortized over two years  for kompetensslussen  approximately  of goodwill   for customer relationships amortized over two years and  for a non compete agreement amortized over one year  for compliance solutions  approximately million of goodwill   for a non compete agreement amortized over one year and  for customer relationships amortized over five years  and for domenica  approximately million for goodwill  million for customer relationships amortized over seven years and  for a database of potential consultants amortized over five years 
based upon identified intangible assets recorded at may   the company anticipates amortization expense related to identified intangible assets to approximate million during the fiscal year ending may  depreciation expense increased from million for the year ended may  to million for the year ended may  the increase in depreciation was related to a higher asset base due to the investments made in offices relocated or expanded since may  and investments in the company s operating system and other information technology 
interest income 
interest income was million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal the decrease in interest income is the result of a lower average cash balance available for investment during fiscal and declining interest rates as compared to fiscal the company has invested available cash in certificates of deposit  money market investments and government agency bonds that have been classified as cash equivalents due to the short maturities of these investments 
as of may   the company has million of investments in commercial paper  government agency bonds and certificates of deposit with remaining maturity dates between three months and one year from the balance sheet date classified as short term investments and considered held to maturity securities 
income taxes 
the provision for income taxes decreased from million for the year ended may  to million for the year ended may  the provision declined primarily because of a reduction in the company s pretax income in fiscal as compared to fiscal  offset in part by an increase in the company s effective tax rate between the two years 
the effective tax rate was for fiscal and for fiscal the effective tax rate increased because the company s lower pre tax income disproportionally magnifies the effect of non deductible permanent differences and incentive stock options isos 
in fiscal  the company recorded a million tax charge comprised of the establishment of a valuation allowance on certain foreign operating loss carryforwards of million and for the company s forgiveness of certain intercompany debt in france  thereby reducing france s operating loss carryforwards by million 
based upon current economic circumstances  management will continue to monitor the need to record additional valuation allowances in the future  primarily related to certain foreign jurisdictions 
under sfas r  the company cannot recognize a tax benefit for certain iso grants unless and until the holder exercises his or her option and then sells the shares within a certain period of time 
in addition  the company can only recognize a potential tax benefit for employees acquisition and subsequent sale of shares purchased 
table of contents through the espp if the sale occurs within a certain defined period 
as a result  the company s provision for income taxes is likely to fluctuate for the foreseeable future 
further  under sfas r  those tax benefits associated with iso grants fully vested at the date of adoption of sfas r will be recognized as additions to paid in capital when and if those options are exercised and not as a reduction to the company s tax provision 
the company recognized a benefit of approximately million and million related to stock based compensation for nonqualified stock options expensed and for eligible disqualifying iso exercises during fiscal and  respectively 
the proportion of expense related to non qualified stock option grants for which the company may recognize a tax benefit in the same quarter as the related compensation expense in most instances increased during fiscal as compared to expense related to isos including espps 
however  the timing and amount of eligible disqualifying iso exercises cannot be predicted 
the company predominantly grants nonqualified stock options to employees in the united states 
periodically  the company reviews the components of both book and taxable income to analyze the adequacy of the tax provision 
there can be no assurance  particularly because of the unpredictability of timing and the amount of eligible disqualifying iso exercises  that the company s effective tax rate will remain constant in the future 
year ended may  compared to year ended may  computations of percentage change period over period are based upon our results  as rounded and presented herein 
revenue 
revenue increased million  or  to million for the year ended may  from million for the year ended may  an improvement in our average bill rate per hour and an increase in the number of hours billed were the primary causes of the increase in revenue 
in addition  fiscal consisted of weeks while fiscal consisted of weeks 
revenues during the fifty third week of fiscal  which included the memorial day holiday in the united states  were million 
average bill rates improved by compared to the prior year average bill rate 
the increase in revenue was also driven by an increase in the number of consultants on assignment from  at the end of fiscal to  at the end of fiscal we operated and offices as of may  and may   respectively 
revenue for the company s major practice areas across the globe consisted of the following in thousands revenue for the year ended of total may  may  may  may  change north america europe asia pacific total on a constant currency basis  international revenues would have been lower by million and million in fiscal and  respectively  using the comparable fiscal and fiscal conversion rates 
direct cost of services 
direct cost of services increased million  or  to million for the year ended may  from million for the year ended may  the increase in direct cost of services was attributable to the increase in our consultants average pay rates as well as the previously described increase in number of hours billed  overall  the average pay rate per hour increased by year over year 
the direct cost of services percentage was and for the years ended may  and may   respectively 
this increase was caused primarily by costs associated with the grant of an extra week of vacation for united states consultants who met certain eligibility requirements commencing in the first quarter of fiscal selling  general and administrative expenses 
s  g a increased as a percentage of revenue from for the year ended may  to for the year ended may  s  g a increased million  or  to million for the year ended may  from million for the year ended may  
table of contents the increase in s  g a primarily stems from increased personnel and related benefit costs  in both our united states and international markets 
management and administrative headcount grew from at the end of fiscal to at the end of fiscal in addition to the increase in salaries and benefit costs  other significant increases in fiscal included an increase in spending for advertising  as the company continued a branding campaign in various united states and international business periodicals  occupancy and related costs from relocated  expanded or new offices  and certain bonuses that are determined based upon revenue  which was higher in fiscal than in fiscal amortization and depreciation expense 
amortization of intangible assets decreased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal the decrease in fiscal is attributable to the completion of amortization of intangible assets related to previous acquisitions 
however  this decrease was partially offset by the company s completion of its valuation studies during fiscal of its june purchase of compliance solutions and its december purchase of domenica 
the company considered a number of factors in performing these studies  including the valuation of identifiable intangible assets 
depreciation expense increased from million for the year ended may  to million for the year ended may  the increase in depreciation was related to a higher asset base due to the investments made in offices relocated or expanded since may  and investments in the company s operating system and other information technology 
interest income 
interest income was million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal the decrease in interest income is the result of a lower average cash balance available for investment during fiscal and declining interest rates as compared to fiscal during fiscal  the company used approximately million to purchase its common stock  paid a special dividend of approximately million in the first quarter of fiscal  and used approximately million to acquire domenica december and compliance solutions june 
income taxes 
the provision for income taxes decreased from million for the year ended may  to million for the year ended may  the provision declined primarily because of a reduction in the company s pretax income in fiscal as compared to fiscal  offset in part by an increase in the company s effective tax rate between the two years 
the effective tax rate was for fiscal and for fiscal the primary reason for the increase in the effective tax rate was primarily due to increases in state taxes  lower benefit from international tax rates and an increase in the rate attributable to permanent differences because of lower pretax income in fiscal as compared to fiscal the company recognized a benefit of approximately million and million related to stock based compensation for nonqualified stock options expensed and for eligible disqualifying iso exercises during fiscal and  respectively 
the timing and amount of eligible disqualifying iso exercises cannot be predicted

certain factors that could affect our quarterly operating results are described in part i item a 
risk factors 
due to these and other factors  we believe that quarter to quarter comparisons of our results of operations are not meaningful indicators of future performance

net cash provided by operating activities totaled million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal cash provided by operations in fiscal resulted from the net income of the company of million  adjusted for non cash items of million  plus net cash provided by changes in operating assets and liabilities of million 
in fiscal  cash provided by operations resulted from net income of the company of million  adjusted for non cash items of million  offset by net cash used for changes in operating assets and liabilities of million 
the most significant cause of the increase in operating cash flows was the reduction in the company s accounts receivable balance as a result of the decline in the company s revenue  particularly in the third and fourth quarters of fiscal  the decrease in accounts receivable was offset by an increase in the company s prepaid income tax balance as well as decreases in the company s required accruals for salaries  bonus and vacations as the number of employees was lower at the end of fiscal as compared to in addition  the company also changed its bonus plan for consultants such that a portion of the plan  considered a long term liability at the end of fiscal  was amended and the liability to the consultants was paid out by the end of fiscal non cash items increased beginning in fiscal as a result of the company s adoption of the accounting required in sfas r to expense stock based compensation  these charges do not reflect an actual cash outflow from the company but are an estimate of the fair value of the services provided by employees and directors in exchange for stock option grants and purchase of stock through the company s espp

in fiscal  the company paid a special cash dividend of per share of common stock for an aggregate amount of approximately million  there was no dividend payment made in fiscal  and used approximately million to purchase approximately million shares of its common stock  the cash used in fiscal was offset by cash received from stock option exercises and sales of common stock through the espp of million in fiscal our ongoing operations and anticipated growth in the geographic markets we currently serve will require us to continue to make investments in capital equipment  primarily technology hardware and software 
in addition  we may consider making strategic acquisitions 
we anticipate that our current cash and the ongoing cash flows from our operations will be adequate to meet our working capital and capital expenditure needs for at least the next months 
if we require additional capital resources to grow our business  either internally or through acquisition  we may seek to sell additional equity securities or to secure debt financing 
the sale of additional equity securities or certain forms of debt financing could result in additional dilution to our stockholders 
we may not be able to obtain financing arrangements in amounts or on terms acceptable to us in the future 
in the event we are unable to obtain additional financing when needed  we may be compelled to delay or curtail our plans to develop our business  which could have a material adverse effect on our operations  market position and competitiveness

recent accounting pronouncements information regarding recent accounting pronouncements is contained in note to the consolidated financial statements for the year ended may  item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk 
at the end of fiscal  we had approximately million of cash and cash equivalents and short term investments 
securities that the company has the ability and positive intent to hold to maturity are carried at amortized cost 
these securities consist of commercial paper and government agency bonds 
cost approximates market for these securities 
the earnings on these investments are subject to changes in interest rates  however  assuming a constant balance available for investment  a decline in interest rates would reduce our interest income but would not have a material impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations 
foreign currency exchange rate risk 
for the year ended may   approximately of the company s revenues were generated outside of the united states 
as a result  our operating results are subject to fluctuations in the exchange rates of foreign currencies in relation to the united states dollar 
revenues and expenses denominated in foreign currencies are translated into united states dollars at the monthly average exchange rates prevailing during the period 
thus  as the value of the united states dollar fluctuates relative to the currencies in our non united states based operations  our reported results may vary 
assets and liabilities of our non united states based operations are translated into united states dollars at the exchange rate effective at the end of each monthly reporting period
