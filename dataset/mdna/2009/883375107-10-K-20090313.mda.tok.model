item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview theragenics corporation is a medical device company serving the surgical products and cancer treatment markets  operating in two business segments 
the terms company  we  us  or our mean theragenics corporation and all entities included in our consolidated financial statements 
our surgical products business consists of wound closure  vascular access  and specialty needle products 
wound closure includes sutures  needles and other surgical products 
vascular access includes introducers  guidewires  and related products 
specialty needles include coaxial  biopsy  spinal and disposable veress needles  access trocars  and other needle based products 
this segment serves a number of markets and applications  including among other areas  interventional cardiology  interventional radiology  vascular surgery  orthopedics  plastic surgery  dental surgery  urology  veterinary medicine  pain management  endoscopy  and spinal surgery 
our surgical products business sells its devices and components primarily to original equipment manufacturers oems and to a network of distributors 
in our brachytherapy seed business  we produce  market and sell theraseed  our premier palladium prostate cancer treatment device  i seed  our iodine based prostate cancer treatment device  and other related products and services 
we are the world s largest producer of palladium  the radioactive isotope that supplies the therapeutic radiation for our theraseed device 
physicians  hospitals and other healthcare providers  primarily located in the united states  utilize the theraseed device 
the majority of theraseed sales are channeled through third party distributors 
we also maintain an in house sales force that sells our theraseed and i seed devices directly to physicians 
we have substantially diversified our operations and revenues in recent years 
prior to  we operated one business segment  our brachytherapy seed business 
our sole product was the palladium theraseed prostate cancer treatment device 
in  we began to market i seed  our iodine based i seed prostate cancer treatment product 
in may  we expanded into the surgical products business with the acquisition of cp medical corporation cp medical 
in august we restructured our brachytherapy seed business in order to sharpen our focus on our two business segments and provide a more focused platform for continued diversification 
in august we acquired galt medical corp 
galt  and in july  we acquired needletech products  inc needletech 
cp medical  galt  and needletech comprise our surgical products business  which accounted for of consolidated revenue in prior to may  the brachytherapy seed business constituted of our revenue 
we acquired cp medical on may   for approximately million  including million in cash and the issuance of  shares of common stock valued at approximately million 
galt was acquired on august   for million net of million of cash acquired  including million in cash and the issuance of  share of common stock valued at million 
acquisition of needletech products in we acquired all of the outstanding common stock of needletech on july  the total purchase price  including transaction costs  was approximately million net of cash  cash equivalents  and marketable securities acquired of approximately million 
we paid the purchase price in cash  including million from borrowings under our million credit facility 
needletech is a manufacturer of specialty needles and related medical devices 
their current products include coaxial needles  biopsy needles  access trocars  brachytherapy needles  guidewire introducer needles  spinal needles  disposable veress needles  and other needle based products 
end markets served include the cardiology  orthopedics  pain management  endoscopy  spinal surgery  urology  and veterinary medicine markets 
we believe the acquisition of needletech will forward our stated strategy of becoming a diversified medical device manufacturer  will increase our breadth of offerings to our existing customers and will expand our customer base of large leading edge oems 
the results of needletech s operations were included in our consolidated results subsequent to acquisition 
ii results of operations year ended december   compared to year ended december  revenue following is a summary of revenue by segment for each of the three years in the period ended december  in thousands year ended december  surgical products brachytherapy seed product sales licensing fees total brachytherapy seed intersegment eliminations consolidated revenue in our surgical products segment increased over as a result of the acquisition of needletech  organic growth  and expanded programs for existing customers 
on a pro forma basis  as if the needletech acquisition had occurred on january   revenue in our surgical products segment would have increased over a significant portion of the products in our surgical business is sold to oems and a network of distributors 
ordering patterns of these customers vary and are difficult to predict 
accordingly  surgical products revenue is subject to fluctuation  especially on a quarter to quarter basis 
in addition  the volatility and disruptions in the us and global economies and credit markets  and other uncertainties due to the economic slowdown in the us and around the world  have had a negative effect on our surgical product revenue  especially as general economic conditions worsened in the fourth quarter of scheduled shipping dates for orders were farther out than we have typically experienced 
we believe the lengthening lead times have been  at least in part  our customers response to hospitals efforts to reduce inventories and conserve cash 
we believe this has affected all companies in the supply chain  including ours 
looking forward  we expect that the difficult economic climate and macroeconomic uncertainties generally will continue to affect our surgical products business at least through  and perhaps make the fluctuations in our results even more volatile from period to period 
brachytherapy product sales decreased in compared to the decrease in product sales included a decline in sales to our main distributor of 
we believe there has been an industry wide decline in prostate brachytherapy procedure volume in some newer forms of treatment have increased their market share  especially those with medicare reimbursement levels that are higher than reimbursement levels for brachytherapy 
these newer forms of alternative treatments include intensity modulated radiation therapy imrt and robotic surgery 
our revenues also continue to be affected by the disappointing performance of our main distributor 
we also maintain our own internal brachytherapy sales force that sells theraseed and i seed directly to hospitals and physicians 
revenue from direct sales was of total brachytherapy segment revenue in and in in addition to treatment options that enjoy favorable reimbursement rates  we believe brachytherapy seed revenue is also affected by disruptive pricing from other brachytherapy providers and uncertainties surrounding reimbursement 
the average selling price of the theraseed device sold directly to hospitals and physicians was down slightly in compared to we have two non exclusive distribution agreements in place for the distribution of the theraseed device 
the primary distribution agreement is with c 
r 
bard  inc bard  which is effective through december  the bard agreement 
sales to bard represented and of brachytherapy product revenue in and  respectively  and and of consolidated product revenue in and  respectively 
revenue generated from the second non exclusive distributor was not material in and is not expected to be material in the terms of the bard agreement provide for automatic one year extensions of the term  unless either party gives notice of its intent not to renew at least twelve months prior to the end of the current term 
the current term expires on december   and will be automatically extended for one additional year unless either party gives notice by december  of its intent not to extend the agreement 
in may  we entered into an exclusive license agreement whereby we licensed to another party the rights to certain intellectual property related to an expandable brachytherapy delivery system that we developed 
the term of the agreement is through the expiration of the last of the patents licensed under the agreement  which is currently november the agreement provides for a minimal non refundable initial license fee and non refundable continuing royalties based upon sales subject to certain minimums 
license fee revenue under this agreement was not material in and is not expected to be material in ii we believe that medicare reimbursement policies have affected the brachytherapy market and will continue to affect the brachytherapy market 
during medicare continued to reimburse for brachytherapy seeds under the charges adjusted to costs methodology  which is based on the actual invoiced cost of the seeds and which we sometimes refer to as a pass through methodology 
in december  congress enacted the medicare  medicaid and schip extension act of  which extended the existing cost based reimbursement methodology through june  on july   the medicare improvements for patients and providers act of the act was enacted into law 
the act extends medicare s long standing cost based reimbursement methodology for brachytherapy seeds administered in the hospital outpatient setting through december   ensuring that the medicare program does not implement potentially restrictive caps on reimbursement during this period 
the act was retroactive to july  the potential for fixed medicare reimbursement rates after the expiration of the act and other factors can be expected to lead to continued pricing pressure from hospitals and other health care providers 
any of these factors could have an adverse effect on brachytherapy revenue 
operating income loss and costs and expenses following is a summary of operating income loss by segment for each of the three years in the period ended december  in thousands year ended december  surgical products operating income loss impairment of goodwill and tradenames surgical products excluding special items brachytherapy seed operating income impairment of goodwill and tradenames one time license fees change in estimated value of asset held for sale restructuring related items  net brachytherapy seed excluding special items intersegment eliminations operating income loss consolidated excluding special items operating income excluding special items is a non gaap financial measure we use to make operational decisions  evaluate performance  prepare internal forecasts and allocate resources 
we believe presentation of these non gaap financial measures provides supplemental information that is helpful to an understanding of the operating results of our businesses and period to period comparisons of performance 
non gaap financial measures should be considered in addition to  but not as a substitute for  the comparable measure calculated and presented in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap 
on a consolidated basis we had an operating loss of million in this included a non cash impairment charge of million  related primarily to the impairment of all of our previously recorded goodwill 
see impairment of goodwill and tradenames below 
ii operating income in the surgical products segment includes the results of needletech subsequent to acquisition on july  surgical products operating income excluding special items was million in compared to million in gross margins in our surgical products segment were in compared to in our gross margins in were negatively affected by  of non cash acquisition related charges related to the needletech acquisition 
these non cash charges were related primarily to the fair value adjustments to needletech inventory at acquisition and will not recur in gross margins are also dependent on sales channel and product mix 
selling  general  and administrative sg a expenses in our surgical products business were of revenue in both and in we incurred higher recruiting  relocation  and information technology infrastructure costs as compared to we also implemented a new research and development r d program in our surgical products business in the fourth quarter of this r d program is intended to focus on product extensions  next generation products and new products that are complementary to our current product lines 
r d expenses in our surgical products segment were million in compared to  in looking forward  we expect r d expenses to increase to as high as million in  depending on our opportunities 
we also expect to continue to make investments in staffing  and other infrastructure  including our corporate wide investment in standardization of our information technology systems  in our surgical products segment in accordingly  operating income may fluctuate solely as a result of investments made in operations in future periods 
operating income excluding special items in the brachytherapy seed segment was million in compared to million in in december we increased the estimated service lives of our cyclotron equipment from years to years 
this change reduced manufacturing related depreciation expense by approximately million in from what would have otherwise been reported 
despite the lower depreciation expense  our operating income declined in primarily as a result of lower revenue 
manufacturing related expenses in our brachytherapy business tend to be fixed in nature 
accordingly  even modest declines in revenue have a negative impact on operating income 
gross margins and operating income in our brachytherapy seed business are expected to continue to be highly dependent on sales levels  due to this high fixed cost component 
partially offsetting the lower revenue was a  decrease in sg a expenses compared to primarily as a result of lower compensation related expenses and the elimination of maintenance expenses and carrying costs related to our oak ridge facility  which we sold in july looking forward  the elimination of our oak ridge carrying costs will reduce future annual operating expenses by approximately  as compared to r d expenses in the brachytherapy seed segment also declined in we do not expect r d expenses in this segment to be material in future periods  although we may incur r d expenses for appropriate opportunities in process improvements 
asset held for sale we completed the sale of our oak ridge facility in july this facility was previously classified as a long term asset held for sale in our consolidated balance sheet 
as part of this transaction  the facility was sold and the underlying land sublease was terminated 
the significant portion of the present value of the future payments due under that sublease was previously classified as a long term contract termination liability in our consolidated balance sheet 
the  gain realized from the completion of the sale in july  including the termination of the sublease  was recognized as an adjustment to the carrying value of the asset held for sale in during we recorded a  write down of the carrying value of the oak ridge facility based on the general deterioration of the commercial real estate markets and in the overall economy at the time 
impairment of goodwill and tradenames in accordance with the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  we perform an assessment of goodwill impairment annually  or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that impairment in the value of goodwill recorded on our balance sheet may exist 
we perform our impairment testing at the reporting unit level 
a reporting unit is the same as  or one level below  an operating segment 
we typically perform our annual assessment during the fourth quarter of each year  which coincides with the timing of our annual budgeting and forecasting process 
in order to estimate the fair value of goodwill  we typically make various assumptions about the future prospects for the reporting unit that the goodwill relates to  consider market factors specific to that reporting unit  and estimate future cash flows to be generated by that reporting unit 
assumptions used in these assessments are consistent with our internal planning 
we also consider external economic and market conditions that could impact the fair value of our reporting units 
our common stock is listed and traded on the new york stock exchange nyse 
the trading prices of many companies  including our own  declined significantly during the fourth quarter of  along with significant declines in the overall market value of the composite of all shares traded on the stock exchanges 
these overall stock market declines have continued into early we believe that events in the us and global credit markets  banking and financial markets  the current economic instability  and negative economic news in general  have caused the significant volatility in the prices of common stocks listed on the us and global stock exchanges 
this decline in stock market valuations coincided with our annual impairment testing 
ii the extended decline in our share price and market capitalization  and the overall deterioration in general macroeconomic conditions as discussed above  had a material effect on our impairment testing in the fourth quarter 
our assumptions and judgments reflected the deteriorating macroeconomic environment and resulted in the use of discount rates and comparable company market multiples that reflected the significantly increased risk prevalent in the markets 
in addition  our cash flow  discount rate and market multiple assumptions were severely restricted due to our market capitalization  which is determined by our share price as quoted by the nyse 
as a result of these circumstances  the first step of our impairment testing under sfas no 
indicated that goodwill was impaired at each of our reporting units 
we then performed the second step of the goodwill impairment test which involves calculating the implied fair value of goodwill by allocating the fair value of the reporting unit to all of its assets and liabilities other than goodwill including both recognized and unrecognized intangible assets and comparing the residual amount to the carrying value of goodwill 
the fair value of our reporting units was determined using discounted cash flow and market multiple approaches 
as we noted above  our estimates of fair value of our reporting units were severely limited by our market capitalization 
the results of this second step of impairment testing indicated that all goodwill at each of our reporting units was impaired 
total impairment of goodwill was million in our surgical products segment and million in our brachytherapy seed segment 
these impairment charges are not expected to affect our liquidity  cash flows from operating activities  or future operations 
these charges also had no effect on our million credit facility or our compliance with the financial covenants under the credit facility 
our tradenames were intangible assets with indefinite lives and accordingly were not subject to amortization 
pursuant to sfas no 
the recorded value of our tradenames intangible asset is tested for impairment annually or more frequently if changes in circumstances indicate that impairment may exist 
the determination of fair value used in the impairment evaluation is based on discounted estimates of future sales projections attributable to ownership of the tradenames 
significant judgments inherent in this analysis include assumptions about appropriate sales growth rates  royalty rates  discount rates and the amount of expected future cash flows 
the judgments and assumptions used in the estimate of fair value are consistent with the projections and assumptions that are used in our internal budgeting and forecasting process 
they are also consistent with the judgments and assumptions used in our goodwill impairment testing 
the determination of fair value is highly sensitive to changes in the related discount rate used to evaluate the fair value of our tradenames 
we estimated the current fair value of our tradenames  as determined using discount rates reflective of current economic conditions and our market capitalization 
we compared these estimated fair values to the recorded amounts of our tradenames and determined that there was impairment of million  all related to reporting units in our surgical products segment 
in connection with our review of tradename impairment  we determined that current facts and circumstances no longer supported an indefinite life 
we estimated that the remaining useful life of our tradenames was years 
accordingly  we will amortize our tradenames over years beginning in  and amortization expense in is expected to be  higher than it would be if tradenames were not subject to amortization 
pursuant to sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  we also review long lived assets  including our intangible assets subject to amortization  for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable 
we group these assets at the lowest level that we could reasonably estimate the identifiable cash flows 
recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of long lived assets to the future undiscounted net cash flows expected to be generated by these assets 
if the carrying amounts exceed the future undiscounted cash flows  then the impairment recognized is the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds their fair value 
as a result of the impairment indicators related to goodwill  we tested our long lived assets for impairment and determined that there was no impairment 
other income expense interest income was million in compared with million in the amount included  of one time interest income related to million of refunded federal income taxes 
interest income also decreased in as a result of cash used for the needletech acquisition and lower yields due to a more conservative investment mix and declining market interest rates 
our current investments consist primarily of money market funds and us treasury securities 
our investments can include short term cash investments and high credit quality corporate and municipal obligations  in accordance with our investment policies 
see liquidity marketable securities and critical accounting policies below 
funds available for investment have and will continue to be utilized for our current and future expansion programs and strategic opportunities for growth and diversification 
as funds continue to be used for these programs and activities  and as interest rates continue to change  we expect interest income to fluctuate accordingly 
ii interest expense increased to  in from  in the increase was due to an additional million of borrowings under our credit facility for the needletech acquisition 
interest on outstanding borrowings is payable at libor plus with an effective rate of at december  and at december  our interest expense in would have been higher had our effective interest rate not declined during the course of the year in future levels of interest expense will be dependent on the level of outstanding borrowings and on changes in the underlying libor rate 
such changes are impossible for us to predict  especially in the current economic environment 
to date we have not hedged the interest costs related to our credit facility 
we may hedge our interest rate risk in the future  depending on  among other things  the intermediate and long term outlook for interest rates and the risks and costs associated with hedging such items 
our current credit facility expires in october should we be successful in renewing or replacing our current credit facility  future interest expense will also be impacted by any new terms  increases or decreases in the effective interest rate on borrowings  and any future borrowings to support expansion programs and strategic opportunities for growth and diversification 
due to the current economic environment and severe difficulties in the credit markets  any new or replacement credit facility is likely to be on less favorable terms than our current credit facility 
other non operating income in totaled  this amount consisted of gains from the sale of scrap metal from one of our operating facilities of  looking forward  we do not expect to continue to realize similar gains in the near future 
offsetting this gain in was  in losses in our marketable securities  which included a  impairment charge related to a decline in market value to one of our investments that we considered to be a permanent decline 
for more information on the risks related to our investments  see critical accounting policies  liquidity and capital resources marketable securities  and item a  quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk  all of which are included in this report 
income tax expense our effective income tax rate for was a benefit of 
in our effective income tax rate was 
our effective income tax rate in was significantly affected by our non cash impairment charges of goodwill and tradenames 
the majority of these impairment charges were not deductible for income tax purposes and  accordingly  no tax benefit was recorded related to the non deductible charges 
this had the effect of reducing our tax benefit by approximately in excluding the effect of the non cash impairment charges  our income tax rate was in future tax rates can be affected by  among other things  changes in tax regulations  changes in statutory tax rates  changes in the tax jurisdictions in which we must file income tax returns  and many other items that affect the taxability and deductibility of our revenue and expenses and for which we cannot currently predict 
during  the irs completed an examination of our and federal income tax returns with no significant adjustments 
upon settlement of the audit  during we received a refund of federal income tax previously paid of million 
this refund resulted from the carryback of tax losses that were reported in our federal income tax return 
we also received  of interest income related to this refund  which was recognized upon settlement of the irs examination in year ended december   compared to year ended december  revenue consolidated revenue in increased over as a result of the increase in revenue in the surgical products segment 
results for include the results of galt for the entire year 
galt  which was acquired in august  was included for approximately five months in brachytherapy product sales decreased in compared to this decrease was due to a decline in sales to our main distributor  partially offset by an increase in direct sales 
the sales decline to this main distributor was attributable to a reduction in transfer price  which was effective february   with the remaining decrease due to lower unit volumes 
we reduced the transfer price in recognition of competitive marketplace pressures and new distributor strategies 
direct sales totaled of brachytherapy product revenue in compared to in the increase in direct sales resulted from programs implemented by the direct sales force and direct to consumer advertising programs 
the average selling price of the theraseed device sold directly to hospitals and physicians in was comparable to our primary distribution agreement in was with cr bard  inc bard 
sales to bard represented approximately and of brachytherapy product revenue in and  respectively  and and of consolidated product revenue in and  respectively 
revenue generated from a second non exclusive distributor was not material in or revenue in the period included  of one time license fee revenue in the brachytherapy segment related to the licensee s receipt of the ce mark and european registration for therasphere in certain european countries 
during  license fees represented only the continuing royalties from continuing license fees from european and us product sales of therasphere 
ii operating income and costs and expenses operating income in the surgical products segment includes the results of galt for the entire year in and for five months in gross margins in the surgical products segment were in and in and were affected by product and sales channel mix 
in addition to the inclusion of galt for a full year in  operating income improved over the periods due to reductions in professional fees and bad debt expense partially offset by severance costs 
efficiencies were also realized because of the larger scale of the surgical products business in overall sg a expenses as a percent of sales in the surgical products segment decreased to in from in operating income excluding special items in the brachytherapy segment increased to million in  more than double the million in this increase in profitability was a result of reductions in operating expenses in  partially offsetting the effect of lower revenue 
cost reductions were a result of operating efficiencies and other savings programs implemented in the last half of in  selling  general and administrative sg a expenses in the brachytherapy segment decreased by million compared to these sg a reductions were primarily a result of decreases in advertising and professional fees 
research and development r d expenses increased to million in compared to  in the brachytherapy segment developed a new device to assist with the configuration of seeds 
r d in the surgical products segment was primarily related to new product development 
asset held for sale during we recorded a  write down of the carrying value of our oak ridge facility  which was held for sale 
this write down was based on the general deterioration of the commercial real estate markets and in the overall economy at the time 
we completed the sale of the oak ridge facility in july other income expense interest income was million in compared to million in the amount included  of one time interest income related to million of refunded federal income taxes 
this interest income was recognized in the second quarter of upon settlement of the irs examination of our federal income tax return 
other increases in interest income were a result of higher interest rates in interest expense increased from  in to  in  as the million in borrowings under our credit facility was outstanding for all of in  these borrowings were outstanding for approximately five months 
income tax expense our effective income tax rate for was 
in  we recognized an income tax benefit of million 
this net benefit was a result of recognizing income tax expense of million  offset by a benefit resulting from the release of million of the deferred tax asset valuation allowance 
the valuation allowance was released in as it became more likely than not that our deferred income tax assets would be realized 
excluding the release of the allowance  the effective tax rate for would have been 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
the sec defines critical accounting policies as those that require application of our most difficult  subjective or complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain and may change in subsequent periods 
the following is not intended to be a comprehensive list of our accounting policies 
our significant accounting policies are more fully described in the notes to our consolidated financial statements 
in many cases  the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by gaap  with no need for our judgment in their application 
the accounting policies described below are those which we believe are most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results  and are areas in which our judgment in selecting an available alternative might produce a materially different result 
marketable securities 
we review our investments in marketable securities for impairment based on both quantitative and qualitative criteria that include the extent to which cost exceeds market value  the duration of any market decline  our intent and ability to hold to maturity or expected recovery  and the creditworthiness of the issuer 
we perform research and analysis  and monitor market conditions to identify potential impairments 
ii due to the severe volatility and disruptions related to the us and global investment and credit markets  we are exposed to the risk of changes in fair value of our marketable securities in future periods  which may cause us to take impairment charges that we do not currently anticipate 
while we will continue to research  analyze and monitor our investments  we cannot predict what the effect of current investment and credit market circumstances might have on our portfolio going forward 
you can find more information related to the valuation of our marketable securities in note e in the accompanying consolidated financial statements  liquidity and capital resources in management s discussion and analysis  and item a  quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk  all of which are included in this report 
property and equipment 
property and equipment are recorded at cost and depreciated on a straight line basis over the estimated useful lives of such assets 
our estimates can result in differences from the actual useful lives of certain assets 
the significant portion of equipment is comprised of cyclotrons  which are utilized in the brachytherapy business 
as of december   we owned and operated eight cyclotrons  the first of which entered service in in december we changed the estimated service lives of certain depreciable assets  mainly the cyclotron equipment 
the estimated service life of the cyclotron equipment was increased from years to years  and was based on  among other things  an assessment of the equipment s operating and maintenance history and expected future performance 
we accounted for this change as a change in estimate in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting changes and error corrections 
accordingly  this change was accounted for in the period of the change and will be accounted for in future periods 
in  this change reduced depreciation expense by approximately million compared to what it would have been using the former estimated useful life 
the effect of this change was not significant in we will continue to periodically examine estimates used for depreciation for reasonableness 
if we determine that the useful life of property or equipment should be shortened or lengthened  depreciation expense would be adjusted accordingly for the remaining useful lives of the identified assets 
under sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  we assess the impairment of our depreciable assets including property  equipment  and intangible assets subject to amortization whenever events or circumstances indicate that such assets might be impaired 
in the event the expected undiscounted future cash flow attributable to the asset is less than the carrying value of the asset  an impairment loss equal to the excess of the asset s carrying value over its fair value is recorded 
the estimation of fair value  whether in conjunction with an asset to be held and used or with an asset held for sale  also involves judgment 
it is possible that our estimates of fair value may change and impact our financial condition and results of operations 
as a result of the impairment indicators related to goodwill in the fourth quarter of  we performed an assessment of our long lived assets under sfas no 
and determined that there was no impairment 
see impairment of goodwill and tradenames above under results of operations 
goodwill and other intangible assets 
we account for goodwill and other intangible assets in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
under sfas no 
 goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives are not amortized to expense and must be reviewed for impairment annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that such assets might be impaired 
the first step of the impairment test  used to identify potential impairment  compares the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount  including goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives 
if fair value exceeds book value  goodwill is considered not impaired  and the second step of the impairment test is unnecessary 
if book value exceeds fair value  the second step of the impairment test is performed to measure the amount of impairment loss  if any 
for this step the implied fair value of the goodwill is compared with the book value of the goodwill 
if the carrying amount of the goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of the goodwill  an impairment loss would be recognized in an amount equal to that excess 
any loss recognized cannot exceed the carrying amount of goodwill 
after an impairment loss is recognized  the adjusted carrying amount of goodwill is its new accounting basis 
subsequent reversal of a previously recognized impairment loss is prohibited once the measurement of that loss is completed 
we perform our annual goodwill impairment assessment during the fourth quarter 
we also make judgments about goodwill whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that impairment in the value of goodwill recorded on our balance sheet may exist 
the timing of an impairment test may result in charges to our statements of income in future reporting periods that could not have been reasonably foreseen in prior periods 
in order to estimate the fair value of goodwill  we typically make various judgments and assumptions  including  among other things  the identification of the reporting units  the assignment of assets and liabilities to reporting units  the future prospects for the reporting unit that the asset relates to  the market factors specific to that reporting unit  the future cash flows to be generated by that reporting unit  and the weighted average cost of capital for purposes of establishing a discount rate 
assumptions used in these assessments are consistent with our internal planning 
the most recent assessment under sfas no was performed in the fourth quarter of we determined that all of our goodwill was impaired and that a portion of our tradenames intangible asset was impaired 
see impairment of goodwill and tradenames above under results of operations 
ii other intangible assets determined to have finite lives are amortized over their useful lives using a method that is expected to reflect the pattern of its economic benefit 
when a pattern of economic benefit cannot be determined  or if the straight line method results in greater amortization  then the straight line method is used 
to date  all finite lived intangible assets have been amortized using the straight line method 
we also review finite lived intangible assets for impairment to ensure they are appropriately valued if conditions exist that indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable 
allowance for doubtful accounts and returns 
we make estimates and use our judgments in connection with establishing an allowance for the possibility that portions of our accounts receivable balances may become uncollectible or subject to return 
accounts receivable are reduced by this allowance 
specifically  we analyze accounts receivable in relation to customer creditworthiness  current economic trends  changes in our customer payment history  and changes in sales returns history in establishing this allowance 
it is possible that these or other underlying factors could change and impact our financial position and results of operations 
asset retirement obligation 
sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations  requires us to estimate the future cost of asset retirement obligations  to discount that cost to its present value  and to record a corresponding asset and liability in our consolidated balance sheet 
the values ultimately derived are based on many significant estimates  including future decommissioning costs  inflation  cost of capital  and market risk premiums 
the nature of these estimates requires us to make judgments based on historical experience and future expectations 
revisions to the estimates may be required based on such things as changes to cost estimates or the timing of future cash outlays 
any such changes that result in upward or downward revisions in the estimated obligation will result in an adjustment to the related capitalized asset and corresponding liability on a prospective basis 
share based compensation 
we account for share based compensation in accordance with sfas no 
r  share based payment  as interpreted by sec staff accounting bulletin no 
under the fair value recognition provisions of this statement  share based compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the value of the award and is recognized as expense over the vesting period 
in order to determine the fair value of stock options on the date of grant  we utilize the black scholes model 
inherent in this model are assumptions related to expected stock price volatility  option life  risk free interest rate and dividend yield 
the risk free interest rate and dividend yield are based on factual data derived from public sources 
the expected stock price volatility and option life assumptions require significant judgment  which makes them critical accounting estimates 
our expected volatility is based upon weightings of the historical volatility of our stock 
with respect to the weighted average option life assumption  we consider the exercise behavior of past grants and model the pattern of aggregate exercises 
the grant date fair value of restricted stock units and performance restricted stock units collectively  the stock units are based on the fair value of the underlying common stock and is recognized over the requisite service period 
for stock units containing performance conditions  the grant date fair value is adjusted each period for the number of shares ultimately expected to be issued 
for stock units subject to discretionary performance conditions  the grant date has not been established and accordingly  the fair value of the award is updated each period for changes in the fair value of the underlying common stock 
to the extent that the underlying fair value of our common stock varies significantly  and or the number of shares issuable is determined  we may record additional compensation expense or adjust previously recognized compensation expense 
accounting for income taxes 
our judgments  assumptions and estimates relative to the provision for income taxes take into account current tax laws and our interpretation of current tax laws 
we must make assumptions  judgments and estimates to determine our tax provision and our deferred income tax assets and liabilities  including the valuation allowance to be recorded against a deferred tax asset 
actual operating results and the underlying amount and category of income in future years could differ materially from our current assumptions  judgments and estimates of recoverable net deferred taxes 
we periodically evaluate the recoverability of our deferred tax assets and recognize the tax benefit only as reassessment demonstrates that they are realizable 
at such time  if it is determined that it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets are realizable  the valuation allowance is adjusted 
in  we had a million net deferred tax asset primarily as a result of our restructuring 
at that time  a valuation allowance for the entire amount of the net deferred tax asset was established due to uncertainties surrounding its realizability 
in  we released most of the valuation allowance when we determined that it was more likely than not that a significant portion of these deferred tax assets would be realized 
factors considered by us in determining that the significant portion of the deferred tax assets would be realized included  among other things  our performance for the year which included four consecutive quarters of profitability  a full fiscal year of realization of the cost savings associated with the restructuring which exceeded the expected cost savings  certain changes in federal laws and policies occurring in december related to medicare reimbursement of brachytherapy seeds  and the continued successful diversification of the our business through its surgical products segment 
we evaluate the realizability of the deferred tax assets and assess the need for the valuation allowance each reporting period 
in the future if  based on the facts and circumstances surrounding our ability to generate adequate future taxable income  it becomes more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized  the valuation allowance may be required to be increased 
ii commitments and other contractual obligations contractual obligations we lease equipment and production  warehouse  office and other space under non cancelable leases that expire at various dates through june we also have million of borrowings outstanding under our credit facility 
approximate minimum payments of these obligations are as follows amounts in thousands obligation total less than year years years more than years operating lease obligations rental space and equipment production  office and warehouse space related parties total operating lease obligations short term borrowings interest on short term borrowings total short term borrowings other long term obligations total the surgical products business leases approximately  square feet of production  warehouse  and office space from two related entities 
one is controlled by the former owner and officer of cp medical  who is currently a stockholder of theragenics  and the second is controlled by the former principal owners of needletech  who are currently officers 
approximate minimum lease payments under these leases are as follows outstanding borrowings under the company s million credit facility are due october  interest on outstanding borrowings under credit facility at the december  effective rate of 
letter of credit we have a letter of credit outstanding under the credit facility as of december  totaling  this letter of credit is related to asset retirement liabilities of long lived assets 
liquidity and capital resources we assess our liquidity in terms of our ability to generate cash to fund our operating  investing and financing activities 
significant factors affecting the management of liquidity are cash flows generated from operating activities  capital expenditures  operational investments to support growth such as research and development programs  and acquisitions of businesses and technologies 
we have cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities of million at december  compared to million at december  marketable securities consist primarily of high credit quality corporate and municipal obligations  in accordance with our investment policies 
see marketable securities below for more information 
we acquired all of the outstanding common stock of needletech products  inc needletech on july  for million in cash including transaction costs 
we retained the cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities held by needletech  which had an estimated fair value of approximately million at the acquisition date 
we financed million of the purchase price with borrowings on our existing million credit facility and paid the remainder from our current cash and investment balances 
working capital was million and million at december  and  respectively 
the decline in working capital is primarily due to the classification of million of borrowings under our credit facility as a short term liability at december   thus reducing working capital 
our credit facility expires on october  at december  all outstanding borrowings under our credit facility were classified as long term and  accordingly  were not a part of working capital 
ii we have a credit facility with a financial institution that provides for borrowings of up to million  including a million sub limit for letters of credit 
borrowings of million were outstanding under the credit facility at december  interest is payable quarterly at libor plus effective rate of at december  for outstanding borrowings 
we also have a letter of credit totaling  outstanding under the credit facility  representing decommission funding required by the georgia department of natural resources 
the credit facility is unsecured  but provides for a lien to be established on substantially all of our assets subject to certain exceptions in the event certain events of default occur under the credit facility 
the credit facility  as amended  contains representations and warranties  as well as affirmative  reporting and negative covenants  customary for financings of this type 
among other things  certain provisions of the credit facility limit the incurrence of additional debt and require the maintenance of certain financial ratios 
in addition  the terms of our credit facility require us to maintain a minimum of million of liquid assets  as defined in the credit facility 
as of december   we were in compliance with the terms of the credit facility 
our credit facility expires on october  see credit facility below for more information 
cash provided by operations was million for the year ended december   compared to million in cash provided by operations consists of net earnings  plus non cash expenses such as depreciation  amortization  deferred income taxes  and changes in balance sheet items such as accounts receivable  inventories  prepaid expenses and payables 
the decline in was primarily a result of income tax payments during the year 
in  a substantial portion of our taxable income was reduced by net operating loss carryforwards  resulting in no significant income tax payments made in in addition  during we also received a million refund of income taxes paid in prior periods including interest 
we had no remaining net operating loss carryforward as of december  accordingly  in we began making income tax payments based on taxable income and paid a total of million 
during  as a result of the completion of the sale of our oak ridge facility  we generated another tax loss 
we expect that this tax loss will allow us to recover approximately million of income taxes paid during and to reduce a portion of income taxes payable in capital expenditures totaled million during and the expenditures were primarily to support continued growth and capacity in the surgical products business 
capital expenditures are expected to increase in as we continue our investments to support growth in the surgical products segment and maintain the brachytherapy segment 
in our surgical products business we expect to move one of our manufacturing operations to a larger leased facility during we also expect to invest in upgrades to our information technology systems 
these programs  along with our capital expenditures in the normal course  could increase our capital expenditure level to as much as million in cash provided by financing activities was million in consisting primarily of the million proceeds from our credit facility  which was used in our needletech acquisition  offset by  for the payment of certain expenses for which we were indemnified and reimbursed by receipt of  shares of our common stock 
cash provided by financing activities was  in consisting of cash proceeds from the exercise of stock options and the company s employee stock purchase plan 
research and development r d expenses were million in we expect to continue to use cash in to support growth in the surgical products segment  especially for the r d program implemented in late this new r d effort may increase our r d expenses to as much as million in  depending on the opportunities 
we may also continue to use cash for increased marketing and theraseed support activities  and in the pursuit of additional diversification efforts such as product development and the purchase of technologies  products or companies 
we believe that current cash and investment balances and cash from future operations will be sufficient to meet our current short term anticipated working capital and capital expenditure requirements 
however  continued disruption and instability in the us and global financial markets and worldwide economies may hinder our ability to take advantage of opportunities for long term growth in our businesses 
in the event additional financing becomes necessary  we may choose to raise those funds through other means of financing as appropriate 
credit facility our million credit agreement expires on october  we intend to seek renewal or replacement of this credit agreement during however  us and global market and economic conditions continue to be disrupted and volatile 
the disruption has been particularly acute in the financial sector and has continued to deteriorate in early financial institutions in particular have encountered severe difficulties  political influences and other pressures in the current economic environment 
although we believe we have not suffered any material liquidity issues as a result of these recent events  the cost and availability of funds may be adversely affected by  among other things  illiquid credit markets  political influences and other pressures 
continued disruption in us and global markets could adversely affect our ability to renew or replace this credit facility 
any new or replacement facility will likely be under terms that are not as favorable as the current credit facility 
the negative impact of recent and continuing adverse changes in the economy and credit markets generally or our inability to obtain financing on favorable terms  if at all  may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and business 
ii marketable securities we held million of marketable securities at december  this amount consisted primarily of a million of a rated bond fund and a  municipal auction rated security ars 
the ars was liquidated at par in january our cash equivalents include million of bank deposits  money market funds  and us treasury securities 
we review our investments in marketable securities and cash equivalents for impairment based on both quantitative and qualitative criteria that include the extent to which cost exceeds market value  the duration of any market decline  our intent and ability to hold to maturity or expected recovery  and the creditworthiness of the issuer 
we perform research and analysis  and monitor market conditions to identify potential impairments 
as of december  we recognized  of other than temporary impairment charges related to our current investments in marketable securities 
due to the disruptions  volatility and uncertainties related to the us and global investment and credit markets we are exposed to the risk of further changes in fair value of our cash equivalents and marketable securities in future periods  which may cause us to take impairment charges that are not currently anticipated 
while we will continue to research  analyze and monitor our investments  we cannot predict what the effect of current investment and credit market circumstances might have on our portfolio going forward 
medicare developments the medicare prescription drug  improvement and modernization act of the act  which went into effect on january   contained brachytherapy provisions requiring medicare to reimburse hospital outpatient departments for each brachytherapy seed source furnished between january  to december  based on the hospital s costs for each patient calculated from the hospital s charges adjusted by the hospital s specific cost to charge ratio 
the act also directed the us government accountability office gao to conduct a study examining future payment policies for brachytherapy seeds 
the gao published its report on july   concluding that the centers for medicare medicaid services cms  the regulatory body that sets medicare reimbursement policies  could establish separate prospective payment rates effective in for palladium brachytherapy seeds sources such as theraseed and iodine seeds sources using medicare s hospital outpatient data 
although subsequently superceded by congress  cms posted a final rule on november  with fixed prospective payment rates for brachytherapy seeds for medicare s hospital outpatient prospective payment system opps that would have applied to calendar year the use of prospective payment rates would have fixed the per seed rate at which medicare would have reimbursed hospitals in we believed that cms approach to determining the fixed prospective reimbursement rate for brachytherapy seeds was fundamentally flawed 
for example  cms did not stratify cost data on differing seed configurations  such as loose versus stranded seeds 
accordingly  we continued to work with policy makers in an effort to rectify the shortcomings we believed to be contained in the new cms rule 
in december  congress enacted the tax relief and health care act of the act  which extended and refined the medicare safeguards initially enacted by congress in for brachytherapy seeds administered in the hospital outpatient setting 
the act s provisions on brachytherapy superceded the final rule published by cms on november  by extending the existing charges adjusted to cost reimbursement policies which we sometimes refer to as a pass through methodology for brachytherapy seeds through the end of  ensuring that the medicare program would not implement potentially restrictive caps on reimbursement during that period 
in addition  the legislation recognized that prostate cancer patients must have meaningful access to stranded brachytherapy seeds  which increasingly are used in clinical practice to further enhance the safety and efficacy of treatment 
the act also established a permanent requirement for medicare to use separate codes for the reimbursement of stranded brachytherapy devices 
stranded seeds are becoming a larger portion of our brachytherapy business 
effective july  cms issued new reimbursement codes for brachytherapy sources 
the codes are isotope specific and recognize the distinction between non stranded versus stranded seeds  as mandated by the act 
in early november  cms again posted a final opps rule for calendar year with fixed prospective reimbursement rates for all brachytherapy source codes  including the new codes established in july in december  congress passed the medicare  medicaid and schip extension act of the act  which once again superseded another cms final opps rule by extending the existing pass through reimbursement policies for brachytherapy seeds through june  fixed reimbursement rates would have become effective on january  without the enactment of the act 
as a result of the act  fixed reimbursement rates for seeds were delayed until july  on july   the medicare improvements for patients and providers act of the act was enacted into law 
the act extends medicare s longstanding pass through reimbursement policies for brachytherapy seeds administered in the hospital outpatient setting through december   ensuring that the medicare program does not implement potentially restrictive caps on reimbursement during this period 
the act was retroactive to july  we expect to continue to support efforts to extend the pass through reimbursement policies beyond the potential for fixed reimbursement rates after the expiration of the act on december  and other factors can be expected to lead to continued pricing pressure from hospitals and other health care providers 
any of these factors could have an adverse effect on brachytherapy revenue
