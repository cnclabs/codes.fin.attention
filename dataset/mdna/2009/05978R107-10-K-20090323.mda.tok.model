item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation introduction the following discussion and analysis reviews our results of operations and assesses our financial condition 
the purpose of this discussion is to focus on information about us that is not otherwise apparent from the consolidated financial statements and related footnotes appearing elsewhere in this report on form k 
reference should be made to those financial statements and the selected financial data presented elsewhere in this report on form k for an understanding of the following discussion and analysis 
historical results of operations and any trends which may appear are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected in future periods 
the following discussion and analysis also identifies significant factors that have affected our financial condition and results of operations during the periods included in the financial statements contained in this report on form k 
we encourage you to read this discussion and analysis in conjunction with our financial statements and the other statistical information included in this report on form k 
executive summary the year ended december  was an extremely tumultuous year for the us economy and  more specifically  for the financial services industry 
deteriorating home values  among other factors  provided a catalyst for declining valuations across nearly all asset classes  including loans and securities 
property value declines  which began in late  continued to build throughout while banctrust did not have material exposure to many of the issues that plagued the industry eg  sub prime loans  structured investment vehicles  collateralized debt obligations  the company s exposure to the residential housing sector  primarily within its commercial real estate and construction loan portfolios  pressured its loan portfolio  resulting in increased credit costs and other real estate expenses 
we reported a profit for even though the recession adversely affected the economy in our markets  particularly in our gulf coast markets which were significantly impacted by declining real estate prices 
our earnings fell short of our expectations because of increased loan loss provisions  lower margins resulting from falling interest rates and increased expenses associated with other real estate owned 
loans were down  compared with the prior year 
the decrease was primarily due to a slowdown in economic activity in our coastal markets and to an increase in non performing loans being moved to other real estate owned 
we also sold three branches in the tuscaloosa  alabama market  which decreased loans by million 
the sale of the branches was part of our strategy to focus on markets where we have a greater presence 
we improved our operating leverage during the year by integrating peoples and completing the consolidation of our subsidiary banks into one bank 
we have realized approximately million in annual cost savings from these initiatives 
we increased our provision for loan losses primarily in response to increasing non performing assets in our florida market 
we believe the additional provisions were warranted in light of economic conditions and continued downward pressure on real estate collateral values 
although we believe our reserves were adequate at year end to cover projected loan losses  future changes in housing values  interest rates and economic conditions could impact the provision for credit losses for these loans in future periods 
we remain focused on credit quality to protect our future earnings and capital base 
we took proactive steps during the fourth quarter to raise million in new capital through the sale of preferred stock to the us treasury to strengthen our already strong capital base 
the us treasury department s capital purchase program was designed to fund well capitalized and well managed banks to ensure safety and soundness of the banking system during these challenging economic times 
we were well capitalized prior to participating in the program  and our participation significantly increased our capital base 
we continued to gain market share by attracting customers from other banks in our markets that have been impacted by bank merger activity and the unprecedented market events within the financial services industry 
we remain focused on providing our customers with personal attention and services to support their financial requirements 
we believe we are in an excellent position to take advantage of the changes in the banking markets by leveraging our strong capital base to fund future loan growth as the economy recovers 
as a bank holding company  our results of operations are almost entirely dependent on the results of operations of our subsidiary bank 
the following table contains selected data related to our subsidiary bank number of locations market area counties total assets at december  in thousands autauga  baldwin  barbour  bibb  butler  dallas  elmore  escambia  jefferson  lee  marengo  mobile  monroe  montgomery  shelby  in alabama and bay  okaloosa  walton in florida we offer a broad range of financial services to our customers  including retail banking  trust  insurance and securities services and products through the bank  our trust department and a financial services subsidiary of the bank 
like most community banks  we derive the majority of our revenue from the interest we earn on our loans and investments  and our greatest expense is the interest we pay on interest bearing deposits and borrowings 
consequently  one of the key measures of our success is our net interest income  which is the difference between the revenues we earn on our interest earning assets  such as loans and investments  and the expenses we pay on our interest bearing liabilities  such as interest bearing deposits and borrowings 
another key measure of our success is our net interest margin  or the difference between the yield we earn on these interest earning assets and the rate we pay on our interest bearing liabilities 
there are risks inherent in all loans  so we maintain an allowance for loan losses that we believe is adequate to absorb probable losses inherent in our loan portfolio 
we maintain this allowance by charging a provision for loan losses against our operating earnings for each period 
we have included a discussion of this process  as well as several tables describing our allowance for loan losses  in the following discussion 
in addition to earning interest on our loans and investments  we earn income through fees and other charges to our customers  including service charges on deposit accounts  mortgage fees  trust fees and fees for investment services 
we have also included a discussion of the various components of this non interest income  as well as of our non interest expense 
we measure and monitor the following factors as key indicators of our financial performance net income earnings per share loan and deposit growth credit quality effect of economic trends during and most of  the financial markets operated in a low interest rate environment 
during  many economists believed the economy was beginning to show signs of strengthening  and the federal reserve increased the federal funds interest rate by basis points during and by an additional basis points during in mid the federal reserve stopped increasing rates  and problems in the sub prime real estate market began to appear later in the year 
in problems in the sub prime real estate market began to intensify  and problems in the debt markets in general began to appear 
in august of  the federal reserve began reducing interest rates in an effort to combat the economic effects of the debt problems 
the interest rate reductions accelerated throughout along with the sub prime problems  the national real estate market faced a general reduction in sales and values of homes and other real estate  which further deteriorated in while the problems have affected wide areas of the united states  they were amplified in our coastal markets in florida and alabama by the continuing market disruption caused by major hurricanes in and our urban markets such as mobile  montgomery and birmingham have not been as severely affected 
the specific economic and credit risks associated with our loan portfolio  especially the real estate loan portfolio  include  but are not limited to  a general downturn in the economy that could affect unemployment rates in our market areas  general real estate market deterioration  interest rate fluctuations  deteriorated collateral values  title defects  inaccurate appraisals and financial deterioration of borrowers 
construction and development lending can also present other specific risks to the lender such as whether developers can find builders to buy lots for home construction  whether the builders can obtain financing for construction  whether the builders can sell the home to buyers and whether buyers can obtain permanent financing 
until mid  real estate values in our metropolitan montgomery and coastal alabama and florida markets increased  and employment trends in our market areas were favorable 
we experienced a slowdown in loan demand in our coastal markets in the fall of which has continued through the most likely reason for the slowdown initially was the effects of hurricanes in and along the gulf coast  especially hurricane katrina in august of the sub prime problem  combined with the collapse of the real estate market in some areas  has intensified the problems along the gulf coast 
we increased significantly the provision for loan losses in the fourth quarter of as a result of the deterioration in the real estate market  the higher level of non performing loans and the continuing uncertainty regarding economic conditions in the markets in which we operate  particularly those in the coastal regions of southern alabama and northwest florida 
calendar was marked by severe macro economic conditions  which negatively impacted liquidity and credit quality 
financial and credit markets declined sharply  building on issues that began in the sub prime mortgage market in the second half of and which led to significant declines in real estate and home values 
consumer confidence across all sectors of the economy declined as we experienced rising costs fueled by unprecedented prices for crude oil in the second and third quarters of coupled with the downturns in housing and mortgage related financial services 
these conditions were accompanied by a further deterioration in the labor market and rising unemployment  all of which contributed to extreme market volatility as economic fears and illiquidity persisted 
concerns regarding increased credit losses from the weakening economy negatively affected capital and earnings of most financial institutions 
financial institutions experienced significant declines in the value of collateral for real estate loans and heightened credit losses  resulting in record levels of non performing assets  charge offs and foreclosures 
in addition  certain financial institutions failed or merged with other institutions  and two of the government sponsored housing enterprises were placed into conservatorship with the us government 
liquidity in the debt markets remains low in spite of efforts by the us treasury and the federal reserve bank to inject capital into financial institutions 
during  the federal reserve bank lowered the federal funds rate seven times  including a drop of basis points in december during  the federal funds rate decreased from on january  to on december  various agencies of the united states government proposed a number of initiatives to stabilize the global economy and financial markets  including the emergency economic stabilization act of eesa including the troubled asset relief program tarp  the fdic s temporary liquidity guarantee program  the financial stability plan and american recovery and reinvestment act of arra 
arra  among other things  amends the terms of the tarp and imposes certain additional conditions and requirements on participating institutions such as banctrust 
however  it also loosens the limitations on redemption by allowing affected institutions to repay tarp proceeds at any time  subject to approval of the participating institution s primary regulator 
the effective dates of certain of arra s provisions and their applicability to banctrust are currently being analyzed by the company 
treasury  the fdic and other governmental agencies continue to enact rules and regulations to implement the eesa  tarp  the financial stability plan  the arra and related economic recovery programs  many of which contain limitations on the ability of financial institutions to take certain actions or to engage in certain activities if the financial institution is a participant in the tarp capital purchase program or related programs 
we are unable to predict the actual impact of the eesa  the fdic programs or any other governmental program on the financial markets 
the severe economic conditions are expected to continue in financial institutions likely will continue to experience heightened credit losses and higher levels of non performing assets  charge offs and foreclosures 
these factors negatively influenced  and likely will continue to negatively influence  earning asset yields at a time when the market for deposits is intensely competitive 
as a result  financial institutions experienced  and are expected to continue to experience  pressure on credit costs  loan yields  deposit and other borrowing costs  liquidity  and capital 
critical accounting policies and estimates we have adopted various accounting policies that govern the application of accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america and general practices within the banking industry in the preparation of our financial statements 
our significant accounting policies are described in the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements as of december  included in this report on form k 
certain accounting policies require management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reported period 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
estimates and assumptions are reviewed periodically  and the effects of revisions are reflected in the consolidated financial statements in the period they are determined to be necessary 
we believe the allowance for loan losses is the critical accounting policy that requires the most significant judgment and estimates used in preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
a description of these policies is set forth below 
allowance for loan losses the allowance for loan losses is maintained at a level considered by management to be sufficient to absorb losses inherent in the loan portfolio 
loans are charged off against the allowance for loan losses when management believes that the collection of the principal is unlikely 
subsequent recoveries are added to the allowance 
banctrust s determination of its allowance for loan losses is determined in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas nos 
and and other regulatory guidance 
the amount of the allowance for loan losses and the amount of the provision charged to expense is based on periodic reviews of the portfolio  past loan loss experience  current economic conditions and such other factors which  in management s judgment  deserve current recognition in estimating loan losses 
management has developed and uses a documented systematic methodology for determining and maintaining an allowance for loan losses 
a regular  formal and ongoing loan review is conducted to identify loans with unusual risks and probable loss 
management uses the loan review process to stratify the loan portfolio into risk grades 
for higher risk graded loans in the portfolio  management determines estimated amounts of loss based on several factors  including historical loss experience  management s judgment of economic conditions and the resulting impact on higher risk graded loans  the financial capacity of the borrower  secondary sources of repayment including collateral  and regulatory guidelines 
this determination also considers the balance of impaired loans 
specific allowances for impaired loans are based on comparisons of the recorded carrying values of the loans to the present value of these loans estimated cash flows discounted at each loan s effective interest rate  the fair value of the collateral  or the loans observable market price 
recovery of the carrying value of loans is dependent to a great extent on economic  operating and other conditions that may be beyond the company s control 
in addition to evaluating probable losses on individual loans  management also determines probable losses for all other loans that are not individually evaluated 
the amount of the allowance for loan losses related to all other loans in the portfolio is determined based on historical and current loss experience  portfolio mix by loan type and by collateral type  current economic conditions  the level and trend of loan quality ratios and such other factors that  in management s judgment  deserve current recognition in estimating inherent loan losses 
the methodology and assumptions used to determine the allowance are continually reviewed as to their appropriateness given the most recent losses realized and other factors that influence the estimation process 
the assumptions and resulting allowance level are adjusted accordingly as these factors change 
goodwill management tests goodwill for impairment on an annual basis  or more often if events or circumstances indicate there may be impairment 
management engaged external valuation specialists to assist in the goodwill assessment performed at september  and december  if the carrying amount of a reporting unit s goodwill exceeds its implied fair value  the company would recognize an impairment loss in an amount equal to that excess 
fair value of the reporting unit in was determined using two methods  one based on the price as a multiple of tangible equity capital for which similar units have sold and one based on discounted cash flow models with estimated cash flows based on internal forecasts of net income 
these two methods provided a range of valuations that management used in evaluating goodwill for possible impairment 
our goodwill impairment testing for  which was updated at december  as a result of the recent decline in our common stock price and net earnings  indicated that our goodwill was not impaired 
as a result of the recent decline in our stock price and operating results  the excess of the fair value over carrying value narrowed in our assessment 
if our stock price continues to decline  if the company does not produce anticipated cash flows  or if similar units begin selling at significantly lower prices than in the past  our goodwill may be impaired in the future 
financial condition recent acquisition in october of  the company completed the acquisition of the peoples banctrust company  inc peoples 
on the acquisition date the assets of peoples were approximately million 
the acquisition of peoples was accounted for under the purchase accounting method as required by united states generally accepted accounting principles 
under this method of accounting  the financial statements and tables shown in this section do not reflect results of operations or the financial condition of peoples prior to october  one result of this accounting method is that certain items shown in the following financial statements and tables are less useful as a means of judging the company s performance in and  in comparing to and in comparing and to other years shown 
average assets and liabilities average assets in were billion  compared to billion in most of the increase in average assets was attributable to the peoples acquisition 
average loans  net  in were billion compared to billion in we experienced a significant increase in loan demand beginning in  and the demand continued to accelerate in and into the first half of beginning in the third quarter of we experienced a rapid slowdown in loan demand in our gulf coast markets  most likely a reaction to the extreme hurricane season of  especially hurricane katrina 
economic decline in subsequent years has more severely affected the northwest florida and gulf coast markets 
while loan demand remains reasonably good in our metropolitan markets of mobile  montgomery and birmingham  loan demand in our coastal markets remains weak 
collateral values have fallen in all of our markets  with the drop being more significant in our coastal markets average deposits in were billion compared to billion in short term and long term borrowings consist of federal funds purchased  federal home loan bank fhlb borrowings  notes payable to our subsidiary statutory trusts issued in connection with trust preferred securities offerings and a note payable to another financial institution 
in december  we issued an additional million of trust preferred securities 
part of the funds were used to pay off a bank loan  and the remaining proceeds were used for general corporate purposes 
in october of  in order to complete the purchase of peoples  we obtained a term bank loan in the amount of million 
in december we issued million worth of preferred stock to the us treasury and used million of the proceeds to pay down the bank loan 
our average equity as a percent of average total assets in was percent  compared to percent in average equity in and included approximately million and million  respectively  recorded as intangible assets related to acquisitions accounted for as purchases

average loan growth was strong in and continued into mid as economic conditions in our markets were good 
after the hurricane season and hurricane katrina  loan demand in our markets directly on the gulf of mexico slowed considerably 
we believe the psychological effects of the storms of and  as well as severe problems in the property insurance industry and overall economic decline  contributed to the slowdown in loan demand throughout our coastal markets that began in late our average loan to deposit ratio was percent in  percent in and percent in our loan to deposit ratio at year end was percent compared to percent at year end and percent at year end our lending strategy concentrates on originating loans with relatively short maturities or  in the case of loans with longer maturities  with floating rate arrangements when possible 
of our outstanding loans at december   million  or percent  mature within one year or otherwise reprice within one year 
maintaining high levels of short term and variable rate loans in our portfolio is a key component of our interest rate risk management strategy and was a key contributor to our improved net interest revenue and our net interest margin during the recent rising interest rate environment 
net interest revenue and net interest margin decreased when interest rates declined rapidly in net interest revenue and the net interest margin are discussed more fully under results of operations 
we offer  through third party arrangements  certain mortgage loan products that we sell to these third parties shortly after origination and that are therefore not retained in our loan portfolio 
these products expand our mortgage loan product offerings and have the capacity to generate significant fee income  especially during periods of relatively low mortgage rates 
these fees have come from first and second home purchases as well as from home refinancing volume 
mortgage loan origination volume in several of our markets has declined due to the downturn in the national housing market  particularly in our coastal markets impacted by the severe hurricane season in  and from a rise in interest rates beginning in mid refinancing volume in the metropolitan areas of mobile and montgomery have remained relatively stable 
with the return to lower mortgage rates in the last half of  volume has increased 
mortgage refinancing volumes are expected to increase in with record low interest rates 
potential restriction on cash out refinancings may lower these volumes to some degree

 accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities  requires that securities be classified into one of three categories held to maturity  available for sale or trading 
securities classified as held to maturity are stated at amortized cost 
securities are classified as held to maturity if management has the positive intent  and we have the ability  to hold the securities until they mature 
securities classified as available for sale are stated at fair value 
securities are classified as available for sale if they are to be held for indefinite periods of time  such as securities management intends to use as part of its asset liability strategy or that may be sold in response to changes in interest rates  changes in prepayment risks  changes in liquidity needs  the need to increase regulatory capital or other similar factors 
at december   all of our securities were stated at estimated fair value since they were in the available for sale category 
at december   we held no trading securities or securities classified as held to maturity 
the maturities and weighted average yields of securities available for sale at december   are presented in table at amortized cost using the average stated contractual maturities

total deposits at year end decreased million  or percent  from year end the decrease was partially the result of the sale of three branches in august the remaining decrease resulted from the extreme market and economic reaction to the financial crisis which began in the last half of average deposits increased at a rapid pace in  growing from million in to billion in  an increase of percent 
our deposit mix  on average  did not significantly change in and in  we saw a decrease in average savings deposits of million 
most of the decrease occurred in our florida market and appears to be a result of the slowdown which occurred after hurricane katrina 
also in we experienced an increase of million in average time deposits 
part of this increase is a result of our efforts to offset the savings deposit decrease in florida  and the remainder resulted from new account efforts in our other markets 
the increase of million from to was almost entirely attributable to the peoples purchase  since deposit growth in our gulf coast markets slowed considerably 
in  the bank significantly increased rates on time deposits in its florida markets in order to attract new deposits to fund loans 
as these time deposits matured in  the bank offered lower replacement rates 
as a result  deposits in our florida markets decreased by approximately million from december  to december  we define core deposits as total deposits less certificates of deposit of  or more 
core deposits  as a percentage of total deposits  represented percent and percent at year end and  respectively 
while our primary deposit taking emphasis focuses on attracting and retaining core deposits from customers who will also use our other products and services  we have from time to time found it necessary to use non core funding sources such as large certificates of deposit and other borrowed funds 
this was the case in periods of very rapid loan growth such as we experienced during and we do not currently need to access our non core funding sources  as internally generated funds are supplying our liquidity needs 
while we might consider using non core funding sources again during periods when loan growth exceeds core deposit growth  we are currently focused on minimizing our reliance on these sources of funds

fhlb advances  as a funding source  are flexible and allow us to quickly obtain funding with the mix of maturities and rates that best suits our overall asset liability management strategy 
our fhlb advances totaled million at december  compared to million as of december  we use our long term fhlb advances primarily to fund loan originations 
during  we repaid fhlb advances as they matured in an effort to reduce our dependency on these types of funds 
we acquired million in fhlb advances in the peoples purchase in during  we replaced most of our maturing fhlb advances with new advances 
of our outstanding fhlb advances at december   all had fixed interest rates 
note to the consolidated financial statements included in this report on form k sets forth additional information relating to outstanding balances  scheduled maturities and rates of our fhlb advances 
in  we increased our long term borrowings by issuing a note payable to our wholly owned statutory trust subsidiary  banctrust capital trust i the trust  which the trust purchased with the million proceeds of trust preferred securities it sold to investors 
the note payable matures in december we pay interest on the note to the trust  and the trust pays dividends on the trust preferred securities quarterly 
the interest rate we and the trust pay is reset quarterly at three month libor plus basis points 
we used the proceeds from the note payable to finance a portion of the purchase price for commercesouth  inc we have the option to repay any amounts of the note payable beginning december in  we again increased our long term borrowings by issuing a note payable to our wholly owned statutory trust subsidiary  banctrust capital trust ii trust ii  which trust ii purchased with the million proceeds of trust preferred securities it sold to an investor 
the note payable matures in we pay interest on the note to trust ii  and trust ii pays dividends on the trust preferred securities quarterly 
the interest rate we and trust ii pay is reset quarterly at three month libor plus basis points 
we used million of the proceeds from the note payable to repay a bank loan 
the remainder was used for general corporate purposes 
we do not have the option to repay any amounts of the note payable until in  we obtained a million term loan which we used to finance a portion of the purchase price for the peoples banctrust company 
on december  we prepaid million of the loan 
the loan matures in october of and is carried as long term debt 
the interest rate on this loan is based on one month libor plus a spread 
the spread is based on our level of non performing assets and can fluctuate monthly 
the spread at december  was basis points  which is the maximum spread possible under the loan agreement 
this loan is secured by our stock in the bank and requires quarterly interest payments 
as of december   our ratio of nonperforming assets to total loans and other real estate owned was percent  which exceeds the percent allowed by the loan agreement governing this loan 
we have been granted a waiver of the breach of the loan covenant regarding non performing assets 
this waiver only applies to the covenant breach as of december   and the situation will be reviewed again as of march  if we remain in breach of this covenant and are unable to obtain a waiver or amendment of the loan agreement  the lending bank would have the right to give notice of default 
if we are unable to cure the default within ninety days of notice  then the lending bank would have the right to declare the entire balance of the loan due and payable  which could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity and ability to pay dividends 
management continues to vigorously pursue a favorable resolution to this issue

off balance sheet arrangements the company  as part of its ongoing operations  issues financial guarantees in the form of financial and performance standby letters of credit 
standby letters of credit are contingent commitments issued by the company generally to guarantee the performance of a customer to a third party 
a financial standby letter of credit is a commitment by the company to guarantee a customer s repayment of an outstanding loan or financial obligation 
in a performance standby letter of credit  the company guarantees a customer s performance under a contractual non financial obligation for which it receives a fee 
the company has recourse against the customer for any amount it is required to pay to a third party under a standby letter of credit 
revenues are recognized over the life of the standby letter of credit 
the maximum potential amount of future payments the company could be required to make under its standby letters of credit at december  was million  and that sum represents the company s maximum credit risk 
at december   the company had thousand of unearned fees associated with standby letter of credit agreements 
the company holds collateral to support standby letters of credit when deemed necessary 
collateral varies but may include accounts receivable  inventory  property  plant and equipment  and income producing commercial property 
table presents information about our off balance sheet arrangements at december  table off balance sheet arrangements one year or less over one year through five years over five years total dollars in thousands lines of credit unused standby letters of credit total asset liability management the purpose of asset liability management is to maximize return while minimizing risk 
maximizing return means achieving or exceeding our profitability and growth goals 
minimizing risk means managing four key risk factors liquidity  interest rate sensitivity  capital adequacy  and asset quality 
our asset liability management involves a comprehensive approach to statement of condition management that meets the risk and return criteria established by management and the board of directors 
management does not typically use derivative financial instruments as part of the asset liability management process 
our primary market risk is our exposure to interest rate changes 
interest rate risk management strategies are designed to optimize net interest income while minimizing the effects of changes in market rates of interest on operating results and asset and liability fair values 
a key component of our interest rate risk management strategy is to manage and match the maturity and repricing characteristics of our assets and liabilities 
we use modeling techniques to simulate the effects various changes in market rates of interest would have on our interest income and on the fair values of our assets and liabilities 
important elements that affect the risk profile of our statement of condition in interest rate risk modeling include the mix of floating versus fixed rate assets and liabilities and the scheduled  as well as expected  repricing and maturing volumes and rates of assets and liabilities 
using the interest sensitivity analysis presented in table  applying a scenario simulating a hypothetical basis point rate increase applied to all interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities at december   we would expect a net decrease in net interest income of million for the year following the rate increase 
using a scenario simulating a hypothetical basis point decrease  we would expect a net decrease in net interest income of million for the year following the rate decrease 
these hypothetical examples are not a precise indicator of future events or of the actual effects such rate increases or decreases would have on our financial condition and operating results 
instead  they are reasonable estimates of the results anticipated if the assumptions used in the modeling techniques were to occur 
liquidity liquidity represents the ability of a bank to meet its funding needs with its available sources of funds 
it represents our ability to meet loan commitments as well as deposit withdrawals 
liquidity is derived from both the asset side and the liability side of the statement of condition 
on the asset side  liquidity is provided by marketable investment securities  maturing loans  federal funds sold and cash and cash equivalents 
on the liability side  liquidity is provided by a stable base of core deposits 
in addition to our ability to meet liquidity demands through current assets and liabilities  we had available at december   federal funds lines of credit of million and fhlb lines of credit million 
our asset liability committee  which is made up of certain members of management and the board of directors  monitors our liquidity position and formulates and implements  when appropriate  corrective measures in the event certain liquidity parameters are exceeded 
the consolidated statements of cash flows provide an analysis of cash from operating  investing  and financing activities 
cash flows from operating activities provided million in compared to million in and million in net cash from investing activities provided million in primarily due to the decrease in loans and provided million in primarily from decreased investments in interest bearing deposits in other banks and other investments 
net cash used in financing activities was million in compared to million in  due primarily to the decrease in deposits of million in and million in the net decrease in cash and cash equivalents was million in  compared to a net decrease of thousand in and a net increase of million in we acquired net cash and cash equivalents of million in through the purchase of peoples 
interest rate sensitivity management attempts to maintain a proper balance between the growth of net interest revenue and the risks that might result from significant changes in interest rates in the market by monitoring our interest rate sensitivity 
one tool for measurement of this risk is gap analysis  whereby the repricing of assets and liabilities is compared within certain time categories 
by identifying mismatches in repricing opportunities within a time category  we can identify interest rate risk 
the interest sensitivity analysis presented in table is based on this type of gap analysis  which assumes that rates earned on interest earning assets and rates paid on interest bearing liabilities will move simultaneously in the same direction and to the same extent 
however  the rates associated with these assets and liabilities typically change at different times and in varying amounts 
changes in the composition of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities can increase or decrease net interest revenue without affecting interest rate sensitivity 
the interest rate spread between assets and their corresponding liabilities can be significantly changed while the repricing interval for both remains unchanged  thus impacting net interest revenue 
over a period of time  net interest revenue can increase or decrease if one side of the statement of condition reprices before the other side 
an interest sensitivity ratio of percent earning assets divided by interest bearing liabilities  which represents a matched interest rate sensitive position  does not guarantee maximum net interest revenue 
management evaluates several factors  including the general direction of interest rates  before making adjustments to earning assets 
management tries to determine the type of investment and the maturity needed to maximize net interest revenue while minimizing interest rate risk 
management may  from time to time  accept calculated risks associated with interest rate sensitivity in an attempt to maximize net interest revenue 
we have not in the past used derivative financial instruments to manage interest rate sensitivity  however  in the peoples merger  we acquired an interest rate contract 
peoples purchased the interest rate contract to manage interest rate risk in its loan portfolio 
the contract was sold in the first quarter of for a gain of million 
at december   our three month gap position interest earning assets divided by interest bearing liabilities was percent  and our twelve month cumulative gap position was percent 
our twelve month cumulative gap position was within the range established by management as acceptable but our three month position was slightly out of the range 
our three month gap position indicates that  in a period of rising interest rates  each of earning assets that reprice upward during the three months would be accompanied by in interest bearing liabilities repricing upward during the same period 
thus  under this scenario  net interest revenue could be expected to decrease during the three month period of rising rates  as interest expense increases would exceed increases in interest income 
likewise  our twelve month gap position indicates that each of interest earning assets that reprices upward during such period would be accompanied by upward repricing of in interest bearing liabilities resulting in a decrease in net interest revenue 
in a period of falling rates  the opposite effect might occur 
while certain categories of liabilities are contractually tied to interest rate movements  most  including deposits  are subject only to competitive pressures and do not necessarily reprice directly with changes in market rates 
because rates on liabilities are near historic lows  a further decrease in rates would probably not result in an increase in net interest revenue 
management has some flexibility when adjusting rates on these products 
therefore  the repricing of assets and liabilities would not necessarily take place at the same time and in corresponding amounts 
the following table summarizes our interest sensitive assets and liabilities as of december  adjustable rate loans are included in the period in which their interest rates are scheduled to adjust 
fixed rate loans are included in the periods in which they are anticipated to be repaid based on scheduled maturities

certain types of savings accounts are included in the non interest rate sensitive within years category 
in management s opinion  these liabilities do not reprice in the same proportions as interest rate sensitive assets  as they are not responsive to general interest rate changes in the economy

we completed the sale of million in preferred shares to the united states treasury on december  the preferred shares pay a cumulative annual dividend at the rate of for the first five years 
the dividend will increase to after five years if the preferred shares have not been redeemed by the company 
in conjunction with the issuance of the preferred shares  we issued the us treasury a warrant to purchase up to  shares of our common stock at per share  which would represent an aggregate investment  if fully exercised of approximately million in banctrust common stock  or of the investment in preferred stock 
our participation resulted in the imposition of certain restrictions including limits on executive compensation and the requirement that we obtain prior approval from the us treasury before increasing our regular quarterly dividends paid to common shareholders above per share 
under the capital purchase program  the company s ability to purchase  redeem or otherwise acquire for consideration its common stock or trust preferred securities of its affiliates is restricted until the earlier of a the third anniversary of the issuance of the preferred stock and b the date on which the company has redeemed all of the preferred stock or the treasury has transferred all of the preferred stock to third parties  provided  however  that certain restrictions persist for any period when there are accrued and unpaid dividends on the preferred stock outstanding

under revised interpretation no 
fin r promulgated by financial accounting standards board fasb  both the trust and trust ii must be deconsolidated with us for accounting purposes 
as a result of this accounting pronouncement  the federal reserve board adopted changes to its capital rules with respect to the regulatory capital treatment afforded to trust preferred securities 
the federal reserve board s rules permit qualified trust preferred securities and other restricted capital elements to be included as tier capital up to of core capital 
we believe that our trust preferred securities qualify under these revised regulatory capital rules and expect that we will continue to treat our million of trust preferred securities as tier capital 
for regulatory purposes  the trust preferred securities are added to our tangible common shareholders equity to calculate tier capital 
our leverage ratio  defined as tangible shareholders equity divided by quarterly average assets  was at year end compared to at year end the federal reserve and the fdic require bank holding companies and banks to maintain certain minimum levels of capital as defined by risk based capital guidelines 
these guidelines consider risk factors associated with various components of assets  both on and off the statement of condition 
under these guidelines  capital is measured in two tiers  and these capital tiers are used in conjunction with risk based assets in determining risk based capital ratios 
our capital ratios expressed as a percentage of total risk adjusted assets  for tier and total capital were percent and percent  respectively  at december  we exceeded the minimum risk based capital guidelines at december   and the minimum guidelines are shown in table see management s discussion and analysis capital adequacy  and note of notes to consolidated financial statements

major factors influencing net interest revenue are changes in interest rates  changes in the volume of assets and liabilities and changes in the asset liability mix 
presented in table is an analysis of net interest revenue  weighted average yields on interest earning assets and weighted average rates paid on interest bearing liabilities for the past three years 
net yield on interest earning assets is net interest revenue  on a tax equivalent basis  divided by total average interest earning assets 
this ratio is a measure of our effectiveness in pricing interest earning assets and funding them with both interest bearing and non interest bearing liabilities 
our net yield in  on a tax equivalent basis  decreased basis points to percent compared to percent in and percent in from mid through mid  rising interest rates and a large increase in our loan volume resulted in an increase to our net yield 
this trend continued until the federal reserve stopped increasing rates in mid the federal reserve s monetary policy  combined with slower loan growth in  resulted in margin compression 
in recent years certain loans were placed on non accrual  further reducing our net interest margin 
the rapid decrease in interest rates beginning in the third quarter of was a contributing factor as well 
the current high volume of non performing assets as of december   reduced our net interest margin by approximately to basis points in further cuts in interest rates could erode our margin by limiting our ability to offset point for point asset yield reductions with liability costs 
further liability cost reductions could be limited by competition for deposits as well as the inability to aggressively lower deposit rates below the already near historic low levels in some categories

provision for loan and lease losses and allowance for loan and lease losses the provision for loan and lease losses is the charge to earnings that is added to the allowance for loan losses in order to maintain the allowance at a level that is adequate to absorb inherent losses in our loan portfolio 
management reviews the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses on a continuous basis by assessing the quality of the loan portfolio and adjusting the allowance when appropriate 
risk management procedures are in place to assist in identifying potential problem loans 
management s evaluation of each loan includes a review of the financial condition and capacity of the borrower  the value of the collateral  current economic trends  historical losses  work out and collection arrangements and possible risks associated with concentrations of credit 
the loan review process also includes an evaluation of credit quality within the mortgage and installment loan portfolios 
in establishing the allowance  loss percentages are applied to groups of loans with similar risk characteristics 
these loss percentages are determined by historical experience  portfolio mix  economic factors and other risk factors 
each quarter this review is quantified in a report prepared by loan review officers and delivered to management  which uses the report to determine whether any adjustments to the allowance for loan losses are appropriate 
management submits these quarterly reports to banctrust s board of directors 
the amount of the allowance is affected by i loan charge offs  which decrease the allowance  ii recoveries on loans previously charged off  which increase the allowance  and iii the provisions for loan losses charged to income  which increase the allowance

the changes in the allocation of the allowance for loan and lease losses see table from to are primarily attributable to the increase in non performing loans secured by real estate 
management reviews the adequacy of the allowance for loan and lease losses on a continuous basis by assessing the quality of the loan and lease portfolio  including non performing loans and leases  and adjusts the allowance when appropriate 
management believes the current methodology used to determine the required level of reserves is adequate  and management considered the allowance adequate at december  deterioration of the credit quality of loans in our portfolio  especially loans along the immediate gulf coast  could lead to an increase in the provision for loan and lease losses in future periods

inflation and other issues because our assets and liabilities are primarily monetary in nature  the effect of inflation on our assets is less significant compared to most commercial and industrial companies 
however  inflation does have an impact on the growth of total assets in the banking industry and the resulting need to increase capital at higher than normal rates in order to maintain an appropriate equity to assets ratio 
inflation also has a significant effect on other expenses  which tend to rise during periods of general inflation 
notwithstanding these effects of inflation  management believes our financial results are influenced more by management s ability to react to changes in interest rates than by inflation
