inflation and changing prices essentially all of the company s revenue is derived from the sale of its products in competitive markets

critical accounting estimates income taxes the company s effective tax rate is based on pre tax income and the tax rates applicable to that income in the various jurisdictions in which the company operates 
significant judgment is required in determining the company s effective income tax rate and in evaluating its tax positions 
the company adopted financial accounting standards board interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes fin on august  the company establishes fin liabilities when it is not more likely than not that the company will realize the full tax benefit of the position 
the company adjusts these fin liabilities in light of changing facts and circumstances 
tax regulations may require items of income and expense to be included in a tax return in different periods than the items are reflected in the consolidated financial statements 
as a result  the effective income tax rate reflected in the consolidated financial statements may be different than the tax rate reported in the income tax return 
some of these differences are permanent  such as expenses that are not deductible on the income tax return  and some are temporary differences  such as depreciation expense 
temporary differences create deferred tax assets and liabilities 
deferred tax assets generally represent items that can be used as tax deductions or credits in the tax return in future years for which the company has already recorded the tax benefit in the consolidated financial statements 
the company establishes valuation allowances against its deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that the amount of expected future taxable income will not support the use of the deduction or credit 
deferred tax liabilities generally represent tax expense recognized in the consolidated financial statements for which payment has been deferred or expense for which the company has already taken a deduction on an income tax return  but has not yet recognized as expense in the consolidated financial statements 
goodwill and intangible assets the allocation of purchase price for business combinations requires management estimates and judgment as to expectations for future cash flows of the acquired business and the allocation of those cash flows to identifiable intangible assets in determining the estimated fair value for purchase price allocation purposes 
if the actual results differ from the estimates and judgments used in these estimates  the amounts recorded in the financial statements could result in a possible impairment of the intangible assets and goodwill or require acceleration of the amortization expense of finite lived intangible assets 
in addition  sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  requires that goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets be tested at least annually for impairment 
changes in management s estimates or judgments could result in an impairment charge  and such a charge could have an adverse effect on the company s financial condition and results of operations 
to aid in establishing the value of goodwill and other intangible assets at the time of acquisition  company policy requires that all acquisitions with a purchase price above million must be further evaluated in a more detailed review 
the company has identified five reporting units within its three reportable segments in accordance with sfas no 
the company s methodologies for valuing goodwill are applied consistently on a year over year basis  the assumptions used in performing the impairment calculations were evaluated in light of market and business conditions 
brady continues to believe that the discounted cash flow model provides a reasonable and meaningful fair value estimate based upon the reporting units projections of future operating results and cash flows and replicates how market participants would value the company s reporting units 
in performing the company s annual impairment assessment the company performed a sensitivity analysis on the material assumptions used in the discounted cash flow valuation models for each of its reporting units 
based on the company s fiscal impairment testing and assuming a hypothetical decrease in the estimated fair values of each of its reporting units  the hypothetical fair value of each of the company s reporting units would have been greater than the carrying value
