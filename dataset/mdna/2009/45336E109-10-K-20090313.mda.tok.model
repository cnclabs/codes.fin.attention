our significant accounting policies  including those considered to be critical accounting policies  are summarized in note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
overview we are principally focused on selling software solutions and telecommunication services to the contact center industry 
in  we began the process of transitioning from operating as a telecommunications services provider to operating primarily as a software as a service saas provider 
we began as a reseller of telecommunication services 
after a series of strategic acquisitions  we emerged with a new product approach combining a national voice over ip voip network with innovative  on demand contact handling and agent optimization software technology called incontact 
we use the saas model to sell our incontact product suite to the contact center industry 
our incontact product suite is a set of software applications hosted and delivered by us to our customers on a per seat basis with the ability to scale capacity up or down as business fluctuates 
our incontact suite over the past several years  we have transitioned from a telecommunications long distance reseller and aggregator into a value added  saas company focused on the contact center market 
we have made a number of strategic acquisitions that we believe have positioned us at the forefront of the rapidly emerging hosted contact center software market 
we began building our all in one contact center solution with the acquisition of an automated call distribution solution  which is now the back bone of our incontact suite of services 
in  we added two components to our incontact application consisting of a workforce management product and a customer satisfaction measurement tool  echo 

table of contents long distance long distance telecommunication and related services remain the majority of our revenue 
as a domestic and international long distance reseller and aggregator  we contract with a number of third party long distance service providers for the right to resell telecommunication services to our customers 
the variety of traditional telecommunication services we offer enables our customers to buy most of the telecommunications services they need from one source  combine those services into a customized package including incontact s all in one  contact center solution  receive one bill for those services  make one call to incontact if service problems or billing issues arise  and depend on our professional team of employees to manage their network and contact center solution  end to end  so our users can focus on their business operations 
we offer our users a set of traditional connectivity products  which include the dedicated voice t product  the intelligent t  voip connectivity services and our switched services 
in addition to long distance  toll free  and other traditional telephone services  these connectivity options enable our users to connect to our voip network and the complete set of incontact suite of services we have available 
our users publish toll free and local inbound numbers to their customers enabling inbound calls to be handled directly or through the incontact suite embedded in the voip network 
our distribution channels pursue multiple marketing avenues  including using independent agents  value added resellers and direct and inside sales forces 
trends in our business the focus of our business operations has shifted dramatically the past three years  resulting in increased revenues from saas sales of our incontact suite  and we expect that our software segment revenues will continue to grow as a result of our continued emphasis on this segment of our business 
since when we began a concerted effort to focus our business on developing and marketing our incontact suite  we have seen continued attrition in our traditional pure telecommunication long distance business 
we expect costs of revenue excluding depreciation and amortization to decrease as a percentage of sales as we continue to shift our revenues more heavily towards the software segment 
our annual costs of revenue as a percentage of sales were in fiscal  in fiscal and in fiscal we recently began emphasizing the use of partner relationships in our business 
partnerships benefit incontact because they introduce us to new sales channels and they add scalability to our sales  implementation  professional services  and support operations 
partner companies are finding us appealing to work with for the following reasons our incontact suite is easy to integrate with  our direct sales presence give partners regional presence  and our strength and experience with the saas model attracts new partners wanting to capitalize on the momentum in this software market 
due to the recent turmoil in the credit industry and the downturn in the economy in general  we believe more contact centers are going to limit their up front capital expenditures  including purchases of premise based equipment 
we believe this will accelerate the adoption of the saas model by contact centers  which in turn will make our hosted incontact product suite more appealing to the contact center market 
we have experienced a trend in the telecommunication industry to increase costs associated with short duration calls 
a short duration call is defined as a call lasting only seconds or less 
typically a large volume of short duration calls will burden most telephony switches 
as a result  most carriers are beginning to apply surcharges to those calls 
we have passed these surcharges on to our customers that have a large number of short duration calls 
although we are uncertain what impact this will have on our long distance customer base  it does have the potential to increase attrition in our long distance segment as customers seek a safe haven from these surcharges until the industry as a whole adjusts 

table of contents results of operations results of versus the following is a tabular presentation of our condensed operating results for the year ended december  compared to our condensed operating results for the year ended december  in thousands change change revenue costs of revenue gross profit selling and marketing general and administrative depreciation and amortization research and development loss from operations interest expense  net loss before income taxes income tax expense net loss revenue total revenues increased  to million during compared to revenues of million during the increase is due to an increase of million in software segment revenue due to increased focus on our sales and marketing efforts on our all in one hosted incontact suite 
this increase is offset by a decrease of million in telecom segment revenue due to expected attrition 
costs of revenue cost of revenue excluding depreciation and amortization decreased million or to million during compared to million during consistent with other telecommunication companies  we do not include depreciation and amortization in our calculation of costs of revenue 
costs of revenue as a percentage of revenue decreased four percentage points to during compared to during the decrease is primarily driven by our transition in sales mix from our telecom segment that has lower margins to our software segment as a result of increased sales of our hosted incontact suite  which has much higher margins 
selling and marketing selling and marketing expense increased  or to million during from million during this increase is due to an overall increase in the number of sales and lead generation activities related to promoting the incontact suite in the market 
as previously noted  we continue to focus our marketing efforts on promoting our incontact suite of services 
general and administrative general and administrative expense increased million or to million during compared to million during the increase is due primarily to an increase of million in compensation expenses related to the implementation and support of incontact customers  additional rent and maintenance costs of million primarily related to the new corporate headquarters we moved into in at the end of  which affected subsequent quarters  and accounting and legal costs of  incurred in the first half of depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization expense decreased  or to million during from million during the decrease is due to decreases in intangible assets obtained in past acquisitions becoming fully amortized in offset by an increase in depreciation expense for acquired property and equipment in 
table of contents research and development research and development expense increased million or to million during compared to million during the increase is due to an increase in compensation expense related to the addition of new employees in our research and development department as we continue to develop new products and enhance existing products for our incontact suite of services 
interest expense  net interest expense  net decreased  or to  during compared to  during the decrease is due to paying off the outstanding balance of our revolving credit facility in the third quarter of and the conversion of the comvest convertible term note in april  thereby reducing the amount of debt on which interest is incurred 
the decrease was partially offset by interest expense incurred from drawing a total of million from our revolving credit facility in the second and third quarters of results of versus the following is a tabular presentation of our condensed operating results for the year ended december  compared to our condensed operating results for the year ended december  in thousands change change revenue costs of revenue gross profit selling and marketing general and administrative depreciation and amortization research and development loss from operations interest expense  net loss before income taxes income tax expense net loss revenue total revenues decreased million or to million during compared to revenues of million during the bulk of the decrease is driven by attrition in the telecom segment that was not replaced by software segment revenue 
in early  we completed two strategic acquisitions  which augmented our suite of incontact services 
through these acquisitions  we now offer companies the ability to monitor both customer satisfaction and agent effectiveness through our echo product as well as efficiently staff their contact center using our work force management solution 
we believe these acquisitions provide significant growth potential 
these acquisitions added a total of million of additional revenue in  primarily from users using our echo product 
costs of revenue cost of revenue excluding depreciation and amortization decreased million or to million during compared to the million during the decrease in our costs of revenue was primarily driven by a significant decline of million in our telecom segment revenue during  which is much lower margin revenue than our software segment revenue 
in we were successful in negotiating better terms with our long distance carriers and have moved long distance traffic from our legacy long distance network to our least cost routing technology 
selling and marketing selling and marketing expense increased million or to million during from million during this increase was due primarily to our increased efforts to market the incontact application suite through advertising  marketing and lead generation activities 

table of contents general and administrative general and administrative expense increased million or to million during compared to million during during  we increased the number of user support and new implementation personnel which significantly drove up our general and administrative costs 
during the first quarter of  we granted a significant number of stock options to our executive management team and other senior members of management that increased our stock based compensation expense  in over research and development research and development expense increased million or to million during compared to million during this increase was due to our continued development of the incontact suite 
interest expense  net interest expense  net decreased  or to  during compared to million during primarily due to the april conversion of the comvest convertible term note that saved us over  in interest expense for the remaining period in and the september equity raise completed in conjunction with our million shelf registration in which we paid down the entire outstanding balance of our revolving credit facility that saved us a significant amount of monthly interest 
segment reporting prior to january   we managed and reported financial results based on two customer segments incontact and telecom 
the incontact segment included all revenues from customers using at least of incontact services each month as well as their long distance voice and data services 
the telecom segment included all voice and data long distance services provided to customers not utilizing at least of incontact services each month 
effective january   management changed the way it manages the business and accordingly  we changed the way we report segments to reflect sales based on our two primary segments 
the new segments are software and telecom  which is different than the previously reported telecom segment 
the software segment includes all revenues from our incontact suite and related professional services 
the telecom segment includes all voice and long distance services provided to customers regardless of their use of saas products listed above 
during the first three quarters of  we referred to our software segment as the saas segment 
we subsequently determined in the fourth quarter of that referring to this segment as the software segment is clearer to our customers  investors and other stakeholders of our business

results of versus we continue to see decreases in the telecom segment  however the attrition rates are in line with our expectations 
overall telecom segment revenue decreased million or to million during 
table of contents compared to million during this decrease is due to the expected attrition of our telecom customers as we focus our selling and marketing efforts on our incontact suite of services 
with the decline in revenues from the telecom segment  we reduced overall costs in the segment as well 
our costs of revenue decreased and selling and marketing expenses decreased during compared to results of versus telecom segment revenue decreased million or to million during from million this decrease was due to the expected attrition of our telecom customers as we focused our selling and marketing efforts on our incontact suite of services 
with the decline in revenues from the telecom segment  we reduced overall costs in the segment as well 
our costs of revenue decreased  selling and marketing expenses decreased and depreciation and amortization expenses decreased during compared to these decreases were offset by a increase in general and administrative expenses due to the significant increase in consolidated general administrative expenses 
liquidity and capital resources current financial condition our principal sources of liquidity are cash and cash equivalents and available borrowings under our revolving credit facility  which expires in may at december   we had million of cash and cash equivalents 
cash equivalents are comprised of highly liquid assets with an original maturity at date of purchase of three months or less 
in addition to cash and cash equivalents  we have access to additional available borrowings under our revolving credit facility 
the revolving credit facility is secured by essentially all our assets 
the available borrowings under the revolving credit facility are million  resulting in total cash and additional availability under the revolving credit facility of million at december  we experienced a net loss of million during the year ended december  primary expenses affecting operations during this period were non cash charges related to million of depreciation and amortization and million of stock based compensation 
our working capital of million at december  decreased to  at december  the decrease is primarily due to a million reduction in accounts receivable and other current assets  an  increase in deferred revenue  a million liquidation of short term investments  and a  reclassification of our investments from short term to long term 
these factors were offset by a million increase in cash and cash equivalents 
we believe that current economic conditions will impact our access to equity financing through accordingly  we expect to rely on internally generated cash  our revolving credit facility and our equipment leasing facility to finance operations and capital requirements 
we believe that existing cash and cash equivalents  cash from operations  and available borrowings under our revolving credit facility and equipment leasing facility will be sufficient to meet our cash requirements during the next twelve months revolving credit note in may  we entered into an agreement with comvest capital  llc  which included a million convertible term note and a million revolving credit note 
these notes are secured by essentially all our assets 
as part of the agreement  we issued five year warrants to purchase  shares of common stock at per share  which remain outstanding as of december  on april  comvest exercised its right to convert the entire million outstanding balance of the million convertible term note  which was converted into  shares of common stock 
in conjunction with the note conversion  comvest agreed to eliminate significant number of financial covenants continuing under the revolving credit note 

table of contents the revolving credit note matures in may  accrues interest at a fixed nine percent and provides for maximum availability of million based on a calculation of percent of billed and percent unbilled accounts receivable at the measurement date 
we are required to make monthly interest payments and the entire outstanding balance is due at maturity 
there was million of unused commitment at december  under the revolving credit note 
the poor conditions in the credit markets notwithstanding  we have no reason to believe our revolving credit facility will not remain available to us on its present terms 
we consider our relationship with comvest to be good  and are beginning now to make overtures regarding renewal of the facility in nevertheless  the recent economic downturn illustrates that there is no certainty in current credit markets and no assurance that comvest will not seek changes to the terms of our facility or be willing to continue in capital leases we entered into an equipment leasing facility with an equipment financing company lessor in under the terms of the leasing facility  the lessor has agreed to provide us financing of million to lease computer related equipment and software for incontact s business operations  which the lessor will lease to us in the form of a capital lease 
the term of the facility is months upon acceptance of the leased property by us 
the calculated interest rate is subject to change based on changes in the treasury yield  installation period of the lease and the residual value 
at december   we have utilized million of the leasing facility to acquire computer related equipment and software  which has been recorded to property and equipment and other assets and long term debt and capital lease obligations 
beginning january   we are required by the lessor to provide cash collateral on the remaining  of available borrowings under the equipment leasing facility 
this is a new borrowing condition  which we believe the lessor imposed due to the turmoil in the credit markets 
we are currently in the process of seeking a new equipment leasing facility to fund capital purchases in the second half of and the first quarter of there is no assurance that we will be able to secure an additional equipment leasing facility on acceptable terms under current conditions in the credit markets 
if we are unsuccessful in obtaining an equipment leasing facility  we plan to meet our capital requirements through existing cash  available borrowings on our line of credit  and through cost reductions relating to operating expenses 
acquisitions we completed the acquisitions of benchmarkportal  inc benchmarkportal on february  and scheduleq  llc scheduleq on february  we accounted for both the benchmarkportal and scheduleq acquisitions using the purchase method of accounting and have included the operating results of each business in our consolidated statements of operations since the respective date of each acquisition 
management allocated the purchase price to the acquired tangible and intangible assets and liabilities based on their respective fair values 
in addition to the amounts paid at closing of the benchmarkportal acquisition  we agreed to pay contingent purchase price payments to benchmarkportal stock holders in the following amounts million of additional contingent purchase price cash payments to benchmarkportal stockholders in equal monthly installments of  subject to adjustment if monthly recurring revenue during the payout period from customers accounts acquired in the transaction does not remain at certain levels which are adjusted for estimated attrition  and up to an additional million maximum contingent quarterly earn out to benchmarkportal stockholders paid on a variable percentage of recurring revenue from the sale of echo services in excess of  per quarter during the four year period after the acquisition 
benchmarkportal stockholders earned total contingent purchase price payments of  in and  in  which have been recorded as additional goodwill 

table of contents in addition to the amounts paid at closing of the scheduleq acquisition  we agreed to pay contingent purchase price payments to scheduleq stockholders over a term of months based on the number of licenses sold by us  with a minimum aggregate earn out payment of  and a maximum of  former scheduleq stockholders earned total contingent purchase price payments of  in and  in  which have been recorded as additional goodwill 
cash flows in summary  our cash flows were in thousands year ended december  net cash used in operating activities net cash used in investing activities net cash provided by financing activities during the year ended december   we generated million of cash from financing activities 
we obtained cash from financing activities primarily by borrowing million from our revolving credit facility 
during the year ended december   we used  and million of cash in operating and investing activities  respectively 
cash used in investing activities was used to acquire property and equipment which was offset by proceeds from selling a portion of our auction rate preferred securities 
we had an overall net increase in cash of million during the year ended december  the amount that we have invested in our expansion has provided additional network capacity and additional resources to help grow our incontact suite 
during the year ended december   our employees exercised options to purchase a total of  shares of common stock and we received total proceeds of  as of december   we had  of investments in auction rate preferred securities arps  which are classified as available for sale securities and reflected at fair value 
as of december   we had million of investments in arps  which were valued based on quoted market prices and classified as current assets 
in january  we sold million of these arps at the quoted market prices  which was equal to the carrying value at december  in the fourth quarter of  the fund that issued arps to us executed a partial redemption of its outstanding arps  which resulted in redemption of an additional  of our arps 
contractual obligations the following table discloses aggregate information about our contractual obligations including notes payable and lease obligations  and the periods in which payments are due as of december  in thousands total less than year years years after years revolving credit facility and notes payable capital leases interest operating leases purchase commitments total contractual obligations our purchase commitments are with national long distance telecommunication providers 
we have one purchase commitment that provides for monthly minimums of  per month through october we exceed our monthly minimum with this carrier 
we have commitment with another carrier that requires a lump sum usage commitment through july that we feel we will meet based on our current usage patterns 

table of contents fair value measurements the fair value of a financial instrument is the amount that could be received upon the sale of an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date 
financial assets are marked to bid prices and financial liabilities are marked to offer prices 
fair value measurements do not include transaction costs 
we adopted statement no 
 fair value measurements statement  on january  this statement defines fair value  establishes a framework to measure fair value  and expands disclosures about fair value measurements 
statement establishes a fair value hierarchy used to prioritize the quality and reliability of the information used to determine fair values 
categorization within the fair value hierarchy is based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement 
the fair value hierarchy is defined into the following three categories level quoted market prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities 
level observable market based inputs or unobservable inputs that are corroborated by market data 
level unobservable inputs that are not corroborated by market data 
in february  the fasb issued staff position fsp no 
fas  effective date of fasb statement no 
 which delays the effective date of statement for non financial assets and liabilities to fiscal years beginning after november  we are currently reviewing the requirements of fsp no 
fas  and at this point in time  have not determined what impact  if any  fsp no 
fas will have on our results of operations and financial condition 
in october  the fasb issued fsp no 
fas  determining the fair value of a financial asset when the market for that asset is not active 
this statement clarifies that determining fair value in an inactive or dislocated market depends on facts and circumstances and requires significant management judgment 
this statement specifies that it is acceptable to use inputs based on management estimates or assumptions  or for management to make adjustments to observable inputs to determine fair value when markets are not active and relevant observable inputs are not available 
we adopted statement no 
 the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities  on january   and elected not to establish a fair value for our financial instruments and certain other items under this statement 
therefore  our adoption of this statement did not impact our financial statements during the year ended december  we utilized unobservable level inputs in determining the fair value of our auction rate preferred securities  which totaled  at december  in prior periods  due to the auction process which took place every days for most securities  quoted market prices were readily available  which would qualify as level under statement however  due to events in credit markets during the first quarter of  the auction events for most of these instruments failed and  therefore  we have determined the estimated fair values of these securities utilizing a discounted cash flow analysis as of december  this analysis considers  among other items  the collateralization of the underlying securities  the expected future cash flows and the expectation of the next time the security is expected to have a successful auction 
these securities were also compared  when possible  to other observable market data with similar characteristics to the securities held by us 
due to these events  we reclassified these instruments as level during the first quarter of and have recorded a temporary unrealized decline in fair value of  for the year ended december   with an offsetting entry to accumulated other comprehensive loss 
we currently believe that this temporary decline in fair value is due entirely to liquidity issues and not credit issues  because the auction rate preferred securities are in aaa closed end bond mutual funds that are over collateralized by at least and are backed by these underlying marketable securities 
in addition  our holdings of auction rate preferred securities represented only of our total cash  cash equivalent  and investment balance at december   which we believe allows us sufficient time for the securities to return to original full value 
we will re evaluate each of these factors as market conditions change in subsequent periods 

table of contents critical accounting estimates revenue recognition revenue is recognized in accordance with sec staff accounting bulletin sab topic  revenue recognition  when all of the following four criteria are met persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  the fee is fixed or determinable  collection is reasonably assured  and delivery has occurred or services have been rendered 
revenue is determined and recognized based on the type of service that is provided for the user as follows incontact suite of services 
revenue is derived from the use of any of our incontact suite of services that are provided on a monthly recurring basis 
the all in one incontact solution includes features such as skills based routing  automated call distribution  self service menus  speech recognition based automated interactive voice response  database integration with the contact handling technology  multimedia contact management voice  fax  email  chat  management reporting features  workforce management features  performance optimization benchmarking  custom call routing and call flow design  and new hire screening and on line training tools 
monthly recurring charges are billed in arrears and recognized for the period in which they are earned 
in addition to the monthly recurring revenue  revenue is also received on a non recurring basis for professional services included in implementing or improving a user s incontact suite experience 
for sales contracts with multiple elements hosted software  training  installation  long distance services  we follow the guidance provided in the emerging issues task force issue eitf no 
 revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables eitf 
eitf allows companies to recognize revenues upfront for delivered elements of a contract when it has objective and reliable evidence of fair value for the undelivered elements of the contract 
however  because we have not yet established objective and reliable evidence of fair value for our incontact suite of services the undelivered element  we defer revenue for upfront fees received for professional services  such as training and installation the delivered elements  and recognize such fees as revenue over the term of the contract  which is generally to months 
accordingly  we have recorded million of deferred revenue at december  and  of deferred revenue at december  fees for long distance services in multiple element arrangements with the incontact suite of services are based on usage and are recognized as revenue in the same manner as fees for traditional long distance services discussed in the following paragraph 
traditional long distance services 
revenue is derived from traditional telecommunications services such as dedicated transport  switched long distance and data services 
these services are provided over our network or through third party telecommunications providers 
our network is the backbone of our incontact application and allows us to provide the all in one incontact solution 
revenue for the transactional long distance usage is derived based on user specific rate plans and the user s call usage and is recognized in the period the call is initiated 
users are also billed monthly charges in arrears and revenue is recognized for such charges over the billing period 
if the billing period spans more than one month  unbilled revenues are accrued for incurred usage to date 
accounts receivable and allowance for doubtful accounts accounts receivable is comprised of amounts billed and billable to users 
the allowance for doubtful accounts  an estimate of the amount of accounts receivable outstanding of which management believes may be uncollectible  is determined each month as a percentage of revenue 
the percentage accrued during was 
management reviews the current trends and aged receivables periodically and adjusts the percentage used to accrue for doubtful accounts as needed 
an account is written off by management when deemed uncollectible  although collection efforts may continue 
long lived assets we estimate the useful lives of plant and equipment in order to determine the amount of depreciation and amortization expense to be recorded during any reporting period 
depreciation and amortization expense is generally computed using the straight line method over the estimated useful lives 
long lived assets consist of property and equipment computer equipment  software  furniture and equipment 
we evaluate the carrying value of long lived assets when events or circumstances indicate the existence of a possible impairment 
in our evaluation  we estimate the net undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the assets  and recognize impairment when such cash flows will be less than carrying values 

table of contents intangible assets we estimate the useful lives of intangibles  which include acquired user lists  patents and acquired technology  in order to determine the amount of amortization expense to be recorded during any reporting period 
we use an accelerated method to amortize customer lists acquired after other intangibles are amortized using the straight line method 
we test intangible assets for impairment annually or when events or circumstances indicate the existence of a possible impairment 
in our evaluation  we estimate the net undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the assets  and recognize impairment when such cash flows will be less than carrying values 
events or circumstances that could indicate the existence of a possible impairment include obsolescence of the technology  an absence of market demand for the product  and or the partial or complete lapse of continuing technology rights protection 
goodwill we evaluate goodwill for impairment  at a minimum  on an annual basis on september of each year and whenever events and changes in circumstances suggest that the carrying amount may not be recoverable 
the fair values are estimated based on the estimated market capitalization at the time the calculation is made 
we evaluate the carrying value of each reporting unit  identified as our segments  telecom and saas  separately 
if the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value  goodwill is considered impaired in the amount that the goodwill balances exceed the calculated fair value 
there were no events or circumstances from the date of our assessment through december  that would impact this assessment 
income taxes all income tax amounts reflect the use of the asset and liability method 
under this method  deferred income tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the expected future income tax consequences of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial and income tax reporting purposes 
a valuation allowance is provided to offset deferred income tax assets if  based upon the available evidence  it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred income tax assets will not be realized 
to date  a valuation allowance has been recorded to eliminate the deferred income tax assets 
in september  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement fin 
fin clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes by prescribing a recognition threshold for tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
fin requires that entities recognize in their financial statements the impact of a tax position if that position is more likely than not of being sustained on audit  based on the technical merits of the position 
fin is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  interest and penalties  if incurred  would be recognized as components of income tax expense 
our adoption of fin on january  had no impact on our consolidated financial statements as we do not have any uncertain income tax positions that would require adjustment 
off balance sheet arrangements other than purchase commitments with two national long distance telecommunication providers and our operating leases note  we do not have any off balance sheet arrangements 
stock based compensation we account for stock based compensation in accordance with statement no 
r  share based payment statement r  which requires measurement of compensation cost for equity based awards ie stock options  warrants  and restricted stock units at fair value on date of grant and recognition of the fair value of compensation for awards expected to vest over the requisite service period 
the fair value of stock options and warrants is determined based on the fair value calculated using the black scholes merton option pricing model black scholes model  which requires various highly judgmental assumptions including volatility  forfeiture rates and expected option life 
if any of the assumptions used in the black scholes model change significantly  stock based compensation expense may differ materially in the future from that recorded in the current period 
we consider many factors when estimating expected forfeitures  including types of awards  employee class  and historical experience 

table of contents we utilize the accelerated graded vesting method  rather than a straight line vesting method  for recognizing compensation expense as management believes this accelerated method more closely matches the expense to associated services 
under this method  nearly of the compensation cost would be expensed in the first year of a typical three year vesting term 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our cash and cash equivalent are invested with high quality issuers and limit the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer 
due to the short term nature of the cash equivalents  we believe that we are not subject to any material interest rate risk as it relates to interest income 
interest rates on outstanding lease and long term debt obligations are fixed and therefore do not vary with market fluctuations 
our short term investments of  in preferred auction rate securities are rated aaa 
while the recent auction failures may limit our ability to liquidate these investments for some period of time  we do not believe the auction failures will materially impact our ability to fund our working capital needs  capital expenditures  or other business requirements 
during  and subsequent to the auction failures that began in february   of our auction rate securities were redeemed by the issuer
