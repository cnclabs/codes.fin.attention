overview we opened our first restaurant under the name rubio s  home of the fish taco in as of march   we have grown to restaurants  including company operated  two licensed and three franchised locations 
we position our restaurants in the high quality  fresh and distinctive fast casual mexican cuisine segment of the restaurant industry 
our business strategy is to become a leading brand in this industry segment 
during  we continued to focus on ways to improve our economic model 
fiscal was impacted by the overall challenging macroeconomic environment in the areas we operate our restaurants  and in particular  rising unemployment and the weak housing markets in arizona  nevada and parts of california 
in addition  the current significant downturn in the overall economy has reduced consumer confidence in the economy and negatively affected consumer spending and dining out frequency 
over the past several months  we have undergone a vigorous assessment of the opportunities to better leverage our resources and gain efficiencies in our cost structure  while continuing to focus on delivering unique products and an unsurpassed guest experience 
notably  we reduced our corporate support staff by just over at the end of april and have several initiatives underway to lower food and labor costs while maintaining the integrity of our brand 
we believe this balanced approach will better position us to achieve our business goals in the near term and still execute our longer term strategy 
our average unit volume  which includes restaurants open for at least months  decreased from  to  due to a decrease in comparable store sales of and the closure of two restaurants during fiscal we opened new restaurants in all of the new openings in and have the new d cor that was developed during and was the basis for our system wide re imaging program 
the majority of these new restaurants are outperforming average weekly sales for their respective markets 
we currently plan to open company owned restaurants in fiscal in our existing geographic markets 
the current slow down in housing  combined with the weak economy  has caused us to focus almost exclusively on sites located in mature trade areas  where we will look for attractive long term opportunities in the softening real estate market 
this narrower focus could limit our growth potential in and our three year expansion plan begins with an annual unit growth rate of approximately in  and increases to by we intend to tailor our expansion plan during based on economic conditions  our financial results and our ability to continue to satisfy the covenants contained in our credit facility 
if our financial results drop below our expectations or we are unable to comply with the covenants in our credit facility  we will slow or curtail our expansion plan 
on the cost and expense side of our economic model  we are experiencing increases in cost of sales 
continued food cost inflation pressure increased our food and distribution costs during fiscal this increase was mitigated by the price increase that we implemented in july of fiscal  the second quarter price increase on our high volume taco tuesday promotion  as well as with ongoing menu engineering efforts 
general and administrative costs increased in primarily due to the addition of key personnel in late  which we believe is helping allow us to execute our development plans as well as to better support our restaurants through hiring  developing and training our new team members  in addition to an increase in non cash share based compensation  legal costs and professional service fees 
as we continue to add new restaurants  we expect to be able to leverage our general and administrative costs at a better rate than we have historically 
critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which are prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles gaap 
the preparation of these consolidated financial statements in accordance with gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingencies at the date of the consolidated financial statements as well as the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
management evaluates these estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis including those relating to impairment of assets  restructuring charges  contingencies and litigation 
our estimates and assumptions have been prepared on the basis of the most current information available  and actual results could differ from these estimates under different assumptions and conditions 
we have identified the following critical accounting policies that are most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and that require management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
note to the consolidated financial statements includes a summary of the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
the following is a review of the more critical accounting policies and methods used by us 
revenue recognition revenues from the operation of company owned restaurants are recognized when sales occur 
franchise revenue is comprised of i area development fees  ii new store opening fees and iii royalties 
fees received pursuant to area development agreements under individual franchise agreements  which grant the right to develop franchised restaurants in future periods in specific geographic areas  are deferred and recognized as revenue on a pro rata basis as the individual franchised restaurants subject to the development agreements are opened 
new store opening fees are recognized as revenue in the month a franchised location opens 
royalties from franchised restaurants are recorded in revenue as earned 
we recognize a liability upon the sale of our gift cards and recognize revenue when these gift cards are redeemed in our restaurants 
revenues from the portion of the gift cards that is not expected to be redeemed breakage are recognized ratably over three years based on historical and expected redemption trends 
this adjustment is classified as revenues in our consolidated statement of operations 
property property is stated at cost 
a variety of costs are incurred in the leasing and construction of restaurant facilities 
the costs of buildings under development include specifically identifiable costs 
the capitalized costs include development costs  construction costs  salaries and related costs  and other costs incurred during the acquisition or construction stage 
salaries and related costs capitalized totaled   and  for fiscal years  and  respectively 
depreciation and amortization of buildings  leasehold improvements  and equipment are computed using the straight line method over the shorter of the estimated useful lives of the assets or the initial lease term for certain leased properties buildings and improvements range from to years and equipment to years 
for leases with renewal periods at the company s option  the company generally uses the original lease term  excluding renewal option periods to determine useful lives  if failure to exercise a renewal option imposes an economic penalty to the company  management may determine at the inception of the lease that renewal is reasonably assured and include the renewal option period in the determination of appropriate estimated useful lives 
the company s policy requires lease term consistency when calculating the depreciation period  in classifying the lease  and in computing straight line rent expense 
impairment of goodwill goodwill  which represents the excess of the cost of acquired businesses over the fair value of amounts assigned to assets acquired and liabilities assumed  is not amortized 
instead  goodwill is assessed for impairment under financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas 
sfas no 
requires goodwill to be tested annually at the same time every year  and when an event occurs or circumstances change  such that it is reasonably possible that an impairment may exist 
we selected our fiscal year end as our annual date 
as a result of our assessment at december  and december   no impairment was indicated 
impairment of long lived assets we evaluate the carrying value of long lived assets for impairment when a restaurant experiences a negative event  including  but not limited to  a significant downturn in sales  a substantial loss of customers  an unfavorable change in demographics or a store closure 
upon the occurrence of a negative event  we estimate the future undiscounted cash flows for the individual restaurants that are affected by the negative event 
if the projected undiscounted cash flows do not exceed the carrying value of the assets at each restaurant  we recognize an impairment loss to reduce the assets carrying amounts to their estimated fair value for assets to be held and used and fair value less cost to sell for assets to be disposed of based on the discounted projected cash flows derived from the restaurant 
the most significant assumptions in the analysis are those used to estimate a restaurant s future cash flows 
we use the assumptions in our strategic plan and modify them as necessary based on restaurant specific information 
if the significant assumptions are incorrect  the carrying value of our operating restaurant assets  as well as the related impairment charge  may be overstated or understated 
we estimate that it takes a new restaurant approximately months to reach operating efficiency 
any restaurant open months or less  therefore  is not included in the analysis of long lived asset impairment  unless other events or circumstances arise 
long lived asset impairment amounts are estimates that we have recorded based on reasonable assumptions related to our restaurant locations at this point in time 
the conditions regarding these locations may change in the future and could be materially affected by factors such as our ability to maintain or improve sales levels  our ability to secure subleases  our success at negotiating early termination agreements with lessors  the general health of the economy and resultant demand for commercial property 
because the factors used to estimate impairment expenses are subject to change  amounts recorded may not be sufficient  and adjustments may be necessary 
store closure expense reversal we make decisions to close stores based on their cash flows and anticipated future profitability 
we record losses associated with the closure of a restaurant at the time the unit is closed 
these store closure charges primarily represent a liability for the future lease obligations after the closure dates  net of estimated sublease income  if any 
the amount of our store closure liability  and related store closure charges  may decrease if we are successful in either terminating a lease early or obtaining a more favorable sublease  and may increase if any of our sublessee s default on their leases 
consistent with long lived asset impairment amounts  store closure expenses are estimates that we have recorded based on reasonable assumptions related to our restaurant locations at this point in time 
the conditions regarding these locations may change in the future and could be materially affected by factors such as our ability to maintain or improve sales levels  our ability to secure subleases  our success at negotiating early termination agreements with lessors  the general health of the economy and resultant demand for commercial property 
because the factors used to estimate impairment expenses are subject to change  amounts recorded may not be sufficient  and adjustments may be necessary 
share based payment we account for share based compensation in accordance with sfas no 
r  share based payment sfas r 
under the provisions of sfas r  share based compensation cost is estimated at the grant date based on the award s fair value as calculated by an option pricing model and is recognized as expense on a straight line basis over the requisite service period 
the option pricing models require various highly judgmental assumptions including volatility  forfeiture rates  and expected option life 
if any of the assumptions used in the model change significantly  share based compensation expense may differ materially in the future from that recorded in the current period 
self insurance liabilities we are self insured for a portion of our workers compensation insurance program 
maximum self insured retention  including defense costs per occurrence is  for the claim year ended october  and  during each of our claim years ended october  and we account for insurance liabilities based on independent actuarial estimates of the amount of loss incurred 
these estimates rely on actuarial observations of industry wide and rubio s specific historical claim loss development 
our actual loss development may be better or worse than the development estimated by the actuary 
in that event  we will modify the accrual  and our operating expenses will increase or decrease accordingly 
income taxes we account for uncertainty in income taxes in accordance with fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
 fin  which clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in the financial statements in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes sfas  and provides guidance on the recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
fin also provides guidance on derecognition  classification  interest and penalties  accounting in interim periods  disclosures and transition 
on a quarterly basis  we review and update our inventory of tax positions as necessary to add any new uncertain positions taken  or to remove previously identified uncertain positions that have been adequately resolved 
additionally  uncertain positions may be re measured as warranted by changes in facts or law 
accounting for uncertain tax positions requires significant judgments  including estimating the amount  timing and likelihood of ultimate settlement 
although the company believes that its estimates are reasonable  actual results could differ from these estimates 
results of operations all comparisons under this heading between fiscal  and refer to the week period ended december   the week period ended december  and the week period ended december  the following table sets forth our operating results  expressed as a percentage of total revenues  with respect to certain items included in our consolidated statements of operations 
fiscal year ended december  december  december  total revenues costs and expenses cost of sales restaurant labor restaurant occupancy and other general and administrative expenses depreciation and amortization pre opening expenses asset impairment and store closure expense reversal loss on disposal sale of property operating income loss other income expense  net income loss before income taxes income tax expense benefit net income loss as a percentage of restaurant sales 
the following table summarizes the number of restaurants december  december  december  company operated franchised and licensed locations total revenues total revenues were million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
the increase in revenues in fiscal as compared with fiscal resulted from the following factors first  we opened new stores in fiscal  which contributed sales of million  second  stores opened before fiscal but not yet in our comparable store base contributed sales of million  third  a decrease in comparable store sales of million 
the decrease in comparable store sales in fiscal compared to fiscal was primarily due to a decrease in transactions of  which was partially offset by an increase in average check amount of 
comparable store sales decreased in comparison to the prior year 
units enter the comparable store base after full months of operation 
the increase in revenues in fiscal as compared with fiscal resulted from the following factors first  we opened new stores in fiscal  which contributed sales of million  second  stores opened before fiscal but not yet in our comparable store base contributed sales of million  third  comparable store sales contributed million  and fourth  revenue recognized for the portion of the gift card liability that is not expected to be redeemed breakage contributed million 
the million increase attributable to comparable store sales was offset by million due to the one extra week in fiscal as compared with fiscal this was further offset by a decrease of million in sales from one store that closed in the third quarter of fiscal and one store that closed during the second quarter of fiscal year our average unit volume was  in fiscal as compared with  in fiscal and  in fiscal costs and expenses cost of sales increased to million in fiscal  from million in fiscal and million in fiscal  due primarily to an increase in the number of company operated restaurants 
as a percentage of restaurant sales  cost of sales increased to in fiscal  as compared with in fiscal and in fiscal was impacted by continued food cost inflation pressure  which we mitigated with a price increase we implemented in july of this year  as well as with ongoing menu engineering efforts and diversification of our supply chain 
in addition  increases in the cost of fish  tortillas  avocados  cheese and beverage syrup  as well as cost increases related to our transition to the use of zero trans fat oil during the third quarter of contributed to the increase in cost of sales as a percentage of restaurant sales during fiscal our distribution costs also increased during fiscal  driven largely by higher gasoline costs 
the percentage increase in fiscal as compared with fiscal is a direct result of higher seafood costs due to increased demand and reduced supply 
additionally  avocado costs spiked due to a significant shortage in the supply as a result of the freezing weather in the western united states in january the escalation of gasoline prices and increased ethanol sourcing is increasing the cost of corn  which is directly tied to the costs of chicken  steak  tortillas  cheese and beverage syrup 
the cost of transporting food supplies to our distributors has increased and this cost is passed through to us 
finally  the cost of oil increased due to the transition to the exclusive use of zero trans fat oil in our stores during the third quarter of restaurant labor costs increased to million in fiscal  from million in fiscal and million in fiscal as a percentage of restaurant sales  these costs decreased to in fiscal compared with in fiscal and decreased compared with in fiscal the decrease in labor cost as a percentage of sales during fiscal compared to fiscal was due to continued favorable adjustments to our worker s compensation reserves that resulted primarily from the closure of a large number of cases during the year and our continued focus on safety in our restaurants  as well as from improvements in labor management driven by our new labor scheduling system 
these favorable drivers were partially offset by de leveraging of the fixed component of labor due to lower comparable store sales and the increase in the minimum wage rate in the state of california  which occurred during january the increase in compared with is primarily the result of the increase in the minimum wage at the beginning of the fiscal year  increased staffing levels at the restaurants and the cost of our long term incentive plan for restaurant general managers 
restaurant occupancy and other costs increased to million in fiscal  from million in fiscal and million in fiscal as a percentage of restaurant sales  these costs increased to in fiscal  from in fiscal and in fiscal the increase in restaurant occupancy and other costs as a percentage of restaurant sales during fiscal compared to fiscal is primarily a result of lower average unit volumes on a partially fixed cost base 
the decrease from fiscal compared to fiscal as a percentage of restaurant sales is primarily the result of our decision to shift a significant amount of advertising dollars from radio advertising in the los angeles and phoenix markets to localized neighborhood marketing efforts 
general and administrative expenses increased to million in fiscal  from million in fiscal  and decreased from million in fiscal as a percentage of revenue  these costs were in fiscal  in fiscal and in fiscal the increase in general administrative expenses in dollars  and as a percentage of revenue  in fiscal compared to fiscal is due to an increase in non cash share based compensation  higher legal costs  the addition of senior executives in the fourth quarter of  and professional fees associated with an income tax method change study that allowed us to immediately expense for tax purposes previously capitalized repairs and remodeling expenses 
general and administrative expenses in include the accrual of approximately million for the settlement of the class action wage and hour lawsuit and related costs 
in addition  we also expensed approximately million in legal fees related to this class action lawsuit 
excluding the one time accruals in fiscal  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue for fiscal  as compared with fiscal was relatively flat 
the dollar increase was due to additional head count added during and share based compensation expense 
depreciation and amortization increased to million in fiscal  from million in fiscal and million in fiscal this increase was primarily due to the additional depreciation on the new restaurants added in and as well as depreciation associated with the restaurant re imaging program  which occurred during fiscal and fiscal pre opening expenses increased to  in fiscal  from  in fiscal and  in fiscal during fiscal  we opened restaurants compared with during fiscal and nine during fiscal the increase in pre opening expenses in fiscal compared to fiscal is due to an increase in the number of restaurants opened during the fiscal year 
this is offset by an overall decline in pre opening expenditures on a per store basis 
this per store reduction is primarily due to the shifting of certain marketing related costs to post opening 
pre opening costs include non cash rent expense during the build out period of  to  per location and compensation expense of approximately  to  per location 
asset impairment and store closure reversal expense comprised a net  reversal in fiscal  compared to a  charge in fiscal  and a  reversal in fiscal a store closure reversal of  was recorded in the first quarter of fiscal due to our decision to re brand a location in the fort collins  colorado area that was closed in and was offset by a  store closure expense related to the closure of our beverly center location in los angeles  california during the second quarter of fiscal the  charge in fiscal was the net effect of an adjustment to store closure reserve of  for the sublease income for a salt lake city  utah location  which closed in  combined with a charge to impairment of  for the closure of our beverly center location in los angeles  california and a  adjustment to anticipated sublease income for a restaurant in the denver  colorado area that closed in an additional reversal of  was recorded in the second quarter of during the fourth quarter of  the company reversed  of the store closure accrual due to a subtenant occupying its space longer than anticipated at the signing of the sublease 
other expense income  net  primarily interest  decreased to expense of  in fiscal  compared with income of  in fiscal and income of  in fiscal the increase in interest expense in was due to lower cash balances and interest accruals related to our class action settlement in addition to the amortization of debt issuance costs incurred in conjunction with the new credit facility we secured during fiscal the decrease in interest income in fiscal  as compared to fiscal  was due to reduced cash balances  as well as lower interest rates 
fiscal has one additional week of interest and investment income as compared with fiscal the provision for income taxes for fiscal  and is based on the approximate annual effective tax rate applied to the respective period s pre tax book income or loss 
our fiscal annual income tax provision rate of consisted of our statutory blended federal and state income tax rate applied against our pre tax book income and decreased for the net impact of various items 
in fiscal  we reduced our statutory state tax rate net of federal benefit to 
although the dollar amount of this one time  unfavorable adjustment for the revaluation of the deferred tax asset was not significant  the impact of the adjustment to the state tax rate was due to our pre tax book income being closer to than in prior years 
we have historically classified interest expense and penalties on income tax liabilities and interest income on income tax refunds as additional income tax expense or benefit  respectively  and will continue to do so under fin our fiscal annual income tax provision rate was favorably impacted by our reversal of approximately  of accrued fin related interest expense as a result of the irs approval of our request for method change and the lapse of the statute of limitations on our federal tax year 
our fiscal annual income tax provision rate of consisted of our statutory blended federal and state income tax rate applied against our pre tax book income and increased for the net impact of various items 
these items included a decrease of for federal tax credits  an increase of for accrued interest under fin  and a one time increase of related to the revaluation of the state deferred tax asset to reflect a revised statutory state tax rate 
our fiscal annual income tax benefit rate of consisted of our statutory blended federal and state income tax rate applied against our pre tax book loss and increased by the benefit of federal and california targeted employment tax credits that were claimed 
seasonality historically  we have experienced seasonal variability in our quarterly operating results with higher sales per restaurant in the second and third quarters than in the first and fourth quarters 
the higher sales in the second and third quarters affect profitability by reducing the impact of our restaurants fixed and partially fixed costs  as a percentage of sales 
this seasonal impact on our operating results is expected to continue 
inflation the primary areas of our operations affected by inflation are food  supply  labor  fuel  lease  utility  insurance costs and materials used in the construction of our restaurants 
substantial increases in costs and expenses  particularly food  supply  labor  fuel and operating expenses could have a significant impact on our operating results to the extent that such increases cannot be passed through to our guests 
our leases require us to pay taxes  maintenance  repairs  insurance and utilities  all of which are subject to inflationary increases 
we believe inflation with respect to food  labor  insurance and utility expenses has had a material impact on our results of operations in  and liquidity and capital resources since we became public in  we have funded our capital requirements through bank debt and cash flows from operations 
we generated million in cash flows from operating activities in fiscal  million in fiscal  and million in fiscal the increase in cash flow from operating activities during fiscal is primarily due to the following first  million in tax refunds resulting primarily from the previously mentioned income tax method change study that allowed us to immediately expense for tax purposes previously capitalized repairs and remodeling expenses  second  the initial payment of million related to a previously settled class action lawsuit and the payment of million in prepaid rent at the end of the fourth quarter of fiscal  third  other changes in operating assets and liabilities  and non cash expenses  including depreciation  amortization and share based compensation  partially offset by decreased net income 
net cash used in investing activities was million in fiscal  compared with million in fiscal and million in fiscal net cash used in investing activities in fiscal was comprised primarily of million in capital expenditures and  in purchases of investments offset by million in proceeds from the sale of investments 
net cash used in investing activities in fiscal was comprised primarily of million in capital expenditures 
net cash used in investing activities in fiscal included million in capital expenditures  million used to reacquire franchised locations  and million in purchases of investments  offset by  in proceeds received from the sale of property and million in proceeds received from the maturities of investments 
the increase in cash used in investing activities for fiscal for capital expenditures was driven by increased new store development activity  offset by proceeds from the release of restricted cash that was collateralizing standby letters of credit 
the reduction in capital expenditures in as compared with was due to the completion of our re imaging program offset by expenditures related to one additional new store opening in compared with during  we re imaged six of our restaurants  as compared with in net cash used in provided by financing activities was net cash used of  in fiscal compared with net cash provided of million in fiscal and net cash provided of million in fiscal net cash used in financing activities during fiscal consisted primarily of  in the payment of debt issuance costs 
net cash provided by financing activities during fiscal consisted of proceeds received from exercises of common stock options of million and excess tax benefits from share based compensation of  net cash provided by financing activities in fiscal also consisted of proceeds from exercises of common stock options and excess tax benefits from share based compensation 
on may   we entered into a million revolving line of credit and a million non revolving line of credit the credit facility with pacific western bank the bank 
the revolving line of credit calls for monthly interest payments  which began june  at a variable interest rate based on the prime rate plus  resulting in an initial rate of 
all outstanding principal plus accrued unpaid interest on the revolving line of credit is due may  the non revolving line of credit calls for each advance to be evidenced by a separate note 
each advance shall have a maximum term of months with an interest rate based on the prime rate plus 
payments on advances shall be interest only for the first nine months  then principal and interest payments monthly 
both lines are collateralized by all of our assets and guaranteed by our subsidiaries 
in addition  both lines require us to maintain our primary depository relationship with the bank and the related accounts are subject to the right of offset for amounts due under the lines 
both lines are subject to certain financial and non financial debt covenants and include a restriction on the payment of dividends without prior consent of the bank 
as of december   we were in compliance with all debt covenants 
at december   we had million of availability under the revolving line of credit  net of million of outstanding letters of credit  and million of availability under the non revolving line of credit 
in  we obtained a letter of credit in the amount of million related to our workers compensation insurance policy 
the letter of credit was subject to automatic one year extensions from the expiration date and thereafter  unless notification was made prior to the expiration date 
in december  this letter of credit was increased to million 
the letter of credit was extended in october we were also required  under the terms of the letters of credit  to pledge collateral of million in during the second quarter of  we issued a standby letter of credit under the credit facility we obtained during the second quarter 
we were not required to pledge collateral for this standby letter of credit and  as a result  during the second quarter of fiscal  we included the million in cash and cash equivalents and terminated the related line of credit agreement 
we currently expect total capital expenditures in to be approximately million to million for restaurant openings  restaurant re imaging  maintenance  and for corporate and information technology 
we currently expect that future locations will generally cost between  per unit  net of tenant improvement allowance and excluding pre opening expenses 
some units may exceed this range due to the area in which they are built and the specific requirements of the project 
pre opening expenses are expected to average between  and  per restaurant  which includes approximately  to  of non cash rent expense during the build out period 
we believe that the anticipated cash flows from operations and the availability on our line of credit agreements  combined with our cash and cash equivalents of million as of december  will be sufficient to satisfy our working capital needs  required capital expenditures and class action settlement obligations for the next months 
we intend to tailor our expansion plan during based on economic conditions  our financial results and our ability to continue to satisfy the covenants contained in the credit facility 
if our financial results drop below our expectations or we are unable to comply with the covenants in the credit facility  we will slow or curtail our expansion plan 
nevertheless  changes in our operating plans  lower than anticipated sales  increased expenses  potential acquisitions or other events may cause us to seek additional or alternative financing sooner than anticipated 
additional or alternative financing may not be available on acceptable terms  or at all 
failure to obtain additional or alternative financing as needed could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 
contractual obligations and commitments the following represents a comprehensive list of our contractual obligations and commitments as of december  payments due by period in thousands total less than year years years after years company operated retail locations and other operating leases settlement of class action lawsuit includes interest at per annum 
impact of recently issued accounting standards in october  the fasb issued staff position fsp no 
 determining the fair value of a financial asset when the market for that asset is not active sfas  which clarifies the application of statement no 
in an inactive market and illustrates how an entity would determine fair value when the market for a financial asset is not active 
sfas is effective immediately and applies to prior periods for which financial statements have not been issued  including interim or annual periods ending on or before december  the implementation of sfas did not have an impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in march  the fasb issued sfas no 
 disclosures about derivative instruments and hedging activities an amendment of fasb statement no 
sfas 
sfas requires entities that utilize derivative instruments to provide qualitative disclosures about their objectives and strategies for using such instruments  as well as any details of credit risk related contingent features contained within derivatives 
sfas also requires entities to disclose additional information about the amounts and location of derivatives located within the financial statements  how the provisions of sfas have been applied  and the impact that hedges have on an entity s financial position  financial performance  and cash flows 
sfas is effective for fiscal years and interim periods beginning after november  we are currently in the process of assessing the impact that sfas will have on the disclosures in the consolidated financial statements 
in february  the fasb issued fsp no

sfas r became effective for us at the beginning of fiscal acquisitions  if any  after the effective date will be accounted for in accordance with sfas r 
in december  the fasb issued statement no 
 noncontrolling interest in consolidated financial statements sfas 
sfas clarifies that a non controlling interest in a subsidiary is an ownership interest in the consolidated entity that should be reported as equity in the consolidated financial statements 
this statement also requires consolidated net income to be reported at amounts that include the amounts attributable to both the parent and the non controlling interest and requires disclosure  on the face of the consolidated statement of income  of the amounts of consolidated net income attributable to the parent and to the non controlling interest 
in addition  this statement establishes a single method of accounting for changes in a parent s ownership interest in a subsidiary that does not result in deconsolidation and requires that a parent recognize a gain or loss in net income when a subsidiary is deconsolidated 
sfas became effective for the company at the beginning of this statement will be applied prospectively  except for the presentation and disclosure requirements  which will be applied retrospectively for all periods presented 
we do not currently have any minority or non controlling interests in a subsidiary and do not expect the adoption of sfas will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our market risk exposures are related to our cash and cash equivalents 
we invest our excess cash in highly liquid short term investments with maturities of less than one year 
the portfolio consists primarily of money market instruments 
as of december   we had no investments with maturities in excess of one year 
these investments are not held for trading or other speculative purposes 
changes in interest rates affect the investment income we earn on our investments and  therefore  impact our cash flows and results of operations 
due to the types of our investments and debt instruments  a change in period end interest rates or a hypothetical basis point adverse change in interest rates would not have a significant negative effect on our financial results 
we are exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates on debt 
our exposure to interest rate fluctuations is limited to our outstanding bank debt 
at december   there were no amounts outstanding under our revolving or non revolving lines of credit 
the revolving line of credit calls for monthly interest payments beginning june  at a variable interest rate based on the prime rate plus  resulting in an initial rate of 
all outstanding principal plus accrued unpaid interest on the revolving line of credit is due may  the non revolving line calls for each advance to be evidenced by a separate note 
each advance shall have a maximum term of months with an interest rate based on the prime rate plus 
interest expense incurred during the weeks ended december  was primarily due to interest accruals related to our class action settlement in addition to the amortization of debt issuance costs incurred in conjunction with the new credit facility we secured during fiscal many of the prices of food products purchased by us are affected by changes in weather  production  availability  seasonality  fuel and energy costs  and other factors outside our control 
in an effort to control some of this risk  we have entered into some fixed price purchase commitments with terms of one year or less 
we do not believe that these purchase commitments are material to our operations as a whole 
in addition  we believe that almost all of our food and supplies are available from several sources 
impact of inflation the primary areas of our operations affected by inflation are food  supplies  labor  fuel  lease  utility  insurance costs and materials used in the construction of our restaurants 
substantial increases in costs and expenses  particularly food  supplies  labor  fuel and operating expenses could have a significant impact on our operating results to the extent that such increases cannot be passed through to our guests 
our leases require us to pay taxes  maintenance  repairs  insurance and utilities  all of which are subject to inflationary increases 
we believe inflation with respect to food  labor  insurance and utility expense has had a material impact on our results of operations in  and
