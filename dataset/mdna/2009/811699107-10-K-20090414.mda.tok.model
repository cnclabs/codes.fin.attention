in addition to historical information  the following discussion and other parts of this report contain forward looking information that involves risks and uncertainties 
our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated by such forward looking information due to a number of factors including risks discussed in item a

these risks could cause our actual results to differ materially from any future performance suggested below 
overview we are a leading developer  manufacturer and marketer of digital video systems and services including  the aggregation  licensing  storage  management and distribution of video  television programming  and advertising content to cable system operators  telecommunications companies and broadcast television companies 
until the end of fiscal  the company was managed and operated as three segments  broadcast  broadband and services 
in its first quarter of fiscal  the company realigned its previously reported segments into three new reporting segments software  servers and storage  and media services as segments defined by sfas no 
 disclosure about segments of an enterprise and related information 
the company believes this reorganization better reflects the increasing importance and magnitude of its software products and services as well as the scale of its odg subsidiary 
a description of the three new reporting segments is as follows software segment includes product revenues from the company s advertising  vod  middleware and broadcast software  related services such as professional services  installation  training  project management  product maintenance  technical support and software development for those software products  and operating expenses relating to the software segment such as research and development  selling and marketing and amortization of intangibles 
servers and storage segment includes product revenues from vod and broadcast server product lines and related services such as professional services  installation  training  project management  product maintenance  and technical support for those products and operating expenses relating to the servers and storage segment  such as research and development and selling and marketing 
media services segment includes the operations of odg including content acquisition  and preparation services for television and wireless network service providers and related operating expenses 
under this revised reporting structure  the company determined there are significant functions  and therefore costs  that are considered corporate expenses and are not allocated to the reportable segments for the purposes of assessing performance and making operating decisions 
these unallocated costs include general and administrative expenses  other than general and administrative expenses related to odg  interest  taxes and equity earnings in affiliates  which are managed separately at the corporate level 
the segment data for the fiscal year ended january  and  respectively  has been recast to reflect the realignment of the new segments 
prior to fiscal  services revenues  which included odg revenues  were reported in the services segment and the company did not separately track these service revenues and costs by these new segments  except for odg 
accordingly  management has made certain assumptions to determine the amount of service revenues and service costs attributed to the software and servers and storage reporting segments for the fiscal years ended january  and  respectively 
the basis of the assumptions for all such revenues  costs and expenses includes significant judgments and estimations 
there are no inter segment revenues for the periods 
the company does not separately track all assets by operating segments nor are the segments evaluated under this criterion 
we have experienced fluctuations in our product revenues from quarter to quarter due to the timing of the receipt of customer orders and the shipment of those orders 
the factors that impact the timing of the receipt of customer orders include among other factors the customer s receipt of authorized signatures on their purchase orders  the budgetary approvals within the customer s company for capital purchases  and the ability to process the purchase order within the customer s organization in a timely manner 
factors that may impact the shipment of customer orders include the availability of material to produce the product  the time required to produce and test the product before delivery  and the customer s required delivery date 
the delay in the timing of receipt and shipment of any one customer order can result in significant fluctuations in our revenue reported on a quarterly basis 
our operating results are significantly influenced by a number of factors  including the mix of products sold and services provided  pricing  costs of materials used in our products and the expansion of our operations during the fiscal year 
we price our products and services based upon our costs and consideration of the prices of competitive products and services in the marketplace 
the costs of our products primarily consist of the costs of components and subassemblies that have generally declined from product introduction to product maturity 
as a result of the growth of our business  our operating expenses have historically increased in the areas of research and development  selling and marketing and administration 
in the current state of the economy  we currently expect that customers may still have limited capital spending budgets as we believe they are dependent on advertising revenues to fund their capital equipment purchases 
accordingly  we expect our financial results to vary from quarter to quarter and our historical financial results are not necessarily indicative of future performance 
in light of the higher proportion of our international business  we expect movements in foreign exchange rates to have a greater impact on our operating results and the equity section of our balance sheet in the future 
our ability to continue to generate revenues within the markets that our products are sold and to generate cash from operations and net income is dependent on several factors which include market acceptance of the products and services offered by our customers and increased subscriber usage and demand for these products and services  selection by our customers of our products and services versus the products and services being offered by our competitors  our ability to introduce new products to the market in a timely manner and to meet the demands of the market for new products and product enhancements  our ability to maintain gross margins from the sale of our products and services at a level that will provide us with cash to fund our operations given the pricing pressures within the market and the costs of materials to manufacture our products  and our ability to control operating costs given the fluctuations that we have experienced with revenues from quarter to quarter 
summary of critical accounting policies  significant judgments and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make significant estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
these items are regularly monitored and analyzed by management for changes in facts and circumstances  and material changes in these estimates could occur in the future 
changes in estimates are recorded in the period in which they become known 
we base our estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from our estimates if past experience or other assumptions do not turn out to be substantially accurate 
we believe that the accounting policies described below are critical to understanding our business  results of operations and financial condition because they involve significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
an accounting policy is deemed to be critical if it requires a judgment or accounting estimate to be made based on assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain  and if different estimates that could have been used  or if changes in the accounting estimates that are reasonably likely to occur periodically  could materially impact our consolidated financial statements 
other significant accounting policies  primarily those with lower levels of uncertainty than those discussed below  are also critical to understanding our consolidated financial statements 
the notes to our consolidated financial statements contain additional information related to our accounting policies and should be read in conjunction with this discussion 
principles of consolidation 
the company consolidates the financial statements of its wholly owned subsidiaries and all inter company accounts are eliminated in consolidation 
seachange also holds minority investments in the capital stock of certain private companies having product offerings or customer relationships that have strategic importance 
the company evaluates its equity and debt investments and other contractual relationships with affiliate companies in order to determine whether the guidelines of fasb interpretation fin no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities fin r  as revised under fin r should be applied in the financial statements 
fin r addresses consolidation by business enterprises of variable interest entities that possess certain characteristics 
a variable interest entity vie is defined as an entity in which equity investors do not have the characteristics of a controlling financial interest or do not have sufficient equity at risk for the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support 
the primary beneficiary is required to consolidate the financial position and results of the vie 
the company has concluded that it is not the primary beneficiary for any variable interest entities as of january  the company s investments in affiliates include investments accounted for under the cost method and the equity method of accounting 
the investments that represent less than a ownership interest of the common shares of the affiliate are carried at cost 
under the equity method of accounting  which generally applies to investments that represent to ownership of the common shares of the affiliate  seachange s proportionate ownership share of the earnings or losses of the affiliate are included in equity income loss in earnings of affiliates in the consolidated statement of operations 
we periodically review indicators of the fair value of our investments in affiliates in order to assess whether available facts or circumstances  both internally and externally  may suggest an other than temporary decline in the value of the investment 
the carrying value of an investment in an affiliate may be affected by the affiliate s ability to obtain adequate funding and execute its business plans  general market conditions  industry considerations specific to the affiliate s business  and other factors 
the inability of an affiliate to obtain future funding or successfully execute its business plan could adversely affect our equity earnings of the affiliate in the periods affected by those events 
future adverse changes in market conditions or poor operating results of the affiliates could result in equity losses or an inability to recover the carrying value of the investments in affiliates that may not be reflected in an investment s current carrying value  thereby possibly requiring an impairment charge in the future 
we record an impairment charge when we believe an investment has experienced a decline in value that is other than temporary 
revenue recognition and allowance for doubtful accounts 
the accounting related to revenue recognition is complex and affected by interpretations of the rules and an understanding of industry practices 
as a result  revenue recognition accounting rules require us to make significant judgments 
revenues from sales of hardware  software and systems that do not require significant modification or customization of the underlying software are recognized when title and risk of loss has passed to the customer  there is evidence of an arrangement  fees are fixed or determinable and collection of the related receivable is considered probable 
customers are billed for installation  training  project management and at least one year of product maintenance and technical support at the time of the product sale 
revenue from these activities are deferred at the time of the product sale and recognized ratably over the period these services are performed 
revenue from ongoing product maintenance and technical support agreements are recognized ratably over the period of the related agreements 
revenue from software development contracts that include significant modification or customization  including software product enhancements  is recognized based on the percentage of completion contract accounting method using labor efforts expended in relation to estimates of total labor efforts to complete the contract 
for contracts  where some level of profit is assured but the company is only able to estimate ranges of amounts of total contract revenue and total contract cost  the company uses the lowest probable level of profits in accounting for the contract revenues and costs 
accounting for contract amendments and customer change orders are included in contract accounting when executed 
revenue from shipping and handling costs and other out of pocket expenses reimbursed by customers are included in revenues and cost of revenues 
our share of inter company profits associated with sales and services provided to affiliated companies is eliminated in consolidation in proportion to our equity ownership 
our transactions frequently involve the sales of hardware  software  systems and services in multiple element arrangements 
revenues under multiple element arrangements are recorded based on the residual method of accounting 
under this method  the total arrangement value is allocated first to undelivered elements  based on their fair values  with the remainder being allocated to the delivered elements 
where fair value of undelivered service elements has not been established  the total arrangement value is recognized over the period during which the services are performed 
the amounts allocated to undelivered elements  which may include project management  training  installation  maintenance and technical support and hardware and software components  are based upon the price charged when these elements are sold separately and unaccompanied by the other elements 
the amount allocated to installation  training and project management revenue is based upon standard hourly billing rates and the estimated time required to complete the service 
these services are not essential to the functionality of systems as these services do not alter the equipment s capabilities  are available from other vendors and the systems are standard products 
for multiple element arrangements that include software development with significant modification or customization and systems sales where vendor specific objective evidence of the fair value does not exist for the undelivered elements of the arrangement other than maintenance and technical support  percentage of completion accounting is applied for revenue recognition purposes to the entire arrangement with the exception of maintenance and technical support 
we recognize revenue for product and services only in those situations where collection from the customer is probable 
the company performs ongoing credit evaluations of customers financial condition but generally does not require collateral 
for some international customers  the company may require an irrevocable letter of credit to be issued by the customer before the purchase order is accepted 
the company monitors payments from customers and assesses any collection issues 
the company maintains allowances for specific doubtful accounts and other risk categories of accounts based on estimates of losses resulting from the inability of the company s customers to make required payments and records these allowances as a charge to general and administrative expenses 
the company bases its allowances for doubtful accounts on historical collections and write off experience  current trends  credit assessments  and other analysis of specific customer situations 
while such credit losses have historically been within our expectations and the allowances established  we cannot guarantee that we will continue to experience the same credit loss rates that we have in the past 
if the financial condition of our customers were to change  additional allowances may be required or established allowances may be considered unnecessary 
judgment is required in making these determinations and our failure to accurately estimate the losses for doubtful accounts and ensure that payments are received on a timely basis could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
any taxes assessed by a governmental authority related to revenue producing transactions eg sales or value added taxes are reported on a net basis and excluded from revenues 
inventories and reserves 
inventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value 
cost is determined using the first in  first out fifo method 
inventories consist primarily of components and subassemblies and finished products held for sale 
all of seachange s hardware components are purchased from outside vendors 
the value of inventories are reviewed quarterly to determine that the carrying value is stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value 
seachange records charges to reduce inventory to its net realizable value when impairment is identified through the quarterly review process 
for inventory that has been written down to its net realizable value  the reserve is released upon sale or disposal of this inventory 
the obsolescence evaluation is based upon assumptions and estimates about future demand and possible alternative uses and involves significant judgments 
for the years ended january    and  we recorded inventory write downs of million  million  and million 
goodwill and long lived assets 
the company accounts for business acquisitions in accordance with sfas no 
 business combinations  which requires that the purchase method of accounting be used for all business combinations 
the company determines and records the fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed as of the dates of acquisition 
the company recognizes the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net assets acquired as goodwill 
at the time of acquisition  goodwill is assigned to the operating segment as the applicable reporting unit for the goodwill impairment review 
goodwill is not amortized  but is evaluated for impairment  at the reporting unit level  annually in the third fiscal quarter 
goodwill of a reporting unit also is tested for impairment on an interim basis in addition to the annual evaluation if an event occurs or circumstances change such as declines in sales  earnings or cash flows  decline in our stock price  or material adverse changes in the business climate  which would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount 
the process of evaluating goodwill for impairment requires several judgments and assumptions to be made to determine the fair value of the reporting units  including the method used to determine fair value  discount rates  expected levels of cash flows  revenues and earnings  and the selection of comparable companies used to develop market based assumptions 
in the third quarter of fiscal  the company changed the timing of its annual goodwill impairment testing for its media services reporting unit from october  to august  this change did not delay  accelerate or avoid an impairment charge 
seachange completed the annual impairment tests of goodwill associated with the software  servers and storage and media services segments and determined that as of august  no adjustment was required to the carrying value of goodwill based on the analyses performed 
however  there can be no assurance that goodwill will not become impaired in future periods 
seachange also evaluates property and equipment  intangible assets and other long lived assets on a regular basis for the existence of facts or circumstances  both internal and external that may suggest an asset is not recoverable 
if such circumstances exist  seachange evaluates the carrying value of long lived assets to determine if impairment exists based upon estimated undiscounted future cash flows over the remaining useful life of the assets and compares that value to the carrying value of the assets 
seachange s cash flow estimates contain management s best estimates  using appropriate and customary assumptions and projections at the time 
intangible assets consist of customer contracts  completed technology  patents and trademarks and are respectively assigned to the operating segments 
the intangible assets are amortized to cost of sales and operating expenses  as appropriate  on a straight line or accelerated basis in order to reflect the period that the assets will be consumed 
seachange develops software for resale in markets that are subject to rapid technological change  new product development and changing customer needs 
the time period during which software development costs can be capitalized from the point of reaching technological feasibility until the time of general product release is very short  and consequently  the amounts that could be capitalized are not material to the company s financial position or results of operations 
software development costs relating to sales of software requiring significant modification or customization are charged to costs of product revenues 
during fiscal  the company determined that purchased capitalized software licenses that were classified as other assets on the company s condensed consolidated balance sheets were impaired as of july   resulting in a reduction to other assets of million and a corresponding increase to cost of revenues on the company s consolidated statement of operations for the year ended january  the company concluded that three separate capitalized software licenses that were purchased for eventual use in current and future products of the company were impaired based on its determination that triggering events had occurred during fiscal that warranted consideration of an impairment of long lived assets 
the company abandoned plans to use the capitalized software licenses in any new or existing company products during fiscal with no identified future cash flows to substantiate further capitalization of these software licenses  the company determined these assets to be impaired during the fiscal year ended january  amortization expense is recorded over the period of economic consumption or the life of the agreement  whichever results in the higher expense  starting with the first shipment of the product to a customer 
amortization expense was  million  and  for the fiscal years ended january    and  respectively 
of the million fiscal year amortization  million includes accelerated amortization taken in the second quarter to align the recognition of amortization expense with the remaining economic life of the purchased software 
accounting for income taxes 
as part of the process of preparing our financial statements  we are required to estimate our provision for income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process involves estimating our actual current tax exposure  including assessing the risks associated with tax audits  together with assessing temporary differences resulting from the different treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included within our balance sheet 
deferred income tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective income tax bases  and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards 
we evaluate the weight of all available evidence to determine whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred income tax assets will not be realized 
we will record a valuation allowance if the likelihood of realization of the deferred tax assets in the future is reduced based on an evaluation of objective verifiable evidence 
significant management judgment is required in determining our income tax expense benefit  our deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against our deferred tax assets 
we have established a valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets due to indications that they may not be fully realized 
the amount of the deferred tax asset considered realizable is subject to change based on future events  including generating sufficient pre tax income in future periods 
in the event that actual results differ from these estimates  our provision for income taxes could be materially impacted 
seachange does not provide for us federal and state income taxes on the undistributed earnings of its non us subsidiaries that are considered indefinitely reinvested in the operations outside the us income tax contingencies 
in july  the fasb issued interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes fin 
fin supersedes sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies  as it relates to income tax liabilities and lowers the minimum threshold a tax position is required to meet before being recognized in the financial statements from probable to more likely than not ie  a likelihood of occurrence greater than fifty percent 
under fin  the recognition threshold is met when an entity concludes that a tax position  based solely on its technical merits  is more likely than not to be sustained upon examination by the relevant taxing authority 
those tax positions failing to qualify for initial recognition are recognized in the first interim period in which they meet the more likely than not standard  or are resolved through negotiation or litigation with the taxing authority  or upon expiration of the statute of limitations 
derecognition of a tax position that was previously recognized occurs when an entity subsequently determines that a tax position no longer meets the more likely than not threshold of being sustained 
fin was adopted by the company on february  share based compensation 
we account for all employee and non employee director stock based compensation awards using the provisions of sfas no 
revised  share based payment sfas r 
we have continued to use the black scholes pricing model as the most appropriate method for determining the estimated fair value of all applicable awards 
determining the appropriate fair value model and calculating the fair value of share based payment awards requires the input of highly subjective assumptions  including the expected life of the share based payment awards and stock price volatility 
management estimated the volatility based on the historical volatility of our stock 
the assumptions used in calculating the fair value of share based payment awards represent management s best estimates  but these estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of management s judgment 
as a result  if circumstances change and we use different assumptions  our share based compensation expense could be materially different in the future 
in addition  we are required to estimate the expected forfeiture rate and only recognize expense for those shares expected to vest 
if our actual forfeiture rate is materially different from our estimate  the share based compensation expense could be significantly different from what we have recorded in the current period 
the estimated fair value of seachange s stock based options and performance based restricted stock units  less expected forfeitures  is amortized over the awards vesting period on a graded vesting basis  whereas the restricted stock units and employee stock purchase plan stock units are amortized on a straight line basis 
foreign currency translation 
we have determined that the functional currency of all of our foreign subsidiaries  other than odg and its wholly owned subsidiaries  is the us dollar 
where the us dollar is designated as the functional currency of an entity  we translate that entity s monetary assets and liabilities denominated in local currencies into us dollars the functional and reporting currency at current exchange rates  as of each balance sheet date 
nonmonetary assets eg  inventories  property  plant  and equipment and intangible assets and related income statement accounts eg  cost of sales  depreciation  amortization of intangible assets are translated at historical exchange rates between the functional currency the us dollar and the local currency 
revenue and other expense items are translated using average exchange rates during the fiscal period 
translation adjustments and transactions gains and losses on foreign currency transactions  and any unrealized gains and losses on short term inter company transactions are included in other income or expense  net 
for the odg group where the local currency is designated as the functional currency  we translate its assets and liabilities into us dollars the reporting currency at current exchange rates as of each balance sheet date 
revenue and expense items are translated using average exchange rates during the period 
cumulative translation adjustments are presented as a separate component of stockholders equity 
exchange gains and losses on foreign currency transactions and unrealized gains and losses on short term inter company transactions are included in other income or expense  net 
the aggregate foreign exchange transaction losses included as other expense income  net on the consolidated statement of operations were   and  for the years ended january   and  respectively 
fiscal year ended january  compared to the fiscal year ended january  the following table sets forth summarized consolidated financial information for each of the two fiscal years ended january  and year ended january  in thousands revenues products   services   costs and expenses cost of product revenues   cost of service revenues   research and development   selling and marketing   general and administrative   amortization of intangibles   income loss from operations   interest income  net   other expense income  net gain on sale of investment in affiliate  income before income taxes and equity income in earnings of affiliates income tax expense  equity loss income in earnings of affiliates  net of tax net income loss   revenues the following table summarizes information about the company s reportable segments for each of the two fiscal years ended january  and segment data for fiscal is presented on a basis consistent with the fiscal data and the changed reporting data segment structure

product revenue increased to million in the fiscal year ended january  from million in the fiscal year ended january  product revenues from the software segment accounted for and of the total product revenues in the years ended january  and  respectively 
the servers and storage segment accounted for and of total product revenues in the fiscal years ended january  and  respectively 
service revenue 
service revenues increased to million in the fiscal year ended january  from million in the fiscal year ended january  services revenue for the software segment accounted for and of the total services revenue in the fiscal years ended january  and  respectively 
servers and storage services revenue accounted for and of total services revenue in the fiscal year ended january  and  respectively  while media services revenue accounted for and of total services revenue for the fiscal years ended january  and  respectively 
for the fiscal year ended january   two customers each accounted for more than and collectively accounted for of our total revenues and these same two customers each accounted for more than and collectively accounted for of our total revenues for the year ended january  revenues from these customers were primarily in the software and servers and storage segment 
we believe that a significant amount of our revenues will continue to be derived from a limited number of customers 
international products and services revenues accounted for approximately or million and or million of total revenues in the fiscal years ended january  and  respectively 
we expect that international products and services revenues will remain a significant portion of our business in the future 
a majority of our international sales are made in united states dollars usd  and for the fiscal years and  approximately and  of international revenues were transacted in usd 
media services has designated the great britain pound gbp as its functional currency 
for the fiscal years and  approximately and  respectively of the media services revenues were sales in gbp and and  respectively were made in euros 
during the third and fourth quarter of fiscal  media services financial results were translated to usd for reporting purposes  and the depreciation of the gbp compared to the usd has impacted the amount of revenue recorded by our media services during fiscal we will continue to have exposure to fluctuations in the usd gbp and euro exchange rates on our revenue each quarter for the media services segment 
software revenue 
revenues from our software segment increased to million in the fiscal year ended january  from million in the fiscal year ended january  the year over year growth was primarily due to increased software licensing revenue from shipments of advertising insertion  axiom  vodlink  media client and our vod hospitality software products which were partially offset by million of lower software subscription revenues from comcast 
the increase in service revenue for the software segment was primarily due to higher advertising and vod product maintenance revenues from a growing installed base of products and installation revenue from the completion of several large projects during fiscal servers and storage revenue 
revenues from the server and storage segment increased to million for the fiscal year ended january  from for the fiscal year ended january  the increase in product revenues of compared to the previous year was due primarily to higher vod server revenue from increased shipments of our new flash servers during our fourth quarter of fiscal the year over year increase in services revenue in the servers and storage segment is due to increased installation revenue from vod and broadcast servers products year over year 
media services revenue 
revenues from media services decreased to million in the year ended january  compared to the year ended january  the decrease in revenue was due primarily to the impact of the weakening of gbp compared to the usd during fiscal compared to the previous year 
valued at a constant usd gbp exchange rate  odg increased revenue year over year by with two additional customers in europe 
product gross profit 
costs of product revenues consist primarily of the cost of purchased material components and subassemblies  labor and overhead relating to the final assembly and testing of complete systems and related expenses  and labor and overhead costs related to software development contracts 
the gross profit percentage for products increased from in the fiscal year ended january  to in the fiscal year ended january  the increase in product gross profit percentages between years were primarily due to higher sales volume related margin from our advertising insertion  axiom  vodlink and our vod hospitality software products 
in addition  the company recorded a charge of million in connection with asset impairments taken during fiscal which significantly lowered our fiscal product gross margin 
services gross profit 
cost of services revenues consist primarily of labor  materials and overhead relating to the installation  training  product maintenance and technical support  software development  project management and costs associated with providing media services 
costs of services revenues increased from million in the fiscal year ended january  to million in the fiscal year ended january  while our service gross profit percentage was relatively flat year over year 
the increase in the cost of service of million was due to increased headcount related costs to service our increased installed base of systems 
software gross profit 
software segment gross margin was and in the years ended january  and  respectively 
the increase in product gross profit percentages between years is due mainly to a favorable product mix of higher margin advertising insertion and vod software product revenue in the fiscal year ended january  compared to the fiscal year ended january   as well as the asset impairments taken in fiscal year servers and storage gross profit 
servers and storage segment gross margin of in the years ended january  was six points higher than in the year ended january  because of increased shipment of higher margin vod flash servers and lower manufacturing costs due to headcount and other cost reductions taken in fiscal year media services gross profit 
media services segment gross margin of in the year ended january  was two points lower than in the year ended january  due principally to higher year over year higher headcount related expenses to support additional revenue 
research and development 
research and development expenses consist primarily of the compensation of development personnel  depreciation of development and test equipment and an allocation of related facilities expenses 
research and development expenses were and of total revenues for fiscal year ended january  and  respectively  and increased  year over year 
the increase is primarily due to higher software related headcount and related expenses of  offset by lower contract labor of  we expect that research and development expenses will continue to increase in the fiscal year ended january  as we continue our development of our new products and enhancements 
selling and marketing 
selling and marketing expenses consist primarily of compensation expenses  including sales commissions  travel expenses and certain promotional expenses 
selling and marketing expenses increased from million or of total revenues in the fiscal year ended january  to million  or of total revenues  in the fiscal year ended january  this increase in total expenses is primarily due to million in increased salaries and benefits attributable to the hiring of additional sales and marketing employees  increased commissions of approximately million due to higher revenues and distributor commissions of  offset by lower trade show expenses 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses consist primarily of the compensation of executive  finance  human resource and administrative personnel  legal and accounting services and an allocation of related facilities expenses 
in the fiscal year ended january   general and administrative expenses of million  or of total revenues  increased from million  or of total revenues  in the fiscal year ended january  general and administrative expenses increased approximately  due to higher general and administrative expenses at odg of  primarily due to higher headcount  higher bad debt expense of  offset by lower accounting fees 
amortization of intangibles 
amortization expense consists of the amortization of acquired intangible assets which are operating expenses and not considered costs of revenues 
amortization of intangible assets decreased from million in the fiscal year ended january  to million in the fiscal year ended january  due primarily to the sale of the company s equity investment in filmflex and the related intangible assets in fiscal amortization is also based on the future economic value of the related intangible assets which is generally higher in earlier years of the assets lives 
the table below classifies the amortization expense by its source category  sales and marketing or general and administrative expense 
year ended january  in thousands sales and marketing expense   general and administrative expense amortization expense   an additional  and  of amortization expense related to acquired technology was charged to cost of sales for the years ended january  and  respectively 
interest income  net 
interest income  net was million in the fiscal year ended january  and million in the fiscal year ended january  the increase in interest income is primarily due to the increase in average cash balance in fiscal compared to fiscal other expense income  net 
with the exception of odg  and its wholly owned subsidiaries  the us dollar is the functional currency for our international subsidiaries  therefore all foreign currency translation gains and losses are included in consolidated statements of operations 
the increase in foreign exchange losses was a result of the increased strength of the usd against the foreign currencies held by our subsidiaries in the second half of fiscal compared to fiscal in light of the high proportion of our international businesses  we expect the risk of any adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates could have an impact on our translated results within the consolidated statements of operations 
gain on sale of investment in affiliate 
the gain of million was the result the sale of our equity investment in filmflex during the fourth quarter of fiscal equity income in earnings of affiliates 
equity loss in earnings of affiliates was  in the fiscal year ended january  compared with million in income for fiscal year ended january  the equity income loss in earnings of affiliates consists of our proportionate ownership share of the net income loss under the equity method of accounting 
for fiscal year  the losses consisted of our ownership share in our german joint venture  on demand deutschland gmbh co 
kg 
for fiscal until december  when we sold filmflex  the equity income in earnings of affiliates consisted of our proportionate ownership share of the earnings of filmflex and the losses of on demand deutschland gmbh co 
kg 
income tax provision benefit 
our effective tax rate and income tax provision for fiscal was and  respectively compared to an effective tax rate of and million respectively for the fiscal year ended january  the decrease in the effective tax rate was due to the reduction of our valuation allowance from the utilization in fiscal of a million foreign tax credit attributable to the taxable gain from the sale of our equity investment in filmflex during fiscal in addition  the fiscal tax rate was also reduced for the entitlement and claim of the benefit for a refundable research and development credit of  as a result of the tax stimulus package passed by the us congress in for the fiscal year  the income tax provision was primarily attributable to the taxable gains recorded for odg s transfer of assets to and the reimbursement of previously paid costs from on demand deutschland gmbh co 
kg and to the sale of our equity investment in filmflex 
at january  and  we provided a valuation allowance for the full amount of net deferred tax assets due to the uncertainty of realization of those assets

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we face exposure to financial market risks  including adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates and changes in interest rates 
these exposures may change over time as business practices evolve and could have a material adverse impact on our financial results 
our foreign currency exchange exposure is primarily associated with product sales arrangements  european and asian repatriation or settlement of intercompany payables and receivables among subsidiaries and its parent company  and or investment equity contingency considerations denominated in the local currency where the functional currency of the foreign subsidiary is the us dollar 
substantially all of our international product sales are payable in united states dollars usd or in the case of our odg  and its wholly owned subsidiaries  have operations service sales  payable in gbp  and provide a natural hedge for receipts and local payments 
in light of the high proportion of our international businesses  we expect the risk of any adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates could have an impact on our translated results within the combined statements of financial position and operations 
for the fiscal year ended january   the company s odg operations in the united kingdom generated a foreign currency translation loss of million which was recorded as accumulated other comprehensive loss reducing the company s equity section of the balance sheet over the prior period 
the carrying amounts reflected in the consolidated balance sheet of cash and cash equivalents  short term marketable securities  trade receivables and trade payables approximate fair value at january  due to the short maturities of these instruments 
we maintain investment portfolio holdings of various issuers  types  and maturities 
our cash and marketable securities include cash equivalents  which we consider to be investments purchased with original maturities of three months or less 
given the short maturities and investment grade quality of the portfolio holdings at january   a sharp rise in interest rates should not have a material adverse impact on the fair value of our investment portfolio 
additionally  our long term marketable investments  have fixed interest rates  and therefore are not subject to any interest rate exposure
