item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
overview our profitability is primarily attributable to the sale of water by artesian water 
gross water sales comprises of total operating revenues  the amount of which is subject to seasonal fluctuations  particularly during summer when water demand may vary with rainfall and temperature 
in the event temperatures during the typically warmer months are cooler than expected  or rainfall is greater than expected  the demand for water may decrease and our revenues may be adversely affected 
we believe the effects of weather are short term and do not materially affect the execution of our strategic initiatives 
our water sales revenues were affected in and by rate increases approved by the depsc 
artesian water  artesian water maryland and artesian water pennsylvania provide water service to residential  commercial  industrial  governmental  municipal and utility customers 
our largest operating subsidiary  artesian water  accounted for approximately of our total operating revenues in and serves approximately of delaware s total population 
in october  artesian water maryland signed an agreement with cecil county to purchase four water facilities  with closing expected to occur by june  in december  the mdpsc approved an application for artesian water maryland to construct a water system from the delaware state line  interconnecting with the artesian water system  to the town of elkton 
the town of elkton desired an additional source of water supply 
artesian wastewater  owns wastewater infrastructure and began providing wastewater services in delaware in july artesian wastewater maryland was incorporated on june  to provide regulated wastewater services in the state of maryland 
in october  artesian wastewater maryland signed two asset purchase agreements with cecil county to purchase four wastewater facilities in maryland 
closings on these transactions are expected to occur on or before june  our wastewater customers are billed a flat monthly fee  which contributes to providing a revenue stream unaffected by weather 
artesian utility provides contract water and wastewater operation services to private  municipal and governmental institutions in the southeastern part of pennsylvania 
artesian utility currently operates a million gallon per day wastewater facility for middletown under a year contract that expires on february  artesian utility also operates an approximately  gallon per day wastewater facility in middletown 
in addition  we operate an additional wastewater facility in middletown in order to support the million gallon per day wastewater facility described above 
on june   artesian utility signed an agreement with northern sussex regional water recycling complex  llc  or nsrwrc  for the design  construction and operation of the northern sussex regional water recycling complex  a wastewater treatment facility to be located in sussex county  delaware 
nsrwrc was created for the purpose of developing the treatment facility site  which once constructed  will be operated by artesian wastewater 
artesian development owns an approximately six acre parcel of land zoned for office buildings located immediately adjacent to our corporate headquarters 
in  artesian development purchased approximately eighteen acres of land  in sussex county  to construct an office facility  a water treatment plant and a wastewater facility 
artesian consulting provides engineering services to developers for residential and commercial development 
the acquisition of meridian in june included the assignment of certain current contract agreements to provide engineering services to developers and includes services to be provided to artesian water 

table of contents in addition to services discussed above  artesian resources initiated a water service line protection plan  or wslp plan  in march the wslp plan covers all parts  material and labor required to repair or replace participants leaking water service lines up to an annual limit 
as of december   approximately  or  of our  eligible water customers had signed up for the wslp plan 
the wslp plan was expanded in the second quarter of to include maintenance or repair to customers sewer lines 
this plan  sewer service line protection plan  or sslp plan  covers all parts  material and labor required to repair or replace participants leaking or clogged sewer lines up to an annual limit 
as of december   approximately  or  of our  eligible customers had signed up for the sslp plan 
while water sales revenues are our primary source of revenues  we continue to explore and develop relationships with developers and municipalities in order to increase revenues from contract water operations and wastewater management services 
our contract operations and wastewater management services provide a revenue stream that is not affected by changes in weather patterns 
we plan to continue developing and expanding our contract operations and wastewater services in a manner that complements our growth in water service to new customers 
our anticipated growth in these areas is subject to changes in residential and commercial construction  which may be affected by interest rates  inflation and general housing and economic market conditions 
as a result of the general economic downturn  we my not be able to increase our contract operations and wastewater services at the rate we had previously expected 
we will continue to focus attention on expanding our contract operations opportunities with municipalities and private water providers in delaware and surrounding areas 
ensuring our customers have a dependable supply of safe  high quality water has been  and will continue to be  our highest priority 
in  delaware passed legislation requiring all water utilities to certify by july  and each three years thereafter  that they had sufficient sources of self supply to serve their respective systems 
on march   we filed our certification of self sufficiency of supply with the depsc 
the review was completed on june   and the depsc concluded that we demonstrated that we had sufficient water supply to meet the demands of our customers through in addition and as required by law  on june   we filed with the depsc a new certification of self sufficiency for the period through after completion of their review  on july   the depsc accepted our certification of sufficient water supply through as required  we will file a new certification of self sufficiency with the depsc by june   for the period through water industry the federal environmental protection agency s september report states that the united states water industry is comprised of approximately  community water systems  of which serve less than  customers 
there are currently publicly traded water utilities based in the united states 
the rest are privately or municipally owned systems 
the water industry is capital intensive  with the highest capital investment in plant and equipment per dollar of revenue among all utilities 
increasingly stringent drinking water regulations to meet the requirements of the safe drinking water act of have required the water industry to invest in more advanced treatment systems and processes  which require a heightened level of expertise 
we are currently in full compliance with the requirements of the safe drinking water act 
even though our water utility was founded in  the majority of our investment in infrastructure occurred in the last years 
we believe that delaware s generally lower cost of living in the region  availability of development sites in relatively close proximity to the atlantic ocean in sussex county  and attractive financing rates for construction and mortgages have resulted  and will continue to result  in increases to our customer base 
substantial portions of delaware are currently not served by a public water system  which could also assist in an increase to our customer base as systems are added 
according to the us census bureau  delaware s population increased an estimated from to  as compared to the nationwide growth rate of approximately 
general economic conditions  particularly in the housing market  resulted in a much lower rate of new customer additions than experienced in many years 
interest rates for mortgages have fallen from on average in december to through december long term interest rates for our recent first mortgage bond issuance see note to our financial statements reflect a similar trend  as we were able to reduce our overall weighted cost of debt from in to at the end of 
table of contents wastewater industry the federal environmental protection agency s september report states that over of the united states population is served by centralized wastewater collection and treatment systems  the remaining of the population uses decentralized wastewater treatment systems  or on site systems 
approximately  municipal wastewater treatment facilities are in operation in the united states 
approximately  people are served by publicly owned wastewater treatment facilities in delaware  with an estimated growth to approximately  approximately  people are served by publicly owned wastewater treatment facilities in cecil county  maryland  with an estimated growth to approximately  the clean water act has established the foundation for wastewater discharge control in the united states 
the clean water act established a control program for ensuring that communities have clean water by regulating the release of contaminants into waterways 
permits that limit the amounts of pollutants discharged are required of all wastewater dischargers under the national pollutant discharge elimination system permit program 
the clean water act also requires that wastewater treatment plant discharges meet a minimum of secondary treatment 
the secondary treatment process can remove up to of the organic matter in wastewater 
over of the wastewater treatment facilities produce cleaner discharges by providing even greater levels of treatment 
we operate environmentally friendly wastewater systems that meet or exceed all requirements of federal  state and local standards 
the federal environmental protection agency s september clean watersheds needs survey report estimates that nationwide capital investment needs for wastewater pollution control in the united states is billion for wastewater treatment and collection systems 
the increase in overall national needs is due to a combination of population growth  more protective water quality standards  and aging infrastructure 
our capital plan for the next five years includes projects for wastewater treatment plant improvements  additions and acquisitions in both delaware and maryland 
capital improvements are planned and budgeted to meet anticipated changes in regulations and needs for increased capacity related to projected growth 
the depsc and mdpsc have generally recognized the operating and capital costs associated with these improvements in setting wastewater rates for current customers and capacity charges for new customers 
strategic direction our strategy is to significantly increase customer growth  revenues  earnings and dividends by expanding our water and wastewater services across the delmarva peninsula 
we remain focused on providing superior service to our customers and continuously seeking ways to improve our efficiency and performance 
by providing both water and wastewater services  we are positioned as the primary resource for developers and communities throughout the delmarva peninsula seeking to fill both needs simultaneously 
we have a proven ability to acquire and integrate high growth  established utilities  through which we have captured additional service territories that will serve as a base for future revenue 
we have completed four acquisitions during the past two years  to include our integration of their operations  infrastructure  technology and employees 
we believe this experience presents a strong platform for further expansion and that our success to date also produces positive relationships and credibility with regulators  municipalities  developers and customers in both existing and prospective service areas 
in our regulated water division  our strategy is to focus on a wide spectrum of activities  which include identifying new and dependable sources of supply  developing the wells  treatment plants and delivery systems to get water to customers and educating customers on the wise use of water 
our strategy includes focusing our efforts to expand in new regions added to our delaware service territory over the last years  where growth is strong and demand is increasing 
in addition  we believe growth will be developed in the maryland counties on the delmarva peninsula 
we plan to expand our regulated water service area in the cecil county designated growth corridor and to expand our business through the design  construction  operation and management  as well as acquisition  of additional water systems 
the expansion of our exclusive franchise areas elsewhere in maryland and the award of additional contracts will similarly enhance our operations within the state 

table of contents we believe the effects of weather are short term and do not materially affect the execution of our strategic initiatives 
as we anticipated  our initiatives south of the chesapeake delaware canal  or the c d canal  have provided for nearly all of our customer growth in artesian water  providing approximately of our growth in customers in we expect continued growth in these regions 
this shift in growth is primarily the result of the build out of our service area in northern new castle county 
in  we increased our customer base by and increased our service territory by approximately square miles 
we have also expanded the provision of our services into maryland 
cecil county has designated the interstate corridor as a preferred growth area for business and residential expansion 
recently  the federal base re alignment and closure commission announced the relocation of approximately  jobs to nearby aberdeen  maryland by the wilmington metropolitan area planning commission projects cecil county will grow between and and the maryland department of planning projects that cecil county will experience the highest rate of household growth through of any jurisdiction in the state 
artesian water maryland signed an agreement in october with cecil county for the purchase of specific water facilities  which is expected to close by june  once completed  this will add four water facilities to our service area 
we continue to increase our sources of supply to assure we have adequate high quality water supply to meet our customer growth expectations in all of the states in which we provide water 
in our regulated wastewater division  we foresee significant growth opportunities and will continue to seek strategic partnerships and relationships with developers and municipalities to complement existing agreements for the provision of wastewater service in delaware  maryland and the surrounding areas 
artesian wastewater completed an agreement with georgetown  delaware in july to provide wastewater treatment and disposal services for georgetown s growth and annexation areas 
artesian wastewater will provide up to mgd of wastewater capacity for the town within the next years 
artesian wastewater maryland signed two agreements in october with cecil county for the purchase of specific wastewater facilities  which are expected to close by june  once completed  these acquisitions will add four wastewater facilities to our service area 
we will continue to seek acquisitions of water and wastewater contract operations on the delmarva peninsula 
the purchase of water and wastewater operations agreements assists in our expansion efforts in water and wastewater activity 
we will continue to expand our contract design and construction services of water and wastewater facilities for developers  municipalities and other utilities and will continue to actively pursue water and wastewater operation contracts with municipalities across the delmarva peninsula 
in our non regulated division  we are actively pursuing opportunities to expand our contract operations in southern delaware 
artesian development purchased eighteen acres of land  also located in sussex county  delaware  which will allow for construction of an office facility  water treatment facility and wastewater treatment facility 
artesian consulting continues to provide engineering services to design on site and off site water and wastewater systems for developers as demand increases 
also  with the expansion efforts in our water and wastewater divisions  artesian consulting will provide increased design and engineering services 
regulatory matters and inflation our water and wastewater utility operations are subject to regulation by their respective state regulatory commissions  which have broad administrative power and authority to regulate rates charged for service  determine franchise areas and conditions of service  approve acquisitions  authorize the issuance of securities and other matters 
the profitability of our utility operations is influenced to a great extent by the timeliness and adequacy of rate allowances we are granted by the respective regulatory commissions or authorities in the states in which we operate 

table of contents we are subject to regulation by the following state regulatory commissions the depsc regulates both artesian water and artesian wastewater  artesian water maryland and artesian wastewater maryland are subject to the regulatory jurisdiction of the mdpsc  and artesian water pennsylvania is subject to the regulatory jurisdiction of the papuc 
as of december   we had approximately  metered water customers and wastewater customers in delaware  and served a population of approximately  including contract services  representing approximately of delaware s total population 
increases in the number of customers served by artesian water and artesian wastewater contributed to a portion of the increase in our operating revenues 
water customers increased by approximately  while wastewater customers increased by approximately our regulated utilities periodically seek rate increases to cover the cost of increased operating expenses  increased financing expenses due to additional investments in utility plant and other costs of doing business 
in delaware  utilities are permitted by law to place rates into effect  under bond  on a temporary basis pending completion of a rate increase proceeding 
the first temporary increase may be up to the lesser of million on an annual basis or of gross water sales 
should the rate case not be completed within seven months  by law  the utility may put the entire requested rate relief  up to of gross water sales  in effect under bond until a final resolution is ordered and placed into effect 
if any such rates are found to be in excess of rates the depsc finds to be appropriate  the utility must refund the portion found to be in excess to customers with interest 
the timing of our rate increase requests are therefore dependent upon the estimated cost of the administrative process in relation to the investments and expenses that we hope to recover through the rate increase 
we can provide no assurances that rate increase requests will be approved by applicable regulatory agencies  and  if approved  we cannot guarantee that these rate increases will be granted in a timely or sufficient manner to cover the investments and expenses for which we initially sought the rate increase 
as permitted under delaware law  an interim increase in rates designed to increase annualized revenues by million was placed in effect july  pending conclusion of our filing with the depsc for rate relief 
on december   the depsc approved a settlement agreement in this case 
the increase in annual revenue requirement under the settlement agreement of million was generated in two steps 
the first step was placed in effect on january  to generate approximately million in annual revenue 
the second step was placed in effect july  the second step rates were designed to recover approximately million of annual revenue which reflected the issuance of additional equity issued by artesian resources and invested in artesian water in june and july of of approximately million 
on january   artesian water submitted a notice to the depsc of our intent to file an application for a rate increase 
on april   artesian water filed a petition with the depsc to implement new rates to meet a requested increase in revenue of  or approximately million  on an annualized basis 
on july    pursuant to the depsc s minimum filing requirements  artesian filed a supplemental filing with the depsc to update financial schedules for actual experience through march  and to reflect additional changes affecting the requested increase 
the overall result was a reduction to the requested increase in revenue of  to or approximately million  on an annualized basis 
delaware statute permits water utilities to put into effect  on a semi annual basis  increases related to specific types of distribution system improvements through a distribution system improvement charge or dsic 
this charge is available to water utilities to be implemented between general rate increase applications that normally recognize changes in a water utility s overall financial position 
the dsic approval process is less costly when compared to the approval process for general rate increase requests 
the dsic rate applied between base rate filings is capped at of the amount billed to customers under otherwise applicable rates and charges  and the dsic rate increase applied can not exceed within any month period 
in december  artesian water filed an application with the depsc for approval to collect a increase  effective january   to recover the costs of eligible non revenue producing improvements made since the last rate increase in the depsc approved the dsic effective january  subject to audit at a later date 
during  we earned approximately  in dsic revenue 
on june   the company discontinued the collection of dsic pursuant to delaware law which requires the company to discontinue a dsic when new base rates are put into effect 
we did not have dsic in effect during 
table of contents as permitted by law  on june   we placed temporary rates into effect  designed to generate an increase in annual operating revenue of approximately  or million on an annualized basis  until new rates are approved by the depsc 
also pursuant to law  on december   we placed temporary rates into effect  designed to generate an additional increase in annual operating revenue of approximately or million on an annualized basis  given that the rate case had not been concluded in a seven month period 
evidentiary hearings were held on december  and a final commission decision is anticipated in the third quarter of in reference to the implementation of our requested rate increase 
in  legislation was enacted in delaware requiring all water utilities serving within northern new castle county  delaware to certify by july  and each three years thereafter  that they have sufficient sources of self supply to serve their respective systems 
on june   artesian water filed our certification related to the adequacy of our water supply through after completion of their review  on july   the depsc accepted our certification of sufficient water supply 
as required  we will file a new certification of self sufficiency with the depsc by june   for the period through in  the general assembly passed legislation restructuring the electric industry in delaware 
since the passage of electric restructuring legislation in  electricity prices had been capped for customers of delmarva power and the delaware electric cooperative 
those rate caps were lifted in for customers of the delaware electric cooperative and in may for delmarva power customers 
our electric charges increased in due to higher billing rates charged by delaware electric cooperative after the cap was removed 
in  our electric charges increased further due to the increase from delmarva power 
although we were unable to escape the significant increase associated with the expiration of the price caps  we sought to mitigate future significant increases by signing a two year supply contract  at a fixed price  with pepco holdings  inc in may of and another in april of this new pricing is included in our most recent request for rate relief filed with the depsc 
on april   the depsc made effective new rules under regulation docket that govern the terms and conditions under which water utilities require advances or contributions from customers or developers 
these regulations require that developers pay for all water facilities within a new development  with such funding recorded as contributions in aid of construction by the water utility 
in addition  the utility is required to receive a contribution in aid of construction of  for each new residential connection to its system towards the cost of water supply  treatment and storage facilities 
these regulations further require developers to fully pay for facilities to serve satellite systems 
these required contributions are intended to place a greater burden upon new customers to pay for the cost of facilities required to serve them 
on april   the depsc reopened this docket to assess the effectiveness of the rules and regulations requiring water utilities to collect contributions in aid of construction 
we anticipate this proceeding to continue into on march   the depsc entered order no 
which re opened regulation docket no 
by this order  the commission proposes to repeal rules implemented in and replace them with new regulations governing certificates of public convenience and necessity 
the proposed rules address the content of how notifications are sent to landowners  the definitions for the proposed service area  and the requirement of the applying utility to certify that it will actually provide water services to a new proposed service territory within three years 
if water service is not provided within the three year time frame  the proposed rule provides a mechanism for the commission to determine whether the utility should be able to retain the new cpcn 
the depsc has indicated that in the march proceedings they intend to recommend that a utility provide water service to a new proposed service territory within five years 
these proposed rules have not been adopted and they may not be adopted or could be modified prior to adoption 
as of december   no final decision had been made by the depsc 
our water and wastewater utilities in maryland are subject to regulation by the mdpsc 
if we are seeking new franchise areas  we must first seek approval from the county government and this franchise area must be included in that county s master sewer and water plan 
final granting of these franchise areas must then be obtained by the mdpsc 
in maryland  if utilities want to construct a new plant  approvals must be obtained from the maryland department of the environment  the county government and the mdpsc 
also  soil and erosion plans must be approved and easement agreements with affected parties must be obtained 
the mdpsc also approves rates and charges for service  acquisitions  mergers  issuance of securities and other matters 

table of contents in december  the mdpsc approved an application for artesian water maryland to construct a water system from the delaware state line  interconnecting with the artesian water system  to the town of elkton 
the town of elkton desired an additional source of water supply 
we are affected by inflation  most notably by the continually increasing costs required to maintain  improve and expand our service capability 
the cumulative effect of inflation results in significantly higher facility costs compared to investments made to years ago  which must be recovered from future cash flows 
critical accounting policies all additions to plant are recorded at cost 
cost includes direct labor  materials  and indirect charges for such items as transportation  supervision  pension  medical  and other fringe benefits related to employees engaged in construction activities 
when depreciable units of utility plant are retired  the cost of retired property  together with any cost associated with retirement and less any salvage value or proceeds received  is charged to accumulated depreciation 
maintenance  repairs  and replacement of minor items of plant are charged to expense as incurred 
we record water service revenue  including amounts billed to customers on a cycle basis and unbilled amounts  based upon estimated usage from the date of the last meter reading to the end of the accounting period 
these estimates are made on an individual customer basis  based on one of three methods the previous year s consumption in the same period  the previous billing period s consumption  or trending and are adjusted to reflect current changes in water demand on a system wide basis 
while actual usage for individual customers may differ materially from the estimate  we believe the overall total estimate of consumption and revenue for the fiscal period will not differ materially from actual billed consumption  as the overall estimate has been adjusted to reflect any change in overall demand on the system for the period 
we record accounts receivable at the invoiced amounts 
the reserve for bad debts is the company s best estimate of the amount of probable credit losses in our existing accounts receivable 
the company reviews the reserve for bad debts on a quarterly basis 
account balances are written off against the reserve when it is probable the receivable will not be recovered 
we review for impairment of our long lived assets  including utility plant in service  in accordance with the requirements of sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
we also review regulatory assets for the continued application of sfas no 
our review determines whether there have been changes in circumstances or events that have occurred that require adjustments to the carrying value of these assets 
in accordance with sfas no 
 adjustments to the carrying value of these assets would be made in instances where the inclusion in the rate making process is unlikely 
our regulated utilities record deferred regulatory assets under statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for the effects of certain types of regulation  which are costs that may be recovered over various lengths of time as prescribed by the depsc  mdpsc and papuc 
as the utility incurs certain costs  such as expenses related to rate case applications  a deferred regulatory asset is created 
adjustments to these deferred regulatory assets are made when the depsc  mdpsc or papuc determines whether the expense is recoverable in rates  the length of time over which an expense is recoverable  or  because of changes in circumstances  whether a remaining balance of deferred expense is recoverable in rates charged to customers 
adjustments to reflect changes in recoverability of certain deferred regulatory assets may have a material effect on our financial results 
goodwill is recorded in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  sfas 
we will test goodwill annually for impairment 
goodwill is approximately  as of the year ended december   which is entirely associated with the acquisition of mountain hill in august and is currently being amortized on a straight line basis over a period of fifty years 
the purchase price of mountain hill included reimbursement of all carrying costs through the date of acquisition  which resulted in the recognition of goodwill 

table of contents results of operations compared to operating revenues revenues totaled million in and were above revenues in of million  which is partially due to an increase of million  or in total water sales revenue 
the increase in water sales revenue in artesian water reflects a increase in the number of customers served  rate increases placed in effect in and temporary rate increases of and placed into effect on june  and december   as permitted under delaware law  until new rates are approved by the depsc 
we realized of our total revenue in from the sale of water

other utility operating revenue other utility operating revenue  derived from contract operations  antenna leases on water tanks  finance service charges and wastewater customer service revenues increased in  from million in to million in the increase was primarily the result of a increase in wastewater customer service revenues  from  in to  in  which included monthly fees and operating subsidies from development contracts 
non utility operating revenue non utility operating revenue  derived from non regulated wastewater operations  increased from million in to million in this increase reflected higher contract revenues associated with wastewater treatment projects in southern delaware 
the increase was also due to an increase in artesian utility operations  which had a  increase for the construction of a water treatment facility in cecil county  maryland 
a portion of the increase  approximately  included contract service revenue in artesian utility  a result of the tmh acquisition 
the increase in revenue also included an increase in service line protection plan revenue  of approximately  from  in to  in 
table of contents operating expenses operating expenses  excluding depreciation and taxes  increased approximately million  or  to million in payroll and benefits increased  due to increased staffing at points throughout the year  pay increases and increased medical insurance premiums 
electric expense increased  as a result of an increase in power and electric rates of approximately due to the may expiration of price caps imposed in when deregulation of the electric industry in delaware was adopted 
artesian resources sought to mitigate these increases by signing a two year supply contract with another provider at a fixed price in may repair and maintenance expenses increased  due primarily to an increase in tank painting costs of  associated with a new five year agreement effective july  costs for carbon filter water treatment replacements that increased  and other miscellaneous increases in the maintenance of pump and water treatment plants 
administrative expenses increased by approximately  primarily due to an increase in temporary employment services  directors fees and employee training related to the conversion of our financial reporting system
