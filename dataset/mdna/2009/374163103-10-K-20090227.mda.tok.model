item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview this annual report contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
we use words such as anticipate  believe  plan  expect  future  intend and similar expressions to identify forward looking statements 
these statements appear throughout the annual report and are statements regarding our intent  belief or current expectations  primarily with respect to our operations and related industry developments 
you should not place undue reliance on these forward looking statements  which apply only as of the date of this annual report 
our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements for many reasons  including the risks faced by us and described in the section of item a entitled risk factors  and elsewhere in this annual report 
the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in part ii  item of this annual report 
geron is a menlo park  california based biopharmaceutical company developing first in class therapeutic products for the treatment of cancer and chronic degenerative diseases  including spinal cord injury  heart failure and diabetes 
the company is advancing an anti cancer drug and a cancer vaccine that target the enzyme telomerase through multiple clinical trials 
geron is also believed to be the world leader in the development of human embryonic stem cell hesc based therapeutics 
the company has received fda clearance to begin the world s first human clinical trial of a hesc based therapy grnopc for acute spinal cord injury as discussed in more detail in part i  item business of this annual report 
critical accounting policies and estimates our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
note of notes to consolidated financial statements describes the significant accounting policies used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
certain of these significant accounting policies are considered to be critical accounting policies  as defined below 
a critical accounting policy is defined as one that is both material to the presentation of our financial statements and requires management to make difficult  subjective or complex judgments that could have a material effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
specifically  critical accounting estimates have the following attributes i we are required to make assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time of the estimate  and ii different estimates we could reasonably have used  or changes in the estimate that are reasonably likely to occur  would have a material effect on our financial condition or results of operations 
estimates and assumptions about future events and their effects cannot be determined with certainty 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions believed to be applicable and reasonable under the circumstances 
these estimates may change as new events occur  as additional information is obtained and as our operating environment changes 
these changes have historically been minor and have been included in the consolidated financial statements as soon as they became known 
based on a critical assessment of our accounting policies and the underlying judgments and uncertainties affecting the application of those policies  management believes that our consolidated financial statements are fairly stated in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  and meaningfully present our financial condition and results of operations 
we believe the following critical accounting policies reflect our more significant estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements revenue recognition since our inception  a substantial portion of our revenues has been generated from research and licensing agreements 
revenue under such agreements typically includes upfront signing or license fees  cost reimbursements  milestone payments and royalties on future product sales 
we recognize nonrefundable signing  license or non exclusive option fees as revenue when rights to use the intellectual property related to the license have been delivered and over the term of the agreement if we have continuing performance obligations 
we recognize milestone payments  which are subject to substantive contingencies  upon completion of specified milestones  which represents the culmination of an earnings process  according to contract terms 
royalties are generally recognized as revenue upon the receipt of the related royalty payment 
we recognize cost reimbursement revenue under collaborative agreements as the related research and development costs for services are rendered 
we recognize related party revenue under collaborative agreements as the related party research and development costs for services are rendered and when the source of funds have not been derived from our contributions to the related party 
deferred revenue represents the portion of research or license payments received which have not been earned 
when payments are received in equity securities  we do not recognize any revenue unless such securities are determined to be realizable in cash 
we estimate the projected future term of license agreements over which we recognize revenue 
our estimates are based on contractual terms  historical experience and general industry practice 
revisions in the estimated terms of these license agreements have the effect of increasing or decreasing license fee revenue in the period of revision 
as of december   no revisions to the estimated future terms of license agreements have been made and we do not expect revisions to the currently active agreements in the future 
valuation of equity based compensation on january   we began accounting for stock based awards under the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 
revised  share based payment  sfas r using the modified prospective transition method 
under sfas r  we are required to measure and recognize compensation expense for all stock based awards to our employees and directors  including employee stock options and employee stock purchases related to our employee stock purchase plan espp based on estimated fair values 
we estimated the fair value of stock awards and espp shares using the black scholes option pricing model 
option pricing model assumptions such as expected volatility  risk free interest rate and expected term impact the fair value estimate 
further  the estimated forfeiture rate impacts the amount of aggregate compensation recognized during the period 
the fair value of equity based awards is amortized over the vesting period of the award using a straight line method 
expected volatilities are based on historical volatilities of our stock since traded options on geron stock do not correspond to option terms and trading volume of options is limited 
the expected term of options represents the period of time that options granted are expected to be outstanding 
in deriving this assumption  we reviewed actual historical exercise and cancellation data and the remaining outstanding options not yet exercised or cancelled 
the expected term of employees purchase rights  under our espp  is equal to the purchase period 
the risk free interest rate is based on the us zero coupon treasury strip yields for the expected term in effect on the date of grant 
forfeiture rate was estimated based on historical experience and will be adjusted over the requisite service period based on the extent to which actual forfeitures differ  or are expected to differ  from their estimate 
prior to the implementation of sfas r  we accounted for stock based awards under the intrinsic method of accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  apb and made pro forma footnote disclosures as required by statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure  which amended statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for stock based compensation 
under the intrinsic method  no stock based compensation expense had been recognized in the consolidated statements of operations for stock options granted to employees and directors because the exercise price of the stock options equaled the fair market value of the underlying stock on the date of grant 
we continue to apply the provisions of eitf no 
 accounting for equity instruments that are issued to other than employees for acquiring  or in conjunction with selling  goods or services  eitf for our non employee stock based awards 
under eitf  the measurement date at which the fair value of the stock based award is measured is equal to the earlier of the date at which a commitment for performance by the counterparty to earn the equity instrument is reached or the date at which the counterparty s performance is complete 
we recognized stock based compensation expense of none  million and  for the fair value of the vested portion of non employee options and warrants in our consolidated statements of operations for  and  respectively 
stock based compensation expense recognized under sfas r was million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
as of december   total compensation cost related to unvested stock based awards not yet recognized was million  net of estimated forfeitures  which is expected to be recognized over the next months on a weighted average basis 
we annually evaluate the assumptions used in estimating fair values of our stock based awards by reviewing current trends in comparison to historical data 
we have not revised the method in which we derive assumptions in order to estimate fair values of our stock based awards 
if factors change and we employ different assumptions in the application of sfas r in future periods  the compensation expense that we record under sfas r may differ significantly from what we have recorded in the current period 
fair value of financial instruments in september  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 fair value measurements  sfas which defines fair value  establishes guidelines for measuring fair value and expands disclosures regarding fair value measurements 
sfas does not require any new fair value measurements but rather eliminates inconsistencies in guidance found in various prior accounting pronouncements and is effective for fiscal years beginning after november  beginning january   assets and liabilities recorded at fair value in our consolidated balance sheet are categorized based upon the level of judgment associated with inputs used to measure their fair value 
sfas defines a three level valuation hierarchy for disclosure of fair value measurements as follows level inputs are unadjusted  quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities at the measurement date 
level inputs other than quoted market prices included in level are either directly or indirectly observable for the asset or liability through correlation with market data at the measurement date and for the duration of the instrument s anticipated life 
level inputs reflect management s best estimate of what market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability at the measurement date 
consideration is given to the risk inherent in the valuation technique and the risk inherent in the inputs to the model 
the availability of observable inputs can vary from product to product and is affected by a wide variety of factors  including  for example  the type of product  whether the product is new and not yet established in the marketplace  the liquidity of markets and other characteristics particular to the transaction 
to the extent that valuation is based on models or inputs that are less observable or unobservable in the market  the determination of fair value requires more judgment 
accordingly  we exercise the greatest the degree of judgment in determining fair value for instruments categorized in level we classify inputs to derive fair values for marketable debt securities available for sale and marketable investments in licensees as level and instruments classified as level include us treasury securities  us government sponsored enterprise securities  money market funds and publicly traded equity securities in active markets  representing of total financial assets measured at fair value as of december  instruments classified as level include commercial paper  representing of total financial assets measured at fair value as of december  the price for each security at the measurement date is derived from various sources 
periodically  we assess the reasonableness of these sourced prices by comparing them to the prices provided by our portfolio managers from broker quotes 
historically  we have not experienced significant deviation between the sourced prices and our portfolio manager s prices 
we classify inputs to calculate fair value of derivatives as level which includes warrants and non employee options classified as liabilities under issue derivative liabilities represent all financial liabilities measured at fair value on our consolidated balance sheet as of december  the fair value for these instruments is calculated using the black scholes option pricing model 
the model s inputs reflect assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the instrument in a current period transaction 
inputs to the model include stock volatility  dividend yields  expected term of the derivatives and risk free interest rates 
see the following discussion  fair value of derivatives  for information on derivation of inputs to the model 
changes to the model s inputs are not changes to valuation methodologies  but instead reflect direct or indirect impacts from changes in market conditions 
accordingly  results from the valuation model in one period may not be indicative of future period measurements 
for a further discussion regarding fair value measurements  see note on fair value measurements of notes to consolidated financial statements 
fair value of derivatives we apply the provisions of several accounting pronouncements  including statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  sfas  statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity  sfas and emerging issues task force issue  accounting for derivative financial instruments indexed to  and potentially settled in  a company s own stock  issue to determine whether financial instruments or a component of a financial instrument should be classified within assets  liabilities or stockholders equity 
for warrants and non employee options classified as assets or liabilities  the fair value of these instruments is recorded on the consolidated balance sheet at inception of such classification and marked to fair value at each financial reporting date 
the change in fair value of the warrants and non employee options is recorded in the consolidated statements of operations as an unrealized gain loss on fair value of derivatives 
the warrants and non employee options continue to be reported as an asset or liability until such time as the instruments are exercised or expire or are otherwise modified to remove the provisions which require this treatment  at which time these instruments are marked to fair value and reclassified from assets or liabilities to stockholders equity 
for warrants and non employee options classified as permanent equity  the fair value of the warrants and non employee options is recorded in stockholders equity and no further adjustments are made 
fair value of warrants and non employee options is estimated using the black scholes option pricing model 
use of this model requires us to make assumptions regarding stock volatility  dividend yields  expected term of the warrants and non employee options and risk free interest rates 
expected volatilities are based on historical volatilities of our stock 
the expected term of warrants and non employee options represent the contractual term of the instruments 
the risk free interest rate is based on the us zero coupon treasury strip yields for the remaining term of the instrument 
if factors change and we employ different assumptions in future periods  the fair value of these warrants and non employee options reflected as of each balance sheet date and the resulting change in fair value that we record may differ significantly from what we have recorded in previous periods 
as of december   we have not revised the method in which we derive assumptions in order to estimate fair values of warrants and non employee options  classified as assets or liabilities  and we do not expect revisions in the future 
results of operations our results of operations have fluctuated from period to period and may continue to fluctuate in the future  based upon the progress of our research and development efforts and variations in the level of expenses related to developmental efforts during any given period 
results of operations for any period may be unrelated to results of operations for any other period 
in addition  historical results should not be viewed as indicative of future operating results 
we are subject to risks common to companies in our industry and at our stage of development  including risks inherent in our research and development efforts  reliance upon our collaborative partners  enforcement of our patent and proprietary rights  need for future capital  potential competition and uncertainty of preclinical and clinical trial results or regulatory approvals or clearances 
in order for a product candidate to be commercialized based on our research  we and our collaborators must conduct preclinical tests and clinical trials  demonstrate the efficacy and safety of our product candidates  obtain regulatory approvals or clearances and enter into manufacturing  distribution and marketing arrangements  as well as obtain market acceptance 
we do not expect to receive revenues or royalties based on therapeutic products for a period of years  if at all 
revenues we recognized  of revenues from collaborative agreements in compared to  in and  in revenues in each of these years primarily reflected related party reimbursements we received from our joint venture in hong kong  ta therapeutics  ltd 
tat  for scientific research services and revenue recognized under our collaboration with corning life sciences 
since june   we have been including tat s results in our consolidated financial statements and have eliminated any related party revenue when the source of funds has been derived from our contributions to the related party 
prior to that date  related party revenue earned under a contract to perform scientific research services for tat was recognized as revenue as the services were performed 
we have entered into license and option agreements with companies involved with oncology  diagnostics  research tools  agriculture and biologics production 
in each of these agreements  we have granted certain rights to our technologies 
in connection with the agreements  we are entitled to receive license fees  option fees  milestone payments and royalties on future sales  or any combination thereof 
we recognized license fee revenues of million  million and million in  and  respectively  related to our various agreements 
license fee revenue in primarily reflected the receipt of a million milestone payment from exeter life sciences  inc as a result of the final risk assessment released by the us food and drug administration addressing food products made from cloned animals or their progeny 
license fee revenue in primarily reflected the receipt of million in milestone payments in connection with the collaboration and license agreement with merck 
we expect to recognize revenue of  in   in   in and none thereafter related to our existing deferred revenue 
current revenues may not be predictive of future revenues 
we recognized royalty revenue of   and  in  and  respectively  on product sales of telomerase detection and telomere measurement kits to the research use only market  telomerase based research products and agricultural products 
license and royalty revenues are dependent upon additional agreements being signed and future product sales 
research and development expenses research and development expenses were million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the decrease in compared to was primarily the net result of decreased manufacturing costs of million as a result of timing of drug purchases for grnl and lower scientific supplies of million  partially offset by increased clinical trial costs of million associated with grnl and grnvac the increase in compared to was primarily the net result of higher personnel related expenses of million due to increased headcount  which included an increase of million in stock based compensation expense associated with stock options and restricted stock awards  increased manufacturing costs of million for grnl  increased clinical trial costs of million associated with grnl and grnvac and increased scientific supplies expense of million  partially offset by reduced preclinical study expenses of million due to the progress of grnopc toward our ind filing 
overall  we expect research and development expenses to increase in the next year as we incur expenses related to clinical trials for grnl  grnvac and grnopc along with continued development of our human embryonic stem cell hesc programs 
our research and development activities have arisen from our two major technology platforms  telomerase and hescs 
the oncology programs focus on treating or diagnosing cancer by targeting or detecting the presence of telomerase  either inhibiting activity of the telomerase enzyme  diagnosing cancer by detecting the presence of telomerase  or using telomerase as a target for therapeutic vaccines 
our core knowledge base in telomerase and telomere biology supports all these approaches  and our scientists may contribute to any or all of these programs in a given period 
we have initiated the following clinical trials of grnl phase i single agent trial in patients with chronic lymphoproliferative diseases  phase i single agent trial in patients with solid tumor malignancies  phase i trial in patients with advanced non small cell lung cancer when administered intravenously in combination with a standard paclitaxel carboplatin regimen  phase i single agent trial in patients with multiple myeloma  phase i ii trial in patients with breast cancer when administered intravenously in combination with a paclitaxel bevacizumab regimen  and phase i trial in patients with multiple myeloma when administered intravenously in combination with bortezomib with and without dexamethasone 
preliminary data from these studies showed safety and tolerability of the drug in low dose cohorts as well as the expected pharmacokinetic properties after multiple intravenous infusions of the drug 
interim data from the ongoing clinical trial of grnl in two patients with relapsed and refractory multiple myeloma showed first evidence in man of telomerase inhibition by a telomerase targeting drug 
these preliminary results will help optimize dosing schedules to enable sustained telomerase inhibition that hopefully will translate into clinical activity 
taking the results from the duke university clinical studies in prostate cancer  hematologic malignancies and renal cell carcinoma  we optimized the vaccine manufacturing process and transferred it to a contract manufacturer 
we have initiated a phase ii clinical trial of our telomerase vaccine using the prime boost scheme in patients with acute myelogenous leukemia 
our hesc therapy programs focus on treating injuries and degenerative diseases with cell therapies based on cells derived from hescs 
a core of knowledge of hesc biology  as well as a significant continuing effort in deriving  growing  maintaining  and differentiating hescs  underlies all aspects of this group of programs 
many of our researchers are allocated to more than one hesc program  and the percentage allocations of time change as the resource needs of individual programs vary 
in our hesc therapy programs  we have concentrated our resources on several specific cell types  including grnopc  hesc derived oligodendrocyte progenitor cells  for the treatment of acute spinal cord injury  grncm  hesc derived cardiomyocytes  for the treatment of myocardial disease and toxicology drug testing  grnic  hesc derived pancreatic islet cells for the treatment of diabetes  hesc derived osteoblasts for the treatment of osteoporosis  hesc derived chondrocytes for the treatment of osteoarthritis hesc derived hepatocytes for liver failure and adme drug testing  and hesc derived dendritic cells for cancer immunotherapy and to prevent immune rejection of the other cell types used in therapeutic applications 
we have developed proprietary methods to grow  maintain  and scale the culture of undifferentiated hescs that use feeder cell free and serum free media with chemically defined components 
moreover  we have developed scalable processes to differentiate these cells into therapeutically relevant cells 
we have developed cryopreserved formulations of hesc derived cells to enable our business model of delivering on demand cells for therapeutic use 
in january  we received clearance from the fda to begin a clinical trial of grnopc  our hesc derived therapy targeted for the treatment of acute spinal cord injury 
research and development expenses incurred under each of these programs are as follows in thousands year ended december  oncology    hesc therapies    total    at this time  we cannot provide reliable estimates of how much time or investment will be necessary to commercialize products from the programs currently in progress 
drug development in the us is a process that includes multiple steps defined by the fda under applicable statutes  regulations and guidance documents 
after the preclinical research process of identifying  selecting and testing in animals a potential pharmaceutical compound  the clinical development process begins with the filing of an ind 
clinical development typically involves three phases of study phase i  ii and iii 
the most significant costs associated with clinical development are incurred in phase iii trials  which tend to be the longest and largest studies conducted during the drug development process 
after the completion of a successful preclinical and clinical development program  a new drug application nda or biologics license application bla must be filed with the fda  which includes  among other things  very large amounts of preclinical and clinical data and results and manufacturing related information necessary to support requested approval of the product 
the nda bla must be reviewed and approved by the fda 
according to industry statistics  it generally takes to years to research  develop and bring to market a new prescription medicine in the united states 
in light of the steps and complexities involved  the successful development of our potential products is highly uncertain 
actual timelines and costs to develop and commercialize a product are subject to enormous variability and are very difficult to predict 
in addition  various statutes and regulations also govern or influence the manufacturing  safety reporting  labeling  storage  record keeping and marketing of each product 
the lengthy process of seeking these regulatory reviews and approvals  and the subsequent compliance with applicable statutes and regulations  require the expenditure of substantial resources 
any failure by us to obtain  or any delay in obtaining  regulatory approvals could materially adversely affect our business 
in responding to an nda bla submission  the fda may grant marketing approval  may request additional information  may deny the application if it determines that the application does not provide an adequate basis for approval  and may also refuse to review an application that has been submitted if it determines that the application does not provide an adequate basis for filing and review 
we cannot provide assurance that any approval required by the fda will be obtained on a timely basis  if at all 
for a more complete discussion of the risks and uncertainties associated with completing development of potential products  see the sub section titled delays in the commencement of clinical testing of our current and potential product candidates could result in increased costs to us and delay our ability to generate revenues and obtaining regulatory approvals to market our product candidates in the united states and other countries is a costly and lengthy process and we cannot predict whether or when we will be permitted to commercialize our product candidates in part i  item a entitled risk factors and elsewhere in this annual report 
general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses were million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the increase in from was primarily due to increased compensation expense related to stock options and restricted stock awards to employees  partially offset by reduced consulting expense and lower audit fees 
the increase in from was primarily due to increased compensation expense related to stock options and restricted stock awards to employees and directors  higher consulting expense and increased audit fees 
unrealized gain loss on fair value of derivatives unrealized gain loss on fair value of derivatives reflects a non cash adjustment for changes in fair value of warrants and options held by non employees to purchase common stock that are classified as current liabilities 
under issue  derivatives classified as assets or liabilities are marked to fair value at each financial reporting date with any resulting unrealized gain loss recorded in the consolidated statements of operations 
the derivatives continue to be reported as an asset or liability until such time as the instruments are exercised or expire or are otherwise modified to remove the provisions which require them to be recorded as assets or liabilities  at which time these instruments are marked to fair value and reclassified from assets or liabilities to stockholders equity 
we incurred unrealized gains of  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
unrealized gains in were due to the reduced value of derivatives resulting from shortening of their contractual terms  decreases in the market value of our stock and changes in other inputs factored into the estimate of their fair value such as the volatility of our stock 
unrealized gains for were primarily the result of amendments executed in march to certain warrant agreements to address the presumption under issue of net cash settlement in the event that registered shares were not available to settle the warrants enabling reclassification of the decreasing fair value of those warrants from derivative liabilities to equity 
see note on fair value measurements of notes to consolidated financial statements of this form k for further discussion of the fair value of derivatives 
interest and other income interest income was million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the decrease in compared to was primarily due to decreased interest rates and lower cash and investment balances 
the increase in compared to was primarily due to higher cash and investment balances as a result of million in net proceeds received in connection with the private equity financing in december and million in proceeds received in connection with the exercise of warrants in february also included in interest income for the years ended december   and  were realized losses of   and  respectively  related to other than temporary declines in fair value of our investments in licensees as well as net realized gains of none   and  for  and  respectively  related to sales of investments in licensees 
losses recognized under equity method investment in august  we exchanged our equity interest in the start licensing  inc start joint venture for equity interest in viagen  inc viagen 
in september  we provided a loan of million to viagen in connection with viagen acquiring an interest in an unrelated company 
the proceeds of the loan did not fund prior viagen losses and represents additional financial support to viagen 
in accordance with the equity method of accounting  we recognized losses of  for our proportionate share of viagen s losses since september as an adjustment to the basis of the loan 
previously  we had suspended the equity method of accounting for start and viagen since our proportionate share of net losses exceeded the value of our investment and we had no commitments to provide financial support to either company 
interest and other expense interest and other expense was   and  for the years ended december   and  respectively 
in and  interest and other expense was primarily comprised of bank charges 
the decrease in interest and other expense for compared to was primarily due to reduced bank charges as a result of lower cash and investment balances 
the decrease in interest and other expense for compared to was primarily due to the conclusion of equipment financing payments in june net loss net loss was million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
overall net loss for increased compared to primarily due to reduced revenues from milestones  lower interest income and decreased unrealized gains on derivatives 
overall net loss for increased compared to primarily due to increased operating expenses for the clinical development of grnl and grnvac and increasing headcount offset by increased unrealized gains on derivatives and increased license fee revenue and interest income 
deemed dividend on derivatives in exchange for the exercise of warrants in february  we issued warrants to purchase  shares of common stock  at a premium  exercisable from june the new warrants are substantially the same as the a warrants issued in the december financing 
the aggregate fair value of million for these new instruments  as calculated using the black scholes option pricing model  was recognized as a deemed dividend in the consolidated statements of operations 
in december  we modified the terms of certain outstanding warrants by extending the exercise term and reducing the exercise price 
the exercise term of the a warrants to purchase  shares of common stock was extended to november and the exercise price was modified to per share 
the exercise terms of the a warrants to purchase  shares of common stock and d warrants to purchase  shares of common stock were extended to december and the exercise prices were modified to per share 
in connection with the modifications  we received million in cash consideration from the institutional investors holding the outstanding warrants 
we recognized a deemed dividend of million in the consolidated statements of operations for the incremental fair value of the modified warrants  as estimated using the black scholes option pricing model as of the modification date  net of the cash consideration received from the institutional investors for the modifications 
liquidity and capital resources cash  restricted cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities at december  were million  compared to million at december  and million at december  we have an investment policy to invest these funds in liquid  investment grade securities  such as interest bearing money market funds  us government and agency securities  corporate notes  commercial paper  asset backed securities and municipal securities 
our investment portfolio does not contain securities with exposure to sub prime mortgages  collateralized debt obligations or auction rate securities and we have not to date recognized an other than temporary impairment on our marketable securities or any significant changes in aggregate fair value that would impact our cash resources or liquidity 
to date  we have not experienced lack of access to our invested cash and cash equivalents  however  we cannot provide assurances that access to our invested cash and cash equivalents will not be impacted by adverse conditions in the financial markets 
the decrease in cash  restricted cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities in was due to use of cash for operations 
the decrease in cash  restricted cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities in was the net result of use of cash for operations partially offset by the receipt of million in proceeds from the exercise of warrants issued to institutional investors in connection with a financing in december and receipt of million in milestone payments from merck 
we estimate that our existing capital resources  interest income and equipment financing facility will be sufficient to fund our current level of operations through at least december however  our future capital requirements will be substantial 
changes in our research and development plans or other changes affecting our operating expenses or cash balances may result in the expenditure of available resources before such time 
factors that may require us to use our available capital resources sooner than we anticipate include continued clinical development of our product candidates  grnl  grnvac and grnopc  our ability to meaningfully reduce manufacturing costs of current product candidates  future clinical trial results  progress of product and clinical development of our other product candidates  such as grncm  grnic and grnvac  cost and timing of regulatory approvals  and filing  maintenance  prosecution  defense and enforcement of patent claims and other intellectual property rights 
if our capital resources are insufficient to meet future capital requirements  we will need to raise additional capital to fund our operations 
we intend to seek additional funding through strategic collaborations  public or private equity financings  equipment loans or other financing sources that may be available 
however  we may be unable to raise sufficient additional capital when we need it  on favorable terms or at all 
if we are unable to obtain adequate funds on reasonable terms  we may be required to curtail operations significantly or obtain funds by entering into financing  supply or collaboration agreements on unattractive terms or we may be required to relinquish rights to technology or product candidates or to grant licenses on terms that are unfavorable to us 
cash flows from operating activities net cash used in operations was million  million and million in  and  respectively 
the increase in net cash used for operations in was primarily the result of reduced interest income  payments to biotechnology research corporation  our joint venture partner in ta therapeutics  ltd 
for scientific research services and increased clinical trial expenses 
the increase in net cash used for operations in was primarily the result of increased operating expenses  offset by advance research and development funding from biotechnology research corporation 
cash flows from investing activities net cash provided by investing activities was million  million and million in  and  respectively 
the decrease in net cash provided by investing activities in compared to primarily reflected reduced maturities of marketable securities 
the decrease in net cash provided by investing activities in compared to reflected increased capital expenditures in  partially offset by increased proceeds from the maturities of marketable securities 
for the three years ended december   we have purchased approximately million in property and equipment  net of disposals  none of which was financed through equipment financing arrangements 
as of december   no payments were due under our equipment financing facility 
as of december   we had approximately  available for borrowing under our equipment financing facility 
we intend to renew the commitment for a new equipment financing facility in to further fund equipment purchases 
if we are unable to renew the commitment  we will use our cash resources for capital expenditures 
cash flows from financing activities net cash used in financing activities in was  compared to net cash provided by financing activities of million and million in and  respectively 
net cash used in financing activities in primarily reflected the repurchase of vested stock from certain employees to provide funds for minimum payroll tax withholding requirements 
net cash provided by financing activities in included million in proceeds from the exercise of warrants issued to institutional investors in connection with a financing in december and million in cash consideration from the modification of certain outstanding warrants in december net cash provided by financing activities in primarily reflected the receipt of million in proceeds from the exercise of warrants issued to institutional investors and net proceeds of million from the sale of common stock and warrants to institutional investors 
contractual obligations as of december  our contractual obligations for the next five years  and thereafter were as follows principal payments due by period less than after contractual obligations total year years years years in thousands equipment lease operating leases research funding  total contractual cash obligations  this table does not include any milestone payments under research collaborations or license agreements as the timing and likelihood of such payments are not known 
in addition  this table does not include payments under our severance plan if there were a change in control of the company or severance payments to key employees under involuntary termination 
in march  we issued  shares of our common stock to the lessor of our premises at and constitution drive in payment of our monthly rental obligation from august  through july  in may  we issued  shares of our common stock to the lessor of our premises at commonwealth drive in payment of our monthly rental obligation from may  through april  the fair value of the common stock issuances has been recorded as a prepaid asset and is being amortized to rent expense on a straight line basis over the lease periods 
research funding is comprised of sponsored research commitments at various laboratories around the world  including commitments of our majority owned subsidiary  tat

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the following discussion about our market risk disclosures contains forward looking statements 
actual results could differ materially from those projected in the forward looking statements 
we are exposed to market risk related to changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 
we do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes 
credit risk 
we place our cash  restricted cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities with six financial institutions in the united states 
deposits with banks may exceed the amount of insurance provided on such deposits 
while we monitor the cash balances in our operating accounts and adjust the cash balances as appropriate  these cash balances could be impacted if the underlying financial institutions fail or could be subject to other adverse conditions in the financial markets 
to date  we have not experienced any loss or lack of access to cash in our operating accounts or to our cash equivalents and marketable securities in our investment portfolios 
financial instruments that potentially subject us to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of marketable securities 
marketable securities currently consist of us treasury securities  us government sponsored enterprise securities and commercial paper 
our investment policy  approved by our board of directors  limits the amount we may invest in any one type of investment issuer  thereby reducing credit risk concentrations 
interest rate sensitivity 
the fair value of our cash equivalents and marketable securities at december  was million 
these investments include million of cash equivalents which are due in less than days and million of short term investments which are due in less than one year 
our investment policy is to manage our marketable securities portfolio to preserve principal and liquidity while maximizing the return on the investment portfolio through the full investment of available funds 
we diversify the marketable securities portfolio by investing in multiple types of investment grade securities 
we primarily invest our marketable securities portfolio in short term securities with at least an investment grade rating to minimize interest rate and credit risk as well as to provide for an immediate source of funds 
although changes in interest rates may affect the fair value of the marketable securities portfolio and cause unrealized gains or losses  such gains or losses would not be realized unless the investments are sold 
due to the nature of our investments  which are primarily us treasury securities  us government sponsored enterprise securities  commercial paper and money market funds  we have concluded that there is no material market risk exposure 
foreign currency exchange risk 
because we translate foreign currencies into united states dollars for reporting purposes  currency fluctuations can have an impact  though generally immaterial  on our results 
we believe that our exposure to currency exchange fluctuation risk is insignificant primarily because our wholly owned international subsidiary  geron bio med ltd  satisfies its financial obligations almost exclusively in its local currency 
as of december   there was an immaterial currency exchange impact from our intercompany transactions 
as of december   we did not engage in foreign currency hedging activities
