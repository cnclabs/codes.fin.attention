item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
our efforts to develop and introduce new product and service offerings  including new product features  expose us to risks such as limited customer acceptance  costs related to product defects and large expenditures that may not result in additional net revenue 
rapid technological changes  as well as changes in customer requirements and preferences  characterize the software industry 
we are devoting significant resources to the development of technologies  like our vertical design products and our digital prototyping and collaboration products 
in addition  we are continually introducing new business models that require a considerable investment of technical and financial resources 
we are making such investments through further development and enhancement of our existing products  as well as through acquisitions of new product lines 
such investments may not result in sufficient revenue generation to justify their costs  or competitors may introduce new products and services that achieve acceptance among our current customers  adversely affecting our competitive position 
in particular  a critical component of our growth strategy is to have customers of our autocad and autocad lt products expand their portfolios to include our related d vertical industry products and our d model based design products such as our autodesk inventor products  our autodesk revit products  our autocad civil d products and our autodesk navisworks products 
should sales of our autocad and autocad lt products decrease without a corresponding increase in d vertical and d model based design product revenue or without purchases of customer seats to our d vertical products and d model based design products  our results of operations will be adversely affected 
additionally  the software products we offer are complex  and despite extensive testing and quality control  may contain errors or defects 
these defects or errors could result in the need for corrective releases to our software products  damage to our reputation  loss of revenue  an increase in product returns or lack of market acceptance of our products  any of which would likely harm our business 
our business could suffer as a result of risks and costs associated with strategic acquisitions and investments 
we regularly acquire or invest in businesses  software products and technologies that are complementary to our business through strategic alliances  equity investments or acquisitions 
the risks associated with such acquisitions include  among others  the difficulty of assimilating the products  operations and personnel of the companies  the failure to realize anticipated revenue and cost projections  the requirement to test and assimilate the internal control processes of the acquired business in accordance with the requirements of section of the sarbanes oxley act of section  and the diversion of management s time and attention 
in addition  such acquisitions and investments may involve significant transaction or integration related costs 
we may not be successful in overcoming such risks  and such acquisitions and investments may negatively impact our business 
in addition  such acquisitions and investments have in the past and may in the future contribute to potential fluctuations in quarterly results of operations 
the fluctuations could arise from transaction related costs and charges associated with eliminating redundant expenses or write offs of impaired assets recorded in connection with acquisitions and investments 
for example  during our fourth quarter of fiscal  we took an impairment 
table of contents charge of million  primarily related to goodwill associated with acquisitions in our m e segment 
we also may need to make further investments to support these acquired companies and may have difficulty identifying and acquiring appropriate resources 
these costs or charges could negatively impact results of operations for a given period  cause quarter to quarter variability in our operating results or negatively impact our operating results for several future periods 
our operating results fluctuate within each quarter and from quarter to quarter making our future revenue and operating results difficult to predict 
our quarterly operating results have fluctuated in the past and may do so in the future 
these fluctuations could cause our stock price to change significantly or experience declines 
some of the factors that could cause our operating results to fluctuate include general global economic conditions  the timing of the introduction of new products by us or our competitors  lower growth or contraction of our upgrade or maintenance programs  stock based compensation expense  fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates  the financial and business condition of our reseller and distribution channels  failure to achieve anticipated levels of customer acceptance of key new applications  failure to follow sales policies  unexpected costs or other operating expenses  changes in product pricing or product mix  platform changes  failure to expand our autocad and autocad lt products customer base to related d vertical industry and d model based design products  timing of product releases and retirements  failure to continue momentum of frequent release cycles or to move a significant number of customers from prior product versions in connection with our programs to retire major products  failure to accurately predict the impact of acquired businesses  failure to successfully or fully integrate acquired businesses and technologies  unexpected outcomes of matters relating to litigation  failure to achieve continued cost reductions and productivity increases  unanticipated changes in tax rates and tax laws  distribution channel management  changes in sales compensation practices  the timing of large sales  failure to effectively implement our copyright legalization programs  especially in developing countries  failure to achieve sufficient sell through in our channels for new or existing products  renegotiation or termination of royalty or intellectual property arrangements  interruptions or terminations in the business of our consultants or third party developers  failure to grow lifecycle management or collaboration products  and unanticipated impact of accounting for technology acquisitions 
we have also experienced fluctuations in operating results in interim periods in certain geographic regions due to seasonality or regional economic conditions 
in particular  our operating results in europe during our third quarter are usually affected by a slow summer period  and our asia pacific operations typically experience seasonal slowing in our third and fourth quarters 
our operating expenses are based in part on our expectations for future revenue and are relatively fixed in the short term 
accordingly  any revenue shortfall below expectations could have an immediate and significant adverse effect on our profitability 
greater than anticipated expenses or a failure to maintain rigorous cost controls would also negatively affect profitability 
further  gross margins may be adversely affected if our sales of autocad lt  upgrades and advanced systems products  which historically have had lower margins  grow at a faster rate than sales of our higher margin products 
because we derive a substantial portion of our net revenue from autocad based software products  if these products are not successful  our net revenue will be adversely affected 
we derive a substantial portion of our net revenue from sales of licenses of autocad software  including products based on autocad that serve specific vertical markets  upgrades to those products and products that are interoperable with autocad 
as such  any factor adversely affecting sales of these products  including the product release cycle  market acceptance  product competition  performance and reliability  reputation  price competition  economic and market conditions and the availability of third party applications  would likely harm our operating results 

table of contents we are dependent on international revenue and operations  exposing us to significant regulatory  global economic  intellectual property  collections  currency exchange rate  taxation and other risks  which could adversely impact our financial results 
we are dependent on our international operations for a significant portion of our revenue 
our international revenue  including that from emerging economies  is subject to general economic and political conditions in foreign markets  including conditions in foreign markets resulting from economic and political conditions in the us these factors have recently adversely impacted and may in the future continue to adversely impact our future international revenue  and consequently our business as a whole 
further  our dependency on international revenue makes us much more exposed to global economic trends  which can negatively impact our financial results  even if our results in the us are strong for a particular period 
in addition  we anticipate that our international operations will continue to account for a significant portion of our net revenue  and as we expand our international development  sales and marketing expertise  will provide significant support to our overall efforts in countries outside of the us risks inherent in our international operations include fluctuating currency exchange rates  including risks related to any hedging activities we undertake  unexpected changes in regulatory requirements  practices and tariffs  difficulties in staffing and managing foreign sales and development operations  longer collection cycles for accounts receivable  potential changes in tax laws  tax arrangements with foreign governments and laws regarding the management of data  possible future limitations upon foreign owned businesses  and greater difficulty in protecting intellectual property 
we have been named as a party in lawsuits related to our historical stock option practices and related accounting  and we may be named in additional litigation in the future  all of which could result in an unfavorable outcome and have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations  cash flows and the trading price for our securities 
we are currently defending two lawsuits that have been filed against us and our current officers and certain of our current and former directors and officers relating to our historical stock option practices and related accounting 
see note  commitments and contingencies in the notes to consolidated financial statements for a more detailed description of these proceedings 
the ultimate outcomes of these actions could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations  cash flows and the trading price for our securities 
we may become the subject of additional private or government actions in the future  including stockholder or employee litigation 
litigation may be time consuming  expensive and disruptive to normal business operations  and the outcome of litigation is difficult to predict 
the defense of lawsuits may result in significant expenditures and the diversion of our management s time and attention from the operation of our business  which could impede our business 
all or a portion of any amount we may be required to pay to satisfy a judgment or settlement of any claims may not be covered by insurance 
our business could be adversely affected if we are unable to attract and retain key personnel 
our success depends largely on our ability to attract and retain highly skilled technical  professional  managerial  sales and marketing personnel 
historically  competition for these personnel has been intense  for example  over the past several quarters we have been actively recruiting a new chief financial officer 
the loss of services of any of our key personnel  the inability to retain and attract qualified personnel in the future  or delays in hiring required personnel  particularly engineering and sales personnel  could make it difficult to meet key objectives  such as timely and effective product introductions and financial goals 
existing and increased competition may reduce our net revenue and profits 
the software industry has limited barriers to entry  and the availability of desktop computers with continually expanding performance at progressively lower prices contributes to the ease of market entry 
the 
table of contents markets in which we compete are characterized by vigorous competition  both by entry of competitors with innovative technologies and by consolidation of companies with complementary products and technologies 
in addition  some of our competitors in certain markets have greater financial  technical  sales and marketing and other resources 
furthermore  a reduction in the number and availability of compatible third party applications may adversely affect the sale of our products 
because of these and other factors  competitive conditions in the industry are likely to intensify in the future 
increased competition could result in continued price reductions  reduced net revenue and profit margins and loss of market share  any of which would likely harm our business 
we believe that our future results depend largely upon our ability to offer products that compete favorably with respect to reliability  performance  ease of use  range of useful features  continuing product enhancements  reputation and price 
if we are not able to adequately protect our proprietary rights  our business could be harmed 
we rely on a combination of patent  copyright and trademark laws  trade secret protections  confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions to protect our proprietary rights 
despite such efforts to protect our proprietary rights  unauthorized parties from time to time have copied aspects of our software products or have obtained and used information that we regard as proprietary 
policing unauthorized use of our software products is time consuming and costly 
while we have recovered some revenue resulting from the unauthorized use of our software products  we are unable to measure the extent to which piracy of our software products exists and software piracy can be expected to be a persistent problem 
furthermore  our means of protecting our proprietary rights may not be adequate 
we may face intellectual property infringement claims that could be costly to defend and result in our loss of significant rights 
as more software patents are granted worldwide  as the number of products and competitors in our industry segments grow and as the functionality of products in different industry segments overlap  we expect that software product developers will be increasingly subject to infringement claims 
infringement or misappropriation claims have in the past been  and may in the future be  asserted against us  and any such assertions could harm our business 
additionally  certain patent holders without products have become more aggressive in threatening and pursuing litigation in attempts to obtain fees for licensing the right to use patents 
any such claims or threats  whether with or without merit  have been and could in the future be time consuming to defend  result in costly litigation and diversion of resources  or could cause product shipment delays or require us to enter into royalty or licensing agreements 
in addition  such royalty or license agreements  if required  may not be available on acceptable terms  if at all  which would likely harm our business 
while we believe we currently have adequate internal control over financial reporting  we are required to evaluate our internal control over financial reporting under section of the sarbanes oxley act of and any adverse results from such evaluation could result in a loss of investor confidence in our financial reports and have an adverse effect on our stock price 
pursuant to section  we are required to furnish a report by our management on our internal control over financial reporting 
the report contains  among other matters  an assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of the end of our fiscal year  including a statement as to whether or not our internal control over financial reporting is effective 
this assessment must include disclosure of any material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting identified by management 
while we have determined in our management report on internal control over financial reporting included in this annual report on form k  that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of january   we must continue to monitor and assess our internal control over financial reporting 
if our management identifies one or more material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting and such weakness remains uncorrected at fiscal year end  we will be unable to assert such internal control is effective at 
table of contents fiscal year end 
if we are unable to assert that our internal control over financial reporting is effective at fiscal year end or if our independent registered public accounting firm is unable to express an opinion on the effectiveness of our internal controls or concludes that we have a material weakness in our internal controls  we could lose investor confidence in the accuracy and completeness of our financial reports  which would likely have an adverse effect on our business and stock price 
in preparing our financial statements we make certain assumptions  judgments and estimates about our accruals  which  if not accurate  may significantly impact our financial results 
we make accruals for a number of items  including employee bonuses  partner incentive programs  product returns reserve  sales commissions  sabbatical  asset retirement obligations and allowance for doubtful accounts 
these accruals are based on assumptions  judgments and estimates drawn from historical experience and various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances when made 
actual results could differ materially from our estimated accruals  and such differences could significantly impact our financial results 
changes in existing financial accounting standards or practices  or taxation rules or practices may adversely affect our results of operations 
changes in existing accounting or taxation rules or practices  new accounting pronouncements or taxation rules  or varying interpretations of current accounting pronouncements or taxation practice could have a significant adverse effect on our results of operations or the manner in which we conduct our business 
further  such changes could potentially affect our reporting of transactions completed before such changes are effective 
for example  effective as of february   we adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 
revised business combinations sfas r  which requires acquisition related costs to be expensed as incurred  restructuring costs generally to be expensed in periods subsequent to the acquisition date  in process research and development to be capitalized as an intangible asset with an indefinite life  and changes in accounting for deferred tax asset valuation allowances and acquired income tax uncertainties after the measurement period  which will impact income tax expense 
the impact that sfas r has on our consolidated financial position  results of operations and cash flows will be dependent on the number and size of business combinations that the company consummates subsequent to the adoption of the standard  as well as the valuation and allocation of the net assets acquired 
our operating results could be negatively impacted if our tax positions are successfully challenged by tax authorities 
we are a us based multinational company subject to tax in multiple us and foreign tax jurisdictions 
our effective tax rate is based on expected geographic mix of earnings  statutory rates  intercompany transfer pricing  and enacted tax rules 
significant judgment is required in determining our effective tax rate and in evaluating our tax positions on a worldwide basis 
we believe our tax positions  including intercompany transfer pricing policies  are consistent with the tax laws in the jurisdictions in which we conduct our business 
it is possible that these positions may be challenged by jurisdictional tax authorities and may have a significant impact on our effective tax rate 
we rely on third party technologies and if we are unable to use or integrate these technologies  our product and service development may be delayed 
we rely on certain software that we license from third parties  including software that is integrated with internally developed software and used in our products to perform key functions 
these third party software licenses may not continue to be available on commercially reasonable terms  and the software may not be appropriately supported  maintained or enhanced by the licensors 
the loss of licenses to  or inability to support  maintain and enhance any such software could result in increased costs  or in delays or reductions in product shipments until equivalent software can be developed  identified  licensed and integrated  which would likely harm our business 

table of contents we regularly invest resources to update and improve our internal information technology systems 
should our investments not succeed  or if delays or other issues with new or existing internal technology systems disrupt our operations  our business could be harmed 
we rely on our network and data center infrastructure  internal technology systems and our websites for our development  marketing  operational  support and sales activities 
we are continually investing resources to update and improve these systems and environments in order to meet the growing requirements of our business and customers 
such improvements are often complex  costly and time consuming 
in addition  such improvements can be challenging to integrate with our existing technology systems  or uncover problems with our existing technology systems 
unsuccessful implementation of hardware or software updates and improvements could result in disruption in our business operations  loss of revenue or damage to our reputation 
disruptions with licensing relationships and third party developers could adversely impact our business 
we license certain key technologies from third parties 
licenses may be restricted in the term or the use of such technology in ways that negatively affect our business 
similarly  we may not be able to obtain or renew license agreements for key technology on favorable terms  if at all  and any failure to do so could harm our business 
our business strategy has historically depended in part on our relationships with third party developers who provide products that expand the functionality of our design software 
some developers may elect to support other products or may experience disruption in product development and delivery cycles or financial pressure during periods of economic downturn 
in particular markets  such disruption would likely negatively impact these third party developers and end users  which could harm our business 
additionally  technology created by outsourced product development  whether outsourced to third parties or developed externally and transferred to us through business or technology acquisitions have certain additional risks 
these risks include potential difficulties with effective integration into existing products  adequate transfer of technology know how and ownership and protection of transferred intellectual property 
as a result of our strategy of partnering with other companies for product development  our product delivery schedules could be adversely affected if we experience difficulties with our product development partners 
we partner with certain independent firms and contractors to perform some of our product development activities 
we believe our partnering strategy allows us to  among other things  achieve efficiencies in developing new products and maintaining and enhancing existing product offerings 
our partnering strategy creates a dependency on such independent developers 
independent developers  including those who currently develop products for us in the us and throughout the world  may not be able or willing to provide development support to us in the future 
in addition  use of development resources through consulting relationships  particularly in non us jurisdictions with developing legal systems  may be adversely impacted by  and expose us to risks relating to  evolving employment  export and intellectual property laws 
these risks could  among other things  expose our intellectual property to misappropriation and result in disruptions to product delivery schedules

in addition  we are involved in legal proceedings from time to time arising from the normal course of business activities including claims of alleged infringement of intellectual property rights  commercial  employment  piracy prosecution and other matters 
in our opinion  resolution of pending matters is not expected to have a material adverse impact on its consolidated results of operations  cash flows or its financial position

we assume no obligation to update the forward looking statements to reflect events that occur or circumstances that exist after the date on which they were made 
strategy our goal is to be the world s leading d and d design and engineering software and services company for the architecture  engineering  and construction  manufacturing  geospatial mapping  and digital media and entertainment markets 
worldwide business trends such as globalization  sustainability  investment in infrastructure  and the increasing desire to keep data digital  are creating pressure on our customers to improve innovation while enhancing productivity 
we offer our customers the ability to visualize and simulate real world performance early in the design process through digital prototyping to foster innovation  enhance quality  and save time and money for competitive advantage 
our customers are seeking differentiation through design  and we believe our products provide a competitive advantage to succeed in this environment 
we believe that our ability to make technology available to mainstream markets is one of our competitive advantages 
by innovating in existing technology categories  we bring powerful design products to volume markets 
our products are designed to be easy to learn and use  and to provide customers low cost of deployment  low total cost of ownership and a rapid return on investment 
in addition  our software architecture allows for extensibility and integration with other products 
we believe that our technological leadership  brand recognition  breadth of product line and large installed base will help us weather the economic storm and position us well for an eventual recovery 
we have created a large global community of distributors and resellers  third party developers and customers 
these relationships provide us with a broad reach into volume markets 
our distributor and reseller network is extensive and provides our customers with global resources for the purchase and support of our products as well as resources for effective and cost efficient training services 
we believe the strength of our channel will help us maintain our leadership throughout the economic downturn 
the overall health of our channel partners remains vitally important to us 
we have an active partner assistance program in place on a global basis  and we will continue to work closely with our partners in a collaborative effort to fight through the current economic downturn 
we have a significant number of registered third party developers that create products that operate with our software products  further extending our reach into volume markets 
users trained on our products are broadly available both from educational institutions and the existing work force  reducing the cost of training for our customers 
to train the next generation of users  we offer education programs  including classroom support  standardized curricula  instructor development  and specially priced software purchasing options 

table of contents our growth strategy derives from these core strengths 
we continue to increase the business value of our design tools in a number of ways 
we improve the performance and functionality of existing products with each new release 
our most recent product release commenced in march beyond our d horizontal design products  we develop products addressing industry specific needs including d vertical and d model based products 
we continually strive to improve our product functionality and specialization by industry while increasing product interoperability and usability 
we are also considering innovative ways of delivering better user experiences to the customers we serve 
as a result  we drive technology democratization and increase customer loyalty 
in addition  we believe that expanding our d horizontal product customers portfolios to include our d vertical products and d model based design products presents a meaningful growth opportunity and is an important part of our overall strategy 
for fiscal  revenue from d model based design products increased  including a increase in related maintenance revenue  as compared to the prior fiscal year 
we shipped approximately  commercial seats which includes new seats and crossgrade seats of d model based design products  including approximately  seats of autodesk inventor and autodesk moldflow  and approximately  seats of our architecture  engineering and construction products autodesk revit  autocad civil d  autodesk navisworks and autodesk robobat 
we expect that the adoption of d vertical products and d model based design products will increase the productivity of our customers in all industries and result in richer design data 
this migration also poses various risks to us 
in particular  if we do not successfully expand our d horizontal customer base to our d vertical products and d model based design products as expected  then we would not realize the growth we expect and our business would be adversely affected 
expanding our geographic coverage is another key element of our growth strategy 
we believe that emerging economies continue to present long term growth opportunities for us  although revenue from emerging economies declined for the fourth quarter of fiscal as compared to the same period of the prior fiscal year 
for all of fiscal  revenue from emerging economies increased as compared to fiscal revenue from emerging economies represented of fiscal net revenue as compared to of fiscal net revenue 
while we believe there are long term growth opportunities in emerging economies  conducting business in these countries presents significant challenges  including the current economic contraction in those countries  intellectual property protection and software piracy 
our strategy includes improving our product functionality and expanding our product offerings through internal development as well as through the acquisition of products  technology and businesses 
acquisitions often increase the speed at which we can deliver product functionality to our customers  however  they entail integration challenges and may  in certain instances  negatively impact our operating margins 
we continually review these trade offs in making our decisions of whether to make acquisitions 
the size and frequency of transactions to acquire products  technology and businesses increased during fiscal and the second half of fiscal as compared to earlier periods 
we currently anticipate that we will selectively acquire products  technology and businesses as compelling opportunities that promote our strategy become available  but the pace at which we make such investments will vary depending upon our business needs  the availability of suitable sellers and technology  and our own financial condition 
global economic conditions deteriorated significantly during our fiscal year ended january  economic contraction in most countries and markets  and global financial market instability  including tighter credit  is adversely impacting our business 
we have seen demand for our products and services decline in each of our major geographies and all the industries we serve  particularly during our most recent fiscal quarter that ended on january  we have taken  and continue to take  actions to address these global economic changes and how they are affecting our financial condition 
our strategy remains focused on leveraging our core strengths and investing in our long term growth opportunities to achieve our goal of being the world s leading d and d design and engineering software and services company for the architecture  engineering  and construction  manufacturing  geospatial mapping  and digital media and entertainment markets 

table of contents critical accounting policies and estimates our consolidated financial statements are prepared in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles 
in preparing our consolidated financial statements  we make assumptions  judgments and estimates that can have a significant impact on amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements 
we base our assumptions  judgments and estimates on historical experience and various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results could differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we regularly reevaluate our assumptions  judgments and estimates 
we believe that of our significant accounting policies  which are described in note  business and summary of significant accounting policies  in the notes to consolidated financial statements  the following policies involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity 
accordingly  these are the policies we believe are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our financial condition and results of operations 
revenue recognition 
our accounting policies and practices are in compliance with statement of position  software revenue recognition  as amended  and sec staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition 
we recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  the price is fixed or determinable and collection is probable 
however  determining whether and when some of these criteria have been satisfied often involves assumptions and judgments that can have a significant impact on the timing and amount of revenue we report 
for multiple element arrangements that include software products  we allocate the sales price among each of the deliverables using the residual method  under which revenue is allocated to undelivered elements based on their vendor specific objective evidence vsoe of fair value 
vsoe is the price charged when an element is sold separately or a price set by management with the relevant authority 
if we do not have vsoe of the undelivered element  we defer revenue recognition on the entire sales arrangement until all elements for which we do not have vsoe are delivered 
we are required to exercise judgment in determining whether vsoe exists for each undelivered element based on whether our pricing for these elements is sufficiently consistent 
our assessment of likelihood of collection is also a critical factor in determining the timing of revenue recognition 
if we do not believe that collection is probable  the revenue will be deferred until the earlier of when collection is deemed probable or payment is received 
our indirect channel model includes both a two tiered distribution structure  where distributors sell to resellers  and a one tiered structure where autodesk sells directly to resellers 
our product license revenue from distributors and resellers are generally recognized at the time title to our product passes to the distributor  in a two tiered structure  or reseller  in a one tiered structure  provided all other criteria for revenue recognition are met 
this policy is predicated on our ability to estimate sales returns among other criteria 
we are also required to evaluate whether our distributors and resellers have the ability to honor their commitment to make fixed or determinable payments  regardless of whether they collect payment from their customers 
our policy also presumes that we have no significant performance obligations in connection with the sale of our product licenses by our distributors and resellers to their customers 
if we were to change any of these assumptions or judgments  it could cause a material increase or decrease in the amount of revenue that we report in a particular period 
product returns reserves 
we permit our distributors and resellers to return products up to a percentage of prior quarter purchases 
the product returns reserve is based on historical experience of actual product returns  estimated channel inventory levels  the timing of new product introductions and promotions  channel sell in for applicable markets and other factors 
our product returns reserves were million at january  and million at january  product returns as a percentage of applicable revenue were in fiscal  in fiscal and in fiscal during fiscal year and  we recorded additions to our product returns reserves of million and million  respectively  which reduced our revenue 

table of contents marketable securities 
at january  we had million of short and long term marketable securities 
we review our investments in marketable securities quarterly for indicators of other than temporary impairment 
this determination requires significant judgment 
in making this determination  we employ a systematic methodology that considers available quantitative and qualitative evidence 
if the cost of an investment exceeds its fair value  we evaluate  among other factors  general market conditions  the duration and extent to which the fair value is less than cost  and our intent and ability to hold the investment 
we also consider specific adverse conditions related to the financial health of  and business outlook for  the sponsor  including industry and sector performance  operational and financing cash flow factors  and rating agency actions 
once a decline in fair value is determined to be other than temporary  an impairment charge is recorded to our consolidated statements of income 
this impairment results in a new cost basis in the investment recorded in our consolidated balance sheets 
if market  industry  and or sponsor conditions deteriorate  we may incur future impairments 
determining the fair value of marketable securities that are not actively traded requires significant judgment 
we recorded a million impairment charge during fiscal this impairment related to investments in two money market funds the reserve international liquidity fund the international fund and the reserve primary fund the primary fund  and together with the international fund  the reserve funds 
we believe this impairment charge is other than temporary  therefore  we recorded the amount as an expense under interest and other income expense  net in our consolidated statements of income 
the impairment occurred as a result of the reserve funds revaluing their holdings of debt securities issued by lehman brothers  which filed for chapter bankruptcy on september   and the resulting unusually high redemption requests on the reserve funds 
certain past and future distributions from the reserve funds are currently under dispute by fund investors and the actual amount of the loss on these investments is uncertain at this time 
the cost basis of our investment in the reserve funds immediately prior to september  was million  we received million in distributions from the reserve funds during the third and fourth quarters of fiscal as of january   the cost basis of amounts still invested in the reserve funds by us and awaiting distribution was approximately million 
we believe we will receive substantially all of our remaining investment balance within the next twelve months  therefore  these assets are classified as current in our consolidated balance sheet 
in addition  at january   we had auction rate securities with an estimated fair value of million million cost basis included in non current marketable securities due to their lack of liquidity 
we determined that these securities are other than temporarily impaired  and we recorded a million impairment charge in the fourth quarter of fiscal see further discussion of these reserve fund and auction rate securities in liquidity and capital resources section below 
goodwill 
we test goodwill for impairment annually in the fourth quarter or sooner should events or changes in circumstances indicate potential impairment 
when assessing goodwill for impairment  we use discounted cash flow models which include assumptions regarding projected cash flows 
variances in these assumptions could have a significant impact on our conclusion as to whether goodwill is impaired  or the amount of any impairment charge 
impairment charges  if any  result from instances where the fair values of net assets associated with goodwill are less than their carrying values 
as changes in business conditions and our assumptions occur  we may be required to record impairment charges 
we recorded an impairment charge of approximately million affecting the fourth quarter of fiscal representing the entire goodwill balance associated with our media and entertainment m e segment as of october  during the fourth quarter  revenue and cash flow projections for all segments were substantially impacted by the sharp downturn in the global economy and in our business 
the m e segment was the only segment which had a current fair value of its future discounted cash flows that fell below the carrying value of its assets 
should our revenue and cash flow projections decline significantly in the future  additional impairment charges may be recorded on goodwill 
see further discussion of this impairment charge in note  business and summary of significant accounting policies  in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 

table of contents realizability of long lived assets 
we assess the realizability of our long lived assets and related intangible assets  other than goodwill  annually during the fourth fiscal quarter  or sooner should events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying values of such assets may not be recoverable 
we consider the following factors important in determining when to perform an impairment review significant under performance of a business or product line relative to budget  shifts in business strategies which affect the continued uses of the assets  significant negative industry or economic trends  and the results of past impairment reviews 
in assessing the recoverability of these long lived assets  we first determine their fair values  which are based on assumptions regarding the estimated future cash flows that could reasonably be generated by these assets 
if impairment indicators were present based on our undiscounted cash flow models  which include assumptions regarding projected cash flows  we discounted the cash flows to assess impairments on long lived assets 
variances in these assumptions could have a significant impact on our conclusion as to whether an asset is impaired or the amount of any impairment charge 
impairment charges  if any  result in situations where any fair values of these assets are less than their carrying values 
in addition to our recoverability assessments  we routinely review the remaining estimated useful lives of our long lived assets 
any reduction in the useful life assumption will result in increased depreciation and amortization expense in the quarter when such determinations are made  as well as in subsequent quarters 
we will continue to evaluate the values of our long lived assets in accordance with applicable accounting rules 
as changes in business conditions and our assumptions occur  we may be required to record impairment charges 
income taxes 
we currently have million of net deferred tax assets  mostly arising from tax credits  net operating losses  and timing differences for reserves  accrued liabilities  stock options  purchased technologies and capitalized software  partially offset by the establishment of us deferred tax liabilities on unremitted earnings from certain foreign subsidiaries and acquired intangibles 
we perform a quarterly assessment of the recoverability of these net deferred tax assets and believe that we will generate sufficient future taxable income in appropriate tax jurisdictions to realize the net deferred tax assets 
our judgments regarding future profitability may change due to future market conditions and other factors 
these changes  if any  may require possible material adjustments to these net deferred tax assets  resulting in a reduction in net income in the period when such determinations are made 
stock based compensation 
we account for stock based compensation in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
revised  share based payment sfas r 
under the fair value recognition provisions of this statement  stock based compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized as expense on a straight line basis over the requisite service period  which is generally the vesting period 
sfas r requires companies to estimate the fair value of stock based payment awards on the date of grant using an option pricing model 
the value of the portion of the award that is ultimately expected to vest is recognized as expense over the requisite service periods in our consolidated statements of income 
we use the black scholes merton option pricing model for determining the estimated fair value for employee stock awards 
this model requires the input of assumptions  including expected stock price volatility  expected life  expected dividend yield and risk free interest rate of each award 
the parameters used in the model are reviewed on a quarterly basis and adjusted  as needed 
compensation expense for employee stock awards is recognized on a straight line basis over the vesting period of the award 
legal contingencies 
as described in part i  item  legal proceedings and part ii  item  note  commitments and contingencies  in the notes to consolidated financial statements  we are periodically involved in various legal claims and proceedings 
we routinely review the status of each significant matter and assess our potential financial exposure 
if the potential loss from any matter is considered probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated  we record a liability for the estimated loss 
because of inherent 
table of contents uncertainties related to these legal matters  we base our loss accruals on the best information available at the time 
as additional information becomes available  we reassess our potential liability and may revise our estimates 
such revisions could have a material impact on future quarterly or annual results of operations 
recently issued accounting standards see note  business and summary of significant accounting policies  in the notes to consolidated financial statements for a full description of recent accounting pronouncements  including the expected dates of adoption and estimated effects on results of operations and financial condition  which is incorporation herein by reference 
overview of fiscal results of operations fiscal year ended january  as a of net revenue fiscal year ended january  as a of net revenue in millions net revenue cost of revenue gross profit operating expenses income from operations during fiscal  as compared to fiscal  net revenue increased  gross profit increased and income from operations decreased 
we expect net revenue to decrease in absolute dollars in fiscal as a result of adverse economic pressures on our customers 
during the third and fourth quarters of fiscal we experienced a dramatic change in the economic conditions of our markets globally 
the first two quarters of fiscal were characterized by net revenue growth of over the same period in the prior fiscal year and we reported an increase in income from operations of for that six month period  which was only slightly lower compared to the same period of the prior year as a result of our acquisition activity during the first six months of fiscal due to the deteriorating global economic conditions during our third and fourth fiscal quarters  our results for the second half of fiscal were a stark contrast to the first half of the fiscal year 
revenue for the second half of fiscal declined by compared to the same period in the prior fiscal year  revenue decreased sequentially and during our third and fourth quarters of fiscal  respectively 
income from operations for the second half of fiscal was approximately break even compared to a positive operating margin for the second half of fiscal  the third quarter fiscal positive operating margin of approximately was offset by a negative operating margin in the fourth quarter fiscal due primarily to a goodwill and intangibles impairment charge of million  and a restructuring charge of million 
our primary goals for fiscal were to continue delivering our market leading products and solutions to our customers  to drive revenue growth  and to invest in product functionality and new product lines while minimizing the impact of these investments on gross profit  operating margins and operating cash flow 
due primarily to the deterioration of the economy during the second half of the year  we were unable to achieve our revenue  operating margin and net income goals 
in january we announced a restructuring plan to reduce headcount by approximately and to consolidate certain facilities around the world in order to reduce our operating expenses 
see further discussion of our restructuring plan in note  restructuring reserves of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
we are taking other actions in an attempt to stimulate demand and align our cost structure with the reality of our recent and anticipated financial results  including a hiring freeze  travel restrictions and other expense initiatives 
in taking these actions  we may incur additional costs which could negatively impact our net income and cash flows from operating activities 

table of contents the decrease in income from operations in fiscal as compared to fiscal was primarily due to goodwill and intangibles impairment charges of million  or percentage points of the decrease  affecting the fourth quarter of fiscal  principally associated with our m e segment  and a restructuring charge of million  or percentage points of the decrease  as well as the impact of in process research and development expenses and intangibles amortization from our acquisition activity 
net revenue for fiscal increased by as compared to fiscal due to a increase in maintenance revenue  slightly offset by a decrease in license and other revenue 
net revenue for our d model based design products increased  while net revenue from our d products remained flat during fiscal  as compared to the prior fiscal year 
a critical component of our growth strategy is to continue to add new d horizontal users  while expanding our customers portfolios to include our higher value d vertical and d model based design products 
for fiscal we experienced growth in net revenue in europe  middle east  africa emea and asia pacific apac 
we generate a significant amount of our revenue in the united states  and in countries outside the united states such as japan  germany  france  the united kingdom  italy  the russian federation  canada  south korea  china and australia 
we benefited from a weaker us dollar relative to foreign currencies in the first three quarters of fiscal  the trend reversed in the fourth quarter of fiscal with the us dollar strengthening against most currencies 
the weaker value of the us dollar relative to foreign currencies for the majority of fiscal had a positive effect of million on operating income in fiscal compared to fiscal had exchange rates from fiscal been in effect during fiscal on a constant currency basis  translated international revenue billed in local currencies would have been million lower and operating expenses would have been million lower 
this represents a increase in net revenue and a decrease in income from operations on a constant currency basis during fiscal as compared to fiscal changes in the value of the us dollar may have a significant effect on net revenue and income from operations in future periods 
we use foreign currency forward and option collar contracts to reduce the exchange rate effect on the net revenue of certain anticipated transactions 
our total operating margin decreased from of net revenue in fiscal to in fiscal this decrease is primarily due to the goodwill and intangibles impairment charge and the restructuring charge discussed above 
these decreases were partially offset by a net revenue increase of 
even in these challenging economic times  we will continue to invest in growth and productivity initiatives so that we will be better positioned for growth when the economy improves 
over the longer term we intend to continue to balance investments in revenue growth opportunities with our goal of increasing our operating margins 
our operating margins are very sensitive to changes in revenue  given the relatively fixed nature of most of our expenses  which consist primarily of employee related expenditures  facilities costs  and depreciation and amortization expense 
for fiscal  we expect total costs and expenses to decrease in absolute dollars as we continue to work on finding ways to align our cost structure with our current financial condition  and increase as a percentage of net revenue during fiscal  as compared to fiscal however  there can be no assurance that our cost structure will not increase in the future or that we will be able to align our cost structure with our expected actual financial results 
in addition  in taking these actions  we may incur additional costs which could negatively impact our net income and cash flows from operating activities 
for the first quarter of fiscal  we expect that our net income will be negative 
net cash flows provided by operating activities of million for fiscal was primarily comprised of net income and the net effect of non cash expenses associated with stock based compensation  the impairment of goodwill and intangibles  primarily related to our m e segment  as well as restructuring charges 
we expect net cash flows provided by operating activities to be negative in the first quarter of fiscal as a result of lower revenue combined with cash expenditures in the quarter for payments of the annual employee incentive plan and payments related to our restructuring plan 

table of contents we rely significantly upon major distributors and resellers in both the us and international regions  including tech data corporation and its global affiliates tech data

we finished fiscal with million in cash and marketable securities of which million is classified as long term 
this is an increase from the million balance at january  we had a million draw outstanding on our million available us line of credit at january  we finished fiscal with million of cash from operating activities as compared to million during the previous fiscal year 
operating cash flows declined primarily due to the significant decrease in net income and a reduction of accrued bonuses and commissions 
for the first quarter of fiscal  we expect cash flow from operating activities to be negative as a result of lower revenue combined with cash outlays in the quarter for payments of the annual employee incentive plan and payments relating to the restructuring plan 
in fiscal we purchased million shares of our common stock for million  and continued to invest in our business through acquisitions  and investments in other growth initiatives 
comparatively  during the prior fiscal year we repurchased million shares of our common stock for million and also completed several acquisitions 
we completed fiscal with a higher deferred revenue balance and lower accounts receivable balance as compared to the previous fiscal year 
our deferred revenue balance at january  included million of customer maintenance contracts related to our maintenance program  which will be recognized as maintenance revenue ratably over the life of the contracts  which is predominantly one year

table of contents fiscal net revenue compared to fiscal net revenue license and other revenue license and other revenue are comprised of two components all forms of product license revenue and other revenue 
product license revenue includes revenue from the sale of new seat licenses  revenue from the autodesk upgrade program and revenue from the autodesk crossgrade program 
other revenue consists of revenue from consulting and training services  revenue from the autodesk developers network  autodesk collaborative solution hosting revenue  revenue from autodesk s former location services division and revenue from advanced systems product support 
we divested the location services division in february  and we do not expect further revenue to be received from it see note  subsequent events  in notes to consolidated financial statements for further information 
total license and other revenue decreased during fiscal  as compared to fiscal commercial new seat revenue from our d model based design products and d products for fiscal was flat compared to fiscal during fiscal  we experienced a decrease of approximately percentage points due to lower number of seat licenses sold  offset by an increase of approximately percentage points due to higher average net revenue per seat 
during fiscal  there was less correlation between revenue growth and seat license growth due to changes in our mix of geographies and products  proportion of maintenance in the user base  currency exchange rates  and average selling prices  and we expect this trend to continue 
as a percentage of total net revenue  license and other revenue was for fiscal  for fiscal  and for fiscal we expect license and other revenue to decrease in absolute dollars in fiscal  as compared to fiscal  as a result of adverse economic pressures on our customers 
upgrade revenue  which includes crossgrade revenue  decreased by during fiscal as compared to fiscal  as expected 
the decrease in upgrade revenue was driven primarily from the relatively smaller size of the upgradeable base of our autocad based products in fiscal as compared to the upgradeable base of our autocad based products in fiscal  due to more customers on our maintenance program 
over the long term  we expect revenue from upgrades to decrease as we continue to move customers onto our maintenance program 
revenue from the sales of our services  training and support  included in license and other  represented less than of net revenue for all periods presented 
maintenance revenue under our maintenance program  customers are eligible to receive unspecified upgrades when and if available  downloadable training courses and online support 
we recognize maintenance revenue ratably over the maintenance contract periods 
maintenance revenue increased for fiscal as compared to fiscal approximately percentage points of the increase was due to increases in program enrollment and approximately percentage points of the increase was due to higher net revenue per maintenance seat for fiscal as compared to the same period of the prior fiscal year 
as a percentage of total net revenue  maintenance revenue was for fiscal  for fiscal  and for fiscal our maintenance program  available to most customers worldwide  continues to provide a cost effective and predictable budgetary option to obtain the productivity benefits of upgrades and enhancements when and if released during the term of their contracts 
we expect maintenance revenue to decrease in absolute dollars in fiscal as a result of decreased program enrollment from declines in new product sales as well as maintenance attach and renewal rates 
at january  our maintenance program enrollment consisted of about million users 
aggregate backlog at january  and january  was million and million  respectively  of which million and million  respectively  represented deferred revenue and million and million  respectively  related to current software license product orders that had not yet shipped at the end of each respective fiscal year 
deferred revenue consists primarily of deferred maintenance revenue 

table of contents to a lesser extent  deferred revenue consists of deferred license and other revenue derived from collaborative project management services  consulting services and deferred license sales 
backlog from current software license product orders that we have not yet shipped consists of orders for currently available licensed software products from customers with approved credit status and may include orders with current ship dates and orders with ship dates beyond the current fiscal period 
net revenue by geographic area net revenue in the americas region decreased by during fiscal as compared to fiscal  as a result of a decrease in revenue from new seats in the americas and a decrease in revenue from upgrades  offset in part by a increase in maintenance revenue 
growth in the americas was affected by a slowing economy that impacted growth rates for all of our products in fiscal net revenue in emea increased by  or on a constant currency basis  during fiscal  as compared to fiscal  primarily due to a increase in maintenance revenue and a increase in new seat revenue  slightly offset by a decrease in revenue from upgrades 
emea s growth during fiscal was primarily due to growth in the emea emerging economies  as well as in germany  france  switzerland  italy  belgium and sweden

international net revenue represented of our net revenue in fiscal and of our net revenue in fiscal we started to experience some economic difficulty in international sales in the third quarter of fiscal global conditions have worsened since then  and the economic downturn significantly impacted our international sales during the fourth quarter of fiscal  particularly the robust business we had been seeing in emerging economies 
net revenue in emerging economies grew by from fiscal to fiscal  primarily due to revenue from the russian federation  other emea emerging economies and india 
this growth was a significant factor in our international sales growth during fiscal in contrast  fourth quarter fiscal net revenue in the emea and apac regions decreased and  respectively  compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal  and net revenue from emerging economies declined for the fourth quarter of fiscal as compared to the same period of the prior fiscal year 
further economic weakness in any of the countries that contributes a significant portion of our net revenue could have an even greater adverse effect on our business in those countries 
changes in the value of the us dollar relative to foreign currencies could also significantly affect our future financial results for a given period

direct material and overhead charges include the cost of hardware sold mainly pc based workstations for advanced systems in the m e segment  costs associated with transferring our software to electronic media  printing of user manuals and packaging materials and shipping and handling costs 
cost of license and other revenue increased during fiscal  as compared to fiscal even though license and other revenue decreased by 
cost of license and other revenue increased in fiscal due to an increase in amortization of purchased technology due to the number of acquisitions completed during fiscal years and  slightly offset by decreases in employee related expenses 
since many of these costs are headcount related expenses  they do not vary proportionally with changes in revenue

overall  we increased our investment in research and development during fiscal as compared to the prior fiscal year to create new products and new versions of existing products  broader interoperability  accelerated localization efforts and improvements in visualization  simulation and analysis 
we expect research and development expense to decrease in absolute dollars during fiscal as compared to fiscal  as we continue to find ways to reduce our operating expenses to align with our financial condition  and increase as a percentage of net revenue during fiscal  as compared to fiscal 
table of contents during fiscal  we incurred a total of approximately million for consulting services and in process technology purchases from hanna strategies compared to million in fiscal the cost of the in process technology acquired from hanna strategies was immediately recognized as an expense because the technology had not yet reached technological feasibility and had no alternative future use 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal we acquired the remaining ownership interest in hanna strategies for net consideration of million

we expect general and administrative expense to decrease in absolute dollars during fiscal as compared to fiscal  as we continue to find ways to reduce our operating expenses to align with our financial condition  and increase as a percentage of net revenue during fiscal  as compared to fiscal impairment of goodwill and intangibles fiscal year ended january  increase compared to prior fiscal year fiscal year ended january  increase compared to prior fiscal year fiscal year ended january  in millions impairment of goodwill and intangibles as a percentage of net revenue percentage is not meaningful we recorded a million impairment charge affecting the fourth quarter of fiscal  primarily related to impairment of goodwill associated with our m e segment 
during the three months ended january   revenue and cash flow projections for all segments decreased substantially as the economy worsened 
the m e segment was the only segment which had a current fair value that fell below the carrying value of its assets 
should our revenue and cash flow projections decline significantly in the future  additional impairment charges may be recorded on goodwill

table of contents restructuring fiscal year ended january  increase compared to prior fiscal year fiscal year ended january  increase compared to prior fiscal year fiscal year ended january  in millions restructuring as a percentage of net revenue percentage is not meaningful in the fourth quarter of fiscal  we initiated a restructuring program in order to reduce our operating costs 
this program will reduce the number of employees by a total of approximately full time positions globally and will result in the consolidation of up to leased facilities 
in connection with this restructuring plan  we recorded restructuring charges totaling million related to one time termination benefits for the elimination of approximately of these full time positions globally  and we began the consolidation of nine leased facilities during the fourth quarter of fiscal charges associated with these one time termination benefits and consolidation of leased facilities have been recorded in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities 
as of january   million was paid 
the remaining accrual associated with the termination benefits is expected to be substantially paid during the first quarter of fiscal in the first half of fiscal  we expect to record approximately million to million primarily related to one time employee severance arrangements for the elimination of approximately full time positions globally  and approximately million to million related to the consolidation of leased facilities 
we expect to pay the facility related liabilities through fiscal if our revenue should continue to decline significantly we will look to further reduce our operating expenses to align them with our financial condition  including the possibility of a further restructuring 
in taking these actions  we may incur additional costs which could negatively impact our net income and cash flows from operating activities

the decrease in interest and investment income  net  during fiscal  as compared to fiscal  is primarily due to lower interest rate yields 
the increase in interest and investment income  net  during fiscal  as compared to fiscal  reflects proportionately higher cash balances and interest rate yields during fiscal the increase in interest and investment income  net  for fiscal  as compared to fiscal  was partially offset by a loss on a cost method investment and an impairment of our historical equity investment in hanna strategies

 fin which clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in tax positions 
under fin  companies are required to recognize the benefit from a tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position would be sustained upon audit based solely on the technical merits of the tax position 
fin clarified how a company would measure the income tax benefits from the tax positions that are recognized  provides guidance as to the timing of the derecognition of previously recognized tax benefits  and describes the methods for classifying and disclosing the liabilities within the financial statements for any unrecognized tax benefits 
the provisions of fin were effective as of the beginning of our fiscal year  with the cumulative effect of the change in accounting principle recorded as an adjustment to opening retained earnings 
based on our assessment  we recorded an increase to opening retained earnings during the first quarter of fiscal for tax benefits not previously recognized of million as a result of adopting fin our effective tax rate was and during fiscal and  respectively 
our effective tax rate increased from fiscal to fiscal primarily due to non deductible goodwill impairment and in process research and development expenses

table of contents liquidity and capital resources our primary source of cash is from the sale of licenses to our products 
our primary use of cash is payment of our operating costs which consist primarily of employee related expenses  such as compensation and benefits  as well as general operating expenses for marketing  facilities and overhead costs 
in addition to operating expenses  we also use cash to invest in our growth initiatives  which include acquisitions of products  technology and businesses and to fund our stock repurchase program 
see further discussion of these items below 
at january   our principal sources of liquidity were cash  cash equivalents and short term marketable securities totaling million  net accounts receivable of million and million of outstanding under our lines of credit 
we have a us line of credit facility that permits unsecured short term borrowings of up to million and a china line of credit that permits unsecured short term borrowings of up to million 
these line of credit agreements contain customary covenants that could restrict the imposition of liens on our assets  and restrict our ability to incur additional indebtedness or make dispositions of assets if we fail to maintain their financial covenants 
the lines of credit are available for working capital or other business needs 
we drew on the us line of credit during fiscal due to temporary differences between cash needs and cash availability in the us during fiscal we principally used the facility to fund the million share stock repurchase and for the acquisition of moldflow 
at january   we had million outstanding on the us line of credit 
at january   we had million outstanding on the china line of credit 
we drew on the china line of credit due to temporary differences between cash needs and cash availability in china 
the us facility expires in august and the current china facility draw matures in may the china facility is a short term revolving facility which may be canceled or called at any time with days written notice 
as of march   the balances outstanding on the us and china line of credit facilities were million and million  respectively 
our primary commercial banking relationship is with citibank and its global affiliates citibank 
our cash and cash equivalents are held by diversified financial institutions globally  and the portion of our cash and cash equivalents held by citibank has been significantly reduced during the fourth quarter of fiscal citicorp usa  inc  an affiliate of citibank  is the lead lender and agent in the syndicate of our million us line of credit 
recently  citibank  like many financial institutions  has obtained government assistance 
at january   our short term investment portfolio consisted of term deposits  money market funds and mutual funds with an estimated fair value of million  and a cost basis of million 
of this cost basis amount  million was invested in a defined set of mutual funds as directed by the participants in our deferred compensation plan see note  deferred compensation in the notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion  and million was invested in bank term deposits with original maturities greater than days and less than one year 
the remaining million was invested in two money market funds million was invested in the reserve international liquidity fund the international fund and million was invested in the reserve primary fund the primary fund  and together with the international fund  the reserve funds 
in mid september  the reserve funds ceased redemptions after net asset values of the funds decreased below per share 
this occurred as a result of the reserve funds revaluing their holdings of debt securities issued by lehman brothers  which filed for chapter bankruptcy on september   and the resulting unusually high redemption requests on the reserve funds 
accordingly  we recorded million other than temporary impairment impacting fiscal the impairment expense was recorded in interest and other income expense  net in the consolidated statements of income 
the timing of redemptions from the reserve funds currently is undetermined 
the sec is overseeing the administration  accounting and payout of the us based primary fund  and a third party court appointed supervisor is overseeing  but not managing  the accounting and payment administration of the non us based international fund 
at this time  these investments are not currently liquid  and in the event we need to access these funds  we will not be able to do so 
however  it is our current belief that the distributions for the reserve funds will occur within the next months 
accordingly  the reserve funds are classified in current marketable securities in the consolidated balance sheets as of january  this re designation is included in purchases of 
table of contents available for sale marketable securities in the investing activities section of the consolidated statements of cash flows 
in the third and fourth quarters of fiscal  the reserve funds made a partial distribution under which we received million  leaving an additional million  on a cost basis  still outstanding 
at january   our investment portfolio included two auction rate securities with an estimated fair value of million and a cost basis of million 
our auction rate securities are variable rate debt instruments that have underlying securities with contractual maturities greater than ten years and interest rates that were structured to reset at auction every days 
the securities  which met our investment guidelines at the time the investments were made  have failed to settle in auctions since august in addition  these auction rate securities  which were previously aaa rated  were downgraded during fiscal under the contractual terms of these investments  because the auctions failed to settle  the interest rate on these investments reset by increasing to the libor rate plus basis points  which represents a premium interest rate on these investments 
at this time  these investments are not currently liquid  and in the event we need to access these funds  we will not be able to do so without a loss of principal unless a future auction is successful  or a secondary market is available 
in fiscal we recorded an other than temporary impairment of million related to these investments 
the impairment expense was recorded in interest and other income expense  net in the consolidated statements of income 
due to the lack of liquidity of these investments  they are included in marketable securities non current 
we will continue to evaluate our accounting for our investments on a quarterly basis 
see note  financial instruments  in notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion of our financial instruments 
net cash flows provided by operating activities of million for fiscal was primarily comprised of net income and the net effect of non cash expenses associated with the impairment of goodwill and intangibles  primarily related to our m e segment  as well as restructuring charges 
the primary working capital sources of cash were decreases in accounts receivable and increases in deferred revenue 
the decrease in accounts receivable relates primarily to reduced billings at the end of fiscal due to a decline in revenue 
our days sales outstanding in trade receivables reflect the seasonality in maintenance billings  and was days at january  and the primary working capital use of cash was decreased accrued expenses primarily due to lower accrued employee bonuses and commissions 
we expect net cash flows provided by operating activities to be negative in the first quarter of fiscal as a result of lower revenue combined with cash expenditures in the quarter for payments of the annual employee incentive plan and payments related to our restructuring plan 
other than the draws on the lines of credit discussed above  there have been no material changes in our contractual obligations or commercial commitments 
long term cash requirements for items other than normal operating expenses are anticipated for the following the acquisition of new businesses  software products  or technologies complementary to our business  capital expenditures  including the purchase and implementation of internal use software applications  stock repurchases  and funding restructuring costs 
in addition  million of our marketable securities are held in a rabbi trust under non qualified deferred compensation plans as of january  see note  deferred compensation  in the notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion 
our international operations are subject to currency fluctuations 
to minimize the effect of these fluctuations  we use foreign currency option contracts and forwards to hedge our exposure on anticipated transactions and forward contracts to hedge our exposure on firm commitments  primarily certain receivables and payables denominated in foreign currencies 
prior to the quarter ended october   our foreign currency instruments  by practice  had maturities of less than three months and settled before the end of each quarterly period 
during fiscal  we entered into foreign currency instruments with maturities longer than three months that did not settle before the end of each quarterly period 
we have expanded our hedge program beyond the current quarter to reduce foreign currency risk and volatility by entering into cash flow hedges for one to months in the future with reduced protection for our longer term hedge instruments 
the principal currencies hedged during fiscal were the euro  british pound  japanese yen  swiss franc and canadian dollar 
we monitor our foreign exchange exposures to review the overall effectiveness of our foreign currency hedge positions 

table of contents contractual obligations the following table summarizes our significant financial contractual obligations at january  and the effect such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flows in future periods 
this table excludes amounts already recorded on our balance sheet as current liabilities at january  total fiscal year fiscal years fiscal years thereafter in millions operating lease obligations purchase obligations total total does not include contractual obligations recorded on the balance sheet or certain purchase obligations as discussed below 
the table also excludes a amounts related to income tax liabilities for uncertain tax positions in accordance with fin  since we cannot predict with reasonable reliability the timing of cash settlements to the respective taxing authorities see note income taxes to the notes to consolidated financial statements  and b non qualified deferred compensation plan liabilities since we cannot predict with reasonable reliability the timing of cash disbursements to plan participants see note deferred compensation to the notes to consolidated financial statements 
for the purposes of this table  contractual obligations for purchase of goods or services are defined as agreements that are enforceable and legally binding on autodesk and that specify all significant terms  including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased  fixed  minimum or variable price provisions  and the approximate timing of the transaction 
purchase orders or contracts for the purchase of supplies  services and other goods and services are not included in the table above 
we are not able to determine the aggregate amount of such purchase orders that represent contractual obligations  as purchase orders may represent authorizations to purchase rather than binding agreements 
our purchase orders are based on our current procurement or development needs and are fulfilled by our vendors within short time horizons 
we do not have significant agreements for the purchase of supplies  services or other goods specifying minimum quantities or set prices that exceed our expected requirements for three months 
we also enter into contracts for outsourced services  however  in most instances  the obligations under these contracts are not significant and the contracts contain clauses allowing for cancellation without significant penalty 
in addition  we have certain software royalty commitments associated with the shipment and licensing of certain products 
royalty expense is generally based on the number of units shipped or a percentage of the underlying revenue 
royalty expense  included in cost of license and other revenue  was million in fiscal  million in fiscal  and million in fiscal principal commitments at january  shown above consist of obligations under operating leases for facilities and computer equipment  it infrastructure costs  marketing costs and contractual software development services 
purchase commitments also include million related to a termination fee for an outsource application hosting services agreement entered into during fiscal this fee is reduced as time elapses during the five year contract period 
the expected timing of payment of the obligations discussed above is estimated based on current information 
timing of payments and actual amounts paid may be different depending on the time of receipt of goods or services or changes to agreed upon amounts for some obligations 
we provide indemnifications of varying scopes and certain guarantees  including limited product warranties 
historically  costs related to these warranties and indemnifications have not been significant  but because potential future costs are highly variable  we are unable to estimate the maximum potential impact of these guarantees on our future results of operations 

table of contents issuer purchases of equity securities our board of directors approved a stock repurchase program authorizing the repurchase of up to million shares 
the purpose of the stock repurchase program is to help offset the dilution to net income per share caused by the issuance of stock under our employee stock plans and has the effect of returning excess cash generated from our business to stockholders 
the number of shares acquired and the timing of the purchases are based on several factors  including general market conditions  the volume of employee stock option exercises  the trading price of our common stock  cash on hand and available in the us  and company defined trading windows 
there were no repurchases of our common stock during the three months ended january   during the year ended january  we repurchased million shares of our common stock 
at january   million shares remained available for repurchase under the existing repurchase authorization 
this program does not have a fixed expiration date 
see note  shareholders equity  in the notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion 
off balance sheet arrangements other than operating leases  we do not engage in off balance sheet financing arrangements or have any variable interest entities 
as of january  we did not have any off balance sheet arrangements as defined in item a ii of sec regulation s k 
stock compensation as of january   we maintained two active stock option plans for the purpose of granting stock options to employees and non employee members of our board of directors the employee stock plan plan  which is available only to employees  and the directors option plan  as amended plan  which is available only to non employee directors 
additionally  there are six expired or terminated plans with options outstanding  including the employee stock plan plan  which was replaced by the employee stock plan in march the plan was approved by our stockholders in november under this plan  million shares of our common stock  and million shares that remained available for issuance under the plan upon its expiration  were reserved for issuance 
the plan permits the grant of stock options  restricted stock and restricted stock units  however  no more than million of the shares reserved for issuance under the plan may be issued pursuant to awards of restricted stock units 
at january   million shares were available for future issuance under the plan 
the plan will expire in march the plan  which was originally approved by the stockholders in june  allows for an automatic annual grant of options to non employee members of autodesk s board of directors 
at january   million shares were available for future issuance 
the plan will expire in march our stock option program is broad based and designed to promote long term retention 
essentially all of our employees participate 
approximately of the options we granted during fiscal were awarded to employees other than our ceo  cfo and the three other most highly compensated officers for fiscal  which we refer to as our named executive officers 
options granted under the plan and the plan vest over periods ranging from one to four years and expire within four to seven years of the date of grant 
during fiscal and  the exercise price of all stock options granted under these plans was equal to the fair market value of the stock on the grant date 
all stock option grants to executive officers are made by the compensation and human resources committee of the board of directors 
all members of the compensation and human resources committee are independent directors  as defined by the listing standards of the nasdaq global select market 
grants to our non employee directors are non discretionary and are pre determined by the terms of the plan 

table of contents for further information concerning autodesk s policies and procedures regarding the use of stock options  see compensation discussion and analysis incorporated herein by reference to the section entitled executive compensation  in our proxy statement for our fiscal year annual meeting of stockholders to be filed with the securities and exchange commission not later than days after the fiscal year ended january  in addition to our stock option plans  our employees are also eligible to participate in autodesk s employee qualified stock purchase plan esp plan 
eligible employees may purchase shares of autodesk s common stock at their discretion using up to of their compensation subject to certain limitations  at not less than of fair market value as defined in the plan agreement 
at january   million shares were available for future issuance 
this amount will automatically be increased on the first trading day of each fiscal year by an amount equal to the lesser of million shares or of the total outstanding shares plus any shares repurchased by autodesk during the prior fiscal year 
we typically issue shares on march and september of each fiscal year 
the provisions of this plan expire during fiscal on august   we disclosed that the audit committee of the board of directors was conducting a voluntary review of our historical stock option granting practices and related accounting issues 
due to this review  autodesk was not current with its reporting obligations under the securities exchange act of until june  and suspended contributions and purchases under the esp plan during the third quarter of fiscal and the first quarter of fiscal on september   our board of directors approved an amendment to our esp plan which provided for active participant employees at the time of the suspension to become automatically enrolled in the next offering period  unless they elected not to participate 
the board of directors also approved a one time cash bonus of million to non executive employees enrolled in the esp plan at that date 
this bonus approximated the profits employee participants would have made on the scheduled september  exercise date  had the purchases been made and the shares been sold on the next trading day at close of market  and was expensed as additional compensation expense at the time it was paid 
on march   our board of directors approved an amendment  which superseded the september  amendment  which provided for active participant employees at the time of the suspension to become automatically enrolled in the next offering period ending in september  unless they elected not to participate 
in june  we became current with our financial filings and resumed employee contributions to the esp plan 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk foreign currency exchange risk our revenue  earnings and cash flows are subject to fluctuations due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
our risk management strategy utilizes foreign currency forward and option contracts to manage our foreign currency exposures that exist as part of our ongoing business operations 
prior to the quarter ended october  such contracts did not extend beyond the current quarter  however  beginning in the third quarter of fiscal we entered into longer term hedging contracts 
we have expanded our foreign currency cash flow hedge program beyond one quarter  and as of january  have open contracts to hedge expected cash flows for one to months in the future in order to reduce foreign currency volatility 
contracts are primarily denominated in euros  japanese yen  swiss francs  british pounds and canadian dollars 
we do not enter into any foreign exchange derivative instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
the notional amount of our option and forward contracts was million and million at january  and  respectively 
we utilize foreign currency option collar and forward contracts to reduce the exchange rate impact on the net revenue and operating expenses of certain anticipated transactions 
a sensitivity analysis performed on our hedging portfolio as of january  indicated that a hypothetical appreciation of the us dollar from its value at january  would increase the fair value of our forward exchange and option contracts by million 
a hypothetical depreciation of the dollar from its value at january  would decrease the fair value of our forward exchange and option contracts by million 
the results of the sensitivity analysis performed on our hedging portfolio as of january  indicated that a hypothetical appreciation of the us dollar from its value at january  would have increased the fair value of our forward exchange and 
table of contents option contracts by million and a hypothetical depreciation of the dollar from its value at january  would have decreased the fair value of our forward exchange and option contracts by million 
we do not anticipate any material adverse impact to our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows as a result of these foreign currency forward and option contracts 
interest rate sensitivity at january   we had an investment portfolio of fixed income securities and short term mutual fund balances of million 
at january   we had an investment portfolio of fixed income securities and short term mutual fund balances of million 
the short term mutual fund balances included million at january  and million at january  of amounts held in a rabbi trust under deferred compensation arrangements 
see note  deferred compensation  in the notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion 
interest rate movements affect the interest income we earn on cash equivalents and short term investments 
assuming an average investment balance of million in  if interest rates were to increase decrease by  this would result in a million increase decrease in annual interest income 
further  at january  we held million in money market funds  mutual funds  bank term deposits and auction rate securities which by their structure are not directly susceptible to valuation changes due to increases or decreases in interest rates 
we do not use derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio to manage interest rate risk 
we place our investments in instruments that meet high credit quality standards  as specified in our investment policy guidelines  which limits the amount of credit exposure to any one issue  issuer or type of instrument
