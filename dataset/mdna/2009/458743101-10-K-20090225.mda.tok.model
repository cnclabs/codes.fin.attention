demand from these customers continues to be impacted by the prolonged declines in residential new construction and renovations activity 
net income as a percentage of sales was in compared to in the decline in net income is a result of lower sales  costs associated with our previously announced operational initiatives  such as employee separation benefits and closing underperforming professional contractor showrooms 
in addition  we incurred higher bad debt expense and higher rent and other occupancy costs  which were driven by our auburn  massachusetts  and richmond  virginia distribution center consolidations 
these higher costs were offset in part by decreases in compensation and fringe benefits  performance based bonus and share based compensation expense and lower interest expense associated with lower interest rates 
we will continue to work on lowering our operating costs in the near term while continuing to invest in our operating platform for the long term 
accordingly  in addition to the operational initiatives such as headcount reductions  the closing of underperforming professional contractor showrooms and the consolidation of distribution centers  some of which have been partially completed  our plans include continued investments in information technology solutions to optimize our customer service as well as our credit and collections capabilities
