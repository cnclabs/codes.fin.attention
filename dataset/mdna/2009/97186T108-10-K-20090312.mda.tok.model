community reinvestment act under the community reinvestment act  or cra  as implemented by the congress in  a financial institution has a continuing and affirmative obligation  consistent with its safe and sound operation  to help meet the credit needs of its entire community  including low and moderate income neighborhoods 
cra does not establish specific lending requirements or programs for financial institutions nor does it limit an institution s discretion to develop the types of products and services that it believes are best suited to its particular community  consistent with cra 
cra requires federal examiners  in connection with the examination of a financial institution  to assess the institution s record of meeting the credit needs of its community and to take such record into account in its evaluation of certain applications by such institution 
cra also requires all institutions to make public disclosure of their cra ratings 
the bank has a compliance committee  which oversees the planning of products  and services offered to the community  especially those aimed to serve low and moderate income communities 
the fdic rated the bank as satisfactory in meeting community credit needs under cra at its most recent examination for cra performance 
consumer laws and regulations in addition to the laws and regulations discussed herein  the bank is also subject to certain consumer laws and regulations that are designed to protect consumers in transactions with banks 
while the list set forth herein is not exhaustive  these laws and regulations include the truth in lending act  the truth in savings act  the electronic funds transfer act  the expedited funds availability act  the equal credit opportunity act  the fair housing act  the real estate settlement and procedures act  the fair credit reporting act and the federal trade commission act  among others 
these laws and regulations mandate certain disclosure requirements and regulate the manner in which financial institutions must deal with customers when taking deposits or making loans to such customers 
the bank must comply with the applicable provisions of these consumer protection laws and regulations as part of its ongoing customer relations 
permissible activities and subsidiaries california law permits state chartered commercial banks to engage in any activity permissible for national banks 
therefore  the bank may form subsidiaries to engage in the many so called closely related to banking or non banking activities commonly conducted by national banks in operating subsidiaries  and further  pursuant to glba  the bank may conduct certain financial activities in a 
table of contents subsidiary to the same extent as may a national bank  provided the bank is and remains well capitalized  well managed and in satisfactory compliance with cra 
presently  the bank does not have any financial subsidiaries 
in september  the us securities and exchange commission  or sec  and the federal reserve board finalized joint rules required by the financial services regulatory relief act of to implement exceptions provided in the glba for securities activities that banks may conduct without registering with the sec as a securities broker or moving such activities to a broker dealer affiliate 
the federal reserve board s final regulation r provides exceptions for networking arrangements with third party broker dealers and authorities  including sweep accounts to money market funds  and with related trust  fiduciary  custodial and safekeeping needs 
the final rules  which will not be effective until  are not expected to have a material effect on the bank as it does not have any securities activities 
interstate branching under current law  california state banks are permitted to establish branch offices throughout california with prior regulatory approval 
in addition  with prior regulatory approval  banks are permitted to acquire branches of existing banks located in california 
finally  california state banks generally may branch across state lines by merging with banks in other states if allowed by the applicable states laws 
california law  with limited exceptions  currently permits branching across state lines through interstate mergers resulting in the acquisition of a whole california bank that has been in existence for at least five years 
under the federal deposit insurance act  states may opt in and allow out of state banks to branch into their state by establishing a new start up branch in the state 
california law currently prohibits de novo branching into the state of california 
the bank currently has branches located in the states of california  texas  new jersey and new york 
federal home loan bank system the federal home loan bank system  or the fhlb  of which the bank is a member  consists of regional fhlbs governed and regulated by the federal housing finance board  or the fhfb 
the fhlbs serve as reserve or credit facilities for member institutions within their assigned regions 
they are funded primarily from proceeds derived from the sale of consolidated obligations of the fhlb system 
they make loans ie  advances to members in accordance with policies and procedures established by the fhlb and the boards of directors of each regional fhlb 
as a system member  the bank is entitled to borrow from the fhlb of san francisco  or fhlb sf  and is required to own capital stock in the fhlb sf in an amount equal to the greater of of the membership asset value  not exceeding million  or of outstanding fhlb sf advance borrowings 
the bank is in compliance with the stock ownership rules described above with respect to such advances  commitments and letters of credit and home mortgage loans and similar obligations 
all loans  advances and other extensions of credit made by the fhlb sf to the bank are secured by a portion of the bank s mortgage loan portfolio  certain other investments and the capital stock of the fhlb sf held by the bank 
mortgage banking operations the bank is subject to the rules and regulations of fnma with respect to originating  processing  selling and servicing mortgage loans and the issuance and sale of mortgage backed securities

the bank is also subject to regulation by the california department of financial institutions  with respect to  among other things  the establishment of maximum origination fees on certain types of mortgage loan products 
future legislation and economic policy we cannot predict what other legislation or economic and monetary policies of the various regulatory authorities might be enacted or adopted or what other regulations might be adopted or the effects thereof 
future legislation and policies and the effects thereof might have a significant influence on overall growth and distribution of loans  investments and deposits and affect interest rates charged on loans or paid from time and savings deposits 
such legislation and policies have had a significant effect on the operating results of commercial banks in the past and are expected to continue 
item a 
risk factors the risks described below could materially and adversely affect our business  financial conditions and results of operations 
you should carefully consider the following risk factors and all other information contained in this report 
the risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face 
additional risks and uncertainties are discussed elsewhere in this report  and there may be additional risks not presently known to us or that we currently believe are immaterial to our business 
in addition  the trading price of our common stock could decline due to any of the events described in these risks 
if a significant number of clients fail to perform under their loans  our business  profitability  and financial condition would be adversely affected 
as a lender  the largest risk we face is the possibility that a significant number of our client borrowers will fail to pay their loans when due 
if borrower defaults cause losses in excess of our allowance for loan losses  it could have an adverse effect on our business  profitability  and financial condition 
we have established an evaluation process designed to determine the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses 
although this evaluation process uses historical and other objective information  the classification of loans and the establishment of loan losses are dependent to a great extent on our experience and judgment 
although we believe that our allowance for loan losses is at a level adequate to absorb any inherent losses in our loan portfolio  we cannot assure you that we will not further increase the allowance for loan losses or that regulators will not require us to increase this allowance 
increases in our allowance for loan losses could materially affect our earnings adversely 
like all financial institutions  we maintain an allowance for loan losses to provide for loan defaults and non performance 
our allowance for loan losses is based on prior experience  as well as an evaluation of the risks in the current portfolio 
however  actual loan losses could increase significantly as the result of changes in economic  operating and other conditions  including changes in interest rates  which are generally beyond our control 
thus  such losses could exceed our current allowance estimates 
either of these occurrences could materially affect our earnings adversely 
in addition  the fdic and the dfi  as an integral part of their respective supervisory functions  periodically review our allowance for loan losses 
such regulatory agencies may require us to increase our provision for loan losses or to recognize further loan charge offs  based upon judgments different from those of management 
any increase in our allowance required by the fdic or the dfi could adversely affect us 

table of contents banking organizations are subject to interest rate risk and variations in interest rates may negatively affect our financial performance 
a major portion of our net income comes from our interest rate spread  which is the difference between the interest rates paid by us on interest bearing liabilities  such as deposits and other borrowings  and the interest rates we receive on interest earning assets  such as loans we extend to our clients and securities held in our investment portfolio 
net interest spreads are affected by the difference between the maturities and repricing characteristics of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
in addition  loan volume and yields are affected by market interest rates on loans  and rising interest rates generally are associated with a lower volume of loan originations 
in  federal reserve board reduced the federal funds rate seven times 
as of january   the federal funds rate was 
by december   the federal funds rate had been reduced to current rate of to 
the series of reductions in the federal funds rate during effectively lowered our average interest rate for  which resulted in lower average yield rates compared to the interest rate ranges for and were to and to  respectively 
because of the declining national economy and continued financial crisis  the credit markets are lacking liquidity 
while the federal funds rate and other short term market interest rates decreased substantially  the intermediate and long term market interest rates  which are used by many banking organizations to guide loan pricing  have not decreased proportionately 
this has led to a steepening of the market yield curve with short term rates considerably lower than long term notes 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to minimize our interest rate risk 
in addition  while a decrease in the general level of interest rates may improve the ability of certain borrowers with variable rate loans to pay the interest on and principal of their obligations  it reduces our interest income  and may lead to an increase in competition among banks for deposits 
accordingly  changes in levels of market interest rates could materially and adversely affect our net interest spread  net interest margin and our overall profitability 
liquidity risk could impair our ability to fund operations  meet our obligations as they become due and jeopardize our financial condition 
liquidity is essential to our business 
liquidity risk is the potential that the bank will be unable to meet its obligations as they come due because of an inability to liquidate assets or obtain adequate funding 
an inability to raise funds through deposits  borrowings  the sale of loans and other sources could have a substantial negative effect on our liquidity 
our access to funding sources in amounts adequate to finance our activities or on terms which are acceptable to us could be impaired by factors that affect us specifically or the financial services industry or economy in general 
factors that could detrimentally impact our access to liquidity sources include a decrease in the level of our business activity as a result of a downturn in the markets in which our loans are concentrated or adverse regulatory actions against us 
market conditions or other events could also negatively affect the level or cost of funding  affecting our ongoing ability to accommodate liability maturities and deposit withdrawals  meet contractual obligations  and fund asset growth and new business transactions at a reasonable cost  in a timely manner and without adverse consequences 
although management has implemented strategies to maintain sufficient and diverse sources of funding to accommodate planned as well as unanticipated changes in assets and liabilities under both normal and adverse conditions  any substantial  unexpected and or prolonged change in the level or cost of liquidity could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 

table of contents the profitability of wilshire bancorp is dependent on the profitability of the bank 
because wilshire bancorp s principal activity is to act as the holding company of the bank  the profitability of wilshire bancorp is dependent on the profitability of the bank 
the bank operates in an extremely competitive banking environment  competing with a number of banks and other financial institutions which possess greater financial resources than those available to the bank  in addition to other independent banks 
in addition  the banking business is affected by general economic and political conditions  both domestic and international  and by government monetary and fiscal policies 
conditions such as inflation  recession  unemployment  high interest rates  short money supply  scarce natural resources  international terrorism and other disorders as well as other factors beyond the control of the bank may adversely affect its profitability 
banks are also subject to extensive governmental supervision  regulation and control  and future legislation and government policy could adversely affect the banking industry and the operations of the bank 
wilshire bancorp relies heavily on the payment of dividends from the bank 
the bank is the only source of significant income for wilshire bancorp 
accordingly  the ability of wilshire bancorp to meet its debt service requirements and to pay dividends depends on the ability of the bank to pay dividends to it 
however  the bank is subject to regulations limiting the amount of dividends that it may pay to wilshire bancorp 
for example  any payment of dividends by the bank is subject to the fdic s capital adequacy guidelines 
all banks and bank holding companies are required to maintain a minimum ratio of qualifying total capital to total risk weighted assets of  at least one half of which must be in the form of tier capital  and a ratio of tier capital to average adjusted assets of 
if i the fdic increases any of these required ratios  ii the total of risk weighted assets of the bank increases significantly  and or iii the bank s income decreases significantly  the bank s board of directors may decide or be required to retain a greater portion of the bank s earnings to achieve and maintain the required capital or asset ratios 
this will reduce the amount of funds available for the payment of dividends by the bank to wilshire bancorp 
further  in some cases  the fdic could take the position that it has the power to prohibit the bank from paying dividends if  in its view  such payments would constitute unsafe or unsound banking practices 
in addition  whether dividends are paid and their frequency and amount will depend on the financial condition and performance  and the discretion of the board of directors of the bank 
the foregoing restrictions on dividends paid by the bank may limit wilshire bancorp s ability to obtain funds from such dividends for its cash needs  including funds for payment of its debt service requirements and operating expenses and for payment of cash dividends to wilshire bancorp s shareholders 
the amount of dividends the bank could pay to wilshire bancorp as of december  without prior regulatory approval  which is limited by statute to the sum of undivided profits for the current year plus net profits for the preceding two years less any distributions made to shareholders during such periods  was million 
the holders of recently issued debentures and series a preferred stock have rights that are senior to those of our common shareholders 
in december  the bank issued an aggregate of million of junior subordinated debentures  sometimes referred to in this report as the junior subordinated debentures or the debentures 
in addition  in the past three years  wilshire bancorp  as a wholly owned subsidiary of the bank in and as a parent company of the bank in and  issued an aggregate of  of junior subordinated debentures as part of the issuance of  in trust preferred securities by statutory trusts wholly owned by wilshire bancorp 
the purpose of these transactions was to raise additional capital 
these junior subordinated debentures are senior in liquidation rights to our outstanding shares of common stock and our series a preferred stock 
the terms of these junior subordinated debentures also restrict our ability to pay dividends on our common stock at any time we 
table of contents are in default under  or with respect to the junior subordinated debentures issued in  or  have exercised our right to defer interest payments under the indentures governing these junior subordinated debentures 
as a result  in the event of our bankruptcy  dissolution or liquidation  the holder of these junior subordinated debentures must be paid in full before any liquidating distributions may be made to the holders of our common and preferred stock 
if we default under the terms of these junior subordinated debentures or utilize our right to defer interest payments on the junior subordinated debentures issued in  or  no dividends may be paid to holders of our common and preferred stock for so long as we remain in default or have deferred amounts remaining unpaid 
on december   the company issued  in series a preferred stock and a warrant to the us treasury as part of the us treasury s cpp 
this million investment from the us treasury  which is commonly referred to as troubled assets relief program tarp investment  was part of the government strategy to counter the ongoing financial crisis and the possible prolonged economic downturn 
the tarp investment was made to us in exchange for our  shares of our series a preferred stock and a warrant to purchase initially  shares of our common stock 
the preferred stockholder  the us treasury  has preference with respect to dividends and liquidation over our common shareholders 
similar to the junior subordinated debentures  if we default the payment of dividends on our series a preferred stock  no dividends may be paid to holders of our common stock for so long as we remain in default or have deferred amounts remaining unpaid 
because we are substantially dependent on dividends from the bank in order to make the periodic payments due under the terms of the junior subordinated debentures issued in  and  and the terms of the series a preferred stock issued in  in the event that the bank is unable to pay dividends to wilshire bancorp for any significant period of time  then we may be unable to pay the amounts due to the holders of these junior subordinated debentures and the us treasury 
adverse changes in domestic or global economic conditions  especially in california  could have a material adverse effect on our business  growth  and profitability 
if economic conditions worsen in the domestic or global economy  especially in california  our business  growth and profitability are likely to be materially adversely affected 
a substantial number of our clients are geographically concentrated in california  and adverse economic conditions in california  particularly in the los angeles area  could harm the businesses of a disproportionate number of our clients 
to the extent that our clients underlying businesses are harmed  they are more likely to default on their loans 
we can provide no assurance that conditions in the california economy and in the economies of other areas where we operate will not deteriorate further in the future and that such deterioration will not adversely affect us 
recently negative development in the financial industry and us and global credit markets may affect our operations and results 
negative developments in the latter half of in the us financial market  its real estate section  and the securitization markets for the mortgage loans have resulted in uncertainty in the overall economy both domestically and globally 
the market is generally expected to undergo a continual economic downtown in commercial as well as consumer loan portfolio performances have deteriorated at many institutions and the competition for deposits and quality loans has increased significantly 
in addition  the values of real estate collateral supporting many commercial loans and home mortgages have substantially declined and may continue to further decline 
bank and bank holding company stock prices have been negatively affected as has the ability of banks and bank holding companies to raise capital or borrow in the debt markets compared to recent years 
as a result  there is a potential for new federal or state laws and regulations regarding lending and funding practices and liquidity standards  and bank regulatory agencies are expected to be very aggressive in 
table of contents responding to concerns and trends identified in examinations  including the expected issuance of many formal enforcement orders 
negative developments in the financial industry and the impact of new legislation in response to those developments could negatively affect our operations by restricting our business operations  including our ability to originate or sell loans  and adversely affect our financial performance 
governmental responses to recent market disruptions may be inadequate and may have unintended consequences 
in response to recent market disruptions  legislators and financial regulators have taken a number of steps to stabilize the financial markets 
these steps include the enactment and partial implementation of the emergency economic stabilization act of  the provision of other direct and indirect assistance to distressed financial institutions  assistance by the banking authorities in arranging acquisitions of weakened banks and broker dealers  implementation of programs by the federal reserve to provide liquidity to the commercial paper markets and expansion of deposit insurance coverage 
the new administration and congress have pursued additional initiatives in an effort to stimulate the economy and stabilize the financial markets  including the recent enactment of the american recovery and reinvestment act of  and have altered the terms of some previously announced policies 
the overall effects of these and other legislative and regulatory efforts on the financial markets are uncertain 
should these or other legislative or regulatory initiatives fail to stabilize the financial markets  our business  financial condition  results of operations and prospects could be materially and adversely affected 
our operations may require us to raise additional capital in the future  but that capital may not be available or may not be on terms acceptable to us when it is needed 
we are required by federal regulatory authorities to maintain adequate levels of capital to support our operations 
we believe that our existing capital resources will satisfy our capital requirements for the foreseeable future and will be sufficient to offset any problem assets 
however  should our asset quality erode and require significant additional provision  resulting in consistent net operating losses at the bank  our capital levels will decline and we will need to raise capital 
our ability to raise additional capital  if needed  will depend on conditions in the capital markets at that time  which are outside our control  and on our financial performance 
accordingly  we cannot be certain of our ability to raise additional capital if needed or on terms acceptable to us 
if we cannot raise additional capital when needed  our ability to further expand our operations through internal growth and acquisitions could be materially impaired 
the short term and long term impact of the new basel ii capital standards and the forthcoming new capital rules to be proposed for non basel ii us banks is uncertain 
as a result of the recent deterioration in the global credit markets and the potential impact of increased liquidity risk and interest rate risk  it is unclear what the short term impact of the implementation basel ii may be or what impact a pending alternative standardized approach to basel ii option for non basel ii us banks may have on the cost and availability of different types of credit and the potential compliance costs of implementing the new capital standards 
maintaining or increasing our market share depends on market acceptance and regulatory approval of new products and services 
our success depends  in part  upon our ability to adapt our products and services to evolving industry standards and consumer demand 
there is increasing pressure on financial services companies to provide products and services at lower prices 
in addition  the widespread adoption of new technologies  including internet based services  could require us to make substantial expenditures to 
table of contents modify or adapt our existing products or services 
a failure to achieve market acceptance of any new products we introduce  or a failure to introduce products that the market may demand  could have an adverse effect on our business  profitability  or growth prospects 
significant reliance on loans secured by real estate may increase our vulnerability to downturns in the california real estate market and other variables impacting the value of real estate 
at december   approximately of our loans were secured by real estate  a substantial portion of which consist of loans secured by real estate in california 
conditions in the california real estate market historically have influenced the level of our non performing assets 
a real estate recession in southern california could adversely affect our results of operations 
in addition  california has experienced  on occasion  significant natural disasters  including earthquakes  brush fires and  during early and late  flooding attributed to the weather phenomenon known as el nino 
in addition to these catastrophes  california has experienced a moderate decline in housing prices beginning in late the decline in housing prices subsequently developed into the current financial crisis  characterized by the further decline in the real estate market in many parts of the country  including california  starting in the second half of  and the failures of many financial institutions in the availability of insurance to compensate for losses resulting from such crises is limited 
the occurrence of one or more of such crises could impair the value of the collateral for our real estate secured loans and adversely affect us 
if we fail to retain our key employees  our growth and profitability could be adversely affected 
our future success depends in large part upon the continuing contributions of our key management personnel 
if we lose the services of one or more key employees within a short period of time  we could be adversely affected 
our future success is also dependent upon our continuing ability to attract and retain highly qualified personnel 
competition for such employees among financial institutions in california is intense 
our inability to attract and retain additional key personnel could adversely affect us 
in november  our former executive vice president and chief financial officer  resigned 
following his resignation  we engaged his replacement in april in addition  our senior vice president and controller  was promoted to senior vice president and deputy chief financial officer in conjunction with the appointment of our new chief financial officer 
furthermore  effective january   our former president and chief executive officer retired 
however  in connection with his retirement  we have entered into a consulting agreement providing for his continued service as an advisor for the bank until may following the retirement of our former chief exectuive officer  we promoted our previous executive vice president and chief lending officer to the position of president and chief executive officer  and our prior executive vice president and sba manager  was promoted to chief lending officer 
for as long as we have shares of series a preferred stock outstanding in connection with the us treasury s voluntary tarp capital purchase program  we will be subject to the limitations on compensation included in eesa and arra 
these restrictions may make it more difficult for us to retain certain of our key officers and employees because competitors who are not subject to the same restrictions may be able to offer more competitive salaries and or benefits to these individuals 
more information about the compensation limitations of eesa and aara can be found in the section entitled regulation and supervision tarp capital purchase program in item of this report 
we may be unable to manage future growth 
we may encounter problems in managing our future growth 
our total assets at december    and were billion  billion  and billion  respectively  representing an increase of million  or in and million  or in we currently intend to consider additional de novo branches and lpos and to investigate opportunities to acquire or 
table of contents combine with other financial institutions that would complement our existing business  as such opportunities may arise and consistent with our deliberate expansion strategy 
no assurance can be provided  however  that we will be able to identify a suitable acquisition target or consummate any such acquisition 
further  our ability to manage growth will depend primarily on our ability to attract and retain qualified personnel  monitor operations  maintain earnings and control costs 
any failure by us to accomplish these goals could result in interruptions in our business plans and could also adversely affect current operations 
our expenses will increase as a result of increases in fdic insurance premiums 
the fdic imposes an assessment against institutions for deposit insurance 
this assessment is based on the risk category of the institution 
federal law requires that the designated reserve ratio for the deposit insurance fund be established by the fdic at a of estimated insured deposits 
if this reserve ratio drops below  the fdic must  within days  establish and implement a plan to restore the designated reserve ratio to of estimated insured deposits within five years absent extraordinary circumstances 
recent bank failures coupled with deteriorating economic conditions have significantly reduced the deposit insurance fund s reserve ratio 
as a result of this reduced reserve ratio  on october   the fdic adopted a restoration plan that would restore the reserve ratios to its required level of over a seven year period 
there have also been increases in fdic assessments resulting from its recently announced temporary liquidity guaranty program 
should the economy continue to decline  the fdic premiums could continue to increase 
continued increases in fdic insurance premiums could have an adverse effect on our earnings 
we could be liable for breaches of security in our online banking services 
fear of security breaches could limit the growth of our online services 
we offer various internet based services to our clients  including online banking services 
the secure transmission of confidential information over the internet is essential to maintain our clients confidence in our online services 
advances in computer capabilities  new discoveries or other developments could result in a compromise or breach of the technology we use to protect client transaction data 
although we have developed systems and processes that are designed to prevent security breaches and periodically test our security  failure to mitigate breaches of security could adversely affect our ability to offer and grow our online services and could harm our business 
people generally are concerned with security and privacy on the internet and any publicized security problems could inhibit the growth of the internet as a means of conducting commercial transactions 
our ability to provide financial services over the internet would be severely impeded if clients became unwilling to transmit confidential information online 
as a result  our operations and financial condition could be adversely affected 
our directors and executive officers beneficially own a significant portion of our outstanding common stock 
as of february   our directors and executive officers  together with their respective affiliates  beneficially owned approximately of our outstanding voting common stock not including vested option shares 
as a result  such shareholders may have the ability to significantly influence the outcome of corporate actions requiring shareholder approval  including the election of directors and the approval of significant corporate transactions  such as a merger or sale of all or substantially all of our assets 
we can provide no assurance that the investment objectives of such shareholders will be the same as our other shareholders 

table of contents the market for our common stock is limited  and potentially subject to volatile changes in price 
the market price of our common stock may be subject to significant fluctuation in response to numerous factors  including variations in our annual or quarterly financial results or those of our competitors  changes by financial research analysts in their evaluation of our financial results or those of our competitors  or our failure or that of our competitors to meet such estimates  conditions in the economy in general or the banking industry in particular  or unfavorable publicity affecting us or the banking industry 
in addition  the equity markets have  on occasion  experienced significant price and volume fluctuations that have affected the market prices for many companies securities and have been unrelated to the operating performance of those companies 
in addition  the sale by any of our large shareholders of a significant portion of that shareholder s holdings could have a material adverse effect on the market price of our common stock 
further  the registration of any significant amount of additional shares of our common stock will have the immediate effect of increasing the public float of our common stock and any such increase may cause the market price of our common stock to decline or fluctuate significantly 
any such fluctuations may adversely affect the prevailing market price of the common stock 
we may experience goodwill impairment 
in light of the overall instability of the economy  the continued volatility in the financial markets  the downward pressure on bank stock prices  and expectations of financial performance for the banking industry  including the company  our estimates of goodwill fair value may be subject to change or adjustment and we may determine that impairment charges are necessary 
estimates of fair value are determined based on a complex model using cash flows and company comparisons 
if management s estimates of future cash flows are inaccurate  the fair value determined could be inaccurate and impairment may not be recognized in a timely manner 
subsequent to december   the company s market capitalization continued to decrease 
if the company s market capitalization continues to remain below book value  we will update our valuation analysis to determine whether goodwill is impaired 
no assurance can be given that goodwill will not be written down in future periods 
we face substantial competition in our primary market area 
we conduct our banking operations primarily in southern california 
increased competition in our market may result in reduced loans and deposits 
ultimately  we may not be able to compete successfully against current and future competitors 
many competitors offer the same banking services that we offer in our service area 
these competitors include national banks  regional banks and other community banks 
we also face competition from many other types of financial institutions  including without limitation  savings and loan institutions  finance companies  brokerage firms  insurance companies  credit unions  mortgage banks and other financial intermediaries 
in particular  our competitors include several major financial companies whose greater resources may afford them a marketplace advantage by enabling them to maintain numerous banking locations and mount extensive promotional and advertising campaigns 
additionally  banks and other financial institutions with larger capitalization and financial intermediaries not subject to bank regulatory restrictions have larger lending limits and are thereby able to serve the credit needs of larger customers 
areas of competition include interest rates for loans and deposits  efforts to obtain deposits  and range and quality of products and services provided  including new technology driven products and services 
technological innovation continues to contribute to greater competition in domestic and international financial services markets as technological advances enable more companies to provide financial services 
we also face competition from out of state financial intermediaries that have opened low end production offices or that solicit deposits in our market areas 
if we are unable to attract and retain banking customers  we 
table of contents may be unable to continue our loan growth and level of deposits and our results of operations and financial condition may otherwise be adversely affected 
anti takeover provisions of our charter documents may have the effect of delaying or preventing changes in control or management 
certain provisions in our articles of incorporation and bylaws could discourage unsolicited takeover proposals not approved by the board of directors in which shareholders could receive a premium for their shares  thereby potentially limiting the opportunity for our shareholders to dispose of their shares at the higher price generally available in takeover attempts or that may be available under a merger proposal or may have the effect of permitting our current management  including the current board of directors  to retain its position  and place it in a better position to resist changes that shareholders may wish to make if they are dissatisfied with the conduct of our business 
the anti takeover measures included in our articles of incorporation and bylaws  include  without limitation  the following the elimination of cumulative voting  the adoption of a classified board of directors  super majority shareholder voting requirements to modify certain provisions of the articles of incorporation and bylaws  and restrictions on certain business combinations with third parties who may acquire our securities outside of an action taken by us 
we are subject to significant government regulation and legislation that increases the cost of doing business and inhibits our ability to compete 
we are subject to extensive state and federal regulation  supervision and legislation  all of which is subject to material change from time to time 
these laws and regulations increase the cost of doing business and have an adverse impact on our ability to compete efficiently with other financial service providers that are not similarly regulated 
changes in regulatory policies or procedures could result in management s determining that a higher provision for loan losses would be necessary and could cause higher loan charge offs  thus adversely affecting our net earnings 
there can be no assurance that future regulation or legislation will not impose additional requirements and restrictions on us in a manner that could adversely affect our results of operations  cash flows  financial condition and prospects 
as a participant in the tarp capital purchase program  we have agreed to various requirements and restrictions imposed by the us treasury on all participants  which included a provision that the u 
s 
treasury could change the terms of participation at any time 
further information regarding the current requirements and restrictions imposed on tarp participants can be found under the caption regulation and supervision the tarp capital purchase program in item of this report 
we could be negatively impacted by downturns in the south korean economy 
many of our customers are locally based korean americans who also conduct business in south korea 
although we conduct most of our business with locally based customers and rely on domestically located assets to collateralize our loans and credit arrangements  we have historically had some exposure to the economy of south korea in connection with certain of our loans and credit transactions with korean banks 
such exposure has consisted of discounts of acceptances created by banks in south korea  
table of contents advances made against clean documents presented under sight letters of credit issued by banks in south korea  advances made against clean documents held for later presentation under letters of credit issued by banks in south korea  and extensions of credit to borrowers in the us secured by letters of credit issued by banks in south korea 
we generally enter into any such loan or credit arrangements  in excess of  and of longer than days  only with the largest of the korean banks and spread other lesser or shorter term loan or credit arrangements among a variety of medium sized korean banks 
as a result of the economic crisis in south korea in the mid s  management has continued to closely monitor our exposure to the korean economy and the activities of korean banks with which we conduct business 
to date  we have not experienced any significant losses attributable to our exposure to south korea 
nevertheless  there can be no assurance that our efforts to minimize exposure to downturns in the korean economy will be successful in the future  and another significant downturn in the korean economy could result in significant credit losses for us 
in addition  because our customer base is largely korean american  our deposit base could significantly decrease as a result of a deterioration of the korean economy 
for example  some of our customers businesses may rely on funds from south korea 
further  our customers may temporarily withdraw deposits in order to transfer funds and benefit from gains on foreign exchange and interest rates  and or to help their relatives in south korea during downturns in the korean economy 
a significant decrease in our deposits could also have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
additional shares of our common stock issued in the future could have a dilutive effect 
shares of our common stock eligible for future issuance and sale could have a dilutive effect on the market for our stock 
our articles of incorporation authorize the issuance of  shares of common stock 
as of february   there were approximately  shares of our common stock issued and outstanding   shares of our authorized but unissued shares of common stock are reserved for issuance under the wilshire bancorp  inc stock option plan  or the stock option plan   shares of our authorized but unissued shares of common stock are reserved for issuance upon exercise of the warrant that we issued to the us treasury in connection with our participation in the tarp capital purchase program  plus an additional  shares of our common stock are reserved for issuance to the holders of stock options previously granted and still outstanding under the wilshire state bank stock option plan  or the stock option plan 
thus  approximately  shares of our common stock remain authorized not reserved for stock options and are available for future issuance and sale at the discretion of our board of directors 
shares of our preferred stock previously issued and preferred stock issued in the future could have dilutive and other effects 
on december   we received  from the us treasury as part of the federal government s capital purchase program 
in exchange for the federal funding  we issued  shares of series a preferred stock  each with a stated liquidation amount of  per share  to the us treasury 
as of february   there was a total of  shares of our series a preferred stock that were issued and outstanding 
shares of our preferred stock eligible for future issuance and sale also could have a dilutive effect on the market for the shares of our common stock  especially because of the fact that the preferred shares would have seniority with respect to our common stock 
in addition to  shares of 
table of contents common stock  our articles of incorporation authorize the issuance of  shares of preferred stock 
as of december   the total number of shares of authorized but unissued preferred stock was  although our board of directors has no present intent to authorize the issuance of shares of preferred stock  such shares could be authorized in the future 
if such shares of preferred stock are made convertible into shares of common stock  there could be a dilutive effect on the shares of common stock then outstanding 
in addition  shares of preferred stock may be provided a preference over holders of common stock upon our liquidation or with respect to the payment of dividends  in respect of voting rights or in the redemption of our capital stock 
the rights  preferences  privileges and restrictions applicable to any series of preferred stock may be determined by resolution of our board of directors without the need for shareholder approval

dividends as a california corporation  we are restricted under the california general corporation law  or cgcl  from paying dividends under certain conditions 
our shareholders are entitled to receive 
table of contents dividends when and as declared by our board of directors  out of funds legally available for the payment of dividends  as provided in the cgcl 
the cgcl provides that a corporation may make a distribution to its shareholders if retained earnings immediately prior to the dividend payout at least equal the amount of proposed distribution 
in the event that sufficient retained earnings are not available for the proposed distribution  a corporation may  nevertheless  make a distribution  if it meets both the quantitative solvency and the liquidity tests 
in general  the quantitative solvency test requires that the sum of the assets of the corporation equal at least times its liabilities 
the liquidity test generally requires that a corporation have current assets at least equal to current liabilities  or  if the average of the earnings of the corporation before taxes on income and before interest expenses for the two preceding fiscal years was less than the average of the interest expense of the corporation for such fiscal years  then current assets must be equal to at least times current liabilities 
in certain circumstances  we may be required to obtain the prior approval of the federal reserve board to make capital distributions to our shareholders 
it has been our general practice to retain earnings for the purpose of increasing capital to support growth  and no cash dividends were paid to shareholders prior to however  we began paying a cash dividend to our common shareholders beginning with the first quarter of while we currently pay cash dividends on our common stock  as well as to the holders of our series a preferred stock pursuant to our agreements under the tarp capital purchase program 
dividends are subject to the discretion of our board of directors and will depend on a number of factors  including future earnings  financial condition  cash needs and general business conditions 
any dividend to our common shareholders must also comply with the restrictions in our outstanding junior subordinated debentures and our series a preferred stock described earlier in this report  as well as applicable bank regulations 
the following table shows cash dividends to our common shareholders declared by wilshire bancorp the two years ended december  declaration date payable date record date type march  april  march  per share may  july  june  per share august  october  september  per share november  january  december  per share february  april  march  per share may  july  june  per share september  october  september  per share december  january  december  per share as of december   we had not paid any dividends on our series a preferred stock 
our ability to pay cash dividends in the future will depend in large part on the ability of the bank to pay dividends on its capital stock to us 
the ability of the bank to pay dividends on its common stock is restricted by the california financial code  the fdia and fdic regulations 
in general terms  california law provides that the bank may declare a cash dividend out of net profits up to the lesser of retained earnings or net income for the last three fiscal years less any distributions made to shareholders during such period  or  with the prior written approval of the commissioner of department of financial institutions  in an amount not exceeding the greatest of retained earnings  net income for the prior fiscal year  or net income for the current fiscal year 

table of contents the bank s ability to pay any cash dividends will depend not only upon our earnings during a specified period  but also on our meeting certain capital requirements 
the fdia and fdic regulations restrict the payment of dividends when a bank is undercapitalized  when a bank has failed to pay insurance assessments  or when there are safety and soundness concerns regarding a bank 
the payment of dividends by the bank may also be affected by other regulatory requirements and policies  such as maintenance of adequate capital 
if  in the opinion of the regulatory authority  a depository institution under its jurisdiction is engaged in  or is about to engage in  an unsafe or unsound practice which  depending on the financial condition of the depository institution  could include the payment of dividends  such authority may require  after notice and hearing  that such depository institution cease and desist from such practice 
securities authorized for issuance under equity compensation plans in june  we established the stock option plan that provides for the issuance of restricted stock and options to purchase up to  shares of our authorized but unissued common stock to employees  directors  and consultants 
exercise prices for options may not be less than the fair market value at the date of grant 
compensation expense for awards is recorded over the vesting period 
under the stock option plan  there were options outstanding to purchase  shares of our common stock as of december  during  the bank established the stock option plan  which provided for the issuance of up to  shares of the company s authorized but unissued common stock to managerial employees and directors 
due to the expiration of the plan in february  no additional options may be granted under the stock option plan 
accordingly  no shares of our common stock remain available for future issuance under the stock option plan 
nonetheless  there are  shares of our common stock reserved for issuance to the holders of stock options previously granted and still outstanding under the stock option plan 
the following table summarizes information as of december  relating to the number of securities to be issued upon the exercise of the outstanding options under the plan and the plan and their weighted average exercise price

eesa prohibits us from accruing any bonus  retention award  or incentive compensation to at least the five most highly compensated employees of the company or such higher number of employees as the us treasury may determine 
although the interpretation of what specifically constitutes incentive compensation is not clear  it is likely that we will not be able to grant additional stock options to at least our five most highly compensated employees during the time that we have shares of series a preferred stock outstanding

executive overview introduction wilshire bancorp  inc succeeded to the business and operations of wilshire state bank the bank upon consummation of the reorganization of the bank into a holding company structure  effective as of august  prior to the completion of the reorganization  the bank was subject to the information  reporting and proxy statement requirements of the exchange act  pursuant to the regulations of its primary regulator  the federal deposit insurance corporation  or fdic 
accordingly  the bank filed annual and quarterly reports  proxy statements and other information with the fdic 
pursuant to rule g of the exchange act  the company has succeeded to the reporting obligations of the bank and the reporting obligations of the bank to the fdic have terminated 
filings by the company under the exchange act  like this form k  are to be made with the sec 
note that while we refer generally to the company throughout this filing  all references to the company prior to august   except where otherwise indicated  are to the bank 
we operate a community bank in the general commercial banking business  with our primary market encompassing the multi ethnic population of the los angeles metropolitan area 
our full service offices are located primarily in areas where a majority of the businesses are owned by korean speaking immigrants  with many of the remaining businesses owned by hispanic and other minority groups 
at december   we had approximately billion in assets  billion in total loans and billion in deposits 
we also have expanded and diversified our business geographically by focusing on the continued development of the east coast market 
in may  we completed the acquisition of liberty bank of new york liberty and its merger into the bank 
with this acquisition  we added million in total assets and two branches in new york city 
we paid million for this transaction  which consisted of million in cash and million in our common stock  shares 
we also incurred merger related costs of  which we recognized as additional consideration in connection with this business combination 
in july  we acquired a branch of royal bank america rba in fort lee  new jersey in exchange for our branch at flushing  new york 
in this branch exchange transaction  we purchased selected fixed assets and assumed selected liabilities  including a portion of rba s time deposits 
as consideration  we transferred to rba selected intangible and fixed assets  and selected liabilities  including a portion of time deposits  intangible liabilities  and lease obligations 
the amounts involved in this transaction were insignificant except for the time deposits exchanged 
in the branch exchange transaction  both parties transferred deposit liabilities in the amount of approximately million 
the branch exchange transaction was accounted for as an exchange of assets and liabilities 
the fort lee  new jersey loan portfolio has grown to million as of december   as compared with the prior year end 
deposit growth at the fort lee branch has also exceeded our expectation  it has increased to million as of december   as compared with the prior year end 
subsequent to the branch exchange in july  we opened a new bayside branch in new york to compensate for the loss of our flushing branch 
the above described transactions resulted in an expansion of our banking service and market coverage to the state of new jersey and the greater new york city metropolitan area 
similar to the new jersey branch  the loan portfolio of our two new york 
table of contents branches has grown since the acquisition  from million to million at the end of our deposit portfolio in the new york branches has also experienced significant growth  up from million at the time of the acquisition to million at the end of because we recognize the business opportunities in flushing and in an attempt to further expand our market coverage in the new york new jersey area  we plan to open our own flushing branch in the first quarter of this will be our third branch in the greater new york city metropolitan area 
in addition to our expansion into the new york new jersey area  we further expanded our banking network within the state of california 
in august  we opened our new city center branch office in los angeles  california 
to improve operating efficiency  we also merged a market branch in rancho cucamonga  california  into a neighboring branch in the same city during december over the past several years  our network of branches and lpos has expanded geographically 
we currently maintain twenty branch offices and five lpos 
we believe that our market coverage complements our multi ethnic small business focus 
we intend to be cautious about our growth strategy in future years regarding opening of additional branches and lpos 
we expect to continue implementing our growth strategy using planning and market analysis  and as our needs and resources permit 
in december  the bank issued million of the junior subordinated debentures 
subsequently  the company  as a wholly owned subsidiary in and as a parent company of the bank in and  issued a total of  of junior subordinated debentures in connection with a  trust preferred securities issuance by statutory trusts wholly owned by the company 
we believe that the supplemental capital raised in connection with the issuance of these debentures allowed us to achieve and maintain status as a well capitalized institution and sustained our continued loan growth 
in december  we issued  shares of newly designated series a preferred stock  each with a stated liquidation amount of  per share  and an attached warrant exercisable initially for  shares of our common stock  with an exercise price of per share  to the us treasury in exchange for the us treasury s million investment in the tarp capital purchase program 
this additional capital infusion from the united states government further strengthened our capital status  which will allow us to assist financial market with much needed liquidity via careful lending to qualified borrowers 
as evidenced by our past several years of operations  we have experienced significant balance sheet growth 
we have implemented a strategy of building our core banking foundation by focusing on commercial loans and business transaction accounts 
our management believes that this strategy has created recurring revenue streams  diversified our product portfolio and enhanced shareholder value 
key performance indicators we believe the following were key indicators of our performance for operations during our total assets grew to billion at the end of  or an increase of from billion at the end of our total deposits grew to billion at the end of  or an increase of from billion at the end of our total loans grew to billion at the end of  or an increase of from billion at the end of total net interest income slightly increased to million in  or an increase of from million in the smaller increase in net interest relative to the growth in our 
table of contents loan portfolio was primarily due to numerous federal funds rate reductions in  which lowered our net interest margin 
total noninterest income decreased to million in  or a decrease of from million in this decrease was primarily due to a reduction in the volume and premium rate on sba loan sales under the weakened national economy  which is attributable primarily to the ongoing financial crisis 
total noninterest expense increased to million in  or from million in the increase is mainly due to an increase in our fdic deposit insurance premium  stock compensation expenses attributable to the stock option plan  and personnel and premises expenses associated with our business growth 
nonetheless  due to our continuous effort in minimizing operating expenses  noninterest expenses as a percentage of average assets were lowered to in from in our efficiency ratio the ratio of noninterest expense to the sum of net interest income before provision for loan losses and total noninterest income remained at a relatively low level below  at and in and  respectively 
net income available for common shareholders for decreased to million  or per diluted common share  as compared with million  or per diluted common share in the decrease in net income is primarily attributable to a change of management strategy to shift our efforts and focus of from promoting profit growth to improving loan portfolio quality 
these changes are discussed in more detail in the section of this report entitled  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
outlook as we look ahead to  we expect that the declining economy and real estate markets in our primary market areas will continue to be significant determinants to the quality of our assets in future periods  and thus  to our results of operations  liquidity and financial condition 
due to the gradual decrease in housing prices since late  and the emergence of the financial crisis during the second half of  the real estate market and our overall economy are generally declining 
the national economy has reached its lowest point since  and we anticipate a further decline in in an attempt to stimulate the economy  the federal reserve board has aggressively cut the federal funds rate by to basis points to the unprecedentedly low level of to as of december  prior to that  the rates had already been reduced six times  including basis points reductions on october  and october  in addition to federal funds rate cuts  the federal reserve board has been aggressively selling treasury instruments to pump money and liquidity into the banking system and the credit market in an attempt boost spending  ease lending and the shorting pressure of the market 
we expect that the deterioration of our economy will negatively affect our asset quality 
responding proactively to this anticipated business environment  we shifted our focus from growth to improvement of our asset quality 
since  we have strengthened loan underwriting standards and have been carefully scrutinizing any exceptions to our loan policy 
we anticipate these changes will result in loan growth that is slower than our historic levels  but we also anticipate a corresponding improvement in the quality of our loan portfolio 
we expect that the financial crisis will continue and will have widespread effects across different industries and countries 
we therefore expect the general economy to continue to slow in nonetheless  the us government is implementing several initiatives in an attempt to stimulate the national economy 
on october   eesa was enacted by the us congress  which appropriated billion for the purpose of restoring liquidity and stability in the us financial system 
on october   the us treasury established the tarp capital purchase program under the authority granted by the eesa 
under the tarp capital purchase program  the us treasury made 
table of contents billion of capital available to us financial institutions in the form of senior preferred stock investments 
like many other sound financial institutions  we voluntarily participated in the capital purchase program and received million in additional funding that has further strengthened our capital position 
in addition  the federal reserve board has aggressively purchased treasury securities and reduced the federal funds rates as means to improve market liquidity and encourage banks to make credit available to qualified borrowers 
on february   arra was enacted by the us congress  providing an additional approximately billion to stimulate the national economy 
we are optimistic that these government initiatives will result in some economic recovery during the latter half of and in contrast  in response to the current weak economic conditions  the fdic issued a letter indicating that it intends to charge a special assessment in and that assessment may be as much as basis points based on our deposits or assessment base as of june   but the actual amount has not been determined by the fdic 
we expect to accrue and record this one time expense when fdic finalizes the assessment in the second quarter of  and to incur the actual payment in the third quarter of on a micro economic level within our own business  we plan to continue to focus on management of our net interest margin through and beyond 
we are liability sensitive for the first year time frame  meaning that more interest bearing liabilities will reprice than interest earning assets in however  we should begin to see opposite movement by the first quarter of because we are more asset sensitive in the long term as interest earning assets will re price more quickly than interest bearing liabilities 
in general  based upon our current mix of deposits  loans and investments  a decrease in interest rates would result the increase of net interest margin and npv 
increases in interest rates would be expected to have opposite effect 
however  given in the current low interest rate environment  further decreases in interest rate will result in net interest margin as shown in our simulation results below 
it is our expectation that the strategic change toward more moderate and quality loan growth will reduce the volume of our higher yielding  higher risk loans 
although we did not have any subprime borrowers in our current loan portfolio  it is our belief that a more stringent lending strategy is to our benefit in managing loan losses in the current economic environment 
as a result  our net interest margin should experience only moderate growth 
to complement these strategic changes  explore new business opportunities and reduce costs  we plan to extend our market coverage into the east coast of the us we also plan to continue our core deposit campaign that links monetary awards to core deposit growth 
we expect that these measures will benefit our net interest margin going forward 
notwithstanding the overall slower national economy  we believe that there will be slower but continual economic growth in our niche market areas  which includes the korean american business sectors located in southern california  texas  new jersey  and the greater new york city metropolitan area 
we expect that this growth will be mainly attributable to an anticipated capital influx from the republic of korea because of the successful passage of the republic of korea united states free trade agreement in october  and admission of korea into the united states visa waiver program in november accordingly  we therefore believe that we will continue to grow  provided that such growth will be at a more controlled pace than we have experienced in the past few years 
the reduction in our growth rate is expected to result in a healthier balance sheet  as we expect to see fewer non performing loans 
hence  our asset base is expected to be of better quality with more core deposits 
we will continue to consider opportunities for growth in our existing markets  as well as opportunities to expand into new markets through de novo branching and regional lpos 
we are currently in the planning process of opening our third new york branch in flushing during the first 
table of contents quarter of we believe the third new york branch  together with the existing fort lee  new jersey branch and the two existing new york branches  will be a critical part of our planned expansion strategy  especially in the east coast market of the us because of its high level of small business activity and diverse population 
in addition  we will continue to focus on streamlining our operations so that our expenses do not outpace the overall growth of our business 
critical accounting policies the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our financial statements 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
various elements of our accounting policies  by their nature  are inherently subject to estimation techniques  valuation assumptions and other subjective assessments 
in particular  we have identified several accounting policies that  due to judgments  estimates and assumptions inherent in those policies are critical to an understanding of our consolidated financial statements 
these policies relate to the classification and valuation of investment securities  the methodologies that determine our allowance for loan losses  the treatment of non accrual loans  the valuation of properties acquired through foreclosure  the valuation of retained interests and mortgage servicing assets related to the sales of sba loans  and the treatment and valuation of stock based compensation and business combination 
in each area  we have identified the variables most important in the estimation process 
we have used the best information available to make the estimates necessary to value the related assets and liabilities 
actual performance that differs from our estimates and future changes in the key variables could change future valuation and impact net income 
investment securities our investment policy seeks to provide and maintain liquidity  and to produce favorable returns on investments without incurring unnecessary interest rate or credit risk  while complementing our lending activities 
our investment securities portfolio is subject to interest rate risk 
fluctuations in interest rates may cause actual prepayments to vary from the estimated prepayments over the life of a security 
this may result in adjustments to the amortization of premiums or accretion of discounts related to these instruments  consequently changing the net yield on such securities 
reinvestment risk is also associated with the cash flows from such securities 
the unrealized gain loss on such securities may also be adversely impacted by changes in interest rates 
under sfas no 
 accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities  investment securities that management has the positive intent and ability to hold to maturity are classified as held to maturity and recorded at amortized cost 
securities not classified as held to maturity or trading  with readily determinable fair values  are classified as available for sale and recorded at fair value 
purchase premiums and discounts are recognized in interest income using the interest method over the estimated lives of the securities 
the classification and accounting for investment securities are discussed in detail in notes and of the consolidated financial states presented elsewhere in this report under sfas no 
 accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities  investment securities generally must be classified as held to maturity  available for sale  or trading 
the appropriate classification is based partially on our ability to hold the securities to maturity and largely on management s intentions with respect to either 
table of contents holding or selling the securities 
the classification of investment securities is significant since it directly impacts the accounting for unrealized gains and losses on securities 
unrealized gains and losses on trading securities flow directly through earnings during the periods in which they arise 
investment securities that are classified as held to maturity are recorded at amortized cost 
unrealized gains and losses on available for sale securities are recorded as a separate component of stockholders equity accumulated other comprehensive income or loss and do not affect earnings until realized or are deemed to be other than temporarily impaired 
the fair values of investment securities are generally determined by reference to the average of at least two quoted market prices obtained from independent external brokers or independent external pricing service providers who have experience in valuing these securities 
in obtaining such valuation information from third parties  we have evaluated the methodologies used to develop the resulting fair values 
we perform a monthly analysis on the broker quotes received from third parties to ensure that the prices represent a reasonable estimate of the fair value 
the procedures include  but are not limited to  initial and on going review of third party pricing methodologies  review of pricing trends  and monitoring of trading volumes 
we ensure whether prices received from independent brokers represent a reasonable estimate of fair value through the use of internal and external cash flow models developed based on spreads  and when available  market indices 
as a result of this analysis  if we determine there is a more appropriate fair value based upon the available market data  the price received from the third party is adjusted accordingly 
prices from third party pricing services are often unavailable for securities that are rarely traded or are traded only in privately negotiated transactions 
as a result  certain securities are priced via independent broker quotations which utilize inputs that may be difficult to corroborate with observable market based data 
additionally  the majority of these independent broker quotations are non binding 
we are obligated to assess  at each reporting date  whether there is an other than temporary impairment to our investment securities 
such impairment must be recognized in current earnings rather than in other comprehensive income 
the determination of other than temporary impairment is a subjective process  requiring the use of judgment and assumptions 
we examine all individual securities that are in an unrealized loss position at each reporting date for other than temporary impairment 
specific investment related factors we examine to assess impairment include the nature of the investment  severity and duration of the loss  the probability that we will be unable to collect all amounts due  and analysis of the issuers of the securities and whether there has been any cause for default on the securities and any change in the rating of the securities by the various rating agencies 
additionally  we evaluate whether the creditworthiness of the issuer calls the realization of contractual cash flows into question 
we reexamine the financial resources  intent and the overall ability of the company to hold the securities until their fair values recover 
management does not believe that there are any investment securities  other than those identified in the current and previous periods  which are deemed to be other than temporarily impaired as of december  investment securities are discussed in more detail in note of our consolidated financial statements presented later in this report

 we consider all available information relevant to the collectability of the security  including information about past events  current conditions  and reasonable and supportable forecasts  when developing the estimate of future cash flows and making its other than temporary impairment assessment for our portfolio of residual securities and pooled trust preferred securities 
we consider factors such as remaining payment terms of the security  prepayment speeds  the financial condition of the issuer s  expected defaults  and the value of any underlying collateral 
as of december  and december   no investment securities were determined to have any other than temporary impairment

small business administration loans certain sba loans that may be sold prior to maturity have been designated as held for sale at origination and are recorded at the lower of cost or market value  determined on an aggregate basis 
a valuation allowance is established if the market value of such loans is lower than their cost  and operations are charged or credited for valuation adjustments 
when we sell a loan  we usually sell the guaranteed portion of the loan and retain the non guaranteed portion 
we receive sales proceeds from i the guaranteed principal of the loan  ii the deferred premium for the difference between the book value of the retained portion and the fair value allocated to the retained portion  and iii the loan excess servicing fee esf 
at the time of sale  the deferred premium  which is amortized over the remaining life of the loan as an adjustment to yield  is recorded for the difference between the book value and the fair value allocated to the retained portion 
the sales gain is recognized from the difference between the proceeds and the book value allocated to the sold portion 
we allocate the book value of the related loan among three portions on the basis of their relative fair value i the sold portion  ii the retained portion  and iii the esf 
we estimate the fair value of each portion based on the following 
the amount received for the sale represents the fair value of the sold portion 
the fair value of the retained portion is computed by discounting its future cash flows over the estimated life of the loan 
we calculate the fair value of the esf for the loan from the cash in flow of the net servicing fee over the estimated life of the loan  discounted at an above average discount rate and a range of constant prepayment rates of the related loans 
we capitalize the fair value allocated to esf in two categories i intangible servicing assets the contracted servicing fee less normal servicing costs  and ii interest only strip  or i o strip  receivables excess of esf over the contracted servicing fee 
the servicing asset is recorded based on the present value of the contractually specified servicing fee  net of servicing cost  over the estimated life of the loan  with an average discount rate and a range of constant prepayment rates of the related loans 
prior to december   the servicing asset is amortized in proportion to and over the period of estimated servicing income 
for purposes of measuring impairment  the servicing assets are stratified by collateral types 
management periodically evaluates the fair value of servicing assets for impairment 
a valuation allowance is recorded when the fair value is below the carrying amount and a recovery of the valuation allowance is recorded when its fair value exceeds the carrying amount 
however  a reversal may not exceed the original valuation allowance recorded 
on january   we adopted sfas no 
 accounting for servicing of financial assets  and selected a fair value measurement method to measure our servicing assets and liabilities and recognized a one time increase in their fair value of  net of tax effects 
any subsequent increase or decrease in fair value of servicing assets and liabilities is to be included in our current earnings in the statement of operations 
an interest only strip is recorded based on the present value of the excess of future interest income  over the 
table of contents contractually specified servicing fee  calculated using the same assumptions as noted above 
interest only strips are accounted for at their estimated fair value  with unrealized gains recorded as an adjustment in accumulated other comprehensive income in shareholders equity 
if the estimated fair value is less than its carrying value  the loss is considered as other than temporary impairment and it is charged to the current earnings 
i o strips are amortized over the remaining life of the loan as an adjustment to yield and monitored for impairment 
allowance for loan losses accounting for the allowance for loan losses involves significant judgment and assumptions by management and is based on historical data and management s view of the current economic environment 
at least on a quarterly basis  our management reviews the methodology and adequacy of the allowance for loan losses and reports its assessment to the board of directors for its review and approval 
we base our allowance for loan losses on an estimate of probable losses inherent in our loan portfolio 
our methodology for assessing loan loss allowances is intended to reduce the differences between estimated and actual losses and involves a detailed analysis of our loan portfolio in three phases the specific review of individual loans in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no  accounting by creditors for impairment of a loan  the segmenting and reviewing of loan pools with similar characteristics in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies  and our judgmental estimate based on various qualitative factors 
the first phase of our allowance analysis involves the specific review of individual loans to identify and measure impairment 
at this phase  we evaluate each loan except for homogeneous loans  such as automobile loans and home mortgages 
specific risk rated loans are deemed impaired with respect to all amounts  including principal and interest  which will likely not be collected in accordance with the contractual terms of the related loan agreement 
impairment for commercial and real estate loans is measured either based on the present value of the loan s expected future cash flows or  if collection on the loan is collateral dependent  the estimated fair value of the collateral  less selling and holding costs 
the second phase involves segmenting the remainder of the risk rated loan portfolio into groups or pools of loans  together with loans with similar characteristics for evaluation in accordance with sfas no 
we perform loss migration analysis and calculate the loss migration ratio for each loan pool based on its historical net losses and benchmark it against the levels of other peer banks 
in the third phase  we consider relevant internal and external factors that may affect the collectability of a loan portfolio and each group of loan pools 
as a general rule  the factors listed below will be considered to have no impact to our loss migration analysis 
however  if there exists information to warrant adjustment to the loss migration ratios  the changes will be made in accordance with the established parameters and supported by narrative and or statistical analysis 
we use a credit risk matrix to determine the impact to the loss migration analysis 
this matrix enables management to adjust the general allocation based on the loss migration ratio 
the factors currently considered are  but are not limited to concentration of credit  delinquency trend  nature and volume of loan trend  non accrual and problem loan trends  loss and recovery trend  quality loan review  lending and management staff  lending policies and procedures  and external factors such as changes in legal and regulatory requirements  on the level of estimated credit losses in the current portfolio 
for all factors  the extent of the adjustment will be commensurate with the severity of the conditions that concern each factor 

table of contents the evaluation of the inherent loss with respect to these factors is subject to a higher degree of uncertainty because they are not identified with specific problem credits or portfolio components 
central to our credit risk management and our assessment of appropriate loss allowance is our loan risk rating system 
under this system  the originating credit officer assigns borrowers an initial risk rating based on a thorough analysis of each borrower s financial capacity in conjunction with industry and economic trends 
approvals are made based upon the amount of inherent credit risk specific to the transaction and are reviewed for appropriateness by senior line and credit administration personnel 
credits are monitored by line and credit administration personnel for deterioration in a borrower s financial condition which may impact the ability of the borrower to perform under the contract 
although management has allocated a portion of the allowance to specific loans  specific loan pools  including off balance sheet credit exposures which are reported separately as part of other liabilities  the adequacy of the allowance is considered in its entirety 
non accrual loan policy interest on loans is credited to income as earned and is accrued only if deemed collectible 
accrual of interest is discontinued when a loan is over days delinquent unless management believes the loan is adequately collateralized and in the process of collection 
generally  payments received on nonaccrual loans are recorded as principal reductions 
interest income is recognized after all principal has been repaid or an improvement in the condition of the loan has occurred that would warrant resumption of interest accruals 
other real estate owned other real estate owned oreo  which represents real estate acquired through foreclosure  or deed in lieu of foreclosure in satisfaction of commercial and real estate loans  is carried at the lower of cost or estimated fair value less the estimated selling costs of the real estate 
the fair value of the property is based upon a current appraisal 
the difference between the fair value of the real estate collateral and the loan balance at the time of transfer is recorded as a loan charge off if fair value is lower than the loan balance 
subsequent to foreclosure  management periodically performs valuations and the oreo property is carried at the lower of carrying value or fair value  less cost to sell 
the determination of a property s estimated fair value incorporates i revenues projected to be realized from disposal of the property  ii construction and renovation costs  iii marketing and transaction costs  and iv holding costs eg  property taxes  insurance and homeowners association dues 
any subsequent declines in the fair value of the oreo property after the date of transfer are recorded through a write down of the asset 
any subsequent operating expenses or income  reduction in estimated fair values  and gains or losses on disposition of such properties are charged or credited to current operations 
bank owned life insurance boli obligation under eitf  accounting for deferred compensation and postretirement benefit aspects of endorsement slit dollar life insurance arrangements  an employer is required to recognize obligations associated with endorsement split dollar life insurance arrangements that extend into the participant s post employment benefit cost for the continuing life insurance or based on the future death benefit depending on the contractual terms of the underlying agreement 
eitf is effective as of the beginning of the entity s first fiscal year after december  we adopted eitf on january  using the later option based on the future death benefit 
upon this adoption  we recognized increases in the liability for unrecognized post retirement obligations of  and  for directors and officers  respectively  as a cumulative adjustment to our current year s beginning equity 
during the year of  the increases in boli expense and liability related to the adoption of

goodwill we recognized goodwill and intangible assets in connection with the acquisition of liberty bank of new york 
in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  goodwill will no longer be amortized  but rather be subject to impairment testing at least annually 
we tested goodwill for impairment as of december  income taxes we accounted for income taxes under the asset and liability method  which requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in the financial statements 
under this method  deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the differences between the financial statements and tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse 
the effect of a change in tax rates on deferred tax rates on deferred tax assets and liabilities is recognized in income in the period that includes the enacted date 
we record net tax assets to the extent it believes these assets will more likely than not be realized 
in making such determination  we consider all available positive and negative evidence  including scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities  projected future taxable income  tax planning strategies and recent financial operations 
in the event we determine that it would be able to realize its deferred income tax assets in the future in excess of their net recorded amount  we would make an adjustment to reduce the current period provision for income taxes 
our effective tax rates were often lower than the statutory rates 
this was mainly due to state tax benefits derived from doing business in an enterprise zone and tax preferential treatment for our ownership of boli and low income housing tax credit funds 
in  we adopted the provision of fasb financial interpretation no 
fin  accounting for uncertainty in income taxes  which clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in the financial statements in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
fin provides that a tax benefit from an uncertain tax position may be recognized when it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination  including resolutions of any related appeals or litigation processes  based on the technical merits 
a tax position is recognized as a benefit only if it is more likely than not that the tax position would be sustained in a tax examination  with a tax examination being presumed to occur 
the amount recognized is the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than likely of being realized on examination 
for tax positions not meeting the more likely than not test  no tax benefit is recorded 
as a result of the implementation of the interpretation  the company recognized an increase in the liability for unrecognized tax benefit of  and related interest of  as of december   the total unrecognized tax benefit that would affect the effective rate if recognized was  and related interest was  see note 
stock based compensation we issued stock based compensation to certain employees  officers  and directors 
on january   we adopted sfas r  share based payment  for stock based compensation 
sfas no 
r allows for two alternative transition methods 
we follow the modified prospective method  which requires application of the new statement to new awards and to awards modified  repurchased or cancelled after the required effective date 
accordingly  prior period amounts have not been restated 
additionally  compensation cost for the portion of awards for which the requisite service has not been 
table of contents rendered that are outstanding as of january  are recognized as the requisite services are rendered on or after january  the compensation cost of that portion of awards is based on the grant date fair value of those awards 
results of operations net interest income and net interest margin our primary source of revenue is net interest income  which is the difference between interest and fees derived from earning assets and interest paid on liabilities obtained to fund those assets 
our net interest income is affected by changes in the level and mix of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities  referred to as volume changes 
our net interest income is also affected by changes in the yields earned on assets and rates paid on liabilities  referred to as rate changes 
interest rates charged on our loans are affected principally by the demand for such loans  the supply of money available for lending purposes and competitive factors 
those factors are  in turn  affected by general economic conditions and other factors beyond our control  such as federal economic policies  the general supply of money in the economy  legislative tax policies  the governmental budgetary matters  and the actions of the federal reserve board 
our average net loans were billion in  as compared with billion in and billion in  representing similar increases of in both and  respectively  from each of the prior annual periods and average interest earning assets were billion in  as compared with billion in and billion in  representing increases of and in and  respectively  from each of the prior annual periods 
our average interest bearing deposits also increased by to billion in  as compared with billion in  after increasing in from billion in together with other borrowings see financial condition deposits and other sources of funds below  average interest bearing liabilities increased by to billion in  as compared with billion in  after increasing by in from billion in the federal reserve board s rate decreases since september resulted in a slight decrease in our average yield on interest earning assets to in from in in response to the declining national economy  the federal reserve board further reduced the federal funds rate seven times in since the last rate reduction on december   the current federal funds rate has been to  an unprecedentedly low level 
accordingly  the average yield on interest earning assets sharply decreased to in during the same time periods  the rates for deposits in our local markets remained competitive  which required us to closely monitor our cost of funds so that it would be in line with our yield on assets 
our average yield on interest earning assets decreased basis points to in from in and in as a result  interest income decreased to million in  as compared to million in consistent to the drop in interest income  interest expense decreased to million in  as compared with million in in  interest income grew to  as compared with million in the growth in interest income  however  was outpaced by a increase in interest expense to million in from million in the combined result of our growth and careful monitoring efforts with respect to cost of funds resulted in an increase in our net interest income

provision for loan losses and provision for loan commitments in anticipation of credit risk inherent in our lending business and the recent ongoing financial crisis  we set aside allowances through charges to earnings 
such charges were not made only for our outstanding loan portfolio  but also for off balance sheet items  such as commitments to extend credits or letters of credit 
the charges made for our outstanding loan portfolio were credited to allowance for loan losses  whereas charges for off balance sheet items were credited to the reserve for off balance sheet items  which are presented as a component of other liabilities 
although we have enhanced our stringent loan underwriting standards and proactive credit follow up procedures  we experienced a substantial increase of the provision for loan losses because of the weak economy  the decline in the real estate market  and the unprecedented nationwide increase in loan defaults and foreclosures 
with our enhanced credit underwriting procedures and a tightening of 
table of contents our loan growth  our provision for loan losses decreased to million in from million in however  the loan loss provisions for the recent two years have substantially increased  as compared with million in the increases in our provisions were primarily to keep pace with the continued growth of our loan portfolio and an increase of non performing loans see nonperforming assets below for further discussion

noninterest income total noninterest income decreased to million in  as compared with million and million in and  respectively 
noninterest income was of average assets in  lowered from and in and  respectively 
we currently earn non interest income from various sources  including an income stream provided by bank owned life insurance  or boli  in the form of an increase in cash surrender value 
the following table sets forth the various components of our noninterest income for the periods indicated noninterest income dollars in thousands for the years ended december  amount amount amount service charges on deposit accounts loan related servicing fees gain on sale of loans income from other earning assets other income total average assets noninterest income as a of average assets our largest source of noninterest income in was service charge income on deposit accounts  which represented over of total noninterest income 
service charges increased to million in  as compared with million and million in and  respectively 
the increase in services charge income was primarily due to our increase of over during february in the services charges we apply to our customers deposit accounts 
we constantly review service charge rates to maximize service charge income while maintaining a competitive position 
our second largest source of non interest income was loan related servicing fees  which represented approximately of our total non interest income 
this fee income consists of trade financing fees and servicing fees on sba loans sold 
with the expansion of our trade financing activities and the growth of our servicing loan portfolio  this fee income has generally increased 
in  it increased to million  as compared with million in both and the increase of million increase was primarily attributable to million more in income related to a smaller 
table of contents disposal of servicing assets and i o strips of million  such contra income were million and million in and  respectively 
the servicing fee income on sold loans is credited when we collect the monthly payments on the sold loans we are servicing and charged by the monthly amortization of servicing rights and i o strips that we originally capitalized upon sale of the related loans 
such servicing rights and i o strips are also charged against the loan service fee income account when the sold loans are paid off 
our third largest source of noninterest income was the gain on sale of loans  representing approximately of our total noninterest income in this category of income has substantially decreased to million in from million and million in and  respectively 
this noninterest income is derived primarily from the sale of the guaranteed portion of sba loans 
we sell the guaranteed portion of sba loans in government securities secondary markets and retain servicing rights 
due to the weakened economy and ongoing financial crisis  our sba loan production levels decreased to million in as compared with million and million in and  respectively  and accordingly the gain on sale of the guaranteed portions of sba loans decreased to million in  as compared with million in and million in the million decrease in gain of guaranteed portion of sba loan sales in was primarily attributed to the lowered sales volume and decrease in sales premium rates from in to in there was no sale of the unguaranteed portion of sba loans in  which resulted in no gain on sale for the year  as compared with million  and million in  and  respectively 
this source of noninterest income also includes sales gains on residential mortgage loans 
however  due to the decline of the residential mortgage market  sale transactions of residential mortgage loans were low  so the gain on such sales decreased to  in  as compared with  and  in and income on other earning assets represents income from earning assets other than interest earning assets  such as dividend income from fhlb stock ownership and the increase in cash surrender value of boli 
such income was million  million and million in  and  respectively 
the  change in was primarily due to  increase in boli interest income  and  increase in fhlb dividend income 
similarly in  the  increase in income was also primarily attributable to an additional boli interest and fhlb stock dividends 
other income represented income from miscellaneous sources  such as loan referral fees  sba loan packaging fees  gain on sale of investment securities and excess of insurance proceeds over carrying value of an insured loss that generally increases as our business grows 
other income increased to million in  as compared with million in and million in noninterest expense total noninterest expense increased to million in from million in which previously increased from million in these increases were primarily attributable to the increase in stock compensation expenses for new stock options granted in june and various expenses associated with the integration of our new los angeles office opened in august however  due to continuing efforts to minimize operating expenses during our expansion  we were able to maintain noninterest expenses as a percentage of average assets at a low level of in  as compared with in both and management believes that its efforts in cost cutting and revenue diversification have effectively maintained our operational efficiency at comparatively low levels in despite the weak economic conditions  our efficiency ratio has only slightly increased to in  from in and in 
table of contents the following table sets forth a summary of noninterest expenses for the periods indicated noninterest expense dollars in thousands for the years ended december  amount amount amount salaries and employee benefits occupancy and equipment data processing professional fees outsourced service for customers deposit insurance premium advertising and promotional office supplies communications directors fees investor relation expenses amortization of investments in affordable housing partnerships amortization of other intangibles assets other total average assets noninterest expense as a of average assets salaries and employee benefits historically represent more than half of our total noninterest expense and generally increase as our branch network and business volume expand 
these expenses increased to million in  as compared with million in and million in  representing increases of and in and  respectively  over each of the prior year periods 
the million increase in over was the result of overall compensation increases  coupled with million increase in stock compensation attributable to the new options granted in june under the stock option plan 
although additional staffing was necessitated by our new office openings and business growth in the past months  we have successfully controlled and maintained our total number of employees through effective allocation of our human resources 
the number of full time equivalent employees decreased to in december  as compared with and in and  respectively 
nonetheless  our steady asset growth helped us increased assets per employee to million  as compared with million and million at the end of  and  respectively 
occupancy and equipment expenses represent approximately to of total noninterest expenses and totaled million in  compared to million in and million in  representing increases of and in and  respectively  over each of the prior year periods 
these increases were attributable primarily to the expansion of our office network and the additional office space and lease expenses for our new california branch office opened in august similarly  the increases were primarily attributed to the addition of our bayside branch  while the increases in were primarily attributed to our first two branches in the new york new jersey area 

table of contents data processing expenses remained constant at million in and  which previously increased from million in the increase in data processing in corresponded to the growth of our business 
since we exercised extra caution in limiting expenses in  we were successful in keeping this overhead cost down in the current year 
professional fees generally increase as we grow and we expect these expenditures continue to be significant  as we address the enhanced sec and nasdaq corporate governance requirements and the local regulation of the states into which we expand our business operations 
professional fees were million  million  and million  or   and of total noninterest expense  in  and  respectively 
the  increase in was mainly attributable to the  increase in legal fees related to loan collection  property foreclosure and repossession  and various other legal consultations  and the  increase in fees related to consulting  system test  and various accounting and auditing services 
similarly in  the  increase was mainly attributable to the legal and accounting fees incurred for various legal consultations and to comply with the enhanced financial reporting requirements of the sarbanes oxley act  or sox 
outsourced service costs for customers are payments made to third parties who provide services that were traditionally provided by banks to their customers  such as armored car services or bookkeeping services  and are recouped from the earnings credits earned by the respective depositors on their balances maintained with us 
due mainly to the increase in service activities and the increase in depositors demanding such services  our outsourced service costs generally rise in proportion with our business growth 
nonetheless  with our successful cost control measures  these expenses decreased to million in  as compared with million in and million in deposit insurance premium expenses represent the financing corporation fico and fdic insurance premium assessments 
in  these expenses increased to  from  in  which was primarily attributable to the new  fdic risk insurance premium assessment beginning in the second quarter of prior to the second quarter of  only fico premium of  was assessed 
in addition to the regular  fdic risk insurance premium assessment  there was another additional  increase in the fdic risk insurance premium assessment attributable to a temporary increase in deposit insurance coverage in the fourth quarter of as part of the fdic s temporary liquidity guarantee program 
see related discussion in item  business 
because there was no fidc deposit insurance assessment and only an approximate  fico premium was assessed prior to  the expenses in this category were only  in advertising and promotional expenses decreased to million in from million in  which previously decreased from million in  representing   and of total noninterest expenses in  and  respectively 
these expenses represent marketing activities  such as media advertisements and promotional gifts for customers of newly opened offices  especially in the new areas such as the east coast market in new york and new jersey 
the expenses have been decreasing in the past two years  which was primarily attributable to our cost management efforts and the stabilization of our east coast expansion 
noninterest expense  other than the categories specifically addressed above  increased by  or  to million in from million in the increase represents a normal growth in association with the growth of our business activities and was in line with our expectation 
in  noninterest expenses remained roughly the same  as compared with  which has a balance of million 
as a result of our cost control effort  noninterest expense increased less rapidly at in and in  as compared with in our successful expansion into the new york new jersey market in the previous years has paved the groundwork for our further expansion into the east coast in and beyond 
accordingly  we did not see the same level of increases in expenses in and  as compared with although management anticipates that noninterest expense will 
table of contents continue to increase as we continue to grow  we remain committed to cost control and operational efficiency  and we expect to keep these increases to a minimum relative to our rate of growth 
provision for income taxes for the year ended december   we made a provision for income taxes of million on pretax net income of million  representing an effective tax rate of  as compared with a provision for income taxes of million on pretax net income of million  representing an effective tax rate of for  and a provision of million on pretax net income of million  representing an effective tax rate of for the effective tax rate in was slightly lower than those in prior years due primarily to an increase in low income housing tax credit funds and the effect of a change in our estimated tax provision 
our lower effective tax rates compared to statutory rates were mainly due to state tax benefits derived from doing business in an enterprise zone and tax preferential treatment for our ownership of boli and low income housing tax credit funds see other earning assets for further discussion 
generally  income tax expense is the sum of two components current tax expense and deferred tax expense benefit 
current tax expense is calculated by applying the current tax rate to taxable income 
deferred tax expense accounts for the change in deferred tax assets liabilities from year to year 
deferred income tax assets and liabilities represent the tax effects  based on current tax law  of future deductible or taxable amounts attributable to events that have been recognized in our financial statements 
because we traditionally recognize substantially more expenses in our financial statements than we have been allowed to deduct for taxes  we generally have a net deferred tax asset 
at december   and  we had net deferred tax assets of million  million and million  respectively 
on january   we adopted the provisions of fin  accounting for uncertainty in income taxes 
as a result of applying the provisions of fin  we recognized an increase in the liability for unrecognized tax benefit of  and related interest of  as of december   the total unrecognized tax benefit that would affect the effective rate if recognized was  the adjustment was solely related to the state exposure from california enterprise zone net interest deductions 
we do not expect the unrecognized tax benefits to change significantly over the next months 
as of the december   the total accrued interest related to uncertain tax positions was  we accounted for interest related to uncertain tax positions as part of our provision for federal and state income taxes 
accrued interest was included as part of our net deferred tax asset in the consolidated financial statements 
we file united states federal and state income tax returns in jurisdictions with varying statue of limitations 
the through tax years generally remain subject to examination by federal and most state tax authorities 
we are currently under examinations for the and tax years under the california franchise tax board and the new york state department of taxation and finance 
we believe that we have adequately provided or paid for income tax issues not yet resolved with federal  state and foreign tax authorities 
based upon consideration of all relevant facts and circumstances  we do not expect the examination results will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statement as of december  see note 
financial condition investment portfolio investments are one of our major sources of interest income and are acquired in accordance with a written comprehensive investment policy addressing strategies  types and levels of allowable investments 
this investment policy is reviewed at least annually by the board of directors 

table of contents management of our investment portfolio is set in accordance with strategies developed and overseen by our asset liability committee 
investment balances  including cash equivalents and interest bearing deposits in other financial institutions  are subject to change over time based on our asset liability funding needs and interest rate risk management objectives 
our liquidity levels take into consideration anticipated future cash flows and all available sources of credits and are maintained at levels management believes are appropriate to assure future flexibility in meeting anticipated funding needs 
cash equivalents and interest bearing deposits in other financial institutions we sell federal funds  purchase securities under agreements to resell and high quality money market instruments  and deposit interest bearing accounts in other financial institutions to help meet liquidity requirements and provide temporary holdings until the funds can be otherwise deployed or invested 
as of december    and  we had million  million and million  respectively  in overnight federal funds sold and repurchase agreements 
we did not have any interest bearing deposits in other financial institutions as of december    and investment securities management of our investment securities portfolio focuses on providing an adequate level of liquidity and establishing a balanced interest rate sensitive position  while earning an adequate level of investment income without taking undue risk 
as of december   our investment portfolio is primarily comprised of united states government agency securities  accounting for of the entire investment portfolio 
our us government agency securities holdings are all prime conforming mortgage backed securities  or mbs  and collateralized mortgage obligations  or cmos  guaranteed by fnma  fhlmc  or gnma 
gnmas are considered equivalent to us treasury securities  as they are backed by the full faith and credit of the us government 
currently  there are no subprime mortgages in our investment portfolio 
besides the us government agency securities  we also have a investment in corporate debt and in municipal debt securities 
among all of our corporate and municipal debt securities  carry the top rating of aaa aaa  while the remaining  or million  carry an intermediate investment grade rating of at least baa bbb or above 
our investment portfolio does not contain any government sponsored enterprises  or gse  preferred securities or any distressed corporate securities that had required other than temporary impairment charges as of december  we classified our investment securities as held to maturity or available for sale pursuant to sfas no 
we adopted sfas no 
and sfas no 
effective january   and we adopted fasb staff position fsp sfas no 
effective october  pursuant to the fair value election option of sfas no 
 we have chosen to continue classifying our existing instruments of investment securities as held to maturity or available for sale under sfas no 
investment securities that we intend to hold until maturity are classified as held to maturity securities  and all other investment securities are classified as available for sale 
the carrying values of available for sale investment securities are adjusted for unrealized gains and losses as a valuation allowance and any gain or loss is reported on an after tax basis as a component of other comprehensive income 
declines in the fair value of held to maturity and available for sale securities below their cost that are deemed to be other than temporary are reflected in earnings as realized losses  and there were no such other than temporary impairment in the fair market values of our held to maturity and available for sale securities were respectively million and million as of december

total investment securities as a percentage of total assets were and at december  and  respectively  compared to at december  as of december   investment securities having a carrying value of million were pledged to secure certain deposits 

table of contents as of december   held to maturity securities  which are carried at their amortized costs  decreased to million from million and million at december  and  respectively 
the million reduction in was due to million investments being called and the remainder million matured  while the entire million reduction in was due to investments being called 
available for sale securities  which are stated at their fair market values  increased to million at december  from million and million at december  and  respectively 
the million increase in represented million net purchases and million unrealized gain  while the million increase in represented million net purchases and million unrealized gain 
these increases reflect a strategy of improving our levels of liquidity using available for sale securities  in addition to immediately available funds which are maintained mainly in the form of overnight investments

table of contents declines in the fair value of held to maturity and available for sale securities below their cost that are deemed to be other than temporary are reflected in earnings as realized losses 
in estimating other than temporary impairment losses  we consider  among other things  i the length of time and the extent to which the fair value has been less than cost  ii the financial condition and near term prospects of the issuer  and iii our intent and ability to retain our investment in the issuer for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in fair value 
we performed detailed evaluation of the investment portfolio in assessing individual positions that have market values that have declined below cost 
in assessing whether there was other than temporary impairment  we considered in a disciplined manner whether or not all contractual cash flows due on a security will be collected  and our positive intent and ability to hold the debt security until recovery in fair value or maturity a number of factors are considered in the analysis  including but not limited to issuer s credit rating  likelihood of the issuer s default or bankruptcy  collateral underlying the security  industry in which the issuer operates  nature of the investment  severity and duration of the decline in fair value  and analysis of the average life and effective maturity of the security 
we do not believe that any individual unrealized loss as of december  represented an other than temporary impairment 
the unrealized losses on our gse bonds  gse cmos  and gse mbs were attributable to both changes in interest rate us treasury curve and a repricing of risk spreads widening against risk fee rate in the market 
we do not own any non agency mbs or cmo 
all gse bonds  gse cmo  and gse mbs securities are backed by us government sponsored and federal agencies and therefore rated aaa aaa 
we have no exposure to the subprime market in the form of asset backed securities  or abs  and collateralized debt obligations  or cdos  that had previously been rated aaa aaa but have since been downgraded to below investment grade 
we have the intent and ability to hold the securities in an unrealized loss position at december  until the market value recovers or the securities mature 
municipal bonds and corporate bonds are evaluated by reviewing the credit worthiness of the issuer and general market conditions 
the unrealized losses on our investment in municipal and corporate securities were primarily attributable to both changes in interest rates and a repricing of risk in the market 
we have the intent and ability to hold the securities in an unrealized loss position at december  until the market value recovers or the securities mature 
loan portfolio total loans are the sum of loans receivable and loans held for sale and reported at their outstanding principal balances net of any unearned income which is unamortized deferred fees and costs and premiums and discounts

table of contents in the ordinary course of our business  we originate and service our own loans 
for salable loans that we choose to sell in the secondary market  we sell them with representations and warranties generally consistent with industry practices  but without recourse 
the exception is sba loans  and it is our practice to resell these loans in the secondary market for the guaranteed portion with day recourse 
accordingly  we do not retain a significant amount of the credit risk exposure on the loans sold 
and  for all loans we originate and carry  we have not had any subprime loans 
real estate secured loans consist primarily of commercial real estate loans and are extended to finance the purchase and or improvement of commercial real estate and or businesses thereon 
the properties may be either user owned or for investment purposes 
our loan policy adheres to the real estate loan guidelines set forth by the fdic 
the policy provides guidelines including  among other things  fair review of appraisal value  limitation on loan to value ratio  and minimum cash flow requirements to service debt 
loans secured by real estate equaled billion  billion  billion  billion  and billion  as of december     and  respectively 
real estate secured loans as a percentage of total loans were     and at december     and  respectively 
because of the decline of the national real estate market and as a result of our target marketing efforts for unsecured business and commercial loans  the volume of our real estate secured loans as a percentage of our total loan portfolio has decreased in the  and  compared to the prior years  and we believe there will be further decreases going forward 
we offer a wide selection of residential mortgage programs  including non traditional mortgages such as interest only and payment option adjustable rate mortgages 
however  we are extremely cautious at offering such unconventional loans to our customers  and currently we carried no subprime loans in our portfolio 
most of our salable loans are transferred to the secondary market  but we retain a portion on our books as portfolio loans 
this secondary market has become less active compared to the prior years as a result of the general decline in the real estate market and the fact that a few key purchasers in the market have experienced financial difficulties due to the ongoing credit crisis 
our total home mortgage loan portfolio outstanding at the end of and were million and million  respectively  and they represented only a small fraction of our total loan portfolio at in and in we have deemed the effect of this segment of our portfolio on our credit risk profile to be immaterial 
the residential mortgage loans with unconventional terms such as interest only mortgage and option adjustable rate mortgage at december  were million and million  respectively  inclusive of loans held temporarily for sale or refinancing 
they were million and million  respectively  at december  commercial and industrial loans include revolving lines of credit  as well as term business loans 
commercial and industrial loans were million  million  million  million  and million at the end of    and  respectively 
commercial and industrial loans were     and as a percentage of total loans at the end of    and  respectively 
such increases in recent years were mainly caused by our marketing strategy  which targets the relationship based accounts  such as unsecured business and commercial loans 
in the current economic environment  we exercise more due diligence in acquiring new loans 
consequently  we expect that our loan portfolio will continue to grow  but at a more controlled pace 
consumer loans have historically represented less than of our total loan portfolio 
the majority of consumer loans are concentrated in automobile loans  which we provide as a service only to existing customers 
as consumer loans present a higher risk potential compared to our other loan products  especially given current economic conditions  we have reduced our effort in consumer lending since accordingly  as of december   the balance of consumer loans was down by million to million  as compared with million  million  million and million at the end of   and  respectively 
consumer loans as a percentage of total loans have historically been minimal 

table of contents construction loans are generally extended as a temporary financing vehicle only  which also represented less than of our total loan portfolio 
in response to the current real estate market  we have applied stricter loan underwriting policy when making loans in this category 
as a result  construction loans decreased to million as of december   as compared with million  million and million and million at the end of   and  respectively 
our loan terms vary according to loan type 
commercial term loans have typical maturities of three to five years and are extended to finance the purchase of business entities  business equipment  and leasehold improvements  or to provide permanent working capital 
sba guaranteed loans usually have longer maturities to years 
we generally limit real estate loan maturities to five to eight years 
lines of credit  in general  are extended on an annual basis to businesses that need temporary working capital and or import export financing 
we generally seek diversification in our loan portfolio  and our borrowers are diverse as to industry  location  and their current and target markets

the loans generated by our loan production offices  which are located outside of our main geographical market  are generally collateralized by property in close proximity to those offices 
we employ strict guidelines regarding the use of collateral located in less familiar market areas 
since a major real estate recession during the first part of the previous decade  property values in southern california and around the country have generally increased in the last year span from to since late  we have started to see below trend growth in gdp and a gradual decline of the real estate market in southern california and many other areas in the country 
the financial crisis worsened during the later half of  and we observed further decline in the real estate market across the nation 
nonetheless  as of year end  of our loans are secured by first mortgages on various types of real estate 
we expect to see the decline in real estate values to continue into  so with the current economic conditions  no assurance can be given that property values will not decline further in nonperforming assets nonperforming assets  or npas  consist of nonperforming loans  or npls  restructured loans  and other npas 
npls are reported at their outstanding balances  net of any portion guaranteed by sba  and consist of loans on non accrual status and loans days or more past due and still accruing interest 
restructured loans are loans of which the terms of repayment have been renegotiated  resulting in a reduction or deferral of interest or principal 
other npas consist of properties  mainly other real estates owned  or oreo  and repossessed vehicles  acquired by foreclosure or similar means that management intends to offer for sale 
despite the significant growth of our loan portfolio  our continued emphasis on asset quality control enabled us to maintain a relatively low level of npls prior to however  the general economic condition of the us as well as the local economies in which we do business have shown a gradual decline as the housing sector and gdp growth continued to show weakness in and the gdp has started to show negative movement 
this unfavorable macro economy environment affected the strength of our borrowers strength  and our npls  net of sba guaranteed portion  increased to million at the end of  as compared with million  million  million  and million at the end of    and  respectively 
at december   the npls as a percentage of total loans was  increased from   and in   and  respectively 

table of contents at december   we had million as other npas  which was comprised of eight oreos  with seven of those foreclosed in we have listed the properties for sale as of december  among those eight oreos  we have recorded  provision for one of them  with a total value of  the oreo was subsequently sold in february for a small gain of  at the end of  the majority of our oreo was attributable to a single oreo valued at  which was foreclosed in the fourth quarter of at the end of  we had a different oreo  which was subsequently sold in january at a small loss 
at the end of  we had three oreos as other nonperforming assets with an aggregate value of  which were subsequently sold without significant losses 
together with oreo and repossessed vehicles  we managed the ratio of npas as a percentage of total loans and other nonperforming assets at a relatively low level for the past five years  equaling    and as of december     and  respectively 
management believes that the reserve provided for npas  together with the tangible collateral  were adequate as of december  see allowance for loan losses and loan commitments below for further discussion 
except for the million disclosed in the table above  as of december   management was not aware of any material credit problems of borrowers that would cause it to have serious doubts about the ability of a borrower to comply with the present loan payment terms 
however  no assurance can be given that credit problems do not exist that may not have been brought to the attention of management

additional interest income of approximately million would have been recorded during the year ended december   if these loans had been paid in accordance with their original terms and had been outstanding throughout the fiscal year ended december  or  if not outstanding throughout the fiscal year ended december   since origination 
during the fiscal year ended december   no interest income related to this loan was included in net income 
additional interest income would be negligible during the year ended december   if this loan had been paid in accordance with its original term and had been outstanding throughout the fiscal year ended december  
table of contents allowance for loan losses and loan commitments based on the credit risk inherent in our lending business  we set aside allowances through charges to earnings 
such charges were not only made for the outstanding loan portfolio  but also for off balance sheet loan commitments  such as commitments to extend credit or letters of credit 
charges made for the outstanding loan portfolio were credited to the allowance for loan losses  whereas charges related to loan commitments were credited to the reserve for loan commitments  which is presented as a component of other liabilities 
the provision for loan losses and loan commitments is discussed in the section entitled provision for loan losses and provision for loan commitments above 
as a result of our stricter underwriting policies  and the improved due diligence in our loan review process  the net charge offs in decreased to million  as compared to million in nonetheless  the net charge offs in the recent two years were much higher compared to the previous years because the weak business climate adversely impacted the financial condition of a number of our clients 
our net charge offs were million  million  and million  respectively in   and the net charge offs in were mainly comprised of million of commercial and industrial loan charge offs  million of commercial real estate loan charge offs  and million of consumer loan charge offs 
the million net charge offs represents of average total loans in  as compared with    and  in    and  respectively 
in order to keep pace with the increase of npls and the size of our loan portfolio  we increased our allowance for loan losses by  or million  to million at december   as compared with million at december  such allowances were million  million  and million at december    and  respectively 
with the continued increase of the allowance for loan losses and loan commitments in recent years  we were able to maintain the adequate ratio of allowance for loan losses to total loans at     and at the end of     and  respectively 
management believes that the current ratio of is adequate for our loan portfolio because the level of total npls as of december  was relatively low at of total loans 
although management believes our allowance at december  was adequate to absorb losses from any known and inherent risks in the portfolio  no assurance can be given that economic conditions which adversely affect our service areas or other variables will not result in increased losses in the loan portfolio in the future

off balance sheet arrangements during the ordinary course of business  we provide various forms of credit lines to meet the financing needs of our customers 
these commitments  which represent a credit risk to us  are not represented in any form on our balance sheets 
as of december   and  we had commitments to extend credit of million  million  and million  respectively 
obligations under standby letters of credit were million  million  and million  for  and  respectively  and the obligations under commercial letters of credit were million  million  and million for the same periods 

table of contents the effect on our revenues  expenses  cash flows and liquidity from the unused portion of the commitments to provide credit cannot be reasonably predicted because there is no guarantee that the lines of credit will be used 
in the normal course of business  we are involved in various legal claims 
we have reviewed all legal claims against us with counsel and have taken into consideration the views of counsel as to the outcome of the claims 
in our opinion  the final disposition of all such claims will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations 
other earning assets for various business purposes  we make investments in earning assets other than the interest earning assets discussed above 
before  the only other earning assets held by us were insignificant amounts of federal home loan bank stock and the cash surrender value of the boli 
in an effort to provide additional benefits aimed at retaining key employees  while generating a tax exempt noninterest income stream  we purchased million and million in boli during and  respectively  from insurance carriers rated aa or above 
in  we purchased  more in boli from the same insurance carriers 
we are the owner and the primary beneficiary of the life insurance policies and recognize the increase of the cash surrender value of the policies as tax exempt other income 
in  we also invested in several low income housing tax credit funds lihtcf to promote our participation in cra activities 
we committed to invest  over two to three years  a total of million to two different lihtcf million in apollo california tax credit fund xxii  lp  and million in hudson housing los angeles revitalization fund  lp

in  we made million additional commitment to invest in hudson housing los angeles revitalization fund iv lp 
we receive the returns on these investments  over the fifteen years following the said two to three year investment periods in the form of tax credits and tax deductions 
recently in  we committed to invest million in wnc institutional tax credit fund x new york series in order to promote our cra activities in the assessment area in new york and million in wnc institutional tax credit fund in order to promote our cra activities in the assessment area in dallas 
as a collateral for our fhlb borrowings  we are required by fhlb to invest in fhlb stock 
in  our total additional investment in fhlb stock was million  and our total dividends received from our fhlb stock holdings were million 
therefore  the total asset value of the fhlb stock increased million to million as of year end from million in the prior year

total deposits at december   and were billion  billion and billion  respectively  representing an increase of million  or  in and million  or  in the average deposits for the years ended december   and were billion  billion  and billion  respectively 
the average deposit balances remained about the same between year ends of and in  the average deposit balances increased million  or  from the prior year end 
the slow down in deposit growth was primarily due to the stiff competition among other banks in the community 
we expect our expansion into the new york new jersey area and more branch coverage within our primary market of southern california to outpace the existing deposit competition 
in  we expect to see a moderate but higher deposit growth rate than in after  our niche market depositor s preference in time deposits bearing relatively high interest rates decreased the level of deposits in transactional accounts and we increased our reliance on time deposits to fund our loan growth 
despite our efforts in controlling the growth of expensive time deposits  the percentage of the average time deposits over the average total deposits slightly increased to in  from in and in  because of the stiff competition for deposits in the markets where we do business 
we will continue to promote our core deposit campaign in order to achieve the assigned core deposit goals and to reduce our level of time deposit reliance going forward 
the average rate paid on time deposits in denominations of  or more decreased to in as compared with in  which previously increased from in see net interest income and net interest margin for further discussion

table of contents the scheduled maturities of our time deposits in denominations of  or greater at december  are  as follows maturities of time deposits of  or more  at december  dollars in thousands three months or less over three months through six months over six months through twelve months over twelve months total because our client base is comprised primarily of commercial and industrial accounts  individual account balances are generally higher than those of consumer oriented banks 
a number of clients carry deposit balances that were more than of our total deposits  but at both december   and  the california state treasury was the only depositor whose deposit balance was more than of our total deposits 
in addition to our regular customer base  we also accept brokered deposits on a selective basis at reasonable interest rates to augment deposit growth 
during  the ongoing financial crisis and stiff competition for customer deposits among banks within the markets where we do business has driven up interest rates on various deposit products 
as a result  broker deposits have been lower in cost  as compared with other time deposits 
accordingly  we have increased these deposits to million at december  from million and million  at december  and  respectively  in order to improve our net interest margin and to limit our reliance on high interest rate time deposits 
most of the brokered deposits will mature within one year 
fhlb borrowings although deposits are the primary source of funds for our lending and investment activities and for general business purposes  we may obtain advances from the fhlb as an alternative to retail deposit funds 
we have historically utilized borrowings from fhlb in order to take advantage of the flexibility and comparatively low cost 
due to the ongoing financial crisis and stiff competition for customer deposits among banks in our market  we have occasionally used fhlb borrowings as an alternative to fund our growing loan portfolio 
see liquidity management below for the details on the fhlb borrowings program

table of contents payments of distributions on the trust preferred securities and payments on redemption of the trust preferred securities are guaranteed by wilshire bancorp 
the junior subordinated debentures are senior to our shares of common stock and series a preferred stock 
as a result  in the event of our bankruptcy  dissolution or liquidation  the holder of the junior subordinated debentures must be satisfied before any distributions can be made to the holders of our common stock or series a preferred stock 
we have the right to defer distributions on the junior subordinated debentures and related trust preferred securities for up to five years  during which time no dividends may be paid to holders of our common stock 
on march   the federal reserve board adopted a final rule that allows continued inclusion of trust preferred securities in the tier capital of bank holding companies  subject to stricter quantitative limits 
under the final rule  bank holding companies may include trust preferred securities in tier capital in an amount together with other restricted core capital elements equal to of the sum of core capital elements including restricted core capital elements net of goodwill less any associated deferred tax liability 
amounts in excess of these limits will generally be included in tier capital 
for purposes of this rule  restricted core capital elements are generally to be comprised of qualifying cumulative perpetual preferred stock and related surplus  minority interest related to qualifying cumulative perpetual preferred stock directly issued by a consolidated us depository institution or foreign bank subsidiary  minority interest related to qualifying common stock or qualifying cumulative perpetual preferred stock directly issued by a consolidated subsidiary that is neither a us depository institution or a foreign bank and qualifying trust preferred securities 
the final rule provides a transition period for bank holding companies to come into compliance with these new capital restrictions 
accordingly  while the final rule became effective on april   for practical purposes  bank holding companies will have until september  an extension of the september  transition period under the proposed rule to come into compliance with the final rule s capital restrictions due to the transition period 
in extending the transition period to  the federal reserve noted that the extended period will provide bank holding companies with existing trust preferred securities with call features after the first five years an opportunity to restructure their capital elements in order to conform to the limitations of the final rule 
under the final rule  as of december   wilshire bancorp categorized all million trust preferred securities as tier capital 
asset liability management management seeks to ascertain optimum and stable utilization of available assets and liabilities as a vehicle to attain our overall business plans and objectives 
in this regard  management focuses on measurement and control of liquidity risk  interest rate risk and market risk  capital adequacy  operation risk and credit risk 
see risk factors for further discussion on these risks 
information concerning interest rate risk management is set forth under item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 
liquidity management liquidity management involves our ability to meet cash flow requirements arising from fluctuations in deposit levels and demands of daily operations  which include funding of securities purchases  providing for customers credit needs and ongoing repayment of borrowings 
maintenance of adequate liquidity requires that sufficient resources be available at all time to meet our cash flow requirements 
liquidity in a banking institution is required primarily to provide for deposit withdrawals and the credit needs of its customers and to take advantage of investment opportunities as they arise 
liquidity management involves our ability to convert assets into cash or cash equivalents without incurring significant loss  and to raise cash or maintain funds without incurring excessive additional cost 
our 
table of contents liquidity is actively managed on a daily basis and reviewed periodically by the asset liability committee and the board of directors 
this process is intended to ensure the maintenance of sufficient funds to meet the needs of the company  including adequate cash flow for off balance sheet instruments 
our primary sources of liquidity are derived from financing activities which include the acceptance of customer and brokered deposits  federal funds facilities  repurchase agreement facilities  advances from the fhlb of san francisco  and issuance of long term debt 
these funding sources are augmented by payments of principal and interest on loans  the routine liquidation of securities from the available for sale portfolio and securitizations of loans 
in addition  government programs  such as fdic s tlgp  may influence deposit behavior 
primary use of funds include withdrawal of and interest payments on deposits  originations and purchases of loans  purchases of investment securities  and payment of operating expenses 
during the years ended december    and  we experienced net cash inflows from operating activities of million  million  and million  respectively 
in  net cash provided by operating activities was primarily attributable to the million net income adjusted for various non cash flow adjustments  including the subtraction of million origination of loan held for sale  and additions of million proceeds from sale of loans held for sale and million provision for losses on loans and loan commitments 
similarly in and  the net cash provided by operating activities were primarily attributable to the net income earned during the immediately preceding years 
net cash outflows from investing activities totaled million  million  and million during  and  respectively  and were primarily related to the net increases in loans receivable for those three years 
as our loan portfolio continued to grow  net increase in loan receivable were million  million  and million for  and  respectively 
net cash inflows from financing activities were million  million  and million for   and  respectively 
the net cash provided by financing activities in was primarily due to the proceeds from fhlb borrowings and other borrowings of million  and issuance of series a preferred stock to the us treasury in an amount equal to million 
in addition to the debt and equity financing  there was a million net increase in deposits 
in  net cash provided by financing activities were primarily related to million fhlb borrowings and other borrowings  and million proceed from issuance of trust preferred securities 
in  the net cash provided by financing activities were the net difference of million net increase in deposits  and million redemption of fhlb borrowings and other borrowings 
for purpose of having liquid cash available for emergencies  we maintain a portion of our funds in cash and cash equivalents  deposits in other financial institutions and loans and securities available for sale 
our liquid assets at december   and totaled approximately million  million and million  respectively 
our liquidity level measured as the percentage of liquid assets to total assets was  and at december   and  respectively 
as a secondary source of liquidity  we have available a combination of borrowing sources comprised of the federal reserve bank s discount window  fhlb advances  federal funds lines with various corresponding banks  and several master repurchase agreements with major brokerage companies 
among all these sources  we prefer advances from the fhlb to supplement our supply of lendable funds and to meet deposit withdrawal requirements 
advances from the fhlb are typically secured by our mortgage loans and stock issued by the fhlb 
advances are made pursuant to several different programs 
each credit program has its own interest rate and range of maturities 
depending on the program  limitations on the amount of advances are based either on a fixed percentage of an institution s net worth or on the fhlb s assessment of the institution s creditworthiness 
while this fund provides flexibility and reasonable cost  we limit our use to of our borrowing capacity  as 
table of contents such borrowing does not qualify as core funds 
as of december   our borrowing capacity from the fhlb was about million and the outstanding balance was million  or approximately of our borrowing capacity 
as of december   we also maintained a guideline to purchase up to a combined million in federal funds lines with two correspondent banks 
capital resources and capital adequacy requirements historically  our primary source of capital has been internally generated operating income through retained earnings 
in order to ensure adequate levels of capital  we conduct ongoing assessments of projected sources and uses of capital in conjunction with projected increases in assets and level of risks 
we have considered  and we will continue to consider  additional sources of capital as the need arises  whether through the issuance of additional equity  debt or hybrid securities 
when the us treasury made tarp funds available to financial institutions in october  our board of directors decided to take advantage of this opportunity and increased our capital by participating in the program 
in december  we received a tarp investment from the us treasury in the amount of million see notes and 
we are subject to various regulatory capital requirements administered by federal banking agencies 
under capital adequacy guidelines and the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action  we must meet specific capital guidelines that rely on quantitative measures of our assets  liabilities and certain off balance sheet items as calculated under regulatory accounting practices 
failure to meet minimum capital requirements can trigger regulatory actions under the prompt corrective action rules that could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and operations 
prompt corrective action may include regulatory enforcement actions that restrict dividend payments  require the adoption of remedial measures to increase capital  terminate fdic deposit insurance  and mandate the appointment of a conservator or receiver in severe cases 
in addition  failure to maintain a well capitalized status may adversely affect the evaluation of regulatory applications for specific transactions and activities  including acquisitions  continuation and expansion of existing activities  and commencement of new activities  and could adversely affect our business relationships with our existing and prospective clients 
the aforementioned regulatory consequences for failing to maintain adequate ratios of tier and tier capital could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
our capital amounts and classification are also subject to qualitative judgments by regulators about components  risk weightings  and other factors 
see part i  item description of business regulation and supervision capital adequacy requirements in this annual report on form k for additional information regarding regulatory capital requirements 
as of december   we were qualified as a well capitalized institution under the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action 
the following table presents the regulatory standards for well capitalized institutions  compared to our capital ratios as of the dates specified for wilshire bancorp  inc and wilshire state bank actual ratios for the company as of regulatory adequately capitalized standards regulatory well capitalized standards wilshire bancorp  inc december  december  december  total capital to risk weighted assets tier i capital to risk weighted assets tier i capital to average assets

in  total shareholders equity also grew by million from million at december   after declaring cash dividends of million  primarily from internally generated operating income of million 
our equity also increased by the share based compensation and other comprehensive income 
as of december   for the regulatory capital ratio computation purposes  we considered the junior subordinated debentures of million  which consists of million issued by the bank and million issued by the company in connection with the issuance of million trust preferred securities 
at december   wilshire bancorp accounted for million of such securities as tier capital and million as tier capital 
as of december   as the result of issuance of the series a preferred stock in december  the portion qualified for tier capital increased to million million tarp preferred stock and million trust preferred securities  decreasing the portion for tier capital to million 
for the bank level  only the million debenture issued by the bank in is treated as tier capital

subsequent changes in the fair value of contingent consideration classified as a liability are to be recognized in earnings  while contingent consideration classified as equity is not to be remeasured 
costs such as transaction costs are to be excluded from acquisition accounting  generally leading to recognizing expense and additionally  restructuring costs that do not meet certain criteria at the acquisition date are to be subsequently recognized as post acquisition costs

impact of inflation  seasonality inflation primarily impacts us through its effect on interest rates 
our primary source of income is net interest income  which is affected by changes in interest rates 
we attempt to limit the impact of inflation on our net interest margin through management of rate sensitive assets and liabilities and the analysis of interest rate sensitivity 
the effect of inflation on premises and equipment as well as noninterest expenses has not been significant for the periods covered in this report 
our business is generally not seasonal 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk is the risk of loss from adverse changes in market prices and rates 
our market risk arises primarily from interest rate risk inherent in lending  investing and deposit taking activities 
we evaluate market risk pursuant to policies reviewed and approved annually by our board of directors 
the board delegates responsibility for market risk management to the asset liability management alm committee  which reports monthly to the board on activities related to market risk management 
as part of the management of our market risk  our alm committee may direct changes in the mix of assets and liabilities 
to that end  we actively monitor and manage interest rate risk exposures 
interest rate risk management involves development  analysis  implementation and monitoring of earnings to provide stable earnings and capital levels during periods of changing interest rates 
in the management of interest rate risk  we utilize monthly gap analysis and quarterly simulation modeling to determine the sensitivity of net interest income and economic value of equity 
these techniques are complementary and are used together to provide a more accurate measurement of interest rate risk 
gap analysis measures the repricing mismatches between assets and liabilities 
the interest rate sensitivity gap is determined by subtracting the amount of liabilities from the amount of assets that 
table of contents reprice in a particular time interval 
if repricing assets exceed repricing liabilities in any given time period  we would be deemed to be asset sensitive for that period 
conversely  if repricing liabilities exceed repricing assets  we would be deemed to be liability sensitive for that period 
we usually seek to maintain a balanced position over the period of one year to ensure net interest margin stability in times of volatile interest rates 
this is accomplished by maintaining a similar level of interest earning assets and interest paying liabilities available to be repriced within one year 
the change in net interest income may not always follow the general expectations of an asset sensitive or a liability sensitive balance sheet during periods of changing interest rates 
this possibility results from interest rates changing by differing increments and at different time intervals for each type of interest sensitive asset and liability 
the interest rate sensitivity gaps reported in the tables arise when assets are funded with liabilities having different repricing intervals 
because these gaps are actively managed and change daily as adjustments are made in interest rate views and market outlook  positions at the end of any period may not reflect our interest rate sensitivity in subsequent periods 
we attempt to balance longer term economic views against prospects for short term interest rate changes 
although the interest rate sensitivity gap is a useful measurement and contributes to effective asset and liability management  it is difficult to predict the effect of changing interest rates based solely on that measure 
as a result  the alm committee also regularly uses simulation modeling as a tool to measure the sensitivity of earnings and net portfolio value npv to interest rate changes 
the npv is defined as the net present value of an institution s existing assets  liabilities and off balance sheet instruments 
the simulation model captures all assets  liabilities and off balance sheet financial instruments and accounts for significant variables that are believed to be affected by interest rates 
these include prepayment speeds on loans  cash flows of loans and deposits  principal amortization  call options on securities  balance sheet growth assumptions and changes in rate relationships as various rate indices react differently to market rates 
although the simulation measures the volatility of net interest income and net portfolio value under immediate increase or decrease of market interest rate scenarios in basis point increments  our main concern is the negative effect of a reasonably possible worst scenario 
the alm policy prescribes that for the worst possible rate decreasing scenario the possible reduction of net interest income and npv should not exceed of the base net interest income and of the base npv  respectively 
in general  based upon our current mix of deposits  loans and investments  decrease in interest rates would result the increase of net interest margin and npv 
increase in interest rates would be expected to have opposite effect 
however  given in the record low interest rate environment  further decrease in interest rate will result in net interest margin as shown in our simulation measures below 
management believes that the assumptions used to evaluate the vulnerability of our operations to changes in interest rates approximate actual experience and considers them reasonable  however  the interest rate sensitivity of our assets and liabilities and the estimated effects of changes in interest rates on our net interest income and npv could vary substantially if different assumptions were used or actual experience differs from the historical experience on which they are based 
the following table sets forth the interest rate sensitivity of our interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities as of december  using the interest rate sensitivity gap ratio 
for purposes of the following table  an asset or liability is considered rate sensitive within a specified period when it can be repriced or matures within its contractual terms 
actual payment patterns may differ from contractual payment patterns
