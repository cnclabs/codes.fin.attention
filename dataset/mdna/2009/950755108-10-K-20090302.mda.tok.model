overview we operate in the truckload and logistics sectors of the transportation industry 
in the truckload sector  we focus on transporting consumer nondurable products that generally ship more consistently throughout the year 
in the logistics sector  besides managing transportation requirements for individual customers  we provide additional sources of truck capacity  alternative modes of transportation  a global delivery network and systems analysis to optimize transportation needs 
our success depends on our ability to efficiently manage our resources in the delivery of truckload transportation and logistics services to our customers 
resource requirements vary with customer demand  which may be subject to seasonal or general economic conditions 
our ability to adapt to changes in customer transportation requirements is essential to efficiently deploy resources and make capital investments in tractors and trailers with respect to our truckload segment or obtain qualified third party capacity at a reasonable price with respect to our vas segment 
although our business volume is not highly concentrated  we may also be affected by our customers financial failures or loss of customer business 
operating revenues consist of i trucking revenues generated by the six operating fleets in the truckload segment dedicated  regional  van  expedited  temperature controlled and flatbed and ii non trucking revenues generated primarily by the four operating units within our vas segment brokerage  freight management  intermodal and international 
our truckload segment also includes a small amount of non trucking revenues  consisting primarily of the portion of shipments delivered to or from mexico where the truckload segment utilizes a third party capacity provider 
non trucking revenues reported in the operating statistics table include those revenues generated by the vas and truckload segments 
trucking revenues accounted for of total operating revenues in  and non trucking and other operating revenues accounted for 
trucking services typically generate revenues on a per mile basis 
other sources of trucking revenues include fuel surcharges and accessorial revenues such as stop charges  loading unloading charges and equipment detention charges 
because fuel surcharge revenues fluctuate in response to changes in fuel costs  these revenues are identified separately within the operating statistics table and are excluded from the statistics to provide a more meaningful comparison between periods 
the non trucking revenues in the operating statistics table include such revenues generated by a fleet whose operations fall within the truckload segment 
we do this so that we can calculate the revenue statistics in the operating statistics table using only the revenue generated by company owned and owner operator trucks 
the key statistics used to evaluate trucking revenues excluding fuel surcharges are i average revenues per tractor per week  ii per mile rates charged to customers  iii average monthly miles generated per tractor  iv average percentage of empty miles miles without trailer cargo  v average trip length in loaded miles and vi average number of tractors in service 
general economic conditions  seasonal trucking industry freight patterns and industry capacity are important factors that impact these statistics 
our most significant resource requirements are company drivers  owner operators  tractors  trailers and equipment operating costs such as fuel and related fuel taxes  driver pay  insurance and supplies and maintenance 
to mitigate our risk to fuel price increases  we recover additional fuel surcharges from our customers that recoup a majority  but not all  of the increased fuel costs  however  we cannot assure you that current recovery levels will continue in future periods 
our financial results are also affected by company driver and owner operator availability and the market for new and used revenue equipment 
we are self insured for a significant portion of bodily injury  property damage and cargo claims  workers compensation benefits and health claims for our employees supplemented by premium based insurance coverage above certain dollar levels 
for that reason  our financial results may also be affected by driver safety  medical costs  weather  legal and regulatory environments and insurance coverage costs to protect against catastrophic losses 
the operating ratio is a common industry measure used to evaluate our profitability and that of our truckload segment operating fleets 
the operating ratio consists of operating expenses expressed as a percentage of operating revenues 
the most significant variable expenses that impact the truckload segment are driver salaries and benefits  fuel  fuel taxes included in taxes and licenses expense  payments to owner operators included in rent and purchased transportation expense  supplies and maintenance and insurance and claims 
these expenses generally vary based on the number of miles generated 
we also evaluate these costs on a per mile basis to adjust for the impact on the percentage of total operating revenues caused by changes in fuel surcharge revenues  per mile rates charged to customers and non trucking revenues 
as discussed further in the comparison of operating results for to  several industry wide issues could cause costs to increase in these issues include a softer freight market  changing fuel prices  higher new truck purchase prices and a weaker used equipment market 
our main fixed costs include depreciation expense for tractors and trailers and equipment licensing fees included in taxes and licenses expense 
the truckload segment requires substantial cash expenditures for tractor and trailer purchases 
we fund these purchases with net cash from operations and financing available under our existing credit facilities  as management deems necessary 
we provide non trucking services primarily through the four operating units within our vas segment 
unlike our truckload segment  the vas segment is less asset intensive and is instead dependent upon qualified employees  information systems and qualified third party capacity providers 
the largest expense item related to the vas segment is the cost of purchased transportation we pay to third party capacity providers 
this expense item is recorded as rent and purchased transportation expense 
other operating expenses include salaries  wages and benefits and computer hardware and software depreciation 
we evaluate vas by reviewing the gross margin percentage revenues less rent and purchased transportation expenses expressed as a percentage of revenues and the operating income percentage

higher fuel prices and higher fuel surcharge collections increase our consolidated operating ratio and the truckload segment s operating ratio when fuel surcharges are reported on a gross basis as revenues versus netting against fuel expenses 
eliminating fuel surcharge revenues  which are generally a more volatile source of revenue  provides a more consistent basis for comparing the results of operations from period to period

compared to operating revenues operating revenues increased in compared to excluding fuel surcharge revenues  trucking revenues decreased due primarily to a decrease in the average number of tractors in service as discussed further below  partially offset by a increase in average annual miles per tractor 
the truckload freight market  as measured by our overall pre booked percentage of loads to trucks pre books  was softer during most of compared to freight demand was lower the first five months of compared to the first five months of in june  freight volumes improved and exceeded those of june but were approximately the same in third quarter compared to third quarter during fourth quarter  freight volumes declined and were significantly lower than fourth quarter the industry wide accelerated purchase of new trucks in advance of the epa engine emissions standards contributed to excess truck capacity that partially disrupted the supply and demand balance during early these excess trucks along with a weakening economy resulted in lower freight volumes during the first five months of compared to fuel prices increased significantly beginning in late february and peaked in july  contributing to an increase in trucking company failures 
we believe these failures resulted in a more even balance of truck supply to freight demand  which caused pre books in june to exceed those in june and pre books during third quarter to be flat compared to third quarter a very weak retail environment combined with extremely soft housing and manufacturing markets resulted in fewer available shipments during fourth quarter compared to fourth quarter fuel prices also decreased significantly during fourth quarter  resulting in fewer trucking company failures during fourth quarter freight demand softness caused by the weak economy and excess truck capacity made for a challenging freight market during much of we believe these factors increased price competition for freight in the spot market as carriers competed for loads to maintain truck productivity 
our van fleet has the most exposure to the spot freight market and faced the most operational and competitive challenges 
as a result  to better match the volume of freight with the number of trucks and improve profitability  we reduced the size of this fleet by trucks in  including a reduction of trucks during fourth quarter this decrease in the van fleet was partially offset by an increase in trucks in the more profitable regional and expedited fleets  as total trucks decreased by during as freight demand deteriorated during fourth quarter and into january  we reduced the van fleet by an additional trucks in january since march  we have reduced the van fleet from  trucks to about  trucks a reduction of  trucks 
to date in  the freight market remains very challenging and demand continues to be lower than a year ago 
january and february freight demand is very depressed  and we continue to see the freight market weaken  even after considering the significant fleet reduction we implemented in fourth quarter and january the average percentage of empty miles decreased to in from in this decrease was the result of a decrease in the average empty miles percentage related to the dedicated fleets 
these fleets generally operate according to arrangements under which we provide trucks and or trailers for a specific customer s exclusive use 
under nearly all of these arrangements  dedicated customers pay us on an all mile basis regardless of whether trailers are loaded or empty to obtain guaranteed truck and or trailer capacity 
for freight management and statistical reporting purposes  we classify a mile without cargo in the trailer as an empty mile or deadhead mile 
if we excluded the dedicated fleet  the average empty mile percentage would be in and in this increase resulted from the weaker freight market and more regional shipments with shorter lengths of haul 
fuel surcharge revenues represent collections from customers for the higher cost of fuel 
these revenues increased to million in from million in in response to higher average fuel prices in to lessen the effect of fluctuating fuel prices on our margins  we collect fuel surcharge revenues from our customers 
our fuel surcharge programs are designed to i recoup higher fuel costs from customers when fuel prices rise and ii provide customers with the benefit of lower fuel costs when fuel prices decline 
our fuel surcharge standard is a one cent per mile rate increase for every five cent per gallon increase in the doe weekly retail on highway diesel prices 
this standard is used for many fuel surcharge programs 
some customers also have their own fuel surcharge standard program for carriers 
these programs enable us to recover a majority  but not all  of the fuel price increases 
the remaining portion is generally not recoverable because of empty miles not billable to customers  out of route miles  truck idle time and the volatility of fuel prices when prices change rapidly in short time periods 
also  in a rapidly rising fuel price market  there is generally a several week delay between the payment of higher fuel prices and surcharge recovery 
in a rapidly declining fuel price market  the opposite generally occurs  and there is a temporary higher surcharge recovery compared to the price paid for fuel 
vas revenues are generated by its four operating units brokerage  freight management  intermodal and international 
vas revenues increased to million in from million in due to an increase in brokerage  intermodal and international revenues 
this growth was partially offset by a structural change to a customer s continuing third party carrier arrangement that became effective in july consequently  we began reporting vas revenues for this customer on a net basis revenues net of purchased transportation expense rather than on a gross basis 
this change affected the reporting of vas revenues and purchased transportation expenses for this customer in third quarter and subsequent periods 
this reporting change resulted in a reduction in vas revenues and vas rent and purchased transportation expense of million comparing to this reporting change had no impact on the dollar amount of vas gross margin or operating income 
excluding the affected freight revenues for this customer from revenues  vas revenues grew in compared to vas gross margin dollars increased during compared to due to an improvement in the gross margin percentage in the intermodal and international units offset by a decrease in the brokerage unit gross margin percentage 
brokerage revenues increased in compared to  but the brokerage gross margin percentage and operating income percentage declined 
these declines were due to i fuel price declines during the second half of and ii the tightening of truckload capacity in the first half of due to increased carrier failures  which made it more challenging for brokerage to obtain qualified third party carriers at a comparable margin to intermodal revenues increased by  and its operating income percentage also improved 
international  formed in july  revenues grew  and it achieved an improved gross margin percentage 
freight management successfully distributed freight to other operating divisions and continues to secure new customer business awards that generate additional freight opportunities across all company business units 
operating expenses our operating ratio operating expenses expressed as a percentage of operating revenues was in compared to in expense items that impacted the overall operating ratio are described on the following pages

owner operator costs are included in rent and purchased transportation expense 
owner operator miles as a percentage of total miles were in compared to in owner operators are independent contractors who supply their own tractor and driver and are responsible for their operating expenses including driver pay  fuel  supplies and maintenance and fuel taxes 
this decrease in owner operator miles as a percentage of total miles shifted costs from the rent and purchased transportation category to other expense categories 
due to this decrease  we estimate that rent and purchased transportation expense for the truckload segment was lower by approximately cents per total mile  and other expense categories had offsetting increases on a total mile basis as follows i salaries  wages and benefits  cents  ii fuel  cents  and iii depreciation  cent 
salaries  wages and benefits in the truckload segment increased cents per mile on a total mile basis in compared to this increase is primarily attributed to higher student pay average active trainer teams increased  higher workers compensation expense and  as discussed above  the shift from rent and purchased transportation to salaries  wages and benefits because of the decrease in owner operator miles as a percentage of total miles 
within the truckload segment  these cost increases were offset partially by lower non driver pay for office and equipment maintenance personnel due to efficiency and cost control improvements and lower group health insurance costs 
non driver salaries  wages and benefits increased in the non trucking vas segment due to growth in the vas segment 
the qualified and student driver recruiting and retention markets improved in compared to the weakness in the construction and automotive industries  trucking company failures and fleet reductions and a rising national unemployment rate continue to positively affect our driver availability and selectivity 
in addition  we believe our strong mileage utilization and financial strength are attractive to drivers when compared to other carriers 
we anticipate that availability of drivers will remain strong until current economic conditions improve 
when economic conditions improve  competition for qualified drivers will likely increase  and we cannot predict whether we will experience future driver shortages 
if such a shortage were to occur and driver pay rate increases were necessary to attract and retain drivers  our results of operations would be negatively impacted to the extent that corresponding freight rate increases were not obtained 
fuel increased cents per mile for the truckload segment due primarily to higher average diesel fuel prices offset partially by fuel efficiency improvements 
average fuel prices in were cents per gallon higher than in  a increase 
average monthly fuel prices in were higher than those in the comparable months of for the first ten months  with the amount of change over increasing steadily through june per gallon higher than june 
fuel prices began to fall in july and fell below the levels in the last two months of december prices were per gallon lower than december 
average fuel prices to date in have been per gallon lower than the same period of during  we implemented numerous initiatives to improve fuel efficiency and our fuel miles per gallon mpg 
these initiatives include i reducing truck engine idle time  ii lowering non billable miles  iii increasing the percentage of aerodynamic  more fuel efficient trucks in the company truck fleet and iv installing apus in company trucks 
truck engine idle time percentages can be affected by seasonal weather patterns such as warm summer months and cold winter months that prompt drivers to idle the engine to provide air conditioning or heating for comfort during non driving periods 
thus  engine idle time percentages for trucks without apus may be higher and fuel mpg may be lower as a result during the summer and winter months as compared to temperate spring and fall months 
apus provide an alternate source to power heating and air conditioning systems when the main engine is not operating  and apus consume significantly less diesel fuel than idling the main engine 
as of december   we had installed apus in approximately of the company owned truck fleet 
as a result of these initiatives  we improved our company truck average mpg by in compared to this mpg improvement resulted in the purchase of million fewer gallons of diesel fuel in than in this equates to a reduction of approximately  tons of carbon dioxide emissions 
as we purchase new trucks  we intend to continue installing apus and taking part in other environmentally conscious initiatives  such as our active participation in the smartway transport partnership program of the epa 
we have historically been successful recouping a majority  but not all  of fuel cost increases through our fuel surcharge program 
the remaining portion not recouped is caused by the impact of operational costs such as truck idling  empty miles  and out of route miles for which we are not compensated 
each year in the prior four years  rising fuel costs net of fuel surcharge collections had a negative impact on our operating income when compared to the previous year 
the total negative impact on our operating income due to fuel expense  net of fuel surcharge collections  during to was approximately million 
when fuel prices rise rapidly  a negative earnings lag occurs because the cost of fuel rises immediately and the market indexes used to determine fuel surcharges increase at a slower pace 
as a result  during these rising fuel price periods  the negative impact of fuel on our financial results is more significant 
this was the trend during the first two quarters of in a period of declining fuel prices  we generally experience a temporary favorable earnings effect because fuel costs decline at a faster pace than the market indexes used to determine fuel surcharge collections 
this trend began during third quarter as fuel prices began to decrease but had a larger impact during fourth quarter when fuel prices decreased over per gallon from the end of third quarter to the end of fourth quarter this resulted in temporarily lower net fuel expense that helped to offset uncompensated fuel costs from truck idling  empty miles not billable to customers  and out of route miles 
if fuel prices stabilize or increase in the future  we do not expect the temporary favorable trend to continue 
shortages of fuel  increases in fuel prices and petroleum product rationing can have a materially adverse effect on our operations and profitability 
we are unable to predict whether fuel price levels will increase or decrease in the future or the extent to which fuel surcharges will be collected from customers 
as of december   we had no derivative financial instruments to reduce our exposure to fuel price fluctuations 
supplies and maintenance for the truckload segment increased cents per total mile in compared to an increase in the average age of our company truck fleet from years at december  to years at december  caused an increase in maintenance cost per mile 
the higher average age of the truck fleet results in more maintenance that is not covered by warranty 
in addition to the higher average truck age  a higher percentage of the repairs was performed over the road as a result of the decrease in our equipment maintenance personnel see previous discussion of salaries  wages and benefits 
over the road vendors also raised their labor and parts rates during  which contributed to the increase in maintenance costs 
the prices of some parts purchased from over the road vendors  as well as those purchased for use in our shops  increased in because of higher commodity prices 
taxes and licenses for the truckload segment decreased cents per total mile in compared to due to a decrease in fuel taxes per mile resulting from the improvement in the company truck mpg 
an improved mpg results in fewer gallons of diesel fuel purchased and consequently less fuel taxes paid 
insurance and claims for the truckload segment increased from cents per total mile in to cents per total mile in an increase of cents per total mile 
of this increase  cents per total mile relates to unfavorable claims development on larger claims that occurred in years prior to offset partially by lower large claims incurred in the development of these prior year claims will limit further negative development on other large claims in these same policy years as we have now met our annual aggregates in some of these older policy years 
we renewed our liability insurance policies on august  and continue to be responsible for the first million per claim with an annual million aggregate for claims between million and million 
the annual aggregate for claims between million and million was lowered from million to million effective with the new policy year beginning august  see item legal proceedings for information on our bodily injury and property damage coverage levels since august  our liability insurance premiums for the policy year beginning august  are slightly lower than the previous policy year 
depreciation expense for the truckload segment increased cents per total mile in compared to this increase was due primarily to depreciation of the apus installed on company trucks and  to a lesser extent  to higher costs of tractors purchased during and a higher ratio of trailers to tractors resulting from the reduction of our fleet 
the apu depreciation expense is offset by lower fuel costs because tractors with apus generally consume less fuel during periods of idle 
higher average miles per tractor during compared to has the effect of lowering this fixed cost when evaluated on a per mile basis and offset a portion of the increases discussed above 
depreciation expense was historically affected by the engine emissions standards imposed by the epa that became effective in october and applied to all new trucks purchased after that time  resulting in increased truck purchase costs 
depreciation expense is affected because in january  a second set of more strict epa engine emissions standards became effective for all newly manufactured truck engines 
compared to trucks with engines produced before  the trucks with new engines manufactured under the standards have higher purchase prices 
we began to take delivery of trucks with these standard engines in first quarter to replace older trucks in our fleet 
the engines in our fleet of company owned trucks as of december  consist of caterpillar  detroit diesel  mercedes benz and cummins 
in june  caterpillar announced it will not produce on highway engines for use in the united states that will comply with new epa engine emissions standards that become effective in january but will continue to sell on highway engines internationally 
caterpillar also announced it is pursuing a strategic alliance with navistar 
approximately one million trucks in the us domestic market have caterpillar heavy duty engines  and caterpillar has stated it will fully support these engines going forward 
rent and purchased transportation expense consists mainly of payments to third party capacity providers in the vas segment and other non trucking operations and payments to owner operators in the truckload segment 
these expenses generally vary depending on changes in the volume of services generated by the segment 
as a percentage of vas revenues  vas rent and purchased transportation expense decreased to in compared to in as discussed on page  the vas segment s rent and purchased transportation expense was affected by a structural change to a large vas customer s continuing third party carrier arrangement that became effective in july that change resulted in a reduction in vas revenues and vas rent and purchased transportation expense of million from to excluding the rent and purchased transportation expense for this customer  the dollar amount of this expense increased for the vas segment by compared to an increase in vas revenues of 
rent and purchased transportation for the truckload segment increased cents per total mile in due primarily to increased fuel prices that necessitated higher reimbursements to owner operators for fuel during most of compared to  offset slightly by a decrease in the percentage of owner operator truck miles versus company truck miles 
fuel reimbursements to owner operators amounted to million in compared to million in these higher fuel reimbursements resulted in an increase of cents per total mile 
our customer fuel surcharge programs do not differentiate between miles generated by company owned and owner operator trucks 
challenging operating conditions continue to make owner operator recruitment and retention difficult for us 
such conditions include inflationary cost increases that are the responsibility of owner operators  higher fuel prices and a shortage of financing 
we have historically been able to add company owned tractors and recruit additional company drivers to offset any decrease in the number of owner operators 
if a shortage of owner operators and company drivers occurs  increases in per mile settlement rates for owner operators and driver pay rates for company drivers may become necessary to attract and retain these drivers 
this could negatively affect our results of operations to the extent that we did not obtain corresponding freight rate increases 
other operating expenses for the truckload segment increased cents per mile in gains on sales of assets primarily trucks and trailers are reflected as a reduction of other operating expenses and are reported net of sales related expenses  including costs to prepare the equipment for sale 
gains on sales of assets decreased to million in from million in  or a reduction of cents per mile 
we believe fleet truck sales demand softened during due to the softer freight market and higher fuel prices 
at the same time  carrier failures and company fleet reductions increased the supply of used trucks for sale 
we expect this to continue  which will likely have a continued negative impact on the amount of our gains on sales 
we continued to sell our oldest van trailers that are fully depreciated and we expect to continue doing so in  although the market for used trailers has also softened 
our wholly owned subsidiary and used truck retail network  fleet truck sales  is one of the largest class truck sales entities in the united states 
fleet truck sales continues to be our resource for remarketing our used trucks and trailers 
other expense income we recorded million of interest expense in versus million of interest expense in our average outstanding debt per month in was over million  while in we had no outstanding debt until the end of november we had million of debt outstanding and cash and cash equivalents of million at december   for a net cash position of million 
our interest income was million in and our average cash and cash equivalents balance was higher in than in  but the average interest rate earned on these funds was lower in income taxes our effective income tax rate income taxes expressed as a percentage of income before income taxes was for versus for during fourth quarter  we reached a tentative settlement agreement with an internal revenue service irs appeals officer regarding a significant tax deduction based on a timing difference between financial reporting and tax reporting for our to federal income tax returns 
during fourth quarter  we accrued the estimated cumulative interest charges  net of income taxes  of million for the anticipated settlement of this matter 
the irs finalized the settlement during third quarter  and we paid the irs the federal accrued interest at the beginning of october we filed amended state returns reporting the irs settlement changes to the states where required during fourth quarter we are now working with those states to settle our state interest liabilities 
our total payments during  before considering the tax benefit from the deductibility of these payments  were million for federal and million to various states 
we expect to pay about million to settle the remaining state liabilities 
our policy is to recognize interest and penalties directly related to income taxes as additional income tax expense

compared to operating revenues operating revenues decreased in compared to excluding fuel surcharge revenues  trucking revenues decreased due primarily to a decrease in the average number of tractors in service as discussed further below  offset partially by a increase in average annual miles per tractor 
the truckload freight market was softer during most of compared to additionally  the significant industry wide accelerated purchase of new trucks in advance of the new epa engine emissions standards contributed to excess truck capacity that partially disrupted the supply and demand balance during these combined factors negatively affected revenues per total mile  which decreased in compared to freight demand softness and the temporary increase in the supply of trucks caused by the industry truck pre buy made for challenging freight market conditions during in mid march  we began reducing our van fleet by a total of trucks to better match the volume of freight with the capacity of trucks and to improve profitability 
this fleet has the greatest exposure to the spot freight market and faced the most operational and competitive challenges 
by the latter part of april  this initial van fleet reduction goal was achieved  but we had not yet achieved the desired balance of trucks and freight 
as a result  we decided to further reduce our van fleet by an additional trucks  which we completed by the end of june we were able to transfer a portion of our van fleet trucks to other more profitable fleets 
the net impact to our total fleet was an approximate truck reduction from mid march to the end of june beginning in the second week of november  we reduced our van fleet by an additional trucks due to further weakness in the van market 
this resulted in a cumulative truck reduction of our van fleet from mid march to december the average percentage of empty miles increased to in from in this increase resulted from the weaker freight market  a higher percentage of dedicated trucks in the total fleet and more regional shipments with shorter lengths of haul 
if we excluded the dedicated fleet  the average empty mile percentage would be in and in fuel surcharge revenues increased to million in from million in in response to higher average fuel prices in vas revenues decreased to million in from million in due to a structural change to a customer s continuing third party carrier arrangement  offset partially by an increase in brokerage and international revenues 
vas gross margin dollars increased for the same period due to an improvement in the gross margin percentage in the brokerage and intermodal divisions 
the structural change resulted in a reduction in vas revenues and vas rent and purchased transportation expense of million comparing the second half of to the second half of this change had no impact on the dollar amount of vas gross margin or operating income

owner operator miles as a percentage of total miles were in compared to in this increase in owner operator miles as a percentage of total miles shifted costs to the rent and purchased transportation category from other expense categories 
we estimate that rent and purchased transportation expense for the truckload segment was higher by approximately cents per total mile due to this increase  and other expense categories had offsetting decreases on a total mile basis as follows i salaries  wages and benefits  cents  ii fuel  cents  iii taxes and licenses  cent  and iv depreciation  cent 
salaries  wages and benefits for non drivers increased in compared to due to a larger number of employees required to support the growth in the non trucking vas segment 
non driver salaries for the truckload segment were flat in compared to the increase in salaries  wages and benefits per mile of cents for the truckload segment is primarily attributed to i an increase in student driver pay as the average number of student trainer teams was higher in than in  ii an increase in the dedicated fleet truck percentage as dedicated drivers typically earn a higher rate per mile than drivers in our other truck fleets  and iii higher group health insurance costs 
these cost increases for the truckload segment were partially offset by a decrease in workers compensation expense  lower state unemployment tax expense and a decrease in equipment maintenance personnel 
the driver recruiting and retention market was less difficult in than in the due to improved driver availability 
the weakness in the housing market and the van fleet reduction contributed favorably to our driver recruiting and retention efforts 
fuel increased cents per mile for the truckload segment due primarily to higher average diesel fuel prices 
average fuel prices in were cents per gallon  or  higher than in higher net fuel costs had a nine cent negative impact on earnings per share in compared to we include all of the following items when calculating fuel s impact on earnings for both periods i average fuel price per gallon  ii fuel reimbursements paid to owner operator drivers  iii mpg and iv offsetting fuel surcharge revenues from customers 
during third quarter  truckload carriers transitioned a gradually increasing portion of their diesel fuel consumption from low sulfur diesel fuel to ultra low sulfur diesel ulsd fuel 
this transition occurred because fuel refiners were required to meet the epa mandated ulsd threshold by october  preliminary estimates indicated that ulsd would result in a degradation in mpg for all trucks due to the lower energy content btu of ulsd 
since the transition occurred  the result is an approximate degradation of mpg 
we believe that other factors which impact mpg  including increasing the percentage of aerodynamic trucks in our company truck fleet  have offset the negative mpg impact of ulsd 
supplies and maintenance for the truckload segment increased cents per total mile in compared to higher over the road tractor repairs and maintenance were the primary cause of this increase because the increased percentage of dedicated fleet trucks requires more repairs to be performed off site rather than at our terminals 
in addition  the average age of our company owned truck fleet increased to years at december  compared to years at december  a portion of this increase was offset by lower non driver salaries  wages and benefits from a decrease in maintenance personnel  as previously noted 
our trailer repair costs were slightly lower in than in because the purchase of new van trailers to replace our oldest van trailers lowered the average age of our trailer fleet 
insurance and claims for the truckload segment did not change significantly from to  increasing just cents on a per mile basis 
we renewed our liability insurance policies on august  and became responsible for an annual million aggregate for claims between million and million 
during the policy year that ended july   we were responsible for a lower million aggregate for claims between million and million and no aggregate meaning that we were fully insured for claims between million and million 
see item legal proceedings for information on our bodily injury and property damage coverage levels since august  our liability insurance premiums for the policy year beginning august  are slightly lower than the previous policy year 
rent and purchased transportation expense consists mainly of payments to third party capacity providers in the vas segment and other non trucking operations and payments to owner operators in the truckload segment 
as discussed on page  the vas segment s rent and purchased transportation expense decreased in response to a structural change to a large vas customer s continuing arrangement regarding third party carriers 
that change resulted in a reduction in vas revenues and vas rent and purchased transportation expense of million comparing the second half of to the second half of excluding the rent and purchased transportation expense for this customer  the dollar amount of this expense increased for the vas segment  similar to vas revenues 
these expenses generally vary depending on changes in the volume of services generated by the segment 
as a percentage of vas revenues  vas rent and purchased transportation expense decreased to in compared to in rent and purchased transportation for the truckload segment increased cent per total mile in due primarily to the increase in the percentage of owner operator truck miles versus company truck miles 
increased fuel prices also necessitated higher reimbursements to owner operators for fuel million in compared to million in 
these reimbursements resulted in an increase of cents per total mile 
other operating expenses for the truckload segment decreased cents per mile in gains on sales of assets decreased to million in from million in we continued to sell our oldest van trailers that are fully depreciated and replaced them with new trailers 
other operating expenses also include bad debt expense 
in  we recorded an additional million related to the bankruptcy of one of our former customers 
other expense income we recorded million of interest expense in versus million of interest expense in because our average debt levels were higher in we had no debt outstanding at december  our interest income decreased to million in from million in income taxes our effective income tax rate was for versus for during fourth quarter  we reached a tentative settlement agreement with an irs appeals officer regarding a significant timing difference deduction between financial reporting and tax reporting for our to federal income tax returns 
we accrued the estimated cumulative interest charges  net of income taxes  of million for the anticipated settlement of this matter 
our policy is to recognize interest and penalties directly related to income taxes as additional income tax expense

liquidity and capital resources during the year ended december   we generated cash flow from operations of million  a increase million  in cash flow compared to the year ended december  this increase is attributed primarily to i a million change in cash flows related to accounts payable  primarily due to the timing of revenue equipment payments  ii a lower accounts receivable balance due primarily to a decrease in the average fuel surcharge billed per trip at the end of and iii the effect of million lower gains on disposal of operating equipment  offset by iv lower net income of million 
cash flow from operations decreased million in compared to  or 
the decrease in cash flow from operations in compared to was due primarily to a million change in accounts payable for revenue equipment and lower net income of million 
we were able to make net capital expenditures  repurchase common stock and pay dividends because of the cash flow from operations and existing cash balances  supplemented by net borrowings under our existing credit facilities 
net cash used in investing activities increased by million to million in from million in net property additions primarily revenue equipment were million for the year ended december  compared to million during the same period of the increase occurred because we began to take delivery of new trucks in  while we took delivery of substantially fewer new trucks during to delay purchases of more expensive trucks with engines 
the million decrease in investing cash flows from to was due primarily to the purchase of more tractors in as we began to reduce the average age of our truck fleet prior to the engine change 
the average age of our truck fleet is years at december  compared to years at december  and years at december  as of december   we were committed to property and equipment purchases of approximately million 
we expect our estimated net capital expenditures primarily revenue equipment to be in the range of million to million in we intend to fund these net capital expenditures through cash flow from operations and financing available under our existing credit facilities  as management deems necessary 
net financing activities used million in  million in and million in the decrease from to included debt repayments net of borrowings of million in compared to net borrowings of million in we had net borrowings of million in during first quarter  we repaid the total million of debt that was outstanding on december  we paid dividends of million in  million in and million in the dividends included a special dividend of per share million total paid in december we increased our regular quarterly dividend rate by per share beginning with the dividend paid in july and the dividend paid in july financing activities also included common stock repurchases of million in  million in and million in from time to time  the company has repurchased  and may continue to repurchase  shares of the company s common stock 
the timing and amount of such purchases depends on market and other factors 
as of december   the company had purchased  shares pursuant to our current board of directors repurchase authorization and had  shares remaining available for repurchase 
management believes our financial position at december  is strong 
as of december   we had million of cash and cash equivalents and million of stockholders equity 
cash is invested in government portfolio money market funds 
we do not hold any investments in auction rate securities 
as of december   we had a total of million of credit pursuant to two credit facilities  of which we had borrowed million 
the remaining million of credit available under these facilities is further reduced by the million in letters of credit we maintain 
these letters of credit are primarily required as security for insurance policies 
as of december   we did not have any non cancelable revenue equipment operating leases and therefore had no off balance sheet revenue equipment debt 
based on our strong financial position  management does not foresee any significant barriers to obtaining sufficient financing  if necessary 
contractual obligations and commercial commitments the following table sets forth our contractual obligations and commercial commitments as of december  caption payments due by period in millions more less than than period total year years years years unknown

we have committed credit facilities with two banks totaling million  of which we have borrowed million at december  during first quarter  we repaid the total million of debt that was outstanding on december  these credit facilities bear variable interest at december  based on the london interbank offered rate libor 
the credit available under these facilities is further reduced by the amount of standby letters of credit under which we are obligated 
the unused lines of credit are available to us in the event we need financing for the replacement of our fleet or for other significant capital expenditures 
given our strong financial position  we expect that we could obtain additional financing  if necessary 
the standby letters of credit are primarily required for insurance policies 
the equipment purchase commitments relate to committed equipment expenditures 
on january   we adopted financial accounting standards board fasb interpretation no

fin 
as of december   we have recorded million of unrecognized tax benefits 
we expect million to be settled within the next twelve months and are unable to reasonably determine when the million categorized as period unknown will be settled 
off balance sheet arrangements in  we did not have any non cancelable revenue equipment operating leases or other arrangements that meet the definition of an off balance sheet arrangement 
critical accounting policies we operate in the truckload sector of the trucking industry and the logistics sector of the transportation industry 
in the truckload sector  we focus on transporting consumer nondurable products that generally ship consistently throughout the year 
in the logistics sector  besides managing transportation requirements for individual customers  we provide additional sources of truck capacity  alternative modes of transportation  a global delivery network and systems analysis to optimize transportation needs 
our success depends on our ability to efficiently manage our resources in the delivery of truckload transportation and logistics services to our customers 
resource requirements vary with customer demand and may be subject to seasonal or general economic conditions 
our ability to adapt to changes in customer transportation requirements is essential to efficient resource deployment  making capital investments in tractors and trailers or obtaining qualified third party carrier capacity at a reasonable price 
although our business volume is not highly concentrated  we may also be occasionally affected by our customers financial failures or loss of customer business 
our most significant resource requirements are company drivers  owner operators  tractors  trailers and related equipment operating costs such as fuel and related fuel taxes  driver pay  insurance and supplies and maintenance 
to mitigate our risk to fuel price increases  we recover additional fuel surcharges from our customers that recoup a majority  but not all  of the increased fuel costs  however  we cannot assure that current recovery levels will continue in future periods 
our financial results are also affected by company driver and owner operator availability and the new and used revenue equipment market 
because we are self insured for a significant portion of bodily injury  property damage and cargo claims and for workers compensation benefits and health claims for our employees supplemented by premium based insurance coverage above certain dollar levels  financial results may also be affected by driver safety  medical costs  weather  legal and regulatory environments and insurance coverage costs to protect against catastrophic losses 
the most significant accounting policies and estimates that affect our financial statements include the following selections of estimated useful lives and salvage values for purposes of depreciating tractors and trailers 
depreciable lives of tractors and trailers range from to years 
estimates of salvage value at the expected date of trade in or sale for example  three years for tractors are based on the expected market values of equipment at the time of disposal 
although our normal replacement cycle for tractors is three years  we calculate depreciation expense for financial reporting purposes using a five year life and salvage value 
depreciation expense calculated in this manner continues at the same straight line rate which approximates the continuing declining market value of the tractors when a tractor is held beyond the normal three year age 
calculating depreciation expense using a five year life and salvage value results in the same annual depreciation rate of cost per year and the same net book value at the normal three year replacement date of cost as using a three year life and salvage value 
we continually monitor the adequacy of the lives and salvage values used in calculating depreciation expense and adjust these assumptions appropriately when warranted 
impairment of long lived assets 
we review our long lived assets for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate the carrying amount of a long lived asset may not be recoverable 
an impairment loss would be recognized if the carrying amount of the long lived asset is not recoverable and the carrying amount exceeds its fair value 
for long lived assets classified as held and used  the carrying amount is not recoverable when the carrying value of the long lived asset exceeds the sum of the future net cash flows 
we do not separately identify assets by operating segment because tractors and trailers are routinely transferred from one operating fleet to another 
as a result  none of our long lived assets have identifiable cash flows from use that are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities 
thus  the asset group used to assess impairment would include all of our assets 
estimates of accrued liabilities for insurance and claims for liability and physical damage losses and workers compensation 
the insurance and claims accruals current and noncurrent are recorded at the estimated ultimate payment amounts and are based upon individual case estimates including negative development and estimates of incurred but not reported losses using loss development factors based upon past experience 
an actuary reviews our self insurance reserves for bodily injury and property damage claims and workers compensation claims every six months 
policies for revenue recognition 
operating revenues including fuel surcharge revenues and related direct costs are recorded when the shipment is delivered 
for shipments where a third party capacity provider including owner operators under contract with us is utilized to provide some or all of the service and we i are the primary obligor in regard to the shipment delivery  ii establish customer pricing separately from carrier rate negotiations  iii generally have discretion in carrier selection and or iv have credit risk on the shipment  we record both revenues for the dollar value of services we bill to the customer and rent and purchased transportation expense for transportation costs we pay to the third party provider upon the shipment s delivery 
in the absence of the conditions listed above  we record revenues net of those expenses related to third party providers 
accounting for income taxes 
significant management judgment is required to determine i the provision for income taxes  ii whether deferred income taxes will be realized in full or in part and iii the liability for unrecognized tax benefits in accordance with the provisions of fin deferred income tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates that are expected to apply to taxable income in the years when those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
when it is more likely that all or some portion of specific deferred income tax assets will not be realized  a valuation allowance must be established for the amount of deferred income tax assets that are determined not to be realizable 
a valuation allowance for deferred income tax assets has not been deemed necessary due to our profitable operations 
accordingly  if facts or financial circumstances change and consequently impact the likelihood of realizing the deferred income tax assets  we would need to apply management s judgment to determine the amount of valuation allowance required in any given period 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
the allowance for doubtful accounts is our estimate of the amount of probable credit losses in our existing accounts receivable 
we review the financial condition of customers for granting credit and monitor changes in customers financial conditions on an ongoing basis 
we determine the allowance based on our historical write off experience and national economic conditions 
during  numerous significant events affected the us financial markets and resulted in a significant reduction of credit availability and liquidity 
consequently  we believe some of our customers may be unable to obtain or retain adequate financing to support their businesses in the future 
we anticipate that because of these combined factors  some of our customers may also be compelled to restructure their businesses or may be unable to pay amounts owed to us 
we have formal policies in place to continually monitor credit extended to customers and to manage our credit risk 
we maintain credit insurance for some customer accounts 
we evaluate the adequacy of our allowance for doubtful accounts quarterly and believe our allowance for doubtful accounts is adequate based on information currently available 
management periodically re evaluates these estimates as events and circumstances change 
together with the effects of the matters discussed above  these factors may significantly impact our results of operations from period to period 
inflation inflation may impact our operating costs 
a prolonged inflation period could cause rises in interest rates  fuel  wages and other costs 
these inflationary increases could adversely affect our results of operations unless freight rates could be increased correspondingly 
however  the effect of inflation has been minimal over the past three years 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates  commodity prices and foreign currency exchange rates 
interest rate risk we had million of variable rate debt outstanding at december  interest rates on the variable rate debt and our unused credit facilities are based on the libor 
increases in interest rates could impact our annual interest expense on future borrowings 
assuming this level of borrowings  a hypothetical one percentage point increase in the libor interest rate would increase our annual interest expense by  as of december   we do not have any derivative financial instruments to reduce our exposure to interest rate increases 
commodity price risk the price and availability of diesel fuel are subject to fluctuations attributed to changes in the level of global oil production  refining capacity  seasonality  weather and other market factors 
historically  we have recovered a majority  but not all  of fuel price increases from customers in the form of fuel surcharges 
we implemented customer fuel surcharge programs with most of our customers to offset much of the higher fuel cost per gallon 
however  we do not recover all of the fuel cost increase through these surcharge programs 
we cannot predict the extent to which fuel prices will increase or decrease in the future or the extent to which fuel surcharges could be collected 
as of december   we had no derivative financial instruments to reduce our exposure to fuel price fluctuations 
foreign currency exchange rate risk we conduct business in several foreign countries  including mexico  canada and china 
foreign currency transaction losses were million for and were recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss within stockholders equity in the consolidated balance sheets 
amounts of gains and losses for and were not material 
to date  most foreign revenues are denominated in us dollars  and we receive payment for foreign freight services primarily in us dollars to reduce direct foreign currency risk 
assets and liabilities maintained by subsidiary companies in the local currency are subject to foreign exchange gains or losses 
the foreign currency transaction losses for were primarily related to changes in the value of revenue equipment owned by a subsidiary in mexico  whose functional currency is the peso 
the exchange rate between the mexico peso and the us dollar was pesos to at december  compared to pesos to at december
