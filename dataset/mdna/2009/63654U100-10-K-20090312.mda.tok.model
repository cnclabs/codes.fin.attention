item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations please refer to forward looking statements following the index in front of this form k 
the following discussion and analysis of our historical consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with our audited consolidated financial statements and the related notes included elsewhere in this form k 
overview we are a holding company with operations being conducted by our subsidiaries 
our specialty property and casualty insurance companies are licensed in all states  the district of columbia and the cayman islands 
we generate underwriting profits by providing what we view as specialized insurance products  services and programs not generally available in the marketplace 
while many companies write property and casualty insurance for transportation companies  we believe that few write passenger transportation coverage nationwide and very few write coverage for several of the classes of passenger transportation insurance written by us and our subsidiaries 
we focus on niche insurance markets where we offer insurance products designed to meet the unique needs of targeted insurance buyers that we believe are underserved by the insurance industry 
these niche markets typically possess what we view as barriers to entry  such as being too small  too remote or too difficult to attract or sustain most competitors 
examples of products that we write for these markets include captive programs for transportation companies that we refer to as our alternative risk transfer operations of gross premiums written  property and casualty insurance for transportation companies  specialty personal lines  primarily recreational vehicle and commercial vehicle coverage and transportation and general commercial insurance in hawaii and alaska 
we strive to become a market leader in the specialty markets that we choose and serve by offering what we believe are specialized products  excellent customer service and superior claims response 
we write insurance for various sizes of transportation fleets 
because of the amount of smaller fleets nationwide  we have more opportunities to write smaller risks than larger ones 
when general economic conditions improve  entrepreneurs are encouraged to start new transportation companies  which typically commence operations as a smaller risk and a potential traditional insurance customer for us 
during periods of economic downturn  smaller risks are more prone to failure due to a decrease in leisure travel and consolidation in the industry 
an increase in the number of larger risks results in more prospective captive insurance customers 
we do not believe that smaller fleets that generate annual premiums of less than  are large enough to retain the risks associated with participation in one of the captive programs we currently offer 
by offering insurance products to all sizes of risks  we believe we have hedged against the possibility that there will be a reduction in demand for the products we offer 
we believe that we will continue to have opportunities to grow and profit with both traditional and alternative risk transfer customers based on our assumptions regarding future economic and competitive conditions 
we generally incur low start up costs for new businesses  typically less than  incurred over several quarters 
we believe our flexible processes and scalable systems  along with controlled increase of businesses  allow us to manage costs and match them with the revenue flow 
the factors that impact our growth rate are consistent across all products 
however  the trends impacting each of these factors may vary from time to time for individual products 
those factors are as follows submissions the increase or decrease in the number of new applications we receive 
this is influenced by the effectiveness of our marketing activities compared to the marketing activities of our competitors in each market 
the change in the number of current policyholders that are available for a renewal quote 
the number of policyholders available for renewal changes based upon the economic conditions impacting our customer groups and the extent of consolidation that may be taking place within the industries we support 

table of contents quotes the change in the percentage of the new applications received that do not receive a quote from us 
we do not quote risks that do not meet our risk selection criteria or for which we have not been provided complete application data 
we refer to this ratio as the declination ratio and an increasing declination ratio usually results in reduced opportunities to write new business 
sales the change in percentage of the quotes we issue that are actually sold 
we refer to this ratio as the hit ratio 
hit ratios are affected by the number of competitors  the prices quoted by these competitors and the degree of difference between the competitors pricing  terms and conditions and ours 
rates the change in our rate structure from period to period 
the rates we file and quote are impacted by several factors including the cost and extent of the reinsurance we purchase  our operating efficiencies  our average loss costs  which reflect the effectiveness of our underwriting  our underwriting profit expectations  and our claims adjusting processes 
the difference between our rates and the rates of our competitors is the primary factor impacting the revenue growth of our established product lines 
product offerings and distribution we operate in multiple markets with multiple distribution approaches to attempt to reduce the probability that an adverse competitive response in any single market will have a significant impact on our overall business 
we also attempt to maintain several new products  product line extensions or product distribution approaches in active development status so we are able to take advantage of market opportunities 
we select from potential new product ideas based on our stated new business criteria and the anticipated competitive response 
industry and trends the p c insurance industry is cyclical  with periods of rising premium rates and shortages of underwriting capacity hard market followed by periods of substantial price competition and excess capacity soft market 
the p c insurance industry experienced a continued soft market in  resulting in an anticipated industry wide decrease in premiums written which will constitute the first back to back decrease in premiums since according to am best  the decline in premiums in  as well as the sizable and frequent weather related losses are expected to lead to an underwriting loss for the industry in am best s estimated industry combined ratio of is based upon the overall industry statutory combined ratio for the first nine months of the industry faces several unfavorable trends in the coming year such as  but not limited to  a heightened level of investment risk  price stabilization  claims inflation risk and expense control 
despite relatively flat pricing since  improved risk selection and an overall improvement in the risk quality of our book of business have contributed to us attaining combined ratios better than our corporate objective of or lower 
since our inception in we have placed a consistent emphasis on underwriting profit while continuing to grow gross premiums written 
our compound annual growth rate for gross premiums written for the years is while our average combined ratio for the same five year period is 
although our gross and net written premium growth percentages and combined ratio of  and  respectively  were negatively impacted by the soft pricing conditions and an elevated number of large claims experience during the first three quarters  they still exceed the p c insurance industry expected results noted above 
we believe the following factors contribute to our performance which is consistently above industry standards our business model and bottom line orientation have resulted in disciplined and consistent risk assessment and pricing adequacy 

table of contents our ability to attract and retain some of the best transportation companies in the industries we serve and insure them directly or through our captive programs 
our stable operating expenses at or below the revenue growth rate 
during  like most of the p c insurance industry  our results were negatively impacted by net realized losses from investments  including write downs required by the other than temporary impairment accounting guidelines  related to the turmoil in the investment markets 
we have historically maintained a conservative investment portfolio  focusing primarily on high quality fixed income and preferred stock investments 
our purchases have been concentrated in us government and government agencies  state and local government obligations muni bonds and agency backed collateralized mortgage obligations 
although we cannot provide any assurances  at december   with over of our investment portfolio comprised of investment grade fixed income  investment grade preferred stock and cash  we believe we remain properly positioned as we head into as noted above  the p c insurance industry experienced frequent weather related losses in for weather related events such as hurricanes  tornados and hailstorms  we conduct an analysis at least annually pursuant to which we input our in force exposures vehicle values in all states and property limits in hawaii into an independent catastrophe model that predicts our probable maximum loss at various statistical confidence levels 
our estimated probable maximum loss is impacted by changes in our in force exposures as well as changes to the assumptions inherent in the catastrophe model 
hurricane and other weather related events have not had a material negative impact on our past results 
our transportation insurance business in particular is also affected by cost trends that negatively impact profitability such as inflation in vehicle repair costs  vehicle replacement parts costs  used vehicle prices  fuel costs and medical care costs 
we routinely obtain independent data for vehicle repair inflation  vehicle replacement parts costs  used vehicle prices  fuel costs and medical care costs and adjust our pricing routines to attempt to more accurately project the future costs associated with insurance claims 
historically  these increased costs have not had a material adverse impact on our results 
of course  we would expect a negative impact on our future results if we fail to properly account for and project for these inflationary trends 
increased litigation of claims may also negatively impact our profitability 
as described below  the average revenue dollar per personal lines policy is significantly lower than typical commercial policies 
profitability in the specialty personal lines component is dependent on proper pricing and the efficiency of underwriting and policy administration 
we have continued to monitor rate levels and have adjusted them throughout  as warranted 
we continuously strive to improve our underwriting and policy issuance functions to keep this cost element as low as possible by utilizing current technology advances 
to succeed as a transportation underwriter and personal lines underwriter  we must understand and be able to quantify the different risk characteristics of the risks we consider quoting 
certain coverages are more stable and predictable than others and we must recognize the various components of the risks we assume when we write any specific class of insurance business 
examples of trends that can change and  therefore  impact our profitability are loss frequency  loss severity  geographic loss cost differentials  societal and legal factors impacting loss costs such as tort reform  punitive damage inflation and increasing jury awards and changes in regulation impacting the insurance relationship 
any changes in these factors that are not recognized and priced for accordingly will affect our future profitability 
we believe our product management organization provides the focus on a specific risk class needed to stay current with the trends affecting each specific class of business we write 
revenues we derive our revenues primarily from premiums from our insurance policies and income from our investment portfolio 
our underwriting approach is to price our products to achieve an underwriting profit even if it requires us to forego volume 
as with all p c companies  the impact of price changes is reflected in our financial results over time 
price changes on our in force policies occur as they are renewed  which generally takes twelve months for our entire book of business and up to an additional twelve months to earn a full year of premium at the renewal rate 
insurance rates charged on renewing policies have decreased slightly in compared to 
table of contents there are distinct differences in the timing of premiums written in traditional transportation insurance compared to the majority of our alternative risk transfer captive insurance component 
we write traditional transportation insurance policies throughout all months of the year and commence new annual policies at the expiration of the old policy 
under most captive programs  all members of the group share a common renewal date 
these common renewal dates are scheduled throughout the calendar year 
any new captive program participant that joins after the common date will be written for other than a full annual term so its next renewal date coincides with the common expiration date of the captive program it has joined 
historically  most of our group captives had common renewal dates in the first six months of the year  but with the growth from new captive programs  we are now experiencing renewal dates throughout the calendar year 
the alternative risk transfer component of our business grew to of total gross premiums written during as compared to in the projected profitability from the traditional transportation and transportation captive businesses are substantially comparable 
increased investment income opportunities generally are available with traditional insurance but the lower acquisition expenses and persistence of the captive programs generally provide for lower operating expenses from these programs 
the lower expenses associated with our captives generally offset the projected reductions in investment income potential 
from a projected profitability perspective  we are ambivalent as to whether a transportation operator elects to purchase traditional insurance or one of our captive program options 
all of our transportation products  traditional or alternative risk transfer  are priced to achieve targeted underwriting margins 
because traditional insurance tends to have a higher operating expense structure  the portion of the premiums available to pay losses tends to be lower for a traditional insurance quote versus an alternative risk transfer insurance quote 
we use a cost plus pricing approach that projects future losses based upon the insured s historic losses and other factors 
operating expenses  premium taxes and a profit margin are then added to the projected loss component to achieve the total premium to be quoted 
the lower the projected losses  expenses and taxes  the lower the total quoted premiums regardless of whether it is a traditional or alternative risk transfer program quotation 
quoted premiums are computed in accordance with our approved insurance department filings in each state 
our specialty personal lines products are also priced to achieve targeted underwriting margins 
the average premium per policy for this business component is significantly less than transportation lines 
we approach investment and capital management with the intention of supporting insurance operations by providing a stable source of income to offset underwriting risk and growing income to offset inflation 
the priority of goals of our investment policy are to preserve principal while optimizing income 
we follow a formal investment policy and the board reviews the portfolio performance quarterly for compliance with the established guidelines 
like other insurance companies in  our investment portfolio was negatively impacted by the turmoil in the investments market resulting in a million pre tax net realized loss on investments 
however  at december  over of our investment portfolio is in investment grade fixed income and preferred stock investments and cash 
given the economic conditions still existing today  we cannot predict if and when future losses may occur 
expenses losses and lae are a function of the amount and type of insurance contracts we write and of the loss experience of the underlying risks 
we record losses and lae based on an actuarial analysis of the estimated losses we expect to be reported on contracts written 
we seek to establish case reserves at the maximum probable exposure based on our historical claims experience 
our ability to estimate losses and lae accurately at the time of pricing our contracts is a critical factor in determining our profitability 
the amount reported under losses and lae in any period includes payments in the period net of the change in the value of the reserves for unpaid losses and lae between the beginning and the end of the period 
commissions and other underwriting expenses consist principally of brokerage and agent commissions and to a lesser extent premium taxes 
the brokerage and agent commissions are reduced by ceding commissions received from assuming reinsurers that represent a percentage of the premiums on insurance policies and reinsurance contracts written and vary depending upon the amount and types of contracts written 

table of contents other operating and general expenses consist primarily of personnel expenses including salaries  benefits and certain costs associated with awards under our equity compensation plans  such as stock compensation expense and other general operating expenses 
our personnel expenses are primarily fixed in nature and do not vary with the amount of premiums written 
interest expenses associated with outstanding debt and expense on amounts withheld are disclosed separately from operating and general expenses 
we invest funds in the participant loss layer for several of our alternative risk programs 
we receive investment income and incur an equal expense on the amounts owed to alternative risk transfer participants 
expense on amounts withheld represents investment income that we remit back to alternative risk transfer participants 
the related investment income is included in the net investment income line on our consolidated statements of income 
results of operations overview our december  and net earnings from operations  net realized losses from investments and net income are as follows year ended december  amount per share amount per share dollars in thousands  except per share data net income from operations net realized losses from investments net income our net earnings from operations for were million per share diluted compared to million per share diluted in although we had strong revenue growth during  the decrease in net earnings from operations of million from was primarily attributable to an increase in large loss severity  primarily due to our charter passenger transportation business  experienced during the first three quarters of that were not experienced in during the third quarter of  we began the process of reviewing most of our large fleet charter transportation book and our entire in force small fleet book of charter transportation business to ensure that our high underwriting standards are in place and identified specific accounts that require action 
we have also implemented other initiatives centered on risk selection and pricing adequacy relative to the entire charter transportation product 
these large losses experienced earlier in were not experienced during the fourth quarter of which improved the full year combined ratio to 
in addition to an increase in loss severity  we have also experienced a higher net commission expense compared to due to a change in the mix of business we write 
our net earnings were adversely impacted by the turbulent market environment as our net realized losses from investments were million per share diluted in compared to million per share diluted in included in the realized losses are impairment adjustments of million compared to impairment adjustments of million in despite recording these realized losses in accordance with other than temporary impairment accounting guidelines  we believe that an economic loss is still not certain and intend to maximize future potential recoveries related to these investments 
the two largest components of these impairment charges were write downs of exchange trade funds and write offs related to fannie mae  freddie mac and lehman brothers recorded in the third quarter of 
table of contents gross premiums written we operate our business as one segment  property and casualty insurance 
we manage this segment through a product management structure 
the following table sets forth an analysis of gross premiums written by business component during the periods indicated year ended december  amount percent amount percent amount percent dollars in thousands alternative risk transfer transportation specialty personal lines hawaii and alaska other gross premiums written the group captive programs  which focus on specialty or niche insurance businesses  provide various services and coverages tailored to meet specific requirements of defined client groups and their members 
these services include risk management consulting  claims administration and handling  loss control and prevention and reinsurance placement  along with providing various types of property and casualty insurance coverage 
insurance coverage is provided primarily to associations or similar groups of members and to specified classes of business of our agent partners 
gross premiums written includes both direct premium and assumed premium 
during  as a percent of total gross premiums written  the alternative risk transfer component of the business had the largest increase of million or compared to the growth in the alternative risk transfer component is primarily attributable to the addition in of three new captive programs  which contributed to million  or of the increase 
additional increases in this component are related to expanded lines of coverage in one of our existing captive programs and the addition of new members to existing captive programs 
as part of our captive programs  we have analyzed  on a quarterly basis  captive members loss performance on a policy year basis to determine if there would be a premium assessment to participants or if there would be a return of premium to participants as a result of less than expected losses 
assessment premium and return of premium are recorded as adjustments to written premium assessments increase written premium  returns of premium reduce written premium 
the return of premium for of million compared to million in exclusive of the million and million return of premiums  the alternative risk transfer component would have increased in over in addition to the alternative risk transfer component  the specialty personal lines component increased million in compared to  primarily due to additional policies in force in our commercial vehicle product from expanded marketing initiatives and product enhancements 
due to increased competition in a soft market  both our transportation million and hawaii and alaska million components decreased in as compared to our underwriting approach is to price our products to achieve an underwriting profit even if we forgo volume as a result 
our retention rates for traditional transportation are comparable between and  however  we are continuing to experience a trend of competitive pricing on larger traditional accounts impacting premium to a greater degree than in prior periods 
in  we maintained relatively flat rate levels on renewing commercial insurance business and  as a result  our renewal hit ratios have continued to deteriorate to historic levels from the elevated levels we had in and our other component is primarily related to assigned risk policies that we receive from involuntary state insurance plans and over which we have no control 
this component decreased million from 
table of contents premiums earned compared to the following table shows premiums earned for the years ended december  and summarized by the broader business component description  which were determined based primarily on similar economic characteristics  products and services year ended december  change amount percent dollars in thousands premiums earned alternative risk transfer transportation specialty personal lines hawaii and alaska other total premiums earned our premiums earned increased million  or  to million during the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  our alternative risk transfer component increased during compared to the same period in  primarily due to expanded insurance offerings in one of our larger captives  new participants in existing captive programs and the addition of new truck captive programs in our alternative risk transfer business remains our fastest growing component 
our specialty personal lines component increased in compared to  due to growth in our commercial vehicle product 
the transportation component remained relatively constant in compared to  as we are still experiencing a slight decline in renewal rate increases due to the current soft market 
our other component  which is comprised primarily of premium from assigned risk plans from the states in which our insurance company subsidiaries operate and over which we have no control  decreased million  or  to million in compared to the following table shows premiums earned for the years ended december  and summarized by the broader business component description  which were determined based primarily on similar economic characteristics  products and services year ended december  change amount percent dollars in thousands premiums earned alternative risk transfer transportation specialty personal lines hawaii and alaska other total premiums earned our premiums earned increased million  or  to million during the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  our alternative risk transfer component increased during compared to the same period in  primarily due to a large transportation captive written in the first quarter of  expanded coverage in two of our captive programs and new participants in existing captive programs 
due to relatively flat rate increases and an increase in the number of policies in force primarily from expanded distribution  our specialty personal lines component increased in compared to the transportation component remained relatively constant in compared to in the transportation component  we experienced a decline in renewal rate increases due to the softening market 
our other component  which is comprised primarily of premium from assigned risk plans from the states in which our insurance company subsidiaries operate and over which we have no control  increased million  or  to million in 
table of contents underwriting and loss ratio analysis underwriting profitability  as opposed to overall profitability or net earnings  is measured by the combined ratio 
the combined ratio is the sum of the loss and lae ratio and the underwriting expense ratio 
a combined ratio under is indicative of an underwriting profit 
our underwriting approach is to price our products to achieve an underwriting profit even if we forego volume as a result 
from through  our insurance subsidiaries increased their premium rates to offset rising losses and reinsurance costs 
in both and  we experienced a slight decline in rate levels on renewal business due to the continued softening market 
the table below presents our premiums earned and combined ratios for the periods indicated year ended december  dollars in thousands gross premiums written ceded reinsurance net premiums written change in unearned premiums  net of ceded net premiums earned combined ratios loss and lae ratio underwriting expense ratio combined ratio the ratio of losses and lae to premiums earned 
the ratio of the sum of commissions and other underwriting expenses  other operating expenses less other income to premiums earned 
compared to losses and lae increased million  or  for compared to the loss and lae ratio for the year ended december  was compared to for the year ended december  the increase in the loss and lae ratio in of percentage points is primarily due to an increase in large loss severity in our small fleet charter operations that we experienced during the first three quarters of these large losses contributed approximately percentage points to our loss and lae ratio 
during the third quarter of  we began the process of reviewing most of our large fleet charter transportation book and our entire in force small fleet book of charter transportation business to ensure that our high underwriting standards are in place and identified specific accounts that require action 
we have also implemented other initiatives  centered on risk selection and pricing adequacy relative to the entire charter transportation product 
for the years ended december  and  we had favorable development from prior years loss reserves of million and million  respectively 
the favorable development for both years was primarily related to the settlements below the established case reserves and revisions to our estimated future settlements on an individual case by case basis 
this savings represents only and for and  respectively  of the prior year reserves 
the increase in the loss and lae ratio from to also reflects the impact of modestly lower renewal rates that we are experiencing from the softening market 
commissions and other underwriting expenses consist principally of brokerage and agent commissions reduced by ceding commissions received from assuming reinsurers  and vary depending upon the amount and types of contracts written and  to a lesser extent  premium taxes 
the underwriting expense ratio was and for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the percentage point increase to our expense ratio is primarily due to a change in our overall mix of business  including high premium growth in products that tend to have higher commission rates 

table of contents compared to losses and lae increased million  or  for compared to the loss and lae ratio for the year ended december  was compared to for the year ended december  the decrease in the loss and lae ratio in of percentage points is primarily due to a decrease in loss severity in as there was higher than anticipated claims severity in experienced in many of our larger products 
for the year ended december   we had favorable development of million from prior years loss reserves compared to favorable development in of million 
this savings represents and for and  respectively  of the prior year reserves 
the underwriting expense ratio was for both years ended december  and investment income compared to net investment income remained relatively constant at million for compared to million in  reflecting portfolio growth that was offset by lower yields 
yields declined throughout for most investment categories in which we are active 
compared to net investment income increased million  or  to million in compared to the net investment income improvement reflects higher average invested assets due to continued strong cash flows from operations as well as the higher yield of the portfolio 
during higher yields on our short term portfolio compared to favorably impacted our net investment income 
also favorably impacting our yields  during we diversified our portfolio into agency guaranteed collateralized mortgage obligations which did not expose us to the subprime lending sector 
realized gains losses on investments compared to in we had pre tax net realized losses of million compared to million for continuing turmoil in the investment markets has caused market declines in our investment portfolio  particularly in the financial and real estate related holdings 
this has had an adverse impact on our investment portfolio in  as we recognized other than temporary impairment charges on investments of million for the year ended december  the two largest components of the million were write offs of million related to securities issued by fannie mae  freddie mac and lehman brothers holdings inc and million related to exchange traded funds 
we recorded million of impairment adjustments during compared to we had net realized losses of million for compared to net realized gains of million for the turmoil in investment markets during the last half of resulted in market declines in the portfolio  particularly in the financial and real estate related holdings 
this had an impact on the company s investment portfolio in  as net realized gains from sales were offset by write downs of million related to several preferred stock holdings with market values that were significantly below cost in the housing and credit markets 
other income compared to other income decreased million  or  to million for compared to million in this decrease is primarily attributable to a decline in rental income directly resulting from a lease termination agreement executed with a former tenant in the third quarter of compared to other income increased million  or  to million for compared to million in this increase is primarily attributable to an increase in rental income associated with space leased in the building we acquired in as part of our corporate campus expansion and a million lease buyout that we received in the third quarter of from one of our tenants 
commissions and other underwriting expenses compared to commissions and other underwriting expenses for the year ended december  increased million  or  to million from million in the comparable period in the increases relate to an increase in net commission expense due to growth and a change in our business mix as well as a decrease in ceding commission 
our various products have different commission rates  therefore  commission 
table of contents expense can vary based on the product mix written during the period 
during  our premium growth has typically been in products that have higher commission rates 
in addition to a change in our overall mix of business  we recorded an approximate million charge for a one time state guarantee fund in the third quarter of  which was also a contributing factor to the increase in our commission and other underwriting expenses 
compared to commissions and other underwriting expenses for the year ended december  increased million  or  to million from million in the comparable period in the increases are a direct result of our written premium growth  including an increase in commission expense and premium taxes 
the higher commission expense is largely attributable to higher commission rates on our assigned risk business 
other operating and general expenses compared to other operating and general expenses increased million  or  to million during the year ended december  compared to million for the same period in these increases were primarily due to an increase in employee headcount that increased our employee wages over prior year 
compared to other operating and general expenses increased million  or  to million during the year ended december  compared to million for the same period in these increases were due to several employee related expenses  including an increase of million related to our annual bonuses paid in march  a stock bonus award and restricted stock award expense of million and an increase in employee headcount that increased our employee wages 
in addition  a portion of the increase in the other operating and general expenses is related to an increase in facilities expenses from office space that we lease to others  however  this increase is partially offset by an increase in rental income  included in other revenue during the same period 
expense on amounts withheld compared to we invest funds in the participant loss layer for several of the alternative risk transfer programs 
we receive investment income and incur an equal expense on the amounts owed to alternative risk transfer 
expense on amounts withheld represents investment income that we remit back to alternative risk transfer participants 
the related investment income is included in our net investment income line on our consolidated statements of income 
for the year ended december  the expense on amounts withheld increased million over the same period in the increase is directly attributable to the continued growth in our alternative risk transfer component 
compared to for the year ended december  the expense on amounts withheld increased million over the same period in the increase is directly attributable to the growth in our alternative risk transfer component 
income taxes compared to the effective tax rate was  increasing from a rate of in the change in the effective tax rate is primarily due to a valuation allowance of million that was taken on our realized losses  primarily impairment charges which increased the effective tax rate percentage points 
see note to our audited consolidated financial statements for further analysis of items affecting our effective tax rate 
at december   we had gross deferred tax assets of million related to investment securities 
this gross deferred tax asset has been reduced by a valuation allowance on unrealized losses on equity investments of million and a valuation allowance on realized losses on investments of million 
we had no valuation allowance in that impacted our effective tax rate 
future realization of the remaining deferred tax asset  as well as the ability to record tax benefits on future realized and unrealized capital losses  will depend on management s assessment of available tax planning strategies such as realizing any appreciation in certain investment assets 

table of contents compared to the effective tax rate of was relatively flat  increasing from a rate of in financial condition investments and securities lending collateral at december   our investment portfolio contained million in fixed maturity securities  million in equity securities and million in securities lending collateral  all carried at fair value with unrealized gains and losses reported as a separate component of shareholders equity on an after tax basis 
at december   we had pretax net unrealized losses of million on fixed maturities  million on securities lending collateral and million on equity securities 
our investment portfolio allocation is driven by our investment policy  which is weighted towards high quality fixed maturity investments 
although we are focused on maintaining a high quality portfolio  we remain exposed to future market fluctuations  especially given the current global financial crisis 
fixed maturity investments are generally invested in securities with short and intermediate term maturities 
at december   the weighted average maturity of our fixed maturity investments was approximately years 
at december   of the fixed maturities in our portfolio were rated investment grade credit rating of aaa to bbb by standard poor s corporation 
investment grade securities generally bear lower yields and lower degrees of risk than those that are unrated or non investment grade 
although we cannot provide any assurances given current turbulence in the markets  we believe that  in normal market conditions  our high quality investment portfolio should generate a stable and predictable investment return 
included in the fixed maturities were million of mortgage backed securities mbs  all backed by agency guaranteed collateral  which did not directly expose us to the subprime lending sector 
mbs are subject to higher prepayment risk due to the fact that  in periods of declining interest rates  mortgages may be prepaid more rapidly than scheduled as buyers refinance higher rate mortgages to take advantage of declining interest rates 
also included in fixed maturities were million of muni bonds with the majority supported by credit enhancement provided by bond insurers 
approximately of our muni bonds are rated a or better giving no effect to credit enhancement 
summary information for securities with unrealized gains or losses at december  is shown in the following table

table of contents when a decline in the value of a specific investment is considered to be other than temporary  a provision for impairment is charged to earnings accounted for as a realized loss and the cost basis of that investment is reduced 
the determination of whether unrealized losses are other than temporary requires judgment based on subjective as well as objective factors 
factors considered and resources used by management include those discussed in management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations other than temporary impairment 
net realized gains losses on securities sold and charges for other than temporary impairment on securities held were as follows net realized gains losses charges for on sales impairment total dollars in thousands year ended fair value measurements on january   we adopted sfas no 
 fair value measurements  which defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosures about fair value measurements 
under sfas no 
 we must determine the appropriate level in the fair value hierarchy for each fair value measurement 
the fair value hierarchy in sfas no 
prioritizes the inputs  which refer broadly to assumptions market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability  into three levels 
it gives the highest priority to quoted prices unadjusted in active markets for identical assets or liabilities and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs 
the level in the fair value hierarchy within which a fair value measurement in its entirety falls is determined based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety 
level inputs are quoted prices unadjusted in active markets for identical securities that the reporting entity has the ability to access at the measurement date 
level inputs are inputs other than quoted prices within level that are observable for the security  either directly or indirectly 
level inputs include quoted prices for similar securities in active markets  quoted prices for identical or similar securities that are not active and observable inputs other than quoted prices  such as interest rate and yield curves 
level inputs are unobservable inputs for the asset or liability

liquidity and capital resources capital ratios 
the naic s model law for rbc provides formulas to determine the amount of capital and surplus that an insurance company needs to ensure that it has an acceptable expectation of not becoming financially impaired 
at december  and  the capital and surplus of all our insurance companies substantially exceeded the rbc requirements 
sources of funds 
the liquidity requirements of our insurance subsidiaries relate primarily to the liabilities associated with their products as well as operating costs and payments of dividends and taxes to us from insurance 
table of contents subsidiaries 
historically  cash flows from premiums and investment income have provided more than sufficient funds to meet these requirements without requiring the sale of investments 
if our cash flows change dramatically from historical patterns  for example as a result of a decrease in premiums or an increase in claims paid or operating expenses  we may be required to sell securities before their maturity and possibly at a loss 
our insurance subsidiaries generally hold a significant amount of highly liquid  short term investments to meet their liquidity needs 
funds received in excess of cash requirements are generally invested in additional marketable securities 
continuing volatility in the capital markets presents challenges to us as we seek to manage our portfolio and our capital position 
see item a  risk factors for a discussion of certain matters that may affect our portfolio and capital position 
our historic pattern of using receipts from current premium writings for the payment of liabilities incurred in prior periods has enabled us to slightly extend the maturities of our investment portfolio beyond the estimated settlement date of our loss reserves 
we believe that our insurance subsidiaries maintain sufficient liquidity to pay claims and operating expenses  as well as meet commitments in the event of unforeseen events such as reserve deficiencies  inadequate premium rates or reinsurer insolvencies 
our principal sources of liquidity are our existing cash  cash equivalents and short term investments 
cash  cash equivalents and short term investments were million at december   a million increase from december  for  and  we generated consolidated cash flow from operations of million  million and million  respectively 
the increase of million in cash flow from operations in from is primarily due to an increase in our loss and lae reserves stemming from an increase in large claim severity that we experienced during the first three quarters of cash flow from operations increased million in from due to an increase in net income primarily due to a decrease in our loss and lae ratio in compared to net cash used in investing activities was million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the million decrease in cash used in investing activities in  as compared to  was primarily related to a million increase in the purchase of fixed maturity investments in  which was offset by a million increase in the proceeds from sales and maturities of investments and a decline of million in the purchase of equity securities 
the increase in both purchases and redemptions of fixed maturities during  compared to the prior period was directly influenced by current market conditions 
as interest rates continued to decline  many of our high yielding us government agency bonds were called and replaced with purchases of lower yielding agency bonds 
additionally  the decrease in the purchases of equity securities is directly related to the current turmoil in the market 
the million increase in cash used in investing activities in compared to was primarily related to a million increase in the purchase of investments in offset by a million increase in the proceeds from sales and maturities of investments 
we utilized net cash from financing activities of million  million and million  respectively  for the years ended december   and the million increase in cash used in financing activities in versus is primarily from an increase in our dividends paid on common shares to shareholders 
we increased our quarterly dividend from per common share in to per common share in this increase in the dividend resulted in a million increase in dividends paid in the increase in cash used from financing activities in from of million is also primarily attributable to a million increase in dividends paid to shareholders 
we will have continuing cash needs for administrative expenses  the payment of principal and interest on borrowings  shareholder dividends and taxes 
funds to meet these obligations will come primarily from parent company cash dividend and other payments from our insurance company subsidiaries and from our line of credit 
under the state insurance laws  dividends and capital distributions from our insurance companies are subject to restrictions relating to statutory surplus and earnings 
the maximum amount of dividends that our insurance companies could pay to us without seeking regulatory approval in is million 
our insurance subsidiaries paid no dividends in and million in dividends in  without the need for regulatory approval 
under tax allocation and cost sharing agreements among the company and its subsidiaries  taxes and expenses are allocated among the entities 
the federal income tax provision of our individual subsidiaries is computed as if the subsidiary filed a separate tax return 
the resulting provision or credit is currently payable to or receivable from us 

table of contents on december   we replaced our million credit agreement with a million five year unsecured credit agreement  which includes a sublimit of million for letters of credit 
we have the ability to increase the line of credit to million subject to the credit agreement s accordion feature 
amounts borrowed bear interest at either a rate per annum equal to the greater of the administrative agent s prime rate or in excess of the federal funds effective rate or rates ranging from to over libor based on our am best insurance group rating  or at december  commitment fees on the average daily unused portion of the credit agreement also vary with our am best insurance group rating and range from to  or at december  the credit agreement requires us to maintain specified financial covenants measured on a quarterly basis  including consolidated net worth  fixed charge coverage ratio and debt to capital ratio 
in addition  the credit agreement contains certain affirmative and negative covenants  including negative covenants that limit or restrict our ability to  among other things  incur additional indebtedness  effect mergers or consolidations  make investments  enter into asset sales  create liens  enter into transactions with affiliates and other restrictions customarily contained in such agreements 
the credit agreement will terminate on december  on may   we drew million from our credit agreement to redeem in full our outstanding junior subordinated debentures  replacing higher variable rate debt of libor plus basis points with lower variable rate debt 
as of december   the interest rate on this debt is equal to the six month libor at november  plus basis points  with interest payments due quarterly 
we believe that funds generated from operations  including dividends from insurance subsidiaries  parent company cash and funds available under our credit agreement will provide sufficient resources to meet our liquidity requirements for at least the next months 
however  if these funds are insufficient to meet fixed charges in any period  we would be required to generate cash through additional borrowings  sale of assets  sale of portfolio securities or similar transactions 
if we were required to sell portfolio securities early for liquidity purposes rather than holding them to maturity  we would recognize gains or losses on those securities earlier than anticipated 
if we were forced to borrow additional funds in order to meet liquidity needs  we would incur additional interest expense  which could have a negative impact on our earnings 
since our ability to meet our obligations in the long term beyond a month period is dependent upon factors such as market changes  insurance regulatory changes and economic conditions  no assurance can be given that the available net cash flow will be sufficient to meet our operating needs 
off balance sheet items 
we do not have any off balance sheet arrangements as such term is defined in applicable sec rules 
we do not currently have any relationships with unconsolidated entities of financial partnerships  such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities  which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes 
contractual obligations 
the following table summarizes our long term contractual obligations as of december  payment due by period within more than total year years years years dollars in thousands gross unpaid losses and lae securities lending obligations long term debt obligations operating lease obligations total dollar amounts and time periods are estimates based on historical net payment patterns applied to the gross reserve and do not represent actual contractual obligations 
actual payments and their timing could differ 
table of contents significantly from these estimates  and the estimates provided do not reflect potential recoveries under reinsurance treaties 
the timing for the return of the collateral associated with our securities lending varies  but generally within one year  therefore  the return of collateral is reflected as being due within one year 
critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect amounts reported in the financial statements 
as more information becomes known  these estimates and assumptions could change and impact amounts reported in the future 
management believes that the establishment of loss and lae reserves and the determination of other than temporary impairment on investments are two areas where by the degree of judgment required to determine amounts recorded in the financial statements make the accounting policies critical 
we discuss these two policies below 
our other significant accounting policies are described in note to our consolidated financial statements 
loss and lae significant periods of time can elapse between the occurrence of an insured loss  the reporting of that loss to us and our final payment of that loss and its related lae 
to recognize liabilities for unpaid losses  we establish reserves as balance sheet liabilities 
at december  and  we had million and million  respectively  of gross loss and lae reserves  representing management s best estimate of the ultimate loss 
management records  on a monthly and quarterly basis  its best estimate of loss reserves 
for purposes of computing the recorded reserves  management utilizes various data inputs  including analysis that is derived from a review of prior quarter results performed by actuaries employed by great american 
in addition  on an annual basis  actuaries from great american review the recorded reserves for niic  niic hi and tcc utilizing current period data and provide a statement of actuarial opinion  required annually in accordance with state insurance regulations  on the statutory reserves recorded by these us insurance subsidiaries 
the actuarial analysis of niic s  niic hi s and tcc s net reserves as of december  and reflected point estimates that were within of management s recorded net reserves as of such dates 
using this actuarial data along with its other data inputs  management concluded that the recorded reserves appropriately reflect management s best estimates of the liability as of each year end 
the quarterly reviews of unpaid loss and lae reserves by great american actuaries are prepared using standard actuarial techniques 
these may include but may not be limited to the case incurred development method  the paid development method  the bornhuetter ferguson method  and the incremental paid lae to paid loss methods 
the period of time from the occurrence of a loss through the settlement of the liability is referred to as the tail 
generally  the same actuarial methods are considered for both short tail and long tail lines of business because most of them work properly for both 
the methods are designed to incorporate the effects of the differing length of time to settle particular claims 
for short tail lines  management tends to give more weight to the case incurred and paid development methods  although the various methods tend to produce similar results 
for long tail lines  more judgment is involved and more weight may be given to the bornhuetter ferguson method 
liability claims for long tail lines are more susceptible to litigation and can be significantly affected by changing contract interpretation and the legal environment 
therefore  the estimation of loss reserves for these classes is more complex and subject to a higher degree of variability 
supplementary statistical information is reviewed to determine which methods are most appropriate and whether adjustments are needed to particular methods 
this information includes open and closed claim counts  average case reserves and average incurred on open claims  
table of contents closure rates and statistics related to closed and open claim percentages  average closed claim severity  ultimate claim severity  reported loss ratios  projected ultimate loss ratios  and loss payment patterns 
following is a discussion of certain critical variables affecting the estimation of loss reserves in our more significant lines of business 
many other variables may also impact ultimate claim costs 
an important assumption underlying reserve estimates is that the cost trends implicitly built into development patterns will continue into the future 
an unexpected change in cost trends could arise from a variety of sources including a general increase in economic inflation  inflation from social programs  new medical technologies or other factors such as those listed below in connection with our largest lines of business 
it is not possible to isolate and measure the potential impact of just one of these variables and future cost trends could be partially impacted by several such variables 
however  it is reasonable to address the sensitivity of the reserves to a potential impact from changes in these variables by measuring the effect of a possible overall change in future cost trends that may be caused by one or more variables 
the sensitivity of recorded reserves to a potential change of in the future cost trends is shown below 
utilizing the effect of a change in overall cost trends enables changes greater than to be estimated by extrapolation 
the estimated cumulative unfavorable impact that this change would have on our net income is shown below cumulative line of business impact commercial auto liability million workers compensation million the judgments and uncertainties surrounding management s reserve estimation process and the potential for reasonably possible variability in management s most recent reserve estimates may also be viewed by looking at how recent historical estimates of reserves for all lines of business have developed 
if our december   reserves net of reinsurance developed at the same rate as the average development of the most recent five years  the effect on net earnings would be an increase of million 
yr 
average net reserves effect on net development december  earnings million million net of tax effect 
the following discussion describes key assumptions and important variables that materially affect the estimate of the reserve for loss and lae of our two most significant lines of business  which represent of our total reserves and explains what caused them to change from assumptions used in the preceding period 
management has not made changes in key assumptions used in calculating current year reserves based on historical changes or current trends observed 
commercial auto liability 
in this line of business  we provide coverage protecting buses  limousines  other public transportation vehicles and trucks for accidents causing property damage or personal injury to others 
property damage liability and medical payments exposures are typically short tail lines of business with relatively quick reporting and settlement of claims 
bodily injury exposure is long tail because although the claim reporting of this line of business is relatively quick  the final settlement can take longer to achieve 
some of the important variables affecting our estimation of loss reserves for commercial auto liability include litigious climate  unpredictability of judicial decisions regarding coverage issues  
table of contents magnitude of jury awards  outside counsel costs  and frequency and timing of claims reporting 
we recorded unfavorable development of million in for this line of business as actual claim severity was higher than previously anticipated 
we recorded favorable development of million in and million in as actual claim severity  driven by favorable negotiated settlements and jury awards  was significantly lower than previously anticipated 
we continually monitor development trends in each line of business as a component of estimating future ultimate loss and related lae liabilities 
management has not made any changes to the key assumptions used in calculating current year reserves in the commercial auto liability line of business 
workers compensation 
in this long tail line of business  we provide coverage for employees who may be injured in the course of employment 
some of the important variables affecting our estimation of loss reserves for workers compensation include legislative actions and regulatory interpretations  future medical cost inflation  and timing of claims reporting 
a significant portion of our workers compensation business is written in california 
significant reforms passed by the california state legislature in and in reduced employer premiums and set treatment standards for injured workers 
we recorded favorable prior year loss development of million in  million in and million in due primarily to the impact of the legislation on medical claim costs being more favorable than previously anticipated 
as claims incurred from through are now reaching a higher percentage of settlement and maturity  management is able to estimate the ultimate costs of these claims with more precision 
while the standard actuarial techniques do reflect expected favorable impacts from the reforms  the magnitude of future cost savings depends on the implementation and interpretation of the reforms throughout the workers compensation system over the next several years 
while management applies the actuarial methods mentioned above  more judgment is involved in arriving at the final reserve to be held 
management reviewed the frequency  severity and loss and lae ratios implied by the projections from the standard tests in light of the uncertainties of future cost savings and recent rate actions since the reforms  to determine the appropriate reserve level 
due to the long tail nature of this business  we have recognized the favorable effects of the reform legislation on more recent claims only after a high percentage of claims have been paid and the ultimate impact of reforms could be estimated with more precision 
within each line  great american actuaries review the results of individual tests  supplementary statistical information and input from management to select their point estimate of the ultimate liability 
this estimate may be one test  a weighted average of several tests or a judgmental selection as the actuaries determine is appropriate 
the actuarial review is performed each quarter as a test of the reasonableness of management s point estimate and to provide management with a consulting opinion regarding the advisability of modifying its reserve setting assumptions for future periods 
the great american actuaries do not develop ranges of losses 
the level of detail at which data is analyzed varies among the different lines of business 
we generally analyze data by major product or coverage  using countrywide data 
we determine the appropriate segmentation of the data based on data volume  data credibility  mix of business and other actuarial considerations 
point estimates are selected based on test indications and judgment 
claims we view as potentially significant are subject to a rigorous review process involving the adjuster  claims management and executive management 
we seek to establish reserves at the maximum probable exposure based on our historic claims experience 
incurred but not yet reported ibnr reserves are determined separate from the case reserving process and include estimates for potential adverse development of the recorded case reserves 
we monitor ibnr reserves monthly with financial management and quarterly with an actuary from great american 
ibnr reserves are adjusted monthly based on historic patterns and current trends and exposures 
when a claim is 
table of contents reported  claims personnel establish a case reserve for the estimated amount of ultimate payment 
the amount of the reserve is based upon an evaluation of the type of claim involved  the circumstances surrounding each claim and the policy provisions relating to the loss 
the estimate reflects informed judgment of our claims personnel based on general insurance reserving practices and on the experience and knowledge of the claims personnel 
during the loss adjustment period  these estimates are revised as deemed necessary by our claims department based on developments and periodic reviews of the cases 
individual case reserves are reviewed for adequacy at least quarterly by senior claims management 
when establishing and reviewing reserves  we analyze historic data and estimate the impact of various loss development factors  such as our historic loss experience and that of the industry  trends in claims frequency and severity  our mix of business  our claims processing procedures  legislative enactments  judicial decisions  legal developments in imposition of damages and changes and trends in general economic conditions  including the effects of inflation 
as of december   management has not made any key assumptions that are inconsistent with historical loss reserve development patterns 
a change in any of these aforementioned factors from the assumptions implicit in our estimate can cause our actual loss experience to be better or worse than our reserves and the difference can be material 
there is no precise method  however  for evaluating the impact of any specific factor on the adequacy of reserves 
currently established reserves may not prove adequate in light of subsequent actual occurrences 
to the extent that reserves are inadequate and are increased or strengthened  the amount of such increase is treated as a charge to income in the period that the deficiency is recognized 
to the extent that reserves are redundant and are released  the amount of the release is a benefit to income in the period that redundancy is recognized 
the changes we have recorded in our reserves in the past three years illustrate the potential for revisions inherent in estimating reserves 
in  we experienced favorable development of million of total net reserves from claims incurred prior to in  we experienced favorable development of million of total net reserves from claims incurred prior to in  we experienced favorable development of million of total net reserves from claims incurred prior to we did not significantly change our reserving methodology or our claims settlement process in any of these years 
the development reflected settlements that differed from the established case reserves  changes in the case reserves based on new information for that specific claim or the differences in the timing of actual settlements compared to the payout patterns assumed in our accident year ibnr reductions 
the types of coverages we offer and risk levels we retain have a direct influence on the development of claims 
specifically  short duration claims and lower risk retention levels generally are more predictable and normally have less development 
future favorable or unfavorable development of reserves from this past development experience should not be assumed or estimated 
the reserves reported in the financial statements are our best estimate 

table of contents the following table shows the breakdown of our gross loss reserves between case reserves estimated amounts required to settle claims that have already been reported  ibnr reserves estimated amounts that will be needed to settle claims that have already occurred but have not yet been reported to us  as well as reserves for possible development on known claims and lae reserves estimated amounts required to adjust  record and settle claims  other than the claim payments themselves at december  statutory lines of business case ibnr lae total dollars in thousands commercial auto liability workers compensation auto physical damage general liability inland marine private passenger commercial multiple peril other lines reinsurance recoverables 
we are also subject to credit risks with respect to our third party reinsurers 
although reinsurers are liable to us to the extent we cede risks to them  we are ultimately liable to our policyholders on all these risks 
as a result  reinsurance does not limit our ultimate obligation to pay claims to policyholders and we may not be able to recover claims made to our reinsurers 
we manage this credit risk by selecting what we believe to be quality reinsurers  closely monitoring their financial condition  timely billing and collecting amounts due and obtaining sufficient collateral when necessary 
other than temporary impairment our investments are exposed to at least one of three primary sources of investment risk credit  interest rate and market valuation risks 
the financial statement risks are those associated with the recognition of impairments and income  as well as the determination of fair values 
we evaluate whether impairments have occurred on a case by case basis 
management considers a wide range of factors about the security issuer and uses its best judgment in evaluating the cause and amount of decline in the estimated fair value of the security and in assessing the prospects for near term recovery 
inherent in management s evaluation of the security are assumptions and estimates about the operations of the issuer and its future earnings potential 
considerations we use in the impairment evaluation process include  but are not limited to the length of time and the extent to which the market value has been below amortized cost  whether the issuer is experiencing significant financial difficulties  economic stability of an entire industry sector or subsection  whether the issuer  series of issuers or industry has a catastrophic type of loss  the extent to which the unrealized loss is credit driven or a result of changes in market interest rates  historical operating  balance sheet and cash flow data  internally generated financial models and forecasts  our ability and intent to hold the investment for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in market value  and other subjective factors  including concentrations and information obtained from regulators and rating agencies 

table of contents we closely monitor each investment that has a market value that is below its amortized cost and make a determination each quarter for other than temporary impairment for each of those investments 
during the year ended december   we recorded million in other than temporary impairments 
of the million of other than temporary impairments taken during  million related to securities issued by fannie mae  freddie mac and lehman brothers holdings inc and million related to exchange traded funds 
the remaining million is a further reflection of the credit crisis 
we will continue to monitor our portfolio to assess the impact of the recent government actions  including the troubled asset relief program and its impact on market valuations 
while it is not possible to accurately predict if or when a specific security will become impaired  given the current turmoil and uncertainty in the market  charges for other than temporary impairment could be material to net income in subsequent quarters 
management believes it is not likely that future impairment charges will have a significant effect on our liquidity 
we recorded a million impairment adjustment in and no impairment adjustments in see management s discussions and analysis of financial condition and results of operations investments 

table of contents item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk represents the potential economic loss arising from adverse changes in the fair value of financial instruments 
our exposures to market risk relate primarily to our investment portfolio  which is exposed to interest rate risk and credit risk 
we have not entered and do not plan to enter  into any derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
during  there were significant disruptions in the financial markets 
a number of large financial institutions failed  were supported by the united states government or were merged into other organizations 
the market disruption has resulted in a lack of liquidity in the credit markets and a widening of credit spreads 
as a result of these effects  we had a pre tax unrealized loss of million in our fixed maturities portfolio at december   compared with a pre tax unrealized gain of million at december  our securities lending portfolio had pre tax unrealized losses of million and million as of december  and december   respectively 
our equity securities had pre tax unrealized losses of million at december  compared to million at december  the fair value of our fixed maturity portfolio is directly impacted by changes in interest rates  in addition to credit risk 
our fixed maturity portfolio is comprised of primarily fixed rate investments with primarily short term and intermediate term maturities 
we believe this practice allows us to be flexible in reacting to fluctuations of interest rates 
we manage the portfolios of our insurance companies to attempt to achieve an adequate risk adjusted return while maintaining sufficient liquidity to meet policyholder obligations 
we invest in a mix of fixed income securities to capture what we believe are adequate risk adjusted returns in an evolving investment environment 
the following table provides information about our available for sale fixed maturity investments that are sensitive to interest rate risk
