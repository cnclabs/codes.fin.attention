item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations our management s discussion and analysis of financial condition contains forward looking statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of these statements involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties that may cause our actual results or outcomes to be materially different from those anticipated and discussed herein 
important factors that we believe may cause such differences are discussed in the risk factors section of this annual report and in the cautionary statements accompanying the forward looking statements in this annual report 
in assessing forward looking statements contained herein  readers are urged to read carefully all risk factors and cautionary statements contained in this annual report 
further  we operate in an industry sector where securities values are volatile and may be influenced by regulatory and other factors beyond our control 
overview we are a clinical stage  biopharmaceutical company developing novel therapeutics to treat cancer and eye diseases 
our primary focus is the development and commercialization of product candidates referred to as vascular disrupting agents vdas that selectively disable and destroy abnormal blood vessels that provide solid tumors a means of growth and survival and also are associated with visual impairment in a number of ophthalmological diseases and conditions 
approximately subjects have been treated to date with zybrestat in human clinical trials 
in light of the significant human experience with zybrestat to date  and because our vda product candidates act via a validated therapeutic mechanism  inhibition of blood flow to tumors and to neovascular lesions within the eye  we believe the risk associated with our drug development programs is relatively low as compared with compounds that act via unproven or unknown mechanisms of action 
our most advanced therapeutic product candidate  zybrestat tm usan name fosbretabulin  previously known as combretastatin a phosphate or cap  is currently being evaluated in a phase ii iii pivotal registration study  the fact trial  as a potential treatment for anaplastic thyroid cancer atc  a highly aggressive and lethal malignancy for which there are currently no approved therapeutics and extremely limited treatment options 
in  we completed a special protocol assessment process with the us food and drug administration fda for this pivotal registration study 
the fda has also granted fast track designation to zybrestat for the treatment of regionally advanced and or metastatic atc 
zybrestat was awarded orphan drug status by the fda and the european commission in the european union for the treatment of advanced atc and for the treatment of medullary  stage iv papillary and stage iv follicular thyroid cancers 
in addition  zybrestat is being evaluated in phase ii clinical trials as a potential treatment for i non small cell lung cancer nsclc in combination with the chemotherapeutic agents  carboplatin and paclitaxel  and the anti angiogenic agent  bevacizumab the falcon trial  and ii platinum resistant ovarian cancer in combination with carboplatin and paclitaxel 
in october  we announced interim results  as reported by the principal investigator at the th biennial meeting of the international gynecological cancer society  from the ongoing phase ii study with zybrestat in platinum resistant ovarian cancer 
after reviewing these results with an ovarian cancer expert panel  we believe the interim data  assuming final study results are similar  support further development of zybrestat in ovarian cancer and is considering options for undertaking further studies in ovarian cancer  including a study or studies which may potentially be undertaken in collaboration with an oncology cooperative study group 
we anticipate that results from the ongoing zybrestat phase ii ovarian cancer study will be reported in the first half of at annual meeting of the american society of clinical oncology asco 

table of contents we believe that the ongoing fact trial in atc  if successful  will provide a basis for us to seek marketing approval of zybrestat in atc  and that the ongoing zybrestat study program will establish a compelling rationale for further development of zybrestat as a treatment for v other forms of recurrent  metastatic thyroid cancer  vi other aggressive and difficult to treat malignancies  and vii use in combination with chemotherapy in a variety of solid tumors  particularly those in which carboplatin and or paclitaxel chemotherapy are commonly used  and viii use in combination with commonly used anti angiogenic drugs  such as bevacizumab that act via vegf pathway inhibition  in various solid tumor indications 
we believe these areas for potential further development collectively represent a large potential commercial market opportunity that includes cancers of the thyroid  ovary  kidney  liver  head and neck  breast  lung  skin  brain  colon and rectum 
in addition  based upon pre clinical results first published by its collaborators in the november online issue of the journal blood  as well as pre clinical data to be presented in april at the annual meeting of the american association of cancer research aacr  we believe that zybrestat and our other vda product candidates  particularly oxi  may also have utility in the treatment of hematological malignancies or liquid tumors  such as acute myeloid leukemia 
in addition to developing zybrestat as an intravenously administered therapy for oncology indications  in conjunction with symphony we are undertaking an ophthalmology research and development program with zybrestat  the objective of which is to develop a topical formulation of zybrestat for ophthalmological diseases and conditions that are characterized by abnormal blood vessel growth within the eye that results in loss of vision 
we believe that a safe  effective and convenient topically administered anti vascular therapeutic would have advantages over currently approved anti vascular  ophthalmological therapeutics  which must be injected directly into patients eyes  in some cases on a chronic monthly basis 
we are currently conducting pre clinical studies and plans to initiate in the first half of at least one human clinical trial with intravenously administered zybrestat to i confirm the therapeutic utility of zybrestat in an ophthalmologic indication  ii determine tissue concentrations of drug required for activity  and iii further evaluate the feasibility of developing a topical formulation of zybrestat for ophthalmological indications 
to date  we have completed pre clinical experiments demonstrating that zybrestat has activity in six different pre clinical ophthalmology models  including a model in which zybrestat was combined with an approved anti angiogenic drug 
we have also completed multiple pre clinical studies suggesting that zybrestat  when applied topically to the surface of the eye at doses anticipated to be tolerated and non toxic  penetrates to the retina and choroid in quantities that we believe should be more than sufficient for therapeutic activity 
finally  we have completed and reported results at the annual meeting of the association for research in vision and ophthalmology arvo from a phase ii study in patients with myopic macular degeneration in which all patients in the study met the primary clinical endpoint of vision stabilization three months after study entry 
in conjunction with symphony  we are currently evaluating a second generation vda product candidate  oxi  in a phase i clinical trial in patients with advanced solid tumors  and based on what we believe to be compelling pre clinical study results  plan to file an ind for this product candidate and initiate additional phase ib studies beginning in the first half of in pre clinical studies  oxi has shown potent anti tumor activity against solid tumors and acute myeloid leukemia  both as a single agent and in combination with other cancer treatment modalities 
we believe that oxi is differentiated from other vdas by its dual action activity 
oxi has demonstrated potent vascular disrupting effects on tumor vasculature  as well as direct cytotoxic effects on tumor cells that arise from metabolism of the drug by oxidative enzymes  which are elevated in certain tumors and tissues  eg  leukemia  hepatic tumors  and melanoma to a cytotoxic orthoquinone chemical species 
as described in item  business under symphony transaction  in october  we announced a strategic collaboration with symphony capital partners  lp symphony  a private equity firm  under which 
table of contents symphony agreed to provide up to  in funding to support the advancement of zybretat for oncology  zybrestat for ophthalmology and oxi under the transaction  we granted symphony vida  inc  a newly created drug development company  exclusive licenses to zybrestat for use in ophthalmologic indications and oxi we maintain an exclusive option  but not the obligation  to purchase the assets of symphony vida  inc finally  under a sponsored research agreement with baylor university  we are pursuing discovery and development of novel  small molecule therapeutics for the treatment of cancer  including a small molecule cathepsin l inhibitors and hypoxia activated vdas 
cathepsin l is an enzyme involved in protein degradation and has been shown to be closely involved in the processes of angiogenesis and metastasis 
small molecule inhibitors may have the potential to slow tumor growth and metastasis in a manner we believe that could be complementary with its vda therapeutics 
we also believe that its hypoxia activated vdas could serve as line extension products to zybrestat and or oxi financial resources we have generated a cumulative net loss of approximately  for the period from our inception through december  we expect to incur significant additional operating losses over at least the next several years  principally as a result of our continuing clinical trials and anticipated research and development expenditures 
the principal source of our working capital to date has been the proceeds of private and public equity financings and to a lesser extent the exercise of warrants and stock options 
we currently have no material amount of licensing or other fee income 
we expect current cash on hand to fund operations into the fourth quarter of we will require significant additional funding to remain a going concern and to fund operations until such time  if ever  we become profitable 
however  there can be no assurance that adequate additional financing will be available to us on terms that we deem acceptable  if at all 
our failure to successfully complete human clinical trials  develop and market products over the next several years  or to realize product revenues  would materially adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
royalties or other revenue generated by us from commercial sales of our potential products are not expected for several years  if at all 
we expect to continue to pursue strategic alliances and consider collaborative development opportunities that may provide us with access to organizations that have capabilities and or products that are complementary to our own  in order to continue the development of our potential product candidates 
however  there can be no assurances that we will complete any strategic alliances or collaborative development agreements  and the terms of such arrangements may not be advantageous to us 
as of december   we had approximately  in cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities 
during our fiscal  we primarily invested in commercial paper  investment grade corporate bonds  asset backed securities and money market funds 
in fiscal  we plan to employ an even more conservative investment strategy limited to obligations issued by us treasury and federal agencies  obligations of commercial banks and commercial paper 
our investment objectives are to preserve principal  maintain a high degree of liquidity to meet operating needs and obtain competitive returns subject to prevailing market conditions 
as of december   the weighted average days to maturity of our available for sale marketable securities was approximately days  and the yield to maturity based on the cost of those investments was approximately 
in addition  investments held by symphony vida inc were  as of december  these funds are dedicated to fund zybrestat for ophthalmology and oxi licensed to symphony vida  inc in connection with the collaborative arrangement completed in october symphony vida has an investment strategy and objectives similar to ours 
we expect that income from our investments may decrease in fiscal as compared to fiscal due to an expected lower average balance of invested funds and a lower average yield 
on october   we announced a strategic collaboration with symphony capital partners  lp symphony  a private equity firm  under which symphony agreed to provide up to  in funding to support the advancement of zybrestat for oncology  zybrestat for ophthalmology and oxi we 
table of contents issued to holdings  pursuant to the stock and warrant purchase agreement  an aggregate of  shares of our common stock and warrants at a price of per share which was the closing price of oxigene common stock on the nasdaq global market on september  under this collaboration  we entered into a series of related agreements with symphony capital llc  symphony vida  inc  or vida  symphony vida holdings llc  or holdings  and related entities for the list of agreements see notes to financial statements no  description of business and significant accounting policies under license agreements 
pursuant to these agreements  holdings has formed and capitalized vida  a delaware corporation  in order a to hold certain intellectual property related to two of our product candidates  zybrestat for use in ophthalmologic indications and oxi  referred to as the programs  which were exclusively licensed to vida under the novated and restated technology license agreement and b to fund commitments of up to  the funding will support pre clinical and clinical development conducted by us  on behalf of vida  for zybrestat for ophthalmology and oxi under certain circumstances  we may be required to commit up to  to vida 
we are undertaking an ophthalmology research and development program with zybrestat  the objective of which is to develop a topical formulation of zybrestat for ophthalmologic diseases and conditions that are characterized by abnormal blood vessel growth within the eye that results in loss of vision 
we are currently conducting pre clinical studies and plan to undertake clinical trials with the objectives of i confirming the utility of zybrestat in at least one ophthalmologic indication and tissue concentrations of drug required for biological activity  and ii demonstrating the feasibility of developing a topical formulation of zybrestat for ophthalmological indications 
oxi is currently in a phase i clinical trial in patients with advanced solid tumors 
based on favorable results in pre clinical studies  we are planning further clinical trials with oxi in february  we entered into a committed equity financing facility ceff with kingsbridge capital  pursuant to which kingsbridge committed to purchase  subject to certain conditions  up to  shares of our common stock or up to an aggregate of  during the next three years 
under the ceff  we are able to draw down in tranches of up to a maximum of percent of our closing market value at the time of the draw down or the alternative draw down amount calculated pursuant to the common stock purchase agreement whichever is less  subject to certain conditions 
the purchase price of these shares is discounted between to percent from the volume weighted average price of our common stock for each of the eight trading days following the election to sell shares 
kingsbridge is not obligated to purchase shares at prices below per share or at a price below of the closing share price of our stock in the trading day immediately preceding the commencement of the draw down  whichever is higher 
in connection with the ceff  we issued a warrant to kingsbridge to purchase  shares of our common stock at a price of per share exercisable beginning six months after february  for a period of five years thereafter 
we have filed a registration statement on form s to register the resale by kingsbridge of the shares issuable to kingsbridge under the ceff  which was declared effective by the sec on may  in june  we completed our first drawdown under the ceff  netting approximately  in the near future  additional draw downs are not likely due to the current stock price 
the actual and planned uses of proceeds from all of the above financings include the continued development of our two lead product candidates  zybrestat and oxi  in oncology and ophthalmology 
we are committed to a disciplined financial strategy and as such maintain a limited employee and facilities base  with development  scientific  finance and administrative functions  which include  among other things  product development  regulatory oversight and clinical testing 
our research and development team members typically work on a number of development projects concurrently 
accordingly  we do not separately track the costs for each of these research and development projects to enable separate disclosure of these costs on a project by project basis 
we conduct scientific activities pursuant to collaborative arrangements with universities 
regulatory and clinical testing functions are generally contracted out to third party  specialty organizations 
critical accounting policies and significant judgments and estimates our management s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles 

table of contents the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements  as well as the reported revenues and expenses during the reporting periods 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates and judgments  including those related to intangible assets 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be appropriate under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making the judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates 
while our significant accounting policies are more fully described in note to our financial statements included in this report  we believe the following accounting policies are most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results 
available for sale securities we view our marketable securities as available for use in our current operations  and accordingly designate our marketable securities as available for sale 
available for sale securities are carried at fair value with the unrealized gains and losses  net of tax  if any  reported as accumulated other comprehensive income loss in stockholders equity 
we review the status of the unrealized gains and losses of our available for sale marketable securities on a regular basis 
realized gains and losses and declines in value judged to be other than temporary on available for sale securities are included in investment income 
interest and dividends on securities classified as available for sale are included in investment income 
securities in an unrealized loss position deemed not to be other than temporarily impaired  due to management s positive intent and ability to hold the securities until anticipated recovery  with maturation greater than twelve months are classified as long term assets 
accrued clinical costs we charge all research and development expenses  both internal and external costs  to operations as incurred 
our research and development costs represent expenses incurred from the engagement of outside professional service organizations  product manufacturers and consultants associated with the development of our potential product candidates 
we recognize expense associated with these arrangements based on the completion of activities as specified in the applicable contracts 
costs incurred under fixed fee contracts are accrued ratably over the contract period absent any knowledge that the services will be performed other than ratably 
costs incurred under contracts with clinical trial sites and principal investigators are generally accrued on a patients treated basis consistent with the terms outlined in the contract 
in determining costs incurred on some of these programs  we take into consideration a number of factors  including estimates and input provided by our internal program managers 
upon termination of such contracts  we are normally only liable for costs incurred or committed to date 
as a result  accrued research and development expenses represent our estimated contractual liability to outside service providers at any of the relevant times 
any advance payments for goods or services to be used or rendered in future research and development activities pursuant to an executory contractual arrangement are properly classified as prepaid until such goods or services are rendered 
impairment of long lived assets on august   we entered into an exclusive license for the commercial development  use and sale of products or services covered by certain patent rights owned by arizona state university 
the present value of the amount payable under the license agreement has been capitalized based on a discounted cash flow model and is being amortized over the term of the agreement approximately years 
under sfas  management is required to perform an impairment analysis of its long lived assets if triggering events occur 
we review for such triggering events periodically and  even though triggering events such as a going concern opinion and continuing losses exist  we have determined that there is no impairment to this asset during the years ended up to and including december  in addition  the agreement provides for additional payments in connection with the license arrangement upon the initiation of certain clinical trials or the completion of certain regulatory approvals  which payments could be accelerated upon the achievement of certain financial milestones as defined in the agreement 
to date no clinical trials triggering payments under 
table of contents the agreement have been completed and no regulatory approvals have been obtained 
we expense these payments to research and development in the period the criteria  as defined in the agreement  are satisfied 
stock based compensation effective january   we adopted statement of financial accounting standard no 
r sfas r  share based payment  which requires the expense recognition of the estimated fair value of all share based payments issued to employees 
prior to the adoption of sfas r  the estimated fair value associated with such awards was not recorded as an expense  but rather was disclosed in a footnote to our financial statements 
the valuation of employee stock options is an inherently subjective process  since market values are generally not available for long term  non transferable employee stock options 
accordingly  an option pricing model is utilized to derive an estimated fair value 
in calculating the estimated fair value of our stock options  we use the black scholes pricing model  which requires the consideration of the following six variables for purposes of estimating fair value the stock option exercise price  the expected term of the option  the grant date price of our common stock  which is issuable upon exercise of the option  the expected volatility of our common stock  the expected dividends on our common stock we do not anticipate paying dividends in the foreseeable future  and the risk free interest rate for the expected option term stock option exercise price and grant date price of our common stock the closing market price of our common stock on the date of grant 
expected term the expected term of options represents the period of time for which the options are expected to be outstanding and is based on an analysis of historical behavior of option plan participants over time 
expected volatility the expected volatility is a measure of the amount by which our stock price is expected to fluctuate during the term of the options granted 
we determine the expected volatility based on the historical volatility of our common stock over a period commensurate with the option s expected term 
expected dividends we have never declared or paid any cash dividends on our common stock and do not expect to do so in the foreseeable future 
accordingly  we use an expected dividend yield of zero to calculate the grant date fair value of a stock option 
risk free interest rate the risk free interest rate is the implied yield available on us treasury issues with a remaining life consistent with the option s expected term on the date of grant 
of the variables above  the selection of an expected term and expected stock price volatility are the most subjective 
in accordance with the transition provisions of sfas r  the grant date estimates of fair value associated with awards prior to january   which were also calculated using the black scholes option pricing model  have not been changed 
the specific valuation assumptions that were utilized for purposes of deriving an estimate of fair value at the time that prior awards were issued are as disclosed in our prior annual reports on form k  as filed with the sec 
upon adoption of sfas r  we were also required to estimate the level of award forfeitures expected to occur and record compensation expense only for those awards that are ultimately expected to vest 
this requirement applies to all awards that are not yet vested  including awards granted prior to january  accordingly  we performed a historical analysis of option awards that were forfeited prior to vesting  and 
table of contents ultimately recorded total stock option expense that reflected this estimated forfeiture rate 
in our calculation  we segregated participants into two distinct groups  directors and officers and employees 
this analysis is re evaluated quarterly and the forfeiture rate is adjusted as necessary 
ultimately  the actual expense recognized over the vesting period will only be for those shares that vest 
changes in the inputs and assumptions  as described above  can materially affect the measure of estimated fair value of our share based compensation 
consolidation of variable interest entity on october   we announced a strategic collaboration with symphony capital partners  lp symphony  a private equity firm  under which symphony agreed to provide up to  in funding to support the advancement of zybrestat for oncology  zbyrestat for ophthalmology and oxi under this collaboration  we entered into a series of related agreements with symphony capital llc  symphony vida  inc  or vida  symphony vida holdings llc  or holdings  and related entities for a list of the agreements see notes to financial statements no 
 description of business and significant accounting policies under consolidation of variable interest entity 
pursuant to these agreements  holdings has formed and capitalized vida  a delaware corporation  in order a to hold certain intellectual property related to two of our product candidates  zybrestat for use in ophthalmologic indications and oxi  referred to as the programs  which were exclusively licensed to vida under the novated and restated technology license agreement and b to fund commitments of up to  the funding will support pre clinical and clinical development conducted by us  on behalf of vida  for zybrestat for ophthalmology and oxi under certain circumstances  we may be required to commit up to  to vida 
our requirement for additional funding will be determined by a number of factors  including among others  if at all  the determination of the need for more funding and the written recommendation of the joint development committee jdc  the approval of the symphony vida board  the probability and amount of the additional funding provided by holdings  if any  the probability that we may provide optional funding optional company funding  and the timing of meeting the potential obligations 
pursuant to the agreements  we continue to be primarily responsible for all pre clinical  and clinical development efforts as well as maintenance of the intellectual property portfolio for zybrestat for ophthalmology and oxi we and vida have established a development committee to oversee zybrestat for ophthalmology and oxi we participate in the development committee and have the right to appoint one of the five directors of vida 
we have incurred and may continue to incur expenses related to zybrestat for ophthalmology and oxi that are not funded by vida 
the purchase option agreement provides for the exclusive right  but not the obligation  for us to repurchase both programs by acquiring of the equity of vida at any time between october  and march  for an amount equal to two times the amount of capital actually invested by symphony in vida  less certain amounts 
the purchase price is payable in cash or a combination of cash and shares of our common stock up to of the purchase price or of the total number of shares of our common stock outstanding at such time  in our sole discretion  subject to certain limitations 
if we do not exercise our exclusive right with respect to the purchase of zybrestat for ophthalmology and oxi licensed under the agreement with vida  rights to zybrestat for ophthalmology and oxi at the end of the development period will remain with vida 
in consideration for the purchase option  we issued to holdings  shares of our common stock and paid approximately  for structuring fees and related expenses to symphony capital 
under fasb interpretation no 
revised fin r  consolidation of variable interest entities  a variable interest entity vie is an entity that has equity that is insufficient to permit the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support  or an entity that has equity investors that cannot make significant decisions about the entity s operations or that do not absorb their proportionate share of the expected losses or do not receive the expected residual returns of the entity 
fin r requires a vie to be consolidated by the party that is deemed to be the primary beneficiary  which is the party that has exposure to a majority of the potential variability in the vie s outcomes 
the application of fin r to a given arrangement requires significant management judgment 

table of contents we have consolidated the financial position and results of operations of vida in accordance with fin r 
we believe vida is by design a vie because we have a purchase option to acquire its outstanding voting stock at prices that are fixed based upon the date the option is exercised 
the fixed nature of the purchase option price limits symphony s returns  as the investor in vida 
fin r deems parties to be de facto agents if they cannot sell  transfer  or encumber their interests without the prior approval of an enterprise 
symphony is considered to be a de facto agent of the company pursuant to this provision 
further  because we and symphony  are a related party group  based on their direct investment in our common stock  we absorb a majority of vida s variability 
we evaluated whether  pursuant to fin r s requirements  we are most closely associated with vida and concluded that we are most closely associated with vida and should consolidate vida because we originally developed the technology that was licensed to vida  we will continue to oversee and monitor the development program and serve as the ind sponsor for any trials relating to the agreement  our employees and contractors will continue to perform substantially all of the development work  we have the ability to make decisions that have a significant effect on the success of vida s activities through our representation on the vida board and the joint development committee  vida s operations are substantially similar to our activities  and through the purchase option  we have the ability to meaningfully participate in the benefits of a successful development effort 
symphony will be required to absorb the development risk for its equity investment in vida 
pursuant to fin r s requirements  symphony s equity investment in vida is classified as noncontrolling interest in our consolidated balance sheets 
the noncontrolling interest held by symphony has been reduced by the  fair value of the common stock it received in consideration for the purchase option and the pro rata portion of the  of fees and expenses we paid upon the transaction s closing as the total consideration provided by us reduces symphony s at risk equity investment in vida 
while we perform the research and development on behalf of vida  our development risk is limited to the consideration we provided to symphony the common stock and fees 
losses incurred by vida are charged to the noncontrolling interest 
net losses incurred by vida and charged to the noncontrolling interest were  for the year ended december  at december   the noncontrolling interest balance was  as of december   the investments held by vida were  which we currently expect to finance vida programs at least into the first quarter of fiscal as noted above  our agreements with symphony provide for additional funding commitments by both symphony and us  subject to certain conditions 
accounting for derivative financial instruments indexed to and potentially settled in the company s common stock in connection with the strategic collaboration with symphony capital partners  lp symphony in october discussed above  we issued to holdings  a warrant the direct investment warrant to purchase  shares of our common stock at per share  which was the closing price of our common stock on the nasdaq global market on september   the day before the consummation of the symphony transaction 
the term of this warrant was ten years from the date of issuance or until october  this warrant was exercised on december  subsequent to the approval of issuance of common stock underlying the warrant by our stockholders on december  in addition  we agreed that should the development committee of vida determine that vida needs additional funding  and that funding is provided by holdings  we would issue shares of our common stock having a value of up to  the additional investment shares on the date of issuance 
the number of shares required to meet this obligation will be based on the closing price of our common stock on the nasdaq global market on the additional closing date 
because the closing price of our common stock as of the additional closing date is not yet determinable  the number of potential shares issuable to symphony is not yet known  and depending on our stock price  may be greater than the number of shares that we currently have authorized 
the obligation to issue the additional investment shares expires no later than the term of the strategic collaboration or march  
table of contents in connection with the ceff described above in the financial resources section of item  we issued a warrant the ceff warrant to kingsbridge capital to purchase  shares of our common stock at a price of per share exercisable beginning august  for a period of five years thereafter  or until august  due to the indeterminable number of shares required to meet the additional investment shares obligation we have determined that we may not have sufficient authorized shares to settle our outstanding financial instruments 
pursuant to emerging issues task force no 
eitf accounting for derivative financial instruments indexed to and potentially settled in  a company s own stock  our policy with regard to settling outstanding financial instruments is to settle those with the earliest maturity date first which essentially sets the order of preference for settling the awards 
in accordance with fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities fasb and eitf  we account for the direct investment warrant  additional investment shares and ceff warrant collectively the derivative instruments as liabilities 
we began the treatment of these derivative instruments as liabilities as of october   the initial funding and effective date of the symphony transaction 
establishing the value of these derivative instruments is an inherently subjective process 
the value of both the direct investment warrant and the ceff warrant are determined using the black scholes option model 
the value of the additional investment shares is determined by considering a number of factors  including among others  the probability and amount of the additional funding provided by holdings  if any  the probability that oxigene may provide the additional funding amount  and the timing of meeting the potential obligation 
differences in value from one measurement date to another are recorded as other income expense in our statement of operations 
in october  we recorded a  liability for the fair value of the derivative instruments 
we remeasured the derivative instruments as of december  resulting in a gain of  which is in our statement of operations 
the gain primarily represents the change in fair value of the direct investment and the kingsbridge ceff warrants 
recent accounting pronouncements in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
 noncontrolling interests in consolidated financial statements  an amendment of arb no 
sfas 
sfas changes the accounting for noncontrolling minority interests in consolidated financial statements including the requirements to classify noncontrolling interests as a component of consolidated stockholders equity  and the elimination of minority interest accounting in results of operations with earnings attributable to noncontrolling interests reported as part of consolidated earnings 
additionally  sfas revises the accounting for both increases and decreases in a parent s controlling ownership interest 
the company has adopted sfas beginning in fiscal  which required the company to reclassify noncontrolling interest as a component of equity 
in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas sfas no 
revised  entitled business combinations 
sfas r will change how business acquisitions are accounted for and will impact financial statements both on the acquisition date and in subsequent periods 
sfas r is effective prospectively for business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after the beginning of the first annual reporting period beginning on or after december  the company adopted sfas r beginning in and does not expect the change to have a material effect on its financial position or results of operations 
in december  the emerging issues task force eitf issued eitf entitled  accounting for collaborative arrangements 
eitf defines collaboration arrangements and establishes reporting requirements for transactions between participants in a collaborative arrangement and between participants in the arrangement and third parties 
eitf is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  the company adopted eitf beginning in and does not expect the change to have a material effect on its financial position or results of operations 
in june  the eitf issued eitf entitled accounting for nonrefundable advance payments for goods or services received for future research and development activities 
this issue provides guidance on whether nonrefundable advance payments for goods or services that will be used or rendered for research 
table of contents and development activities should be expensed when the advance payment is made or when the research and development activity has been performed 
eitf was effective for all of in february  the fasb issued sfas no 
 entitled fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities sfas 
this statement is an amendment to sfas no 
 accounting for certain investment in debt and equity securities 
sfas permits entities to choose to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value 
sfas was effective for all of results of operations years ended december  and revenues we recognized approximately  in licensing revenue in each of the years ended december  and  in connection with the license of our nutritional and diagnostic technology 
future revenues  if any  from this license agreement are expected to continue to be minimal 
our future revenues will depend upon our ability to establish collaborations with respect to  and generate revenues from products currently under development by us 
we expect that we will not generate meaningful revenue in fiscal unless and until we enter into new collaborations providing for funding through the payment of licensing fees and up front payments 
costs and expenses the following table summarizes our operating expenses for the periods indicated  in thousands and as a percentage of total expenses of total of total increase operating operating decrease amount expenses amount expenses amount research and development general and administrative total operating expenses we expect that as we continue to develop the two lead potential product candidates  zybrestat and oxi  the percentage of research and development expenses to total operating expenses will continue to increase 
research and development expenses the table below summarizes the most significant components of our research and development expenses for the periods indicated  in thousands and as a percentage of total research and development expenses and provides the changes in these components and their percentages of total of total research research development development increase decrease amount expenses amount expenses amount external services employee compensation and related stock based compensation other total research and development 
table of contents external services expenses are comprised of costs incurred for consultants  contractors and outside service providers that assist in the management and support of our development programs 
the increase in these costs in fiscal over fiscal is primarily attributable to an increase in expenditures on our zybrestat oncology programs  namely  our phase ii iii clinical trial for the treatment of anaplastic thyroid cancer  our phase ii trial in combination with bevacizumab for the treatment of non small cell lung cancer  and our phase ii trial for the treatment of platinum resistant ovarian cancer  totaling approximately  these increases were offset by decreases in expenditures on both our phase i trial of oxi in solid tumors and our phase i trial of zybrestat in combination with bevacizumab in solid tumors  totaling approximately  in addition  we experienced an increase in our pre clinical study expenses of approximately  which was offset by a decrease in drug manufacturing expenses of approximately  the increase in employee compensation and related expenses is attributable to an increase in the average number of employees in fiscal over fiscal of approximately 
we expect that with the continued development of our two lead product candidates  zybrestat and oxi in oncology and ophthalmology  our research and development expenses will continue to increase 
as a result  we expect that the percentage of external services expenses to total research and development expenses will continue to increase as well

the increase in consulting and professional services expenses in fiscal over fiscal is primarily attributable to increases in legal and contracted services and advisory costs  totaling approximately  in connection with the establishment of our committed equity financing facility and the initiation of symphony vida inc the increase in facilities related expense is due to the expansion of office space in the san francisco area in fiscal over and an increase in the average number of employees to support the continued development of our product candidates 
the decrease in other expenses in fiscal from fiscal of  is consistent with the overall reduction in spending in the combined general and administrative expense categories 

table of contents we expect that we will continue to incur general and administrative expenses at an appropriate level to support the ongoing development of our potential product candidates and to meet the requirements of being a public company 
other income and expenses in fiscal  we recorded a gain of  relating to the change in fair value of outstanding warrants  which are accounted for as liabilities 
the majority of this gain  or  is due to the direct investment warrant issued to symphony capital in october and exercised by them in december following the approval by our stockholders of the issuance of our common stock underlying the warrant at a special meeting of stockholders on december  the gain represents the change in value between the direct investment warrant issue date and december   the date that the direct investment warrant was exercised 
the remainder of the gain reflects the change during the fourth quarter in value of the ceff warrant issued to kingsbridge capital

the increase in these costs in fiscal over fiscal is attributable to the further development of our two primary potential product candidates  zybrestat in both oncology and ophthalmology and oxi in oncology

at the current time  we are uncertain whether we will be able to access our ceff during fiscal to augment our existing capital resources as the current market price of our common stock is below the minimum required by our agreement with kingsbridge 
we do intend to aggressively pursue other forms of capital infusion including strategic alliances with organizations that have capabilities and or products that are complementary to our own  in order to continue the development of our potential product candidates 
our cash requirements may vary materially from those now planned for or anticipated by management due to numerous risks and uncertainties 
these risks and uncertainties include  but are not limited to the progress of and results of our pre clinical testing and clinical trials of our vda drug candidates under development  including zybrestat  our lead drug candidate  and oxi  the progress of our research and development programs  the time and costs expended and required to obtain any necessary or desired regulatory approvals  the resources  if any  that we devote to developing manufacturing methods and advanced technologies  our ability to enter into licensing arrangements  including any unanticipated licensing arrangements that may be necessary to enable us to continue our development and clinical trial programs  the costs and expenses of filing  prosecuting and  if necessary  enforcing our patent claims  or defending ourselves against possible claims of infringement by us of third party patent or other technology rights  the costs of commercialization activities and arrangements  if any  undertaken by us  and  if and when approved  the demand for our products  which demand is dependent in turn on circumstances and uncertainties that cannot be fully known  understood or quantified unless and until the time of approval  for example the range of indications for which any product is granted approval

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk at december   we did not hold any derivative financial instruments  commodity based instruments or other long term debt obligations 
we account for the symphony direct investment warrants  additional investment shares and the kingsbridge ceff warrant as liabilities 
as of december  the direct investment warrants were exercised and no longer outstanding  the additional investment shares are valued at  and the kingsbridge ceff warrant is valued at  we have adopted an investment policy  the primary objectives of which are to preserve principal  maintain proper liquidity to meet operating needs and maximize yields while preserving principal 
although our investments are subject to credit risk  we follow procedures to limit the amount of credit exposure in any single issue  issuer or type of investment 
our investments are also subject to interest rate risk and will decrease in value if market interest rates increase 
however  due to the conservative nature of our investments and relatively short duration  we believe that interest rate risk is mitigated 
our cash and cash equivalents are maintained in us dollar accounts 
although we conduct a number of our trials and studies outside of the united states  we believe our exposure to foreign currency risk to be limited as the arrangements are in jurisdictions with relatively stable currencies
