competition all of the company s properties are located in developed areas that include other multifamily properties 
the number of competitive multifamily properties in a particular area could have a material effect on the company s ability to lease units at the properties or at any newly acquired properties and on the rents charged 
the company may be competing with other entities that have greater resources than the company and whose managers have more experience than the company s managers 
in addition  other forms of rental properties and single family housing provide housing alternatives to potential residents of multifamily properties 
see item a 
risk factors for additional information with respect to competition 
environmental considerations see item a 
risk factors for information concerning the potential effects of environmental regulations on our operations 
item a 
risk factors general the following risk factors may contain defined terms that are different from those used in the other sections of this report 
unless otherwise indicated  when used in this section  the terms we and us refer to equity residential and its subsidiaries  including erp operating limited partnership 
this item a 
includes forward looking statements 
you should refer to our discussion of the qualifications and limitations on forward looking statements included in item the occurrence of the events discussed in the following risk factors could adversely affect  possibly in a material manner  our business  financial condition or results of operations  which could adversely affect the value of our common shares of beneficial interest or preferred shares of beneficial interest which we refer to collectively as shares  preference interests and or units interests and or units of a subsidiary of erp operating limited partnership  our operating partnership  and limited partnership interests in the operating partnership op units 
in this section  we refer to the shares  interests  units and the op units together as our securities and the investors who own shares  interests  units and or op units as our security holders 
our performance and securities value are subject to risks associated with the real estate industry general real property investments are subject to varying degrees of risk and are relatively illiquid 
several factors may adversely affect the economic performance and value of our properties 
these factors include changes in the national  regional and local economic climates  local conditions such as an oversupply of multifamily properties or a reduction in demand for our multifamily properties  the attractiveness of our properties to residents  competition from other available multifamily property owners and single family homes and changes in market rental rates 
our performance also depends on our ability to collect rent from residents and to pay for adequate maintenance  insurance and other operating costs  including real estate taxes  which could increase over time 
sources of labor and materials required for maintenance  repair  capital expenditure or development may be more expensive than anticipated 
also  
table of contents the expenses of owning and operating a property are not necessarily reduced when circumstances such as market factors and competition cause a reduction in income from the property 
we may not have sufficient cash flows from operations after capital expenditures to cover our distributions we generally consider our cash flows provided by operating activities after capital expenditures to be adequate to meet operating requirements and payment of distributions to our security holders 
however  there may be times when we experience shortfalls in our coverage of distributions  which may cause us to consider reducing our distributions and or using the proceeds from property dispositions or additional financing transactions to make up the difference 
should these shortfalls occur for lengthy periods of time or be material in nature  our financial condition may be adversely affected and we may not be able to maintain our current distribution levels 
we may be unable to renew leases or relet units as leases expire when our residents decide not to renew their leases upon expiration  we may not be able to relet their units 
even if the residents do renew or we can relet the units  the terms of renewal or reletting may be less favorable than current lease terms 
because virtually all of our leases are for apartments  they are generally for terms of no more than one year 
if we are unable to promptly renew the leases or relet the units  or if the rental rates upon renewal or reletting are significantly lower than expected rates  then our results of operations and financial condition will be adversely affected 
occupancy levels and market rents may be adversely affected by national and local economic and market conditions including  without limitation  new construction and excess inventory of multifamily and single family housing  slow or negative employment growth  availability of low interest mortgages for single family home buyers and the potential for geopolitical instability  all of which are beyond the company s control 
in addition  various state and local municipalities are considering and may continue to consider rent control legislation which could limit our ability to raise rents 
finally  the federal government is considering and may continue to consider policies which may encourage home ownership  thus increasing competition and possibly limiting our ability to raise rents 
consequently  our cash flow and ability to service debt and make distributions to security holders could be reduced 
new acquisitions and or development projects may fail to perform as expected and competition for acquisitions may result in increased prices for properties we intend to actively acquire multifamily properties for rental operations as market conditions dictate 
the company does not currently intend to begin the development of any new wholly owned projects but has a substantial number of properties under development now and may commence new development activities if conditions warrant 
we may underestimate the costs necessary to bring an acquired property up to standards established for its intended market position or to complete a development property 
additionally  we expect that other major real estate investors with significant capital will compete with us for attractive investment opportunities or may also develop properties in markets where we focus our development efforts 
this competition may increase prices for multifamily properties 
we may not be in a position or have the opportunity in the future to make suitable property acquisitions on favorable terms 
to the extent that we do develop more properties if conditions warrant  we expect to do so ourselves in addition to co investing with our development partners 
the total number of development units  cost of development and estimated completion dates are subject to uncertainties arising from changing economic conditions such as the cost of labor and construction materials  competition and local government regulation 
because real estate investments are illiquid  we may not be able to sell properties when appropriate real estate investments generally cannot be sold quickly 
we may not be able to reconfigure our portfolio promptly in response to economic or other conditions 
this inability to respond promptly to changes in the performance of our investments could adversely affect our financial condition and ability to make distributions to our security holders 
changes in laws and litigation risk could affect our business we are generally not able to pass through to our residents under existing leases real estate or other federal  state or local taxes 
consequently  any such tax increases may adversely affect our financial condition and limit our ability to make distributions to our security holders 
similarly  changes that increase our potential liability under environmental laws or our expenditures on environmental compliance would adversely affect our cash flow and ability to make distributions on our securities 

table of contents we may become involved in legal proceedings  including but not limited to  proceedings related to consumer  employment  development  condominium conversion  tort and commercial legal issues that if decided adversely to or settled by us  could result in liability material to our financial condition or results of operations 
environmental problems are possible and can be costly federal  state and local laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment may require a current or previous owner or operator of real estate to investigate and clean up hazardous or toxic substances or petroleum product releases at such property 
the owner or operator may have to pay a governmental entity or third parties for property damage and for investigation and clean up costs incurred by such parties in connection with the contamination 
these laws typically impose clean up responsibility and liability without regard to whether the owner or operator knew of or caused the presence of the contaminants 
even if more than one person may have been responsible for the contamination  each person covered by the environmental laws may be held responsible for all of the clean up costs incurred 
in addition  third parties may sue the owner or operator of a site for damages and costs resulting from environmental contamination emanating from that site 
substantially all of our properties have been the subject of environmental assessments completed by qualified independent environmental consultant companies 
while these environmental assessments have not revealed  nor are we aware of  any environmental liability that our management believes would have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations  financial condition or liquidity  there can be no assurance that we will not incur such liabilities in the future 
over the past several years  there have been an increasing number of lawsuits against owners and managers of multifamily properties alleging personal injury and property damage caused by the presence of mold in residential real estate 
as some of these lawsuits have resulted in substantial monetary judgments or settlements  insurance carriers have reacted by excluding mold related claims from standard policies and pricing mold endorsements at prohibitively high rates 
we have adopted programs designed to minimize the existence of mold in any of our properties as well as guidelines for promptly addressing and resolving reports of mold to minimize any impact mold might have on our residents or the property 
we cannot be assured that existing environmental assessments of our properties reveal all environmental liabilities  that any prior owner of any of our properties did not create a material environmental condition not known to us  or that a material environmental condition does not otherwise exist as to any of our properties 
insurance policy deductibles and exclusions in order to manage insurance costs  management has gradually increased deductible and self insured retention amounts 
as of december   the company s property insurance policy provides for a per occurrence deductible of  and self insured retention of million per occurrence  subject to a maximum annual aggregate self insured retention of million  with approximately of any excess losses being covered by insurance 
any earthquake and named windstorm losses are subject to a deductible of of the values of the buildings involved in the losses and are not subject to the aggregate self insured retention 
the company s general liability and worker s compensation policies at december  provide for a million and million per occurrence deductible  respectively 
these higher deductible and self insured retention amounts do expose the company to greater potential uninsured losses  but management believes the savings in insurance premium expense justify this potential increased exposure over the long term 
as a result of the terrorist attacks of september   property insurance carriers created exclusions for losses from terrorism from our all risk property insurance policies 
as of december   the company was insured for million in terrorism insurance coverage  with a  deductible 
this coverage excludes losses from nuclear  biological and chemical attacks 
in the event of a terrorist attack impacting one or more of our properties  we could lose the revenues from the property  our capital investment in the property and possibly face liability claims from residents or others suffering injuries or losses 
the company believes  however  that the number of properties in and geographic diversity of its portfolio and its terrorism insurance coverage help to mitigate its exposure to the risks associated with potential terrorist attacks 

table of contents debt financing  preferred shares and preference interests and units could adversely affect our performance general please refer to item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  for the company s total debt and unsecured debt summaries as of december  in addition to debt  we have million of combined liquidation value of outstanding preferred shares of beneficial interest and preference units  with a weighted average dividend preference of per annum as of december  our use of debt and preferred equity financing creates certain risks  including the following disruptions in the financial markets could adversely affect our ability to obtain debt financing and impact our acquisitions and dispositions the united states capital and credit markets continue to experience significant dislocations and liquidity disruptions 
these circumstances have materially impacted liquidity in the debt markets  making financing terms for us less attractive  and resulted in the unavailability of certain types of debt financing 
if the capital and credit markets continue to experience volatility and the availability of funds remains limited  on unattractive terms or non existent  we will incur increased costs associated with issuing debt instruments 
in addition  it is possible that our ability to access the capital and credit markets may be limited or precluded by these or other factors at a time when we would like  or need  to do so  which would adversely impact our ability to refinance maturing debt and or react to changing economic and business conditions 
due to disruptions in the floating rate tax exempt bond market where the interest rates reset weekly and in the credit market s perception of fannie mae and freddie mac  which guaranty and provide liquidity for these bonds  we have experienced and could experience in the future an increase in interest rates on these debt obligations 
these bonds could also be put to our consolidated subsidiaries if fannie mae or freddie mac fail to satisfy their guaranty obligations 
while this obligation is in almost all cases non recourse to us  this could cause the company to have to repay these obligations on short notice or risk foreclosure actions on the collateralized assets 
furthermore  while we believe fannie mae and freddie mac will continue to provide liquidity to our sector  should they discontinue doing so  have their mandates changed or reduced or be disbanded by the government  it would significantly reduce our access to debt capital and or increase borrowing costs and would significantly reduce our sales of assets 
uncertainty in the credit markets could negatively impact our ability to make acquisitions and make it more difficult or not possible for us to sell properties or may adversely affect the price we receive for properties that we do sell  as prospective buyers may experience increased costs of debt financing or difficulties in obtaining debt financing 
potential continued disruptions in the financial markets could also have other unknown adverse effects on us or the economy generally and may cause the price of our common shares to fluctuate significantly and or to decline 
non performance by our counterparties could adversely affect our performance although we have not experienced any material counterparty non performance  the disruption in financial and credit markets could  among other things  impede the ability of our counterparties to perform on their contractual obligations 
there are multiple financial institutions that are individually committed to lend us varying amounts as part of our revolving credit facility 
should any of these institutions fail to fund their committed amounts when contractually required  our financial condition could be adversely affected 
should several of these institutions fail to fund  we could experience significant financial distress 
one of the financial institutions  with a commitment of million  has recently declared bankruptcy and it is unlikely that they would honor their financial commitment 
our borrowing capacity under the credit facility has in essence been permanently reduced to billion 
the company also has several assets under development with joint venture partners which were financed by financial institutions that are suffering varying degrees of distress 
if one or more of these lenders fail to fund when contractually required  the company or its joint venture partner may be unable to complete construction of its development properties 
in addition  the parent of one of the company s insurance providers has also experienced liquidity issues and while there has yet to be any non performance  should any occur it could negatively impact the company 
should any of our other major insurance providers experience similar financial or other distress  it could negatively impact the company 
finally  we are also party to various derivative contracts with a number of counterparties 
any failure of any of our counterparties to perform under these contracts could negatively impact us 

table of contents a significant downgrade in our credit ratings could adversely affect our performance a significant downgrade in our credit ratings  while not affecting our ability to draw proceeds under the revolving credit facility  would cause our borrowing costs to increase under the facility and also would impact our ability to borrow secured and unsecured debt by increasing borrowing costs  or otherwise limit our access to capital 
in addition  a downgrade below investment grade would require us to post cash collateral and or letters of credit in favor of some of our secured lenders to cover our self insured property and liability insurance deductibles 
scheduled debt payments could adversely affect our financial condition in the future  our cash flow could be insufficient to meet required payments of principal and interest or to pay distributions on our securities at expected levels 
we may not be able to refinance existing debt  including joint venture indebtedness which in virtually all cases requires substantial principal payments at maturity and  if we can  the terms of such refinancing might not be as favorable as the terms of existing indebtedness 
if principal payments due at maturity cannot be refinanced  extended or paid with proceeds of other capital transactions  such as new equity capital  our cash flow will not be sufficient in all years to repay all maturing debt 
as a result  certain of our other debt may cross default  we may be forced to postpone capital expenditures necessary for the maintenance of our properties  we may have to dispose of one or more properties on terms that would otherwise be unacceptable to us or we may be forced to allow the mortgage holder to foreclose on a property 
please refer to item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  for the company s debt maturity schedule as of december  financial covenants could adversely affect the company s financial condition if a property we own is mortgaged to secure debt and we are unable to meet the mortgage payments  the holder of the mortgage could foreclose on the property  resulting in loss of income and asset value 
foreclosure on mortgaged properties or an inability to refinance existing indebtedness would likely have a negative impact on our financial condition and results of operations 
the mortgages on our properties may contain customary negative covenants that  among other things  limit our ability  without the prior consent of the lender  to further mortgage the property and to reduce or change insurance coverage 
in addition  our unsecured credit facilities contain certain restrictions  requirements and other limitations on our ability to incur debt 
the indentures under which a substantial portion of our unsecured debt was issued also contain certain financial and operating covenants including  among other things  maintenance of certain financial ratios  as well as limitations on our ability to incur secured and unsecured debt including acquisition financing  and to sell all or substantially all of our assets 
our credit facilities and indentures are cross defaulted and also contain cross default provisions with other material debt 
the company believes it was in compliance with its unsecured public debt covenants for both the years ended december  and some of the properties were financed with tax exempt bonds that contain certain restrictive covenants or deed restrictions 
we have retained an independent outside consultant to monitor compliance with the restrictive covenants and deed restrictions that affect these properties 
if these bond compliance requirements restrict our ability to increase our rental rates to attract low or moderate income residents  or eligible qualified residents  then our income from these properties may be limited 
generally  we believe that the interest rate benefit attendant to properties with tax exempt bonds more than outweighs any loss of income due to restrictive covenants or deed restrictions 
our degree of leverage could limit our ability to obtain additional financing our consolidated debt to total market capitalization ratio was as of december  our degree of leverage could have important consequences to security holders 
for example  the degree of leverage could affect our ability to obtain additional financing in the future for working capital  capital expenditures  acquisitions  development or other general corporate purposes  making us more vulnerable to a downturn in business or the economy in general 
rising interest rates could adversely affect cash flow advances under our credit facilities bear interest at variable rates based upon libor at various interest periods  plus a spread dependent upon the operating partnership s credit rating  or based upon bids received from the 
table of contents lending group 
certain public issuances of our senior unsecured debt instruments may also  from time to time  bear interest at floating rates 
we may also borrow additional money with variable interest rates in the future 
increases in interest rates would increase our interest expense under these debt instruments and would increase the costs of refinancing existing debt and of issuing new debt 
accordingly  higher interest rates could adversely affect cash flow and our ability to service our debt and to make distributions to security holders 
we use interest rate hedging arrangements to manage our exposure to interest rate volatility  but these arrangements may expose us to additional risks  and no strategy can completely insulate us from risks associated with interest rate fluctuations 
there can be no assurance that our hedging arrangements will have the desired beneficial impact and may involve costs  such as transaction fees or breakage costs  if we terminate them 
we depend on our key personnel we depend on the efforts of the chairman of our board of trustees  samuel zell  and our executive officers  particularly david j 
neithercut  our president and chief executive officer 
if they resign or otherwise cease to be employed by us  our operations could be temporarily adversely affected 
mr 
zell has entered into retirement benefit and noncompetition agreements with the company 
in the event the chairman of the board and or the ceo are unable to serve  i the lead trustee will automatically be appointed to serve as the interim successor to the chairman  ii the chairman will automatically be appointed to serve as the interim successor to the ceo and iii the chair of the compensation committee of the board will immediately call a meeting of the committee to recommend to the full board the selection of a permanent replacement for either or both positions  as necessary 
control and influence by significant shareholders could be exercised in a manner adverse to other shareholders the consent of certain affiliates of mr 
zell is required for certain amendments to the fifth amended and restated agreement of limited partnership of the operating partnership the partnership agreement 
as a result of their security ownership and rights concerning amendments to the partnership agreement  the security holders referred to herein may have influence over the company 
although these security holders have not agreed to act together on any matter  they would be in a position to exercise even more influence over the company s affairs if they were to act together in the future 
this influence could conceivably be exercised in a manner that is inconsistent with the interests of other security holders 
for additional information regarding the security ownership of our trustees  including mr 
zell  and our executive officers  see the company s definitive proxy statement 
shareholders ability to effect changes in control of the company is limited provisions of our declaration of trust and bylaws could inhibit changes in control certain provisions of our declaration of trust and bylaws may delay or prevent a change in control of the company or other transactions that could provide the security holders with a premium over the then prevailing market price of their securities or which might otherwise be in the best interest of our security holders 
this includes the ownership limit described below 
while our existing preferred shares do not have these provisions  any future series of preferred shares may have certain voting provisions that could delay or prevent a change in control or other transactions that might otherwise be in the interest of our security holders 
in  we adopted amendments to our bylaws to expand the information required to be provided by any security holder  or persons acting in concert with such security holder  who proposes business or a nominee at an annual meeting of shareholders  including disclosure of information related to hedging activities and investment strategies with respect to our securities 
these amendments could delay or prevent a change in control or other transactions that might otherwise be in the interest of our security holders 
we have a share ownership limit for reit tax purposes to remain qualified as a reit for federal income tax purposes  not more than in value of our outstanding shares may be owned  directly or indirectly  by five or fewer individuals at any time during the last half of any year 
to facilitate maintenance of our reit qualification  our declaration of trust  subject to certain exceptions  prohibits ownership by any single shareholder of more than of the lesser of the number or value of the outstanding class of common or preferred shares 
we refer to this restriction as the ownership limit 
absent any exemption or waiver granted by our board of trustees  securities acquired or held in violation of the ownership limit will be transferred to a trust for the exclusive benefit of a designated charitable beneficiary  and the security holder s rights to distributions and to vote would terminate 
a transfer of shares may be void if it causes a person to violate the 
table of contents ownership limit 
the ownership limit could delay or prevent a change in control and  therefore  could adversely affect our security holders ability to realize a premium over the then prevailing market price for their shares 
to reduce the ability of the board to use the ownership limit as an anti takeover device  in the company amended the ownership limit to require  rather than permit  the board to grant a waiver of the ownership limit if the individual seeking a waiver demonstrates that such ownership would not jeopardize the company s status as a reit 
our preferred shares may affect changes in control our declaration of trust authorizes the board of trustees to issue up to million preferred shares  and to establish the preferences and rights including the right to vote and the right to convert into common shares of any preferred shares issued 
the board of trustees may use its powers to issue preferred shares and to set the terms of such securities to delay or prevent a change in control of the company  even if a change in control were in the interest of security holders 
inapplicability of maryland law limiting certain changes in control certain provisions of maryland law applicable to real estate investment trusts prohibit business combinations including certain issuances of equity securities with any person who beneficially owns ten percent or more of the voting power of outstanding securities  or with an affiliate who  at any time within the two year period prior to the date in question  was the beneficial owner of ten percent or more of the voting power of the company s outstanding voting securities an interested shareholder  or with an affiliate of an interested shareholder 
these prohibitions last for five years after the most recent date on which the interested shareholder became an interested shareholder 
after the five year period  a business combination with an interested shareholder must be approved by two super majority shareholder votes unless  among other conditions  holders of common shares receive a minimum price for their shares and the consideration is received in cash or in the same form as previously paid by the interested shareholder for its common shares 
as permitted by maryland law  however  the board of trustees of the company has opted out of these restrictions with respect to any business combination involving mr 
zell and certain of his affiliates and persons acting in concert with them 
consequently  the five year prohibition and the super majority vote requirements will not apply to a business combination involving us and or any of them 
such business combinations may not be in the best interest of our security holders 
our success as a reit is dependent on compliance with federal income tax requirements our failure to qualify as a reit would have serious adverse consequences to our security holders we believe that we have qualified for taxation as a reit for federal income tax purposes since our taxable year ended december  based  in part  upon opinions of tax counsel received whenever we have issued equity securities or engaged in significant merger transactions 
we plan to continue to meet the requirements for taxation as a reit 
many of these requirements  however  are highly technical and complex 
we cannot  therefore  guarantee that we have qualified or will qualify in the future as a reit 
the determination that we are a reit requires an analysis of various factual matters that may not be totally within our control 
for example  to qualify as a reit  our gross income must generally come from rental and other real estate or passive related sources that are itemized in the reit tax laws 
we are also required to distribute to security holders at least of our reit taxable income excluding capital gains 
the fact that we hold our assets through erp operating limited partnership and its subsidiaries further complicates the application of the reit requirements 
even a technical or inadvertent mistake could jeopardize our reit status 
furthermore  congress and the irs might make changes to the tax laws and regulations  and the courts might issue new rulings that make it more difficult  or impossible  for us to remain qualified as a reit 
we do not believe  however  that any pending or proposed tax law changes would jeopardize our reit status 
in addition  congress and the irs have recently liberalized the reit qualification rules to permit reit s in certain circumstances to pay a monetary penalty for inadvertent mistakes rather than lose reit status 
if we fail to qualify as a reit  we would be subject to federal income tax at regular corporate rates 
also  unless the irs granted us relief under certain statutory provisions  we would remain disqualified as a reit for four years following the year we first failed to qualify 
if we fail to qualify as a reit  we would have to pay significant income taxes 
we  therefore  would have less money available for investments or for distributions to security holders 
this would likely have a significant adverse effect on the value of our securities 
in addition  we would no longer be required to make any distributions to security holders 
even if we qualify as a reit  we are and will continue to be subject to certain federal  state and local taxes on our income and property 
in addition  our corporate housing business and condominium conversion business  which are conducted through taxable reit subsidiaries  generally will be subject to federal income tax at regular corporate rates to the extent they have taxable income 

table of contents we could be disqualified as a reit or have to pay taxes if our merger partners did not qualify as reits if any of our prior merger partners had failed to qualify as a reit throughout the duration of their existence  then they might have had undistributed c corporation earnings and profits at the time of their merger with us 
if that was the case and we did not distribute those earnings and profits prior to the end of the year in which the merger took place  we might not qualify as a reit 
we believe based  in part  upon opinions of legal counsel received pursuant to the terms of our merger agreements as well as our own investigations  among other things  that each of our prior merger partners qualified as a reit and that  in any event  none of them had any undistributed c corporation earnings and profits at the time of their merger with us 
if any of our prior merger partners failed to qualify as a reit  an additional concern would be that they would have recognized taxable gain at the time they merged with us 
we would be liable for the tax on such gain 
in this event  we could have to pay corporate income tax on any gain existing at the time of the applicable merger on assets acquired in the merger if the assets are sold within ten years of the merger 
finally  we could be precluded from electing reit status for up to four years after the year in which the predecessor entity failed to qualify for reit status 
compliance with reit distribution requirements may affect our financial condition distribution requirements may increase the indebtedness of the company we may be required from time to time  under certain circumstances  to accrue as income for tax purposes interest and rent earned but not yet received 
in such event  or upon our repayment of principal on debt  we could have taxable income without sufficient cash to enable us to meet the distribution requirements of a reit 
accordingly  we could be required to borrow funds or liquidate investments on adverse terms in order to meet these distribution requirements 
tax elections regarding distributions may impact future liquidity of the company during  we did make  and under certain circumstances may consider making again in the future  a tax election to treat future distributions to shareholders as distributions in the current year 
this election  which is provided for in the reit tax code  may allow us to avoid increasing our dividends or paying additional income taxes in the current year 
however  this could result in a constraint on our ability to decrease our dividends in future years without creating risk of either violating the reit distribution requirements or generating additional income tax liability 
federal income tax considerations general the following discussion summarizes the federal income tax considerations material to a holder of common shares 
it is not exhaustive of all possible tax considerations 
for example  it does not give a detailed discussion of any state  local or foreign tax considerations 
the following discussion also does not address all tax matters that may be relevant to prospective shareholders in light of their particular circumstances 
moreover  it does not address all tax matters that may be relevant to shareholders who are subject to special treatment under the tax laws  such as insurance companies  tax exempt entities  financial institutions or broker dealers  foreign corporations and persons who are not citizens or residents of the united states 
the specific tax attributes of a particular shareholder could have a material impact on the tax considerations associated with the purchase  ownership and disposition of common shares 
therefore  it is essential that each prospective shareholder consult with his or her own tax advisors with regard to the application of the federal income tax laws to the shareholder s personal tax situation  as well as any tax consequences arising under the laws of any state  local or foreign taxing jurisdiction 
the information in this section is based on the current internal revenue code  current  temporary and proposed treasury regulations  the legislative history of the internal revenue code  current administrative interpretations and practices of the internal revenue service  including its practices and policies as set forth in private letter rulings  which are not binding on the internal revenue service  and existing court decisions 
future legislation  regulations  administrative interpretations and court decisions could change current law or adversely affect existing interpretations of current law 
any change could apply retroactively 
thus  it is possible that the internal revenue service could challenge the statements in this discussion  which do not bind the internal revenue service or the courts  and that a court could agree with the internal revenue service 

table of contents our taxation we elected reit status beginning with the year that ended december  in any year in which we qualify as a reit  we generally will not be subject to federal income tax on the portion of our reit taxable income or capital gain that we distribute to our shareholders 
this treatment substantially eliminates the double taxation that applies to most corporations  which pay a tax on their income and then distribute dividends to shareholders who are in turn taxed on the amount they receive 
we elected taxable reit subsidiary status for certain of our corporate subsidiaries  primarily those engaged in condominium conversion and sale activities 
as a result  we will be subject to federal income taxes for activities performed by our taxable reit subsidiaries 
we will be subject to federal income tax at regular corporate rates upon our reit taxable income or capital gain that we do not distribute to our shareholders 
in addition  we will be subject to a excise tax if we do not satisfy specific reit distribution requirements 
we could also be subject to the alternative minimum tax on our items of tax preference 
in addition  any net income from prohibited transactions ie  dispositions of property  other than property held by a taxable reit subsidiary  held primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of business will be subject to a tax 
we could also be subject to a penalty tax on certain payments received from or on certain expenses deducted by a taxable reit subsidiary if any such transaction is not respected by the internal revenue service 
if we fail to satisfy the gross income test or the gross income test described below but have maintained our qualification as a reit because we satisfied certain other requirements  we will still generally be subject to a penalty tax on the taxable income attributable to the gross income that caused the income test failure 
if we fail to satisfy any of the reit asset tests described below by more than a de minimis amount  due to reasonable cause  and we nonetheless maintain our reit qualification because of specified cure provisions  we will be required to pay a tax equal to the greater of  or the highest marginal corporate tax rate multiplied by the net income generated by the non qualifying assets 
if we fail to satisfy any provision of the internal revenue code that would result in our failure to qualify as a reit other than a violation of the reit gross income or asset tests described below and the violation is due to reasonable cause  we may retain our reit qualification but we will be required to pay a penalty of  for each such failure 
moreover  we may be subject to taxes in certain situations and on certain transactions that we do not presently contemplate 
we believe that we have qualified as a reit for all of our taxable years beginning with we also believe that our current structure and method of operation is such that we will continue to qualify as a reit 
however  given the complexity of the reit qualification requirements  we cannot provide any assurance that the actual results of our operations have satisfied or will satisfy the requirements under the internal revenue code for a particular year 
if we fail to qualify for taxation as a reit in any taxable year and the relief provisions described herein do not apply  we will be subject to tax on our taxable income at regular corporate rates 
we also may be subject to the corporate alternative minimum tax 
as a result  our failure to qualify as a reit would significantly reduce the cash we have available to distribute to our shareholders 
unless entitled to statutory relief  we would not be able to re elect to be taxed as a reit until our fifth taxable year after the year of disqualification 
it is not possible to state whether we would be entitled to statutory relief 
our qualification and taxation as a reit depend on our ability to satisfy various requirements under the internal revenue code 
we are required to satisfy these requirements on a continuing basis through actual annual operating and other results 
accordingly  there can be no assurance that we will be able to continue to operate in a manner so as to remain qualified as a reit 
ownership of taxable reit subsidiaries by us 
the internal revenue code provides that reits may own greater than ten percent of the voting power and value of the securities of taxable reit subsidiaries or trss  which are corporations subject to tax as a regular c corporation that have elected  jointly with a reit  to be a trs 
generally  a taxable reit subsidiary may own assets that cannot otherwise be owned by a reit and can perform impermissible tenant services discussed below  which would otherwise taint our rental income under the reit income tests 
however  the reit will be obligated to pay a penalty tax on some payments that we receive or on certain expenses deducted by our trss if the economic arrangements between us  our tenants and the trs are not comparable to similar arrangements among unrelated parties 
a trs may also receive income from prohibited transactions without incurring the federal income tax liability imposed on reits 
income from prohibited transactions may include the purchase and sale of land  the purchase and sale of completed development properties and the sale of condominium units 

table of contents trss pay federal and state income tax at the full applicable corporate rates 
the amount of taxes paid on impermissible tenant services income and the sale of real estate held primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of business may be material in amount 
the trss will attempt to reduce  if possible  the amount of these taxes  but we cannot guarantee whether  or the extent to which  measures taken to reduce these taxes will be successful 
to the extent that these companies are required to pay taxes  less cash may be available for distributions to shareholders 
share ownership test and organizational requirement 
in order to qualify as a reit  our shares of beneficial interest must be held by a minimum of persons for at least days of a taxable year that is months  or during a proportionate part of a taxable year of less than months 
also  not more than in value of our shares of beneficial interest may be owned directly or indirectly by applying certain constructive ownership rules  by five or fewer individuals during the last half of each taxable year 
in addition  we must meet certain other organizational requirements  including  but not limited to  that i the beneficial ownership in us is evidenced by transferable shares and ii we are managed by one or more trustees 
we believe that we have satisfied all of these tests and all other organizational requirements and that we will continue to do so in the future 
in order to ensure compliance with the person test and the share ownership test discussed above  we have placed certain restrictions on the transfer of our shares that are intended to prevent further concentration of share ownership 
however  such restrictions may not prevent us from failing these requirements  and thereby failing to qualify as a reit 
gross income tests 
to qualify as a reit  we must satisfy two gross income tests at least of our gross income for each taxable year must be derived directly or indirectly from rents from real property  investments in real estate and or real estate mortgages  dividends paid by another reit and from some types of temporary investments excluding certain hedging income 
at least of our gross income for each taxable year must be derived from any combination of income qualifying under the test and dividends  non real estate mortgage interest and gain from the sale or disposition of stock or securities excluding certain hedging income 
to qualify as rents from real property for the purpose of satisfying the gross income tests  rental payments must generally be received from unrelated persons and not be based on the net income of the resident 
also  the rent attributable to personal property must not exceed of the total rent 
we may generally provide services to residents without tainting our rental income only if such services are usually or customarily rendered in connection with the rental of real property and not otherwise considered impermissible services 
if such services are impermissible  then we may generally provide them only if they are considered de minimis in amount  or are provided through an independent contractor from whom we derive no revenue and that meets other requirements  or through a taxable reit subsidiary 
we believe that services provided to residents by us either are usually or customarily rendered in connection with the rental of real property and not otherwise considered impermissible  or  if considered impermissible services  will meet the de minimis test or will be provided by an independent contractor or taxable reit subsidiary 
however  we cannot provide any assurance that the internal revenue service will agree with these positions 
if we fail to satisfy one or both of the gross income tests for any taxable year  we may nevertheless qualify as a reit for the year if we are entitled to relief under certain provisions of the internal revenue code 
in this case  a penalty tax would still be applicable as discussed above 
generally  it is not possible to state whether in all circumstances we would be entitled to the benefit of these relief provisions and in the event these relief provisions do not apply  we will not qualify as a reit 
asset tests 
in general  at the close of each quarter of our taxable year  we must satisfy four tests relating to the nature of our assets at least of the value of our total assets must be represented by real estate assets which include for this purpose shares in other real estate investment trusts and certain cash related items  not more than of the value of our total assets may be represented by securities other than those in the asset class  except for securities includable in item above  equity investments in other reits  qualified reit subsidiaries ie  corporations owned by a reit that are not trss or reits  or taxable reit subsidiaries a the value of any one issuer s securities owned by us may not exceed of the value of our total assets and b we may not own securities representing more than of the voting power or value of the outstanding securities of any one issuer  and not more than for taxable years beginning after december  of the value of our total assets may be represented by securities of one or more taxable reit subsidiaries 

table of contents the value test described in clause b above does not apply to certain securities that fall within a safe harbor under the code 
under the safe harbor  the following are not considered securities held by us for purposes of this value test i straight debt securities  ii any loan of an individual or an estate  iii certain rental agreements for the use of tangible property  iv any obligation to pay rents from real property  v any security issued by a state or any political subdivision thereof  foreign government or puerto rico only if the determination of any payment under such security is not based on the profits of another entity or payments on any obligation issued by such other entity  or vi any security issued by a reit 
the timing and payment of interest or principal on a security qualifying as straight debt may be subject to a contingency provided that a such contingency does not change the effective yield to maturity  not considering a de minimis change which does not exceed the greater of of or of the annual yield to maturity or we own  or less of the aggregate issue price or value of the particular issuer s debt and not more than months of unaccrued interest can be required to be prepaid or b the contingency is consistent with commercial practice and the contingency is effective upon a default or the exercise of a prepayment right by the issuer of the debt 
if we hold indebtedness from any issuer  including a reit  the indebtedness will be subject to  and may cause a violation of  the asset tests  unless it is a qualifying real estate asset or otherwise satisfies the above safe harbor 
we currently own equity interests in certain entities that have elected to be taxed as reits for federal income tax purposes and are not publicly traded 
if any such entity were to fail to qualify as a reit  we would not meet the voting stock limitation and the value limitation and we would  unless certain relief provisions applied  fail to qualify as a reit 
we believe that we and each of the reits we own an interest in have and will comply with the foregoing asset tests for reit qualification 
however  we cannot provide any assurance that the internal revenue service will agree with our determinations 
if we fail to satisfy the or asset tests described above after a day cure period provided in the internal revenue code  we will be deemed to have met such tests if the value of our non qualifying assets is de minimis ie  does not exceed the lesser of of the total value of our assets at the end of the applicable quarter or  and we dispose of the non qualifying assets within six months after the last day of the quarter in which the failure to satisfy the asset tests is discovered 
for violations due to reasonable cause and not willful neglect that are in excess of the de minimis exception described above  we may avoid disqualification as a reit under any of the asset tests  after the day cure period  by disposing of sufficient assets to meet the asset test within such six month period  paying a tax equal to the greater of  or the highest corporate tax rate multiplied by the net income generated by the non qualifying assets and disclosing certain information to the internal revenue service 
if we cannot avail ourselves of these relief provisions  or if we fail to timely cure any noncompliance with the asset tests  we would cease to qualify as a reit 
annual distribution requirements 
to qualify as a reit  we are generally required to distribute dividends  other than capital gain dividends  to our shareholders each year in an amount at least equal to of our reit taxable income 
these distributions must be paid either in the taxable year to which they relate  or in the following taxable year if declared before we timely file our tax return for the prior year and if paid with or before the first regular dividend payment date after the declaration is made 
we intend to make timely distributions sufficient to satisfy our annual distribution requirements 
to the extent that we do not distribute all of our net capital gain or distribute at least  but less than of our reit taxable income  as adjusted  we are subject to tax on these amounts at regular corporate rates 
we will be subject to a excise tax on the excess of the required distribution over the sum of amounts actually distributed and amounts retained for which federal income tax was paid  if we fail to distribute during each calendar year at least the sum of of our reit ordinary income for the year  of our reit capital gain net income for the year  and any undistributed taxable income from prior taxable years 
a reit may elect to retain rather than distribute all or a portion of its net capital gains and pay the tax on the gains 
in that case  a reit may elect to have its shareholders include their proportionate share of the undistributed net capital gains in income as long term capital gains and receive a credit for their share of the tax paid by the reit 
for purposes of the excise tax described above  any retained amounts would be treated as having been distributed 
ownership of partnership interests by us 
as a result of our ownership of the operating partnership  we will be considered to own and derive our proportionate share of the assets and items of income of the operating partnership  respectively  for purposes of the reit asset and income tests  including its share of assets and items of income of any subsidiaries that are partnerships or limited liability companies 
state and local taxes 
we may be subject to state or local taxation in various jurisdictions  including those in which we transact business or reside 
our state and local tax treatment may not conform to the federal income tax treatment discussed above 
consequently  prospective shareholders should consult their own tax advisors regarding the effect of state and local tax laws on an investment in common shares 

table of contents taxation of domestic shareholders subject to us tax general 
if we qualify as a reit  distributions made to our taxable domestic shareholders with respect to their common shares  other than capital gain distributions and distributions attributable to taxable reit subsidiaries  will be treated as ordinary income to the extent that the distributions come out of earnings and profits 
these distributions will not be eligible for the dividends received deduction for shareholders that are corporations nor will they constitute qualified dividend income under the internal revenue code  meaning that such dividends will be taxed at marginal rates applicable to ordinary income rather than the special capital gain rates currently applicable to qualified dividend income distributed to shareholders who satisfy applicable holding period requirements 
in determining whether distributions are out of earnings and profits  we will allocate our earnings and profits first to preferred shares and second to the common shares 
the portion of ordinary dividends which represent ordinary dividends we receive from a trs  will be designated as qualified dividend income to reit shareholders and are eligible for preferential tax rates if paid to our non corporate shareholders 
to the extent we make distributions to our taxable domestic shareholders in excess of our earnings and profits  such distributions will be considered a return of capital 
such distributions will be treated as a tax free distribution and will reduce the tax basis of a shareholder s common shares by the amount of the distribution so treated 
to the extent such distributions cumulatively exceed a taxable domestic shareholder s tax basis  such distributions are taxable as a gain from the sale of shares 
shareholders may not include in their individual income tax returns any of our net operating losses or capital losses 
dividends declared by a reit in october  november  or december are deemed to have been paid by the reit and received by its shareholders on december of that year  so long as the dividends are actually paid during january of the following year 
however  this treatment only applies to the extent of the reit s earnings and profits existing on december to the extent the shareholder distribution paid in january exceeds available earnings and profits as of december  the excess will be treated as a distribution taxable to shareholders in the year paid 
as such  for tax reporting purposes  january distributions paid to our shareholders may be split between two tax years 
distributions made by us that we properly designate as capital gain dividends will be taxable to taxable domestic shareholders as gain from the sale or exchange of a capital asset held for more than one year 
this treatment applies only to the extent that the designated distributions do not exceed our actual net capital gain for the taxable year 
it applies regardless of the period for which a domestic shareholder has held his or her common shares 
despite this general rule  corporate shareholders may be required to treat up to of certain capital gain dividends as ordinary income 
generally  we will classify a portion of our designated capital gain dividends as a rate gain distribution and the remaining portion as an unrecaptured section gain distribution 
a rate gain distribution would be taxable to taxable domestic shareholders that are individuals  estates or trusts at a maximum rate of 
an unrecaptured section gain distribution would be taxable to taxable domestic shareholders that are individuals  estates or trusts at a maximum rate of 
if  for any taxable year  we elect to designate as capital gain dividends any portion of the dividends paid or made available for the year to holders of all classes of shares of beneficial interest  then the portion of the capital gains dividends that will be allocable to the holders of common shares will be the total capital gain dividends multiplied by a fraction 
the numerator of the fraction will be the total dividends paid or made available to the holders of the common shares for the year 
the denominator of the fraction will be the total dividends paid or made available to holders of all classes of shares of beneficial interest 
we may elect to retain rather than distribute as is generally required net capital gain for a taxable year and pay the income tax on that gain 
if we make this election  shareholders must include in income  as long term capital gain  their proportionate share of the undistributed net capital gain 
shareholders will be treated as having paid their proportionate share of the tax paid by us on these gains 
accordingly  they will receive a tax credit or refund for the amount 
shareholders will increase the basis in their common shares by the difference between the amount of capital gain included in their income and the amount of the tax they are treated as having paid 
our earnings and profits will be adjusted appropriately 
in general  a shareholder will recognize gain or loss for federal income tax purposes on the sale or other disposition of common shares in an amount equal to the difference between 
table of contents a the amount of cash and the fair market value of any property received in the sale or other disposition  and b the shareholder s adjusted tax basis in the common shares 
the gain or loss will be capital gain or loss if the common shares were held as a capital asset 
generally  the capital gain or loss will be long term capital gain or loss if the common shares were held for more than one year 
in general  a loss recognized by a shareholder upon the sale of common shares that were held for six months or less  determined after applying certain holding period rules  will be treated as long term capital loss to the extent that the shareholder received distributions that were treated as long term capital gains 
for shareholders who are individuals  trusts and estates  the long term capital loss will be apportioned among the applicable long term capital gain rates to the extent that distributions received by the shareholder were previously so treated 
taxation of domestic tax exempt shareholders most tax exempt organizations are not subject to federal income tax except to the extent of their unrelated business taxable income  which is often referred to as ubti 
unless a tax exempt shareholder holds its common shares as debt financed property or uses the common shares in an unrelated trade or business  distributions to the shareholder should not constitute ubti 
similarly  if a tax exempt shareholder sells common shares  the income from the sale should not constitute ubti unless the shareholder held the shares as debt financed property or used the shares in a trade or business 
however  for tax exempt shareholders that are social clubs  voluntary employee benefit associations  supplemental unemployment benefit trusts  and qualified group legal services plans  income from owning or selling common shares will constitute ubti unless the organization is able to properly deduct amounts set aside or placed in reserve so as to offset the income generated by its investment in common shares 
these shareholders should consult their own tax advisors concerning these set aside and reserve requirements which are set forth in the internal revenue code 
in addition  certain pension trusts that own more than of a pension held reit must report a portion of the distributions that they receive from the reit as ubti 
we have not been and do not expect to be treated as a pension held reit for purposes of this rule 
taxation of foreign shareholders the following is a discussion of certain anticipated united states federal income tax consequences of the ownership and disposition of common shares applicable to a foreign shareholder 
for purposes of this discussion  a foreign shareholder is any person other than a a citizen or resident of the united states  b a corporation or partnership created or organized in the united states or under the laws of the united states or of any state thereof  or c an estate or trust whose income is includable in gross income for united states federal income tax purposes regardless of its source 
distributions by us 
distributions by us to a foreign shareholder that are neither attributable to gain from sales or exchanges by us of united states real property interests nor designated by us as capital gains dividends will be treated as dividends of ordinary income to the extent that they are made out of our earnings and profits 
these distributions ordinarily will be subject to withholding of united states federal income tax on a gross basis at a rate  or a lower treaty rate  unless the dividends are treated as effectively connected with the conduct by the foreign shareholder of a united states trade or business 
please note that under certain treaties lower withholding rates generally applicable to dividends do not apply to dividends from reits 
dividends that are effectively connected with a united states trade or business will be subject to tax on a net basis at graduated rates  and are generally not subject to withholding 
certification and disclosure requirements must be satisfied before a dividend is exempt from withholding under this exemption 
a foreign shareholder that is a corporation also may be subject to an additional branch profits tax at a rate or a lower treaty rate 

table of contents we expect to withhold united states income tax at the rate of on any distributions made to a foreign shareholder unless a a lower treaty rate applies and any required form or certification evidencing eligibility for that reduced rate is filed with us  or b the foreign shareholder files an irs form w eci with us claiming that the distribution is effectively connected income 
a distribution in excess of our current or accumulated earnings and profits will not be taxable to a foreign shareholder to the extent that the distribution does not exceed the adjusted basis of the shareholder s common shares 
instead  the distribution will reduce the adjusted basis of the common shares 
to the extent that the distribution exceeds the adjusted basis of the common shares  it will give rise to gain from the sale or exchange of the shareholder s common shares 
the tax treatment of this gain is described below 
we intend to withhold at a rate of  or a lower applicable treaty rate  on the entire amount of any distribution not designated as a capital gain distribution 
in such event  a foreign shareholder may seek a refund of the withheld amount from the irs if it is subsequently determined that the distribution was  in fact  in excess of our earnings and profits  and the amount withheld exceeded the foreign shareholder s united states tax liability with respect to the distribution 
any capital gain dividend with respect to any class of our stock which is regularly traded on an established securities market  will be treated as an ordinary dividend described above  if the foreign shareholder did not own more than of such class of stock at any time during the one year period ending on the date of the distribution 
foreign shareholders generally will not be required to report distributions received from us on us federal income tax returns and all distributions treated as dividends for us federal income tax purposes  including any capital gain dividends  will be subject to a us withholding tax unless reduced or eliminated under an applicable income tax treaty  as described above 
in addition  the branch profits tax will no longer apply to such distributions 
distributions to a foreign shareholder that we designate at the time of the distributions as capital gain dividends  other than those arising from the disposition of a united states real property interest  generally will not be subject to united states federal income taxation unless a the investment in the common shares is effectively connected with the foreign shareholder s united states trade or business  in which case the foreign shareholder will be subject to the same treatment as domestic shareholders  except that a shareholder that is a foreign corporation may also be subject to the branch profits tax  as discussed above  or b the foreign shareholder is a nonresident alien individual who is present in the united states for days or more during the taxable year and has a tax home in the united states  in which case the nonresident alien individual will be subject to a tax on the individual s capital gains 
except as described above  under the foreign investment in real property tax act  which is known as firpta  distributions to a foreign shareholder that are attributable to gain from sales or exchanges of united states real property interests will cause the foreign shareholder to be treated as recognizing the gain as income effectively connected with a united states trade or business 
this rule applies whether or not a distribution is designated as a capital gain dividend 
accordingly  foreign shareholders generally would be taxed on these distributions at the same rates applicable to us shareholders  subject to a special alternative minimum tax in the case of nonresident alien individuals 
in addition  a foreign corporate shareholder might be subject to the branch profits tax discussed above  as well as us federal income tax return filing requirements 
we are required to withhold of these distributions 
the withheld amount can be credited against the foreign shareholder s united states federal income tax liability 
although the law is not entirely clear on the matter  it appears that amounts we designate as undistributed capital gains in respect of the common shares held by us shareholders would be treated with respect to foreign shareholders in the same manner as actual distributions of capital gain dividends 
under that approach  foreign shareholders would be able to offset as a credit against the united states federal income tax liability their proportionate share of the tax paid by us on these undistributed capital gains 
in addition  foreign shareholders would be able to receive from the irs a refund to the extent their proportionate share of the tax paid by us were to exceed their actual united states federal income tax liability 

table of contents foreign shareholders sales of common shares 
gain recognized by a foreign shareholder upon the sale or exchange of common shares generally will not be subject to united states taxation unless the shares constitute a united states real property interest within the meaning of firpta 
the common shares will not constitute a united states real property interest so long as we are a domestically controlled reit 
a domestically controlled reit is a reit in which at all times during a specified testing period less than in value of its stock is held directly or indirectly by foreign shareholders 
we believe that we are a domestically controlled reit 
therefore  we believe that the sale of common shares will not be subject to taxation under firpta 
however  because common shares and preferred shares are publicly traded  we cannot guarantee that we will continue to be a domestically controlled reit 
in any event  gain from the sale or exchange of common shares not otherwise subject to firpta will be subject to us tax  if either a the investment in the common shares is effectively connected with the foreign shareholder s united states trade or business  in which case the foreign shareholder will be subject to the same treatment as domestic shareholders with respect to the gain  or b the foreign shareholder is a nonresident alien individual who is present in the united states for days or more during the taxable year and has a tax home in the united states  in which case the nonresident alien individual will be subject to a tax on the individual s capital gains 
even if we do not qualify as or cease to be a domestically controlled reit  gain arising from the sale or exchange by a foreign shareholder of common shares still would not be subject to united states taxation under firpta as a sale of a united states real property interest if a the class or series of shares being sold is regularly traded  as defined by applicable irs regulations  on an established securities market such as the new york stock exchange  and b the selling foreign shareholder owned or less of the value of the outstanding class or series of shares being sold throughout the five year period ending on the date of the sale or exchange 
if gain on the sale or exchange of common shares were subject to taxation under firpta  the foreign shareholder would be subject to regular united states income tax with respect to the gain in the same manner as a taxable us shareholder  subject to any applicable alternative minimum tax  a special alternative minimum tax in the case of nonresident alien individuals and the possible application of the branch profits tax in the case of foreign corporations 
the purchaser of the common shares would be required to withhold and remit to the irs of the purchase price 
information reporting requirement and backup withholding we will report to our domestic shareholders and the internal revenue service the amount of distributions paid during each calendar year and the amount of tax withheld  if any 
under certain circumstances  domestic shareholders may be subject to backup withholding 
backup withholding will apply only if such domestic shareholder fails to furnish certain information to us or the internal revenue service 
backup withholding will not apply with respect to payments made to certain exempt recipients  such as corporations and tax exempt organizations 
domestic shareholders should consult their own tax advisors regarding their qualification for exemption from backup withholding and the procedure for obtaining such an exemption 
backup withholding is not an additional tax 
rather  the amount of any backup withholding with respect to a payment to a domestic shareholder will be allowed as a credit against such person s united states federal income tax liability and may entitle such person to a refund  provided that the required information is timely furnished to the internal revenue service

table of contents item legal proceedings the company is party to a housing discrimination lawsuit brought by a non profit civil rights organization in april in the us district court for the district of maryland 
the suit alleges that the company designed and built approximately of its properties in violation of the accessibility requirements of the fair housing act and americans with disabilities act 
the suit seeks actual and punitive damages  injunctive relief including modification of non compliant properties  costs and attorneys fees 
the company believes it has a number of viable defenses  including that a majority of the named properties were completed before the operative dates of the statutes in question and or were not designed or built by the company 
accordingly  the company is defending the suit vigorously 
due to the pendency of the company s defenses and the uncertainty of many other critical factual and legal issues  it is not possible to determine or predict the outcome of the suit and as a result  no amounts have been accrued at december   while no assurances can be given  the company does not believe that the suit  if adversely determined  would have a material adverse effect on the company

adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures will be calculated to reflect funds from operations on the same basis 
the april white paper states that gain or loss on sales of property is excluded from ffo for previously depreciated operating properties only 
once the company commences the conversion of units to condominiums  it simultaneously discontinues depreciation of such property 
ffo available to common shares and op units is calculated on a basis consistent with net income available to common shares and reflects adjustments to net income for preferred distributions and premiums on redemption of preferred shares in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states

see item for a reconciliation of net income to ffo and ffo available to common shares and op units 
the company believes that ffo and ffo available to common shares and op units are helpful to investors as supplemental measures of the operating performance of a real estate company  because they are recognized measures of performance by the real estate industry and by excluding gains or losses related to dispositions of depreciable property and excluding real estate depreciation which can vary among owners of identical assets in similar condition based on historical cost accounting and useful life estimates  ffo and ffo available to common shares and op units can help compare the operating performance of a company s real estate between periods or as compared to different companies 
ffo and ffo available to common shares and op units do not represent net income  net income available to common shares or net cash flows from operating activities in accordance with gaap 
therefore  ffo and ffo available to common shares and op units should not be exclusively considered as alternatives to net income  net income available to common shares or net cash flows from operating activities as determined by gaap or as measures of liquidity 
the company s calculation of ffo and ffo available to common shares and op units may differ from other real estate companies due to  among other items  variations in cost capitalization policies for capital expenditures and  accordingly  may not be comparable to such other real estate companies

the company does not currently intend to begin the development of any new wholly owned projects but has a substantial number of properties under development now and may commence new development activities if conditions warrant 
we may underestimate the costs necessary to bring an acquired property up to standards established for its intended market position or to complete a development property 
additionally  we expect that other major real estate investors with significant capital will compete with us for attractive investment opportunities or may also develop properties in markets where we focus our development efforts 
this competition may increase prices for multifamily properties

overview equity residential eqr  a maryland real estate investment trust reit formed in march  is an s p company focused on the acquisition  development and management of high quality apartment properties in top united states growth markets 
eqr has elected to be taxed as a reit 
the company is one of the largest publicly traded real estate companies and is the largest publicly traded owner of multifamily properties in the united states based on the aggregate market value of its outstanding common shares  the number of apartment units wholly owned and total revenues earned 
the company s corporate headquarters are located in chicago  illinois and the company also operates property management offices throughout the united states 
as of february   the company has approximately  employees who provide real estate operations  leasing  legal  financial  accounting  acquisition  disposition  development and other support functions 
eqr is the general partner of  and as of december  owned an approximate ownership interest in  erp operating limited partnership  an illinois limited partnership the operating partnership 
the company is structured as an umbrella partnership reit upreit under which all property ownership and related business operations are conducted through the operating partnership and its subsidiaries 
references to the company include eqr  the operating partnership and those entities owned or controlled by the operating partnership and or eqr 
business objectives and operating strategies the company seeks to maximize current income  capital appreciation of each property and the total return for its shareholders 
the company s strategy for accomplishing these objectives includes leveraging our size and scale in four critical ways investing in apartment communities located in strategically targeted markets to maximize our total return on an enterprise level  meeting the needs of our residents by offering a wide array of product choices and a commitment to service  engaging  retaining and attracting the best employees by providing them with the education  resources and opportunities to succeed  and sharing resources  customers and best practices in property management and across the enterprise 
owning a highly diversified portfolio by investing in target markets defined by a combination of the following criteria high barrier to entry low supply  strong economic predictors high demand  and attractive quality of life high demand and retention 
giving residents reasons to stay with the company by providing a range of product options available in our diversified portfolio and by enhancing their experience through our employees and our services 
being open and responsive to market realities to take advantage of investment opportunities that align with our long term vision 
acquisition  development and disposition strategies the company anticipates that future property acquisitions  developments and dispositions will occur within the united states 
acquisitions and developments may be financed from various sources of capital  which may include retained cash flow  issuance of additional equity and debt securities  sales of properties  joint venture agreements and collateralized and uncollateralized borrowings 
in addition  the company may acquire properties in transactions that include the issuance of limited partnership interests in the operating partnership op units as consideration for the 
table of contents acquired properties 
such transactions may  in certain circumstances  enable the sellers to defer  in whole or in part  the recognition of taxable income or gain that might otherwise result from the sales 
eqr may also acquire land parcels to hold and or sell based on market opportunities 
when evaluating potential acquisitions  developments and dispositions  the company generally considers the following factors strategically targeted markets  income levels and employment growth trends in the relevant market  employment and household growth and net migration of the relevant market s population  barriers to entry that would limit competition zoning laws  building permit availability  supply of undeveloped or developable real estate  local building costs and construction costs  among other factors  the location  construction quality  condition and design of the property  the current and projected cash flow of the property and the ability to increase cash flow  the potential for capital appreciation of the property  the terms of resident leases  including the potential for rent increases  the potential for economic growth and the tax and regulatory environment of the community in which the property is located  the occupancy and demand by residents for properties of a similar type in the vicinity the overall market and submarket  the prospects for liquidity through sale  financing or refinancing of the property  the benefits of integration into existing operations  purchase prices and yields of available existing stabilized properties  if any  competition from existing multifamily properties  comparably priced single family homes or rentals  residential properties under development and the potential for the construction of new multifamily properties in the area  and opportunistic selling based on demand and price of high quality assets  including condominium conversions 
the company generally reinvests the proceeds received from property dispositions primarily to achieve its acquisition  development and rehab strategies and at times to fund its debt and equity repurchase activities 
in addition  when feasible  the company may structure these transactions as tax deferred exchanges 
current environment the slowdown in the economy  which accelerated in the fourth quarter of  coupled with continued job losses and or lack of job growth leads us to be cautious regarding expected performance for since the fourth quarter of  our revenue has declined in most of our major markets as the economic slowdown continues to impact existing and prospective residents 
markets with little employment loss should perform better than markets with employment issues  although most of our markets are now experiencing job losses 
should the current credit crisis and general economic recession continue  the company may continue to experience a period of declining revenues  which would adversely impact the company s results of operations 
the vast majority of our leases are for terms of months or less 
as a result  we quickly feel the impact of an economic downturn which limits our ability to raise rents or causes us to lower rents on turnover units and lease renewals 
since the second half of  continued job losses and a lack of household formation have hampered our ability to increase rents or caused us to lower rents for new residents 
additionally  in recent months it has become increasingly difficult to maintain rents with our renewing residents 
after two consecutive years of modest expense growth same store expenses grew between and and between and  the company anticipates that expenses will increase at a higher rate primarily due to cost pressures from non controllable areas such as utilities and real estate taxes 
the combination of expected declines in revenues and higher overall expense levels will have a negative impact on the company s results of operations for the continued credit crisis has negatively impacted the availability and pricing of debt capital 
during this time  the multifamily residential sector has benefited from the continued liquidity provided by fannie mae and freddie mac 
a vast majority of the properties we sold this year were financed for the purchaser by one of these agencies 
furthermore  fannie mae and freddie mac provided us with approximately billion of secured mortgage financing in at attractive rates when compared to other sources of credit 
while the company believes these agencies will continue to provide liquidity to our sector  should they discontinue doing so  have their mandates changed or reduced or be disbanded by the government  it would significantly reduce our access to debt capital and or increase borrowing 
table of contents costs and would significantly reduce our sales of assets 
in response to the recession and liquidity issues prevalent in the debt markets  we took a number of steps to better position ourselves 
in early  we began pre funding our maturing debt obligations with approximately billion in secured mortgage financing obtained from fannie mae and freddie mac 
we also significantly reduced our acquisition activity 
during the second half of  we only acquired one property while we continued selling non core assets 
we expect to continue to be a net seller of assets during should current conditions continue 
additionally  we significantly reduced our development activities  starting only two new projects in the first half of and none in the second half of the year 
we also reduced the number of planned development projects we will undertake in the future and took a million impairment charge to reduce the value of five assets that we no longer plan on pursuing 
we do not currently anticipate starting any new wholly owned development projects during unless market conditions improve significantly 
finally  during we also expect to continue our focus on our expense control initiatives 
our specific current expectations regarding our results for and certain items that will affect them are set forth under results of operations below 
we believe that cash and cash equivalents  federally insured investment deposits and current availability on our revolving credit facility will provide sufficient liquidity to meet our funding obligations relating to debt retirement and existing development projects into we expect that our remaining funding obligations for and subsequent periods will be met through new borrowings  property dispositions and cash generated from operations 
despite the challenging conditions noted above  we believe that the company is well positioned to withstand the continuing economic downturn 
our properties are geographically diverse and were approximately occupied as of december   little new multifamily rental supply has been added to most of our markets  the national single family home ownership rate continues to decline and the long term demographic picture is positive 
we believe we are well positioned with a strong balance sheet and sufficient liquidity to cover debt maturities and development fundings in the near term  which should allow us to take advantage of investment opportunities should distressed assets become available at significant discounts 
when economic conditions improve  the short term nature of our leases and the limited supply of new rental housing being constructed should allow us to quickly realize revenue growth and improvement in our operating results 
results of operations in conjunction with our business objectives and operating strategy  the company continued to invest or recycle its capital investment in apartment properties located in strategically targeted markets during the years ended december  and december  in summary  we year ended december  acquired million of apartment properties consisting of properties and  units and an uncompleted development property for million and invested million to obtain the management contract rights and towards the redevelopment of a military housing project consisting of units  all of which we deem to be in our strategic targeted markets  and sold million of apartment properties consisting of properties and  units  as well as condominium units for million and a land parcel for million 
year ended december  acquired billion of apartment properties consisting of properties and  units and million of land parcels  all of which we deem to be in our strategic targeted markets  and sold billion of apartment properties consisting of properties and  units  as well as condominium units for million and million of land parcels 
the company s primary financial measure for evaluating each of its apartment communities is net operating income noi 
noi represents rental income less property and maintenance expense  real estate tax and insurance expense and property management expense 
the company believes that noi is helpful to investors as a supplemental

under normal operating conditions  the company considers its cash provided by operating activities to be adequate to 
table of contents meet operating requirements and payments of distributions 
however  there may be times when the company experiences shortfalls in its coverage of distributions  which may cause the company to consider reducing its distributions and or using the proceeds from property dispositions or additional financing transactions to make up the difference 
should these shortfalls occur for lengthy periods of time or be material in nature  the company s financial condition may be adversely affected and it may not be able to maintain its current distribution levels 
the company also expects to meet its long term liquidity requirements  such as scheduled unsecured note and mortgage debt maturities  property acquisitions  financing of construction and development activities and capital improvements through the issuance of unsecured notes and equity securities  including additional op units  and proceeds received from the disposition of certain properties as well as joint ventures

see note in the notes to consolidated financial statements for discussion of the events which occurred subsequent to december  capitalization of fixed assets and improvements to real estate our policy with respect to capital expenditures is generally to capitalize expenditures that improve the value of the property or extend the useful life of the component asset of the property 
we track improvements to real estate in two major categories and several subcategories replacements inside the unit 
these include flooring such as carpets  hardwood  vinyl  linoleum or tile  appliances  mechanical equipment such as individual furnace air units  hot water heaters  etc  furniture and fixtures such as kitchen bath cabinets  light fixtures  ceiling fans  sinks  tubs  toilets  mirrors  countertops  etc  and blinds shades 
all replacements are depreciated over a five year estimated useful life 
we expense as incurred all make ready maintenance and turnover costs such as cleaning  interior painting of individual units and the repair of any replacement item noted above 
building improvements outside the unit 
these include roof replacement and major repairs  paving or major resurfacing of parking lots  curbs and sidewalks  amenities and common areas such as pools  exterior sports and playground equipment  lobbies  clubhouses  laundry rooms  alarm and security systems and offices  major building mechanical equipment systems  interior and exterior structural repair and exterior painting and siding  major landscaping and grounds improvement  and vehicles and office and maintenance equipment 
all building improvements are depreciated over a five to ten year estimated useful life 
we capitalize building improvements and upgrades only if the item i exceeds  selected projects must exceed  ii extends the useful life of the asset  and iii improves the value of the asset

the company incurred less in capitalized improvements per unit and overall in primarily due to enhanced efforts to limit the scope of projects and greater cost controls on vendors 
for  the company estimates an annual stabilized run rate of approximately per unit of capital expenditures for its established properties 
the above assumption is based on current expectations and is forward looking 
during the year ended december   the company s total non real estate capital additions  such as computer software  computer equipment  and furniture and fixtures and leasehold improvements to the company s property management offices and its corporate offices  were approximately million 
the company expects to fund approximately million in total additions to non real estate property in the above assumption is based on current expectations and is forward looking 

table of contents improvements to real estate and additions to non real estate property are generally funded from net cash provided by operating activities and from investment cash flow 
derivative instruments in the normal course of business  the company is exposed to the effect of interest rate changes 
the company seeks to limit these risks by following established risk management policies and procedures including the use of derivatives to hedge interest rate risk on debt instruments 
the company has a policy of only entering into contracts with major financial institutions based upon their credit ratings and other factors 
when viewed in conjunction with the underlying and offsetting exposure that the derivatives are designed to hedge  the company has not sustained a material loss from those instruments nor does it anticipate any material adverse effect on its net income or financial position in the future from the use of derivatives it currently has in place 
see note in the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional discussion of derivative instruments at december  other total distributions paid in january amounted to million excluding distributions on partially owned properties  which included certain distributions declared during the fourth quarter ended december  minority interests as of december  decreased by million when compared to december  primarily as a result of the following distributions declared to minority interests  which amounted to million excluding junior preference unit distributions  the allocation of income from operations to holders of op units in the amount of million  the issuance of  op units related to the true up of the purchase price on the acquisition of one property in april with a valuation of million  and the conversion of million op units into common shares valued at million 
off balance sheet arrangements and contractual obligations the company has co invested in various properties that are unconsolidated and accounted for under the equity method of accounting 
management does not believe these investments have a materially different impact upon the company s liquidity  cash flows  capital resources  credit or market risk than its property management and ownership activities 
during and  the company entered into institutional ventures with an unaffiliated partner 
at the respective closing dates  the company sold and or contributed properties containing  units to these ventures and retained a ownership interest in the ventures 
the company s joint venture partner contributed cash equal to of the agreed upon equity value of the properties comprising the ventures  which was then distributed to the company 
the company s strategy with respect to these ventures was to reduce its concentration of properties in a variety of markets 
the company sold three properties consisting of units and one property consisting of units during the years ended december  and  respectively 
the company and its joint venture partner currently intend to wind up these investments over the next few years by selling the related assets 
the company cannot estimate what  if any  profit it will receive from these dispositions or if the company will in fact receive its equity back 
as of december   the company has projects totaling  units in various stages of development with estimated completion dates ranging through june  the development agreements currently in place are discussed in detail in note of the company s consolidated financial statements 
see also notes and in the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional discussion regarding the company s investments in partially owned entities

critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires management to use judgment in the application of accounting policies  including making estimates and assumptions 
if our judgment or interpretation of the facts and circumstances relating to various transactions had been different or different assumptions were made  it is possible that different accounting policies would have been applied  resulting in different financial results or different presentation of our financial statements 
the company s significant accounting policies are described in note in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
these policies were followed in preparing the consolidated financial statements at and for the year ended december  and are consistent with the year ended december  the company has identified six significant accounting policies as critical accounting policies 
these critical accounting policies are those that have the most impact on the reporting of our financial condition and those requiring significant judgments and estimates 
with respect to these critical accounting policies  management believes that the application of judgments and estimates is consistently applied and produces financial information that fairly presents the results of operations for all periods presented 
the six critical accounting policies are impairment of long lived assets  including goodwill the company periodically evaluates its long lived assets  including its investments in real estate and goodwill  for indicators of permanent impairment 
the judgments regarding the existence of impairment indicators are based on factors such as operational performance  market conditions and legal and environmental concerns  as well as the company s ability to hold and its intent with regard to each asset 
future events could occur which would cause the company to conclude that impairment indicators exist and an impairment loss is warranted 
depreciation of investment in real estate the company depreciates the building component of its investment in real estate over a year estimated useful life  building improvements over a year to year estimated useful life and both the furniture  fixtures and equipment and replacements components over a year estimated useful life  all of which are judgmental determinations 
cost capitalization see the capitalization of fixed assets and improvements to real estate section for discussion of the policy with respect to capitalization vs 
expensing of fixed asset repair and maintenance costs 
in addition  the company capitalizes the payroll and associated costs of employees directly responsible for and who spend all of their time on the supervision of major capital and or renovation projects 
these costs are reflected on the balance sheet as an increase to depreciable property 

table of contents the company follows the guidance in sfas no 
 accounting for costs and initial rental operations of real estate projects  for all development projects and uses its professional judgment in determining whether such costs meet the criteria for capitalization or must be expensed as incurred 
the company capitalizes interest  real estate taxes and insurance and payroll and associated costs for those individuals directly responsible for and who spend all of their time on development activities  with capitalization ceasing no later than days following issuance of the certificate of occupancy 
these costs are reflected on the balance sheet as construction in progress for each specific property 
the company expenses as incurred all payroll costs of on site employees working directly at our properties  except as noted above on our development properties prior to certificate of occupancy issuance and on specific major renovations at selected properties when additional incremental employees are hired 
fair value of financial instruments  including derivative instruments the company follows the guidance under sfas no 
when valuing its financial instruments 
the valuation of financial instruments under sfas no 
and sfas no 
 as amended  requires the company to make estimates and judgments that affect the fair value of the instruments 
the company  where possible  bases the fair values of its financial instruments  including its derivative instruments  on listed market prices and third party quotes 
where these are not available  the company bases its estimates on current instruments with similar terms and maturities or on other factors relevant to the financial instruments 
revenue recognition rental income attributable to residential leases is recorded on a straight line basis  which is not materially different than if it were recorded when due from residents and recognized monthly as it is earned 
leases entered into between a resident and a property for the rental of an apartment unit are generally year to year  renewable upon consent of both parties on an annual or monthly basis 
fee and asset management revenue and interest income are recorded on an accrual basis 
share based compensation the company accounts for its share based compensation in accordance with sfas no 
r  share based payment  effective january   which results in compensation expense being recorded based on the fair value of the share compensation granted 
the black scholes option valuation model was developed for use in estimating the fair value of traded options that have no vesting restrictions and are fully transferable 
this model is only one method of valuing options and the company s use of this model should not be interpreted as an endorsement of its accuracy 
because the company s share options have characteristics significantly different from those of traded options  and because changes in the subjective input assumptions can materially affect the fair value estimate  in management s opinion  the existing models do not necessarily provide a reliable single measure of the fair value of its share options and the actual value of the options may be significantly different 
funds from operations for the year ended december   funds from operations ffo available to common shares and op units decreased million  or  as compared to the year ended december  for the year ended december   ffo available to common shares and op units increased million  or  as compared to the year ended december  the following is a reconciliation of net income to ffo available to common shares and op units for each of the five years ended december  
table of contents funds from operations amounts in thousands year ended december  net income allocation to minority interests operating partnership  net adjustments depreciation depreciation non real estate additions depreciation partially owned and unconsolidated properties net gain on sales of unconsolidated entities discontinued operations depreciation gain on sales of discontinued operations  net of minority interests net incremental loss gain on sales of condominium units minority interests operating partnership ffo preferred distributions premium on redemption of preferred shares ffo available to common shares and op units the national association of real estate investment trusts nareit defines funds from operations ffo april white paper as net income computed in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states gaap  excluding gains or losses from sales of depreciable property  plus depreciation and amortization  and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures 
adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures will be calculated to reflect funds from operations on the same basis 
the april white paper states that gain or loss on sales of property is excluded from ffo for previously depreciated operating properties only 
once the company commences the conversion of units to condominiums  it simultaneously discontinues depreciation of such property 
ffo available to common shares and op units is calculated on a basis consistent with net income available to common shares and reflects adjustments to net income for preferred distributions and premiums on redemption of preferred shares in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the equity positions of various individuals and entities that contributed their properties to the operating partnership in exchange for op units are collectively referred to as the minority interests operating partnership 
subject to certain restrictions  the minority interests operating partnership may exchange their op units for eqr common shares on a one for one basis 
the company believes that ffo and ffo available to common shares and op units are helpful to investors as supplemental measures of the operating performance of a real estate company  because they are recognized measures of performance by the real estate industry and by excluding gains or losses related to dispositions of depreciable property and excluding real estate depreciation which can vary among owners of identical assets in similar condition based on historical cost accounting and useful life estimates  ffo and ffo available to common shares and op units can help compare the operating performance of a company s real estate between periods or as compared to different companies 
ffo and ffo available to common shares and op units do not represent net income  net income available to common shares or net cash flows from operating activities in accordance with gaap 
therefore  ffo and ffo available to common shares and op units should not be exclusively considered as alternatives to net income  net income available to common shares or net cash flows from operating activities as determined by gaap or as measures of liquidity 
the company s calculation of ffo and ffo available to common shares and op units may differ from other real estate companies due to  among other items  variations in cost capitalization policies for capital expenditures and  accordingly  may not be comparable to such other real estate companies 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risks relating to the company s financial instruments result primarily from changes in short term libor interest rates and changes in the sifma index for tax exempt debt 
the company does not have any direct foreign exchange or other significant market risk 
the company s exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to the unsecured revolving and term credit facilities as well as floating rate tax exempt debt 
the company typically incurs fixed rate debt obligations to finance acquisitions  while it typically incurs floating rate debt obligations to finance working capital needs and as a temporary measure in advance of securing long term fixed rate financing 
the company continuously evaluates its level of floating rate debt with respect to total debt and other factors  including its assessment of the current and future economic environment 
to the extent the company carries  as it did at december   substantial cash balances  this will tend to partially counterbalance any increase or decrease in interest rates 
the company also utilizes certain derivative financial instruments to limit market risk 
interest rate protection agreements are used to convert floating rate debt to a fixed rate basis or vice versa 
derivatives are used for hedging purposes rather than speculation 
the company does not enter into financial instruments for trading purposes

the fair values of the company s financial instruments including such items in the financial statement captions as cash and cash equivalents  other assets  lines of credit  accounts payable and accrued expenses and other liabilities approximate their carrying or contract values based on their nature  terms and interest rates that approximate current market rates

if market rates of interest permanently decreased by basis points a decrease from the company s existing weighted average interest rates  the net liability fair value of the company s derivative instruments would be approximately million 
these amounts were determined by considering the impact of hypothetical interest rates on the company s financial instruments 
the foregoing assumptions apply to the entire amount of the company s debt and derivative instruments and do not differentiate among maturities 
these analyses do not consider the effects of the changes in overall economic activity that could exist in such an environment 
further  in the event of changes of such magnitude  management would likely take actions to further mitigate its exposure to the changes 
however  due to the uncertainty of the specific actions that would be taken and their possible effects  this analysis assumes no changes in the company s financial structure or results 
the company cannot predict the effect of adverse changes in interest rates on its debt and derivative instruments and  therefore  its exposure to market risk  nor can there be any assurance that long term debt will be available at advantageous pricing 
consequently  future results may differ materially from the estimated adverse changes discussed above
