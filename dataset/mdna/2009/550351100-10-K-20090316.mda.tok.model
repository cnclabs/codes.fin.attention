item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes to those statements included elsewhere in this report 
in addition to historical financial information  the following discussion and analysis contains forward looking statements that involve risks  uncertainties and assumptions 
our actual results and timing of selected events may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of many factors  including those discussed under risk factors and elsewhere in this report 
overview we research  develop and commercialize innovative technologies in two primary areas of focus test measurement  sensing  and instrumentation products and health care products 
we have a disciplined and integrated business model that is designed to accelerate the process of bringing new and innovative products to market 
we identify technologies that can fulfill large and unmet market needs and then take these technologies from the applied research stage through commercialization 
although revenues from product sales currently represent less than half of our total revenues  we continue to invest in product development and commercialization  which we anticipate will lead to increased product sales growth 
in the future  we expect that revenues from product sales will represent a larger proportion of our total revenues 
in addition  we anticipate that  these revenues will reflect a broader and more diversified mix of products as we develop and commercialize new products 
we have developed a disciplined and integrated process to accelerate the development and commercialization of innovative technologies 
our business model employs a market driven approach and provides the infrastructure  resources and know how throughout the process of developing and commercializing new products 
to manage a diverse set of products effectively across a range of development stages  we are organized into two main groups our technology development division and our products division 
these groups work together through all product development stages  including searching for emerging technologies based on market needs  conducting applied research  developing and commercializing innovative products  and applying proven technologies and products to new market opportunities 
our annual revenues were million in  million in  and million in we generate revenues through technology development services provided under contractual arrangements  product sales and license fees 
historically  our technology development revenues have accounted for a large proportion of our total revenues  and we expect that they will continue to represent a significant portion of our total revenues for the foreseeable future 
our technology development revenues grew from million in  to million in and million in we have historically had a backlog of contracts for which work has been scheduled  but for which a specified portion of work has not yet been completed 
we define backlog as the dollar amount of obligations payable to us under negotiated contracts upon completion of a specified portion of work that has not yet been completed  exclusive of revenues previously recognized for work already performed under these contracts  if any 
total backlog includes funded backlog the amount for which money has been directly authorized by the us congress and for which a purchase order has been received by a commercial customer and unfunded backlog firm orders for which funding has not been appropriated 
indefinite delivery and quantity contracts and unexercised options are not reported in total backlog 
the approximate value of our backlog was million at december  revenues from product sales currently represent a smaller proportion of our total revenues  and  historically  we have derived most of these revenues from the sales of our sensing systems and products that make use of light transmitting optical fibers  or fiber optics 
although we have been successful in licensing certain technology in past years  we do not expect license revenues to represent a significant portion of future revenues  however  over time we do intend to gradually increase such revenues 
in the near term  we expect revenues from product sales to be primarily in areas associated with our fiber optic instrumentation and test and measurement platforms 
we also expect to increase our investments in product development and commercialization  which we anticipate 
table of contents will lead to increased product sales growth 
in the long term  we expect that revenues from product sales will represent a larger proportion of our total revenues and that as we develop and commercialize new products  these revenues will reflect a broader and more diversified mix of products 
we incurred consolidated net losses of approximately million  million  and million for the years ended december    and  respectively 
we expect to continue to incur significant expenses as we expand our business  including increased expenses for research and development  sales and marketing  and manufacturing capability 
we may also grow our business in part through acquisitions of additional companies and complementary technologies  which could cause us to incur transaction expenses  amortization or write offs of intangible assets and other acquisition related expenses 
as a result  we expect that we may likely continue to incur losses for the foreseeable future  and these losses could be substantial 
in june  we entered into an intellectual property licensing  development  and supply agreement with intuitive surgical inc  or intuitive 
under the terms of the multi year agreement  we will develop and supply our fiber optic based shape sensing and position tracking system for integration into intuitive s products  including the da vinci surgical system 
pursuant to the agreement  intuitive agreed to pay us certain fees including an up front license fee  development fees payable in quarterly installments over the initial year and a half period following the date of the agreement  and certain other fees  subject to certain termination rights by intuitive and other rights of repayment or reduction 
such fees do not include the minimum purchase requirements of intuitive  which are subject to the successful completion of the development criteria and certain other terms and conditions 
during the three months ended december   we began to experience the impact of the general downtown affecting the united states and global economies 
specifically  revenue from the sale of our products during the fourth quarter of declined substantially as compared to both the immediately preceding quarter and the same quarter in we experienced declines in both the number of units sold as well as a in the average price per unit sold  and we cannot be certain that such declines will not continue or worsen as the state of the us and global economy remains uncertain 
description of our revenues  costs and expenses revenues we generate revenues from technology development  product sales and license payments 
we derive technology development revenues from providing research and development services to third parties  including government entities  academic institutions and corporations  and from achieving milestones established by some of these contracts and in collaboration agreements 
in general  we complete contracted research over periods ranging from six months to three years  and recognize these revenues over the life of the contract as costs are incurred or upon the achievement of certain milestones built into the contracts 
our product revenues reflect amounts that we receive from sales of our products or development of products for third parties and currently represent approximately of our total revenues 
our license revenues are comprised of up front license fees paid to us in connection with licenses or sublicenses of certain patents and other intellectual property as well as royalties  which currently represent an immaterial proportion of our license revenues 
cost of revenues cost of revenues associated with technology development revenues consists of costs associated with performing the related research activities  including direct labor  amounts paid to subcontractors and overhead allocated to technology development activities 
cost of revenues associated with product sales and license revenues consists of license fees for use of certain technologies  product manufacturing costs including all direct material and direct labor costs  amounts paid to our contract manufacturers  manufacturing  shipping and handling  provisions for product warranty  and inventory obsolescence  as well as overhead allocated to these activities 

table of contents operating expense operating expense consists of selling  general and administrative expenses  as well as expenses related to research and development  depreciation of fixed assets and amortization of intangible assets 
these expenses also include compensation for employees in executive and operational functions including certain non cash charges related to expenses from option grants  facilities costs  professional fees  salaries  commissions  travel expense and related benefits of personnel engaged in sales  product management and marketing activities  costs of marketing programs and promotional materials  salaries  bonuses and related benefits of personnel engaged in our own research and development beyond the scope and activities of our technology development division  product development activities not provided under contracts with third parties  and overhead costs related to these activities 
interest income expense on may   we canceled our senior secured revolving credit facility with first national bank  and entered into a new million debt facility with silicon valley bank 
at december   a million term loan was outstanding under this new facility 
interest expense includes interest accrued on the outstanding aggregate principal of the senior convertible promissory notes issued to carilion clinic on december  and interest payable on the silicon valley bank debt term loan 
interest income includes amounts earned on our cash deposits with financial institutions 
during and  we invested the proceeds of the carilion financing transactions and the net proceeds from our initial public offering in a money market account  and we draw from that account as needed to fund ongoing operations 
we also invested the proceeds from the silicon valley bank debt facility in a money market account beginning with our initial draw in may critical accounting policies and estimates technology development revenues we recognize revenue when a contract has been executed  the contract price is fixed and determinable  delivery of services or products has occurred  and collectibility of the contract price is considered probable and can be reasonably estimated 
revenue is earned under cost reimbursable  time and materials and fixed price contracts 
direct contract costs are expensed as incurred 
under cost reimbursable contracts  we are reimbursed for allowable costs and paid a fixed fee 
revenues on cost reimbursable contracts are recognized as costs are incurred plus an estimate of applicable fees earned 
we consider fixed fees under cost reimbursable contracts to be earned in proportion to the allowable costs incurred in performance of the contract 
revenue on time and materials contracts are recognized based on direct labor hours expended at contract billing rates and adding other billable direct costs 
fixed price contracts may include either a product delivery or specific service performance throughout a period 
for fixed price contracts that are based on the proportionate performance method and involve a specified number of deliverables  we recognize revenue based on the proportion of the cost of the deliverables compared to the cost of all deliverables included in the contract 
for fixed price contracts that provide for the development and delivery of a specific prototype or product  revenues are recognized on under the percentage of completion method in accordance with statement of position sop accounting for performance of construction type and certain production type contracts 
our contracts with agencies of the government are subject to periodic funding by the respective contracting agency 
funding for a contract may be provided in full at inception of the contract or ratably throughout the 
table of contents contract as the services are provided 
in evaluating the probability of funding for purposes of assessing collectibility of the contract price  we consider our previous experience with our customers  communication with our customers regarding funding status  and our knowledge of available funding for the contract or program 
if funding is not assessed as probable  revenue recognition is deferred until realization is deemed probable 
contract revenue recognition inherently involves estimation  including the contemplated level of effort to accomplish the tasks under the contract  the cost of the effort  and an ongoing assessment of progress toward completing the contract 
from time to time  as part of normal management processes  facts may change  causing revisions to estimated total costs or revenues expected 
the cumulative impact of any revisions to estimates and the full impact of anticipated losses on any type of contract are recognized in the period in which they become known 
the underlying bases for estimating our contract research revenues are measurable expenses such as labor  subcontractor costs and materials  the cost data of which is updated on a regular basis for purposes of preparing our cost estimates 
our research contracts generally have a period of performance of six to months 
accordingly  our estimates of contract costs have historically been consistent with actual results 
revisions in these estimates between accounting periods to reflect changing facts and circumstances have not had a material impact on our operating results  and we do not expect future changes in these estimates to be material 
whether certain costs under government contracts are allowable is subject to audit by the government 
certain indirect costs are charged to contracts using provisional or estimated indirect rates  which are subject to later revision based on government audits of those costs 
management is of the opinion that costs subsequently disallowed  if any  would not be significant 
product revenues we recognize revenue relating to our products when pervasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the selling price is fixed or determinable  and collectibility of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured 
pursuant to the adoption of emerging issues task force eitf issue no 
 revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables  we evaluate product sales that are a part of multiple element revenue arrangements to determine whether separate units of accounting exist  and follow appropriate revenue recognition policies for each separate unit 
elements are considered separate units of accounting provided that i the delivered items has stand alone value to the customer  ii there is objective and reliable evidence of the fair value of the undelivered item  iii if a general right of return exists relative to the delivered item  delivery or performance of the undelivered item is considered probable and substantially within our control 
in certain product sales arrangements  we offer products bundled together at a discount 
we allocate the overall contract consideration among the separate units of accounting based upon their fair values  with the amount allocated to the delivered item being limited to the amount that is not contingent upon the delivery of additional items or meeting other specified performance conditions 
we base the fair value of the undelivered items upon the normal pricing practice for those items  which is generally the price when sold separately 
for products containing software that is considered more than an incidental component  we consider the requirements of sop  software revenue recognition 
we have concluded that our product sales do not include multiple deliverable elements  as we do not offer post contract customer support  technical services or upgrades and enhancements  or other related services  which would require deferring recognition of revenue relating to the product  absent the existence of fair value for any undelivered elements 
income taxes we estimate our tax liability through calculating our current tax liability  together with assessing temporary differences resulting from the different treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which we record on our balance sheet 
management then assesses the likelihood that deferred tax assets will be recovered in future periods 
in assessing the need for a valuation 
table of contents allowance against the net deferred tax asset  management considers factors such as future reversals of existing taxable temporary difference  taxable income in prior carry back years  whether carry back is permitted under the tax law  tax planning strategies  and estimated future taxable income exclusive of reversing temporary differences and carry forwards 
to the extent that we cannot conclude that it is more likely than not that the benefit of such assets will be realized  we establish a valuation allowance to reduce their net carrying value 
as we assess our projections of future taxable income or other factors that may impact our ability to generate taxable income in future periods  our estimate of the required valuation allowance may change  which could have a material impact on future earnings or losses 
financial accounting standards board fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes fin clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprise s financial statements in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
fin prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
fin also provides guidance on de recognition  classification  interest and penalties  accounting in interim periods  disclosure and transition 
fin has not had a material impact on our results of operation since our adoption of this guidance in while it is often difficult to predict the final outcome or timing of the resolution of any particular tax matter  we establish a liability at the time we determine it is probable we will be required to pay additional taxes related to certain matters 
these liabilities are recorded in the line item accrued liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets 
we adjust such provision  including any impact on the related interest and penalties  in light of changing facts and circumstances  such as the progress of a tax audit 
a number of years may elapse before a particular matter for which we have established a liability is audited and finally resolved 
the number of years with open tax audits varies depending on the tax jurisdiction 
settlement of any particular issue would usually require the use of cash 
we recognize favorable resolutions of tax matters for which we have previously established liabilities as a reduction to our income tax expense when the amounts involved become known 
due to differences between federal or state tax law  and accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  or gaap  certain items are included in the tax return at different times than when these items are reflected in the consolidated financial statements 
therefore  the annual tax rate reflected in our consolidated financial statements is different than that reported in our tax return 
some of these differences are permanent  such as expenses that are not deductible in our tax return 
some differences  such as depreciation expense reverse over time and create deferred tax assets and liabilities 
the tax rates used to determine deferred tax assets or liabilities are the enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse 
based on the evaluation of all available information  we recognize future tax benefits  such as net operating loss carry forwards  to the extent that realizing these benefits is considered more likely than not 
a substantial portion of our net deferred tax asset has been reserved until such time that we generate substantial taxable income from operations or other tax planning strategies that will enable us to fully benefit from this asset 
stock based compensation effective january   we adopted sfas no 
r  share based payment sfas no 
r using the modified prospective transition method 
under this transition method  our financial statements for periods prior to january  were not restated 
however  we incur compensation expense for new awards and awards modified  repurchased or cancelled after january  this compensation expense is computed using the fair value of the stock option as determined by an option pricing model  the black scholes valuation model 
we amortize stock based compensation for such awards on a straight line method over the related service period of the awards taking into account the effects of the employees expected exercise and post vesting employment termination behavior 
to compute the volatility used in this model for options granted after november  we use the lifetime volatility of our common stock  because the stock has been publicly traded for over two years 
table of contents and thus provides sufficient data to determine volatility 
to compute the volatility used in this model for options granted prior to november  we used data from comparable companies 
under the modified prospective method  we recognize compensation cost in our financial statements for all awards granted after january  and for all awards outstanding as of january  for which the requisite service had not been rendered as of the date of adoption 
we measure the amount of compensation cost based on the fair value of the underlying equity award on the date of grant 
we recognize compensation cost over the period that an employee provides service in exchange for the award 
as of december   total compensation expense not yet recognized related to unvested options is approximately million 
goodwill and other intangible assets at december   we had  in goodwill relating to our acquisition of luna technologies in september we account for goodwill in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
sfas no 
requires goodwill and certain intangible assets to no longer be amortized 
in addition  goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level and intangible assets deemed to have an indefinite life and other intangibles are tested for impairment at least annually  or more frequently if impairment indicators arise 
we test for impairment of goodwill by preparing a discounted future net cash flow analysis 
discounted net future cash flows are an estimate of the fair value of the reporting unit 
in preparing this projection  we make a number of assumptions  which include  without limitation  future sales volume levels  price levels  rates of increase in operating expenses  as well as assumptions concerning the timely completion of certain product development activities 
if our projection of discounted future cash flows is in excess of the carrying value of the recorded asset  no impairment is reported 
if the carrying value of the asset exceeds the projected discounted net cash flows  an impairment charge is recorded 
the amount of the impairment charge is the excess of the carrying value of the asset over discounted net cash flows 
we account for patents in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for disposal or impairment of long lived assets 
we amortize our patents over their estimated useful life of five years  and analyze them periodically to determine whether their carrying value has been impaired 
at the end of december  and  respectively  no patents were written down due to any impairment in value 

table of contents results of operations the following table shows information derived from our consolidated statements of operations expressed as a percentage of revenues for the periods presented 
year ended december  revenues  technology development revenues product revenues total revenues cost of revenues technology development costs product costs total cost of revenues gross profit operating expense operating loss total other income  net loss before income taxes income tax expense net loss year ended december  compared to year ended december  revenues total revenues for the year ended december  were million  representing an increase of million  or  over revenues of million for the year ended december  the increase was comprised of a million  or  increase in technology development revenue and a million  or  decrease in product and license revenue 
technology development revenue grew in due to additional contract awards 
a greater proportion of our labor costs were spent generating revenue in than in  which translated to increased revenue 
direct labor applied to billable contract activity increased from of total technology development labor dollars for the year ended december  to for the year ended december  we believe that we improved the efficiency of our technology development labor during the year ended december  product sales  product development  and licensing revenues for the years ended december  and were million and million  respectively  representing a decrease  or million  between these two years 
product development activities included product development work for our arrangement with intuitive surgical  inc  and various arrangements with governmental entities 
revenues relating to product development activities decreased to million during the year ended december   or from million during the year ended december  we attribute this decrease predominantly to changes in our estimates for the level of effort required to attain milestones in certain product development contracts 
when estimated costs to complete a contract increase  we reduce our revenues previously recognized  pursuant to the provisions of sop  accounting for the performance of construction type and certain production type contracts 
we reduced revenues on a cumulative basis by approximately million for the three months ended march  and by approximately million for the three months ended december  due to such changes in estimates 

table of contents the decline in product development revenue was offset by an increase in the revenue realized from product sales for the year ended december  product sales revenue increased to million during the year ended december   or  from million for the year ended december  however  the general deterioration of the global economy began to impact our product sales during the three month ended december  revenue from product sales for the nine months ended september  was million  an increase of million  or  compared to product revenue for the nine months ended september  of million 
however  revenue from the sale of our products for the three months ended december  decreased million  or  to million for the three months ended december   as compared to million for the three months ended december  the number of units sold on which we recognized revenue declined by to during the three months ended december  from during the three months ended december  cost of revenues cost of revenues increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  cost of revenues for technology development increased million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  this increase primarily resulted from the addition of personnel during to fulfill our awarded research contracts  a higher proportion of time expended on direct labor  and other direct costs associated with these contracts 
product and license cost of revenues increased million  or  largely attributable to the increases of cost of goods relating to the sale of products 
operating expense operating expense increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december   an increase of million  or  over the increase in operating expense was driven primarily by two factors in  an increase in litigation expenses  and an increase in share based compensation expenses 
expenses relating to litigation for the year ended december  were approximately million  an increase of million  or  over litigation expenses for the year ended december  of million 
the expense increase is attributable to on going corporate litigation almost entirely with respect to our dispute with hansen medical 
expenses relating to share based compensation were million for the year ended december   an increase of million  or  over share based compensation expenses of million for the year ended december  the increase in share based compensation was driven by an increase in the expense relating to options issued to employees  accounted for under the provisions of sfas r 
expenses relating to these options increased due to an increase in the number of options granted during other income expense other income was million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december   an increase of million in other income items  or approximately 
this increase was due primarily to the following transactions occurring during the year ended december  receipt of net proceeds of a legal settlement  and recognition of income from partial satisfaction of the terms of a grant from the city of danville 

table of contents on july   we settled litigation at mediation with our former auditing and accounting firm in connection with the firm s auditing and opining on the accuracy of several years of our consolidated financial statements in preparation for our registration with the securities and exchange commission and our initial public offering of securities 
the settlement of this matter at mediation was without any admission of liability  or adjudication of fact or law  and the material terms included payment to us 
we recognized million in other income related to this settlement  which is shown net of related legal expenses 
in march  we received a  grant from the city of danville  virginia to be used for the expansion of economic and commercial growth within the city 
specifically   of the grant was to offset certain capital expenditures for leasehold improvements being made at our danville facility  and the remaining  for our creation of new jobs 
accordingly  we deferred the full  amount of the grant as a liability on our balance sheet until we were able to satisfy the grant conditions 
in december we received a determination letter from the city of danville indicating that we had met of the conditions of the grant relating to job creation and of the conditions of the grant relating to capital expenditures 
as a result  we recognized  of the grant proceeds as other income for the year ended december  and correspondingly reduced the deferred liability of  on our balance sheet 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  revenues total revenues for the year ended december  were million  representing an increase of million  or  over revenues of million for the year ended december  the year over year increase was comprised of a million  or  increase in technology development revenue and a million  or  increase in product and license revenue 
technology development revenue grew primarily due to hiring of additional personnel throughout  resulting in increased billable activities performed under our research contracts 
total product and licensing revenues were million for the year ended december   representing a increase over product and licensing revenues of million for the year ended december  approximately million of the product and license revenues related to product sales of our products division 
product and license revenues for the year ended december  also included million in sales of medical products and million in contracted product development activities  which included product development work for the arrangement with intuitive surgical  inc and various arrangements with government entities 
contracted product development activities for the year ended december  were cost of revenues cost of revenues increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  cost of revenues for technology development increased million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  this increase primarily resulted from the addition of personnel during to fulfill our awarded research contracts  a higher proportion of time expended on direct labor  and other direct costs associated with these contracts 
product and license cost of revenues increased million  or  consistent with the product and license revenue growth of  primarily attributable to increased costs associated with an increase in the number of units sold 

table of contents operating expense operating expense increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the increase in operating expense was primarily attributable to increased spending in research and development activities  principally related to research concerning carbon nanomaterials and their potential application in diagnostic imaging  development of our medical products  increased recognition of expense for share based compensation  and increases in personnel  professional fees and other costs 
these increased costs were incurred in support of our strategy to achieve long term growth through the commercialization of innovative products utilizing our proprietary and licensed technologies 
we expect our operating expenses to continue to increase  at a lesser rate of growth  as we continue to invest in new product development and increase product sales 
other income expense other income was  for the year ended december  compared to  for the year ended december  the decline is attributable to reduced cash deposits from to  resulting in lower interest income earned on deposits 
quarterly results the following table sets forth our unaudited historical revenues  operating income and net loss by quarter during and fiscal year fiscal year dollars in thousands  except loss per share march  june  september  december  march  june  september  december  revenues technology development product and license total revenues operating loss net loss basic and fully diluted loss per share liquidity and capital resources prior to august  our primary source of liquidity had been cash provided by operations and divestitures of certain assets and businesses 
in august  we completed our first outside equity financing and raised million through an equity investment by carilion clinic formerly carilion health system 
carilion clinic invested an additional million in december in the form of million aggregate principal amount of senior convertible promissory notes and million in additional equity 
on june   the effective date of our initial public offering  we sold  shares of common stock at per share  resulting in gross proceeds of million 
in connection with this offering  we paid million in underwriting discounts and commissions and incurred other offering expenses of approximately million 
the net proceeds from the offering were approximately million 
our principal uses of cash have been to fund our development of medical products and carbon nanomaterials  and our overall expansion  including facilities  personnel  working capital and other capital expenditures 

table of contents on may   we canceled our previous line of credit agreement with first national bank  and entered into a million maximum debt facility with silicon valley bank 
included in this facility is a four year term debt of million and a revolving line of credit facility available for the remaining million 
the facility has a total debt capacity of million 
at december   there was an outstanding balance of million under the term loan  and no outstanding balance under the revolving facility 
the loan terms require us to meet certain covenants relating to minimum adjusted ebitda  and other specified financial ratios 
as of this filing  we are not aware that we are currently in default of any of these covenants  and we do not have reason to believe that we will be unable to comply with these covenants in the coming year based on our projected operations 
as part of the facility  silicon valley bank issued a  letter of credit on our behalf to the industrial development authority of montgomery county  virginia  as required under an office lease 
the silicon valley bank letter of credit was issued as a replacement for the previous letter of credit issued on our behalf by first national bank in the amount of  in december  we entered into a first amendment to loan and security agreement with silicon valley bank 
the amendment adjusted interest rates under the million debt facility  revised certain minimum ebitda covenants under the facility  and added intellectual property to the assets securing the facility 
the new interest rate on the revolving line of credit is now a floating rate of the prime interest rate plus  with a minimum rate of 
the new interest rate on the term loan is now a floating rate of the prime interest rate plus  with a minimum rate of 
beginning in january  we will pay interest and principal monthly  so that principal is paid back ratably over months 
during the three months ended december   we began to experience the effects of a weakening overall economy  notably with respect to reduced sales of our test and measurement equipment 
we implemented cost cutting initiatives during this period in order to offset the effect of these reduced sales  including downsizing our workforce by approximately positions  and reducing other expenses relating to employee benefit programs 
discussion of cash flows recent activity during the year ended december   we used approximately million of net cash from operations 
this was a decrease of million compared to  when we used million of net cash from operations 
this change was due to the decreased net loss year over year  which contributed an additional million to operating cash flow  and other working capital component changes 
specifically  the significant working capital component changes between december  and december  were an increase in comparative operating cash flow due to increased accounts receivable collections of million  and a decrease in comparative operating cash flow due to accounts payable and accrued expenses of million 
cash used in investing activities for the year ended december  related solely to the purchase of property and equipment and legal fees and costs associated with securing patent rights to certain technology 
our overall cash used in investing activities was million in compared to million in the decrease was attributable to decreased capital asset spending  which was higher in due to the early stage capital needs of our business  including the purchase of office furniture and leasehold improvements relating to our roanoke headquarters building 
we saw fewer such needs in as a result of our prior investment 
cash flows from financing activities for the year ended december  increased significantly compared to this was due primarily to proceeds received from our million term loan as part of our silicon valley bank debt facility 

table of contents at december   total cash and cash equivalents were approximately million 
capital expenditures capital expenditures for property and equipment  including purchased assets  assets acquired under capital leases  and capitalized software  totaled million for  a decrease of million from capital expenditures of million in the decrease from to was principally due to expenditures in for continuing build out and furnishing of headquarters and other office space in roanoke and blacksburg locations  which we did not incur in we expect capital expenditures to increase somewhat in  based on our expected requirements for growth in capacity and replacement and upgrades of equipment 
summary of contractual obligations we lease our facilities in blacksburg  charlottesville  danville  hampton  and roanoke  virginia under operating leases that expire between december and december or under a month to month arrangement 
upon expiration of the leases  we may exercise certain renewal options as specified in the leases 
we also lease certain computer equipment and software under capital lease agreements that expires between february and september the assets subject to these obligations are included in property and equipment on our consolidated balance sheet 
in september  our luna technologies division executed a non cancelable  non reschedulable million purchase order for multiple shipments of tunable lasers to be delivered over an month period beginning in september as of december   approximately remained under this commitment 
the purchase order contains a provision permitting luna technologies to reduce the remaining commitment to million  under certain circumstances that are beyond our control 
set forth below is information concerning our known contractual obligations as of december  that are fixed and determinable 
total after long term debt obligations capital equipment and software lease operating facility leases other operating leases purchase order obligation deferred credits city of danville grant other liabilities total long term debt obligations consist of senior convertible promissory notes of aggregate principal amount of million and accrued interest thereon held by carilion clinic  and a term facility with silicon valley bank with an aggregate outstanding principal amount of million 
in march  we received a  grant from the city of danville  virginia to be used for the expansion of economic and commercial growth within the city 
specifically   of the grant will be 
table of contents used to offset certain capital expenditures for leasehold improvements being made at our danville facility  and the remaining  is to be used for our creation of new jobs 
in december we received a determination letter from the city of danville that we had met of the grant relating to job creation  and relating to capital expenditures 
as a result  we recognized  of the grant as other income for the year ended december  as of december   we had not fully met the capital expenditure milestone  and as a result  we may be required to repay the city of danville  due to the shortfall of capital expenditures 
since we have not yet met the stipulations of the grant  we have recorded the  in deferred liabilities in the accompanying balance sheet as of december  other liabilities include remaining amounts payable for minimum royalty payments for certain licensed technologies 
off balance sheet arrangements we have no off balance sheet arrangements as defined in regulation s k  item a ii 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk represents the risk of loss that may impact our financial position due to adverse changes in financial market prices and rates 
we do not hold or issue financial instruments for trading purposes or have any derivative financial instruments 
our exposure to market risk is limited to interest rate fluctuations due to changes in the general level of united states interest rates  particularly because as of december   our cash reserves were maintained in money market investment accounts and were not exposed to material market risks 
interest rate risk we do not use derivative financial instruments as a hedge against interest rate fluctuations  and  as a result  interest income earned on our cash and cash equivalents and short term investments is subject to changes in interest rates 
however  we believe that the impact of these fluctuations does not have a material effect on our financial position due to the immediate available liquidity or short term nature of these financial instruments 
as of december   we had million deposited in cash and cash equivalents bearing a weighted average interest rate of 
we are exposed to interest rate fluctuations  as a result of our silicon valley bank term loan and revolving debt facility both having interest rates subject to market fluctuations 
we do not currently use derivative instruments to alter the interest rate characteristics of any of our debt
