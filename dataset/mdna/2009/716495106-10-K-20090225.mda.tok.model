item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion is intended to assist in understanding our results of operations and our current financial condition 
our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes included elsewhere in this form k contain additional information that should be referred to when reviewing this material 
statements in this discussion may be forward looking 
these forward looking statements involve risks and uncertainties  including those discussed below  which could cause actual results to differ from those expressed 
overview we are an independent oil and natural gas company engaged in the exploration  development and production of predominately natural gas properties located onshore in the united states 
our properties are primarily located in louisiana  texas  arkansas and oklahoma 
we organize our operations into two principal regions the mid continent  which includes our louisiana and arkansas properties  and the western  which includes our texas and oklahoma properties 
historically  we have grown through acquisitions  with a focus on properties within our core operating areas which we believe have significant development and exploration opportunities and where we can apply our technical experience and economies of scale to increase production and proved reserves while lowering lease operating costs 
in late and throughout  we sought to aggressively expand our leasehold position in resource style natural gas plays within our core operating areas  particularly in the haynesville shale play in northern louisiana and east texas 
we currently own leasehold interests in approximately  net acres in the haynesville shale play 
we also own leasehold interests covering approximately  net acres in the fayetteville shale in arkansas  and  during  we announced our discovery of the eagle ford shale play in south texas  where we currently own leasehold interests in approximately  net acres 
the vast majority of our acreage in these plays is currently undeveloped 
typically  the leases we own require that production in paying quantities be established on units under the lease within the lease term generally three to five years or the lease will expire  although a significant percentage of the leases in the haynesville shale play are currently held by production from other producing zones 
lease expirations will be an important factor determining our capital expenditures focus over the next several years 
at december   our estimated total proved oil and natural gas reserves  as prepared by our independent reserve engineering firm  netherland  sewell  were approximately  bcfe  consisting of mmbbls of oil  and  bcf of natural gas and natural gas liquids 
approximately of our proved reserves were classified as proved developed 
we maintain operational control of approximately of our proved reserves 
production for the fourth quarter averaged mmcfe d and we exited the quarter producing mmcfe d 
full year production was mmcfe d 
we drilled gross wells net wells in  gross net of which were successful resulting in a success rate of 
we had total operating revenues of billion compared to million in  an increase of almost our financial results depend upon many factors  but are largely driven by the volume of our oil and natural gas production and the price that we receive for that production 
our production volumes will decline as reserves are depleted unless we expend capital in successful development and exploration activities or acquire properties with existing production 
the amount we realize for our production depends predominantly upon commodity prices  which are affected by changes in market demand and supply  as impacted by overall economic activity  weather  pipeline capacity constraints  inventory storage levels  basis differentials and other factors  and secondarily upon our commodity price hedging activities 
accordingly  finding and developing oil and natural gas reserves at economical costs is critical to our long term success 
during the second half  oil and natural gas prices declined significantly in response to the credit crisis  the turmoil in the global financial system and the economic recession in the united states and in other developed 
table of contents 
index to financial statements and developing countries 
in response to declining oil and natural gas prices during the last quarter of  we reduced and refocused our capital budget on the development of non proved locations in our haynesville  fayetteville and eagle ford shale plays 
we believe these projects offer the potential for the highest internal rates of return and reserve growth 
currently we plan to spend approximately billion on drilling  completions  seismic and facilities during  of which million has been allocated to our haynesville shale properties  million to our fayetteville shale properties and million to our eagle ford shale properties 
our future drilling plans are subject to change based upon various factors  some of which are beyond our control  including drilling results  oil and natural gas prices  the availability and cost of capital  drilling and production costs  availability of drilling services and equipment  gathering system and pipeline transportation constraints and regulatory approvals 
to the extent these factors lead to reductions in our drilling plans and associated capital budgets in future periods  our financial position  cash flows and operating results could be adversely impacted 
another consequence we face as a result of declining oil and natural gas prices is the possibility that we may be required to recognize a non cash impairment expense under the full cost method of accounting  which we use to account for our oil and natural gas exploration and development activities 
we recorded a full cost ceiling impairment of approximately billion at december   at which time the west texas intermediate posted price was per barrel for oil and the henry hub spot market price was per mmbtu for natural gas 
at times  oil and natural gas prices subsequent to year end have been lower than they were at december  if oil and natural gas prices do not recover  we may be required to take additional impairment charges in the future 
capital resources and liquidity our primary sources of capital resources and liquidity are internally generated cash flows from operations  availability under our senior credit agreement  and access to capital markets  to the extent available 
the capital markets  as they relate to us  have been adversely impacted by the current financial crisis  concerns about overall deflation and its effect on commodity prices  the possibility of a deepening world recession that may extend for a long period into the future  a lack of liquidity in the banking system and the unavailability and cost of credit 
continued volatility in the capital markets could adversely impact our ability to access the capital markets  which could reduce our ability to execute our development and acquisition plans  our ability to replace our reserves  and eventually  our production levels 
during the first quarter of  we initiated a borrowing base redetermination of our senior credit agreement 
our borrowing base of million  along with our existing terms and pricing  were reaffirmed 
we will continue to monitor our liquidity and the capital markets 
our future capital resources and liquidity may depend  in part  on our success in developing the leasehold interests that we acquired 
cash is required to fund capital expenditures necessary to offset inherent declines in production and proven reserves  which is typical in the capital intensive oil and gas industry 
future success in growing reserves and production will be highly dependent on capital resources available and the success of finding and acquiring additional reserves 
during and to date in  we have raised billion of debt net of expenses and billion of equity capital net of discounts and expenses 
we expect to fund our future capital requirements through internally generated cash flows  borrowings under our senior credit agreement which gives us million of borrowing capacity as of today  and additional future capital market issuances if necessary 
long term cash flows are subject to a number of variables including the level of production and prices as well as various economic conditions that have historically affected the oil and natural gas industry 
oil and natural gas prices have continued to fall after december  if these prices hold for a prolonged period of time or continue to fall  our ability to fund capital expenditures  reduce debt  meet financial obligations and become profitable may be materially impacted 
we also strive to maintain financial flexibility and may access capital markets as necessary to maintain substantial borrowing capacity under our senior credit agreement  facilitate drilling on our large undeveloped acreage position and permit us to selectively expand our acreage position and infrastructure projects 

table of contents 
index to financial statements cash flow our primary sources of cash in  and were from operating and financing activities 
proceeds from the sale of common stock  the issuance of new senior debt and cash received from operations were offset by repayments of our senior credit agreement and cash used in investing activities to fund our drilling program and acquisition activities  net of any divestiture activities 
operating cash flow fluctuations were substantially driven by changes in commodity prices and changes in our production volumes 
working capital was substantially influenced by these variables 
fluctuation in commodity prices and our overall cash flow may result in an increase or decrease in our future capital expenditures 
prices for oil and natural gas have historically been subject to seasonal influences characterized by peak demand and higher prices in the winter heating season  however  the impact of other risks and uncertainties have influenced prices throughout recent years 
see results of operations below for a review of the impact of prices and volumes on sales 
years ended december  in thousands cash flows provided by operating activities cash flows used in investing activities cash flows provided by financing activities net increase decrease in cash operating activities 
net cash flows provided by operating activities were million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
key drivers of net operating cash flows are commodity prices  production volumes and operating costs 
net cash provided by operating activities increased in primarily due to the increase in our average realized natural gas equivalent price compared to the same period in the prior year  partially offset by a decrease in production volumes due to the sale of our gulf coast properties during the fourth quarter of production for the fourth quarter was mmcfe d compared to mmcfe d during the third quarter of we exited the quarter producing mmcfe d 
full year production was mmcfe d 
we expect to continue to increase our production volumes in as a result of our capital program which is primarily focused on drilling opportunities in the haynesville  fayetteville and eagle ford shales 
however  we are unable to predict future production levels or future commodity prices  and  therefore  we cannot provide any assurance about future levels of net cash provided by operating activities 
net cash flows provided by operating activities increased in primarily due to our increase in production volumes primarily due to our merger with kcs in july  as well as our increase in our realized natural gas equivalent price 
as a result of significant declines in oil and natural gas prices  net cash flows provided by operating activities declined significantly in the fourth quarter compared to the third quarter despite significant increases in production 
investing activities 
the primary driver of cash used in investing activities is capital spending  inclusive of acquisitions and net of divestitures 
cash used in investing activities was billion  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
in  we spent billion on acquisitions of oil and gas properties and capital expenditures

critical accounting policies and estimates the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect our reported results of operations and the amount of reported assets  liabilities and proved oil and natural gas reserves 
some accounting policies involve judgments and uncertainties to such an extent that there is reasonable likelihood that materially different amounts could have been reported under different conditions  or if different assumptions had been used 
actual results may differ from the estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
described below are the most significant policies we apply in preparing our consolidated financial statements  some of which are subject to alternative treatments under accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
we also describe the most significant estimates and assumptions we make in applying these policies 
we discussed the development  selection and disclosure of each of these with our audit committee
