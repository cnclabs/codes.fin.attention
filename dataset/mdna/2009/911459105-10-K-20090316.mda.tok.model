the following discussion of the company s services should be read in conjunction with management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
bank services as a state chartered commercial bank  united security bank offers a full range of commercial banking services primarily to the business and professional community and individuals located in fresno  madera  kern  and santa clara counties 
the bank offers a wide range of deposit instruments including personal and business checking accounts and savings accounts  interest bearing negotiable order of withdrawal now accounts  money market accounts and time certificates of deposit 
most of the bank s deposits are attracted from individuals and from small and medium sized business related sources 
the bank also engages in a full complement of lending activities  including real estate mortgage  commercial and industrial  real estate construction  as well as agricultural  lease financing  and consumer loans  with particular emphasis on short and medium term obligations 
the bank s loan portfolio is not concentrated in any one industry  although approximately of the bank s loans are secured by real estate 
a loan may be secured in whole or in part by real estate even though the purpose of the loan is not to facilitate the purchase or development of real estate 
at december   the bank had loans net of unearned fees outstanding of million  which represented approximately of the bank s total deposits and approximately of its total assets 
real estate mortgage loans are secured by deeds of trust primarily on commercial property 
repayment of real estate mortgage loans is generally from the cash flow of the borrower 
commercial and industrial loans have a high degree of industry diversification 
loans may be originated in the company s market area  or participated with other financial institutions outside the company s market area 
a substantial portion of commercial and industrial loans are secured by accounts receivable  inventory  leases or other collateral 
the remainder are unsecured  however extensions of credit are predicated on the financial capacity of the borrower to repay the extension of credit 
repayment of commercial loans is generally from the cash flow of the borrower 
real estate construction loans consist of loans to residential contractors  which are secured by single family residential properties 
all real estate loans have established equity requirements 
repayment of real estate construction loans is generally from long term mortgages with other lending institutions 
agricultural loans are generally secured by land  equipment  inventory and receivables 
repayment of agricultural loans is from the expected cash flow of the borrower 
in the normal course of business  the bank makes various loan commitments and incurs certain contingent liabilities 
at december  and  loan commitments of the bank million and million  respectively  and letters of credit totaled million and million  respectively 
of the million in loan commitments outstanding at december   million or were for loans with maturities of one year or less 
due to the nature of the business of the bank s customers  there are no seasonal patterns or absolute predictability to the utilization of unused loan commitments  therefore the bank is unable to forecast the extent to which these commitments will be exercised within the current year 
the bank does not believe that any such utilization will constitute a material liquidity demand 
the company does however have collateralized and uncollateralized lines of credit which could be utilized if such loan commitments were to be exercised in excess of normal expectations 
in addition to the loan and deposit services discussed above  the bank also offers a wide range of specialized services designed to attract and service the needs of commercial customers and account holders 
these services include online banking  safe deposit boxes  atm services  payroll direct deposit  cashier s checks  traveler s checks  money orders  and foreign drafts 
in addition  the bank offers a variety of specialized financial services  including wealth management  employee benefit  insurance and loan products  as well as consulting services for a variety of clients 
the bank does not operate a trust department  however  it makes arrangements with its correspondent bank to offer trust services to its customers on request 
most of the bank s business originates within fresno  madera  kern  and santa clara counties 
neither the bank s business or liquidity is seasonal  and there has been no material effect upon the bank s capital expenditures  earnings or competitive position as a result of federal  state or local environmental regulation 
competition and market share the banking business in california generally  and in the market area served by the company specifically  is highly competitive with respect to both loans and deposits 
the company competes for loans and deposits with other commercial banks  savings and loan associations  finance companies  money market funds  credit unions and other financial institutions  including a number that are substantially larger than the company 
deregulation of the banking industry  increased competition from non bank entities for the cash balances of individuals and businesses  and continuing developments in the computer and communications industries have had  and most likely will continue to have  a significant impact on the company s competitive position 
with the enactment of interstate banking legislation in california  bank holding companies headquartered outside of california will continue to enter the california market and provide competition for the company 
additionally  with the gramm leach bliley act of  traditional competitive barriers between insurance companies  securities underwriters  and commercial banks have been eased  allowing a greater number of financial intermediaries to offer a wider assortment of financial services 
many of the major commercial banks operating in the company s market areas offer certain services such as trust and international banking services  which the company does not offer directly 
in addition  banks with larger capitalization have larger lending limits and are thereby able to serve larger customers 
the company s primary market area at december  was located in fresno  madera  and kern counties  in which approximately fdic insured financial institutions compete for business 
santa clara county was added during february with the legacy bank acquisition  in which approximately fdic insured financial institutions compete for business

rank share fresno county th madera county th kern county th total of fresno  madera  kern counties th santa clara county th supervision and regulation the company the company is a bank holding company within the meaning of the bank holding company act of  as amended the bhc act  and is registered as such with the frb 
a bank holding company is required to file with the frb annual reports and other information regarding its business operations and those of its subsidiaries and is also subject to examination by the frb 
the bhc act requires  among other things  prior approval before acquiring  directly or indirectly  ownership or control of any voting shares of any bank  if after such acquisition it would directly or indirectly own or control more than of the voting stock of that bank  unless it already owns a majority of the voting stock of that bank 
the bhc act also provides that the frb shall not approve any acquisition that would result in or further the creation of a monopoly  or the effect of which may be substantially to lessen competition  unless the anticompetitive effects of the proposed transaction are clearly outweighed by the probable effect in meeting the convenience and needs of the community served 
furthermore  under the bhc act  a bank holding company is  with limited exceptions  prohibited from i acquiring direct or indirect ownership or control of more than of the voting shares of any company which is not a bank or ii engaging in any activity other than managing or controlling banks 
with the prior approval of the frb  however  a bank holding company may own shares of a company engaged in activities which the frb has determined to be so closely related to banking or managing or controlling banks as to be proper incident thereto 
the bhc act requires a bank holding company to serve as a source of financial and managerial strength to its subsidiary banks 
it is the frb s policy that a bank holding company should stand ready to use available resources to provide adequate capital funds to subsidiary banks during periods of financial stress and should maintain the financial flexibility and capital raising capacity to obtain additional resources for assisting a subsidiary bank 
under certain conditions  the frb may conclude that certain actions of a bank holding company  such as payment of cash dividends  would constitute unsafe and unsound banking practices because they violate the frb s source of strength doctrine 
a bank holding company and its subsidiaries are prohibited from certain tie in arrangements in connection with any extension of credit  sale or lease of property or furnishing of services 
for example  with certain exceptions  a bank may not condition an extension of credit on a promise by its customer to obtain other services by it  its holding company or other subsidiaries  or on a promise by its customer not to obtain services from a competitor 
in addition  federal law imposes certain restrictions between the company and its subsidiaries  including the bank 
as an affiliate of the bank  the company is subject  with certain exceptions  to provisions of federal law imposing limitations on  and requiring collateral for  extensions of credit by the bank to its affiliates 
in the gramm leach bliley act the glba was enacted 
the glba became effective in march of and is a financial services modernization law that  among other things  facilitates broad new affiliations among securities firms  insurance companies and bank holding companies by repealing the year old provisions of the glass steagall act 
the glba allows the formation of financial holding companies fhc s  which are bank holding companies with substantially expanded powers 
a bank holding company must acquire the approval of the frb to become a fhc 
under these expanded powers  affiliations may occur between bank holding companies  securities firms and insurance companies  subject to a blend of umbrella supervision and regulation of the newly formed consolidated entity by the federal reserve  oversight of the fhc s bank and thrift subsidiaries by their primary federal and state banking regulators and financial regulation of the fhc s nonbank subsidiaries by their respective specialized regulators 
the company has not applied to become a fhc

the bank the bank as a state chartered bank is subject to regulation  supervision and regular examination by the california department of financial institutions 
in addition  the bank is also a member of the federal reserve system and  as such  is subject to applicable provisions of the federal reserve act and regulations issued thereunder and  is subject to regulation  supervision and regular examination by the federal reserve bank 
the bank is subject to california law  insofar as they are not preempted by federal banking law 
deposits of the bank are insured by the fdic up to the applicable limits in an amount up to  per customer  and  as such  the bank is subject to the regulations of the fdic and the federal deposit insurance act 
as a consequence of the extensive regulation of commercial banking activities in california and the united states  the bank s business is particularly susceptible to changes in california and federal legislation and regulation  which may have the effect of increasing the cost of doing business  limiting permissible activities or increasing competition 
the bank is a member of the federal home loan bank of san francisco the fhlb sf 
among other benefits  each federal home loan bank fhlb serves as a reserve or central bank for its members within its assigned region 
each fhlb is financed primarily from the sale of consolidated obligations of the fhlb system 
each fhlb makes available loans or advances to its members in compliance with the policies and procedures established by the board of directors of the individual fhlb 

the fhlb sf utilizes a single class of stock with a par value of per share  which may be issued  exchanged  redeemed and repurchased only at par value 
as an fhlb member  the bank is required to own fhlb sf capital stock in an amount equal to the greater of a membership stock requirement with an initial cap of million of membership asset value as defined  or an activity based stock requirement based on percentage of outstanding advances 
the fhlb sf capital stock is redeemable on five years written notice  subject to certain conditions 
at december  the bank owned  shares of the fhlb sf capital stock 
the frb requires all depository institutions to maintain non interest bearing reserves at specified levels against their transaction accounts and non personal time deposits 
at december   we were in compliance with these requirements 
various other requirements and restrictions under the laws of the united states and the state of california affect the operations of the bank 
federal and california statutes and regulations relate to many aspects of the bank s operations  including capital requirements and disclosure requirements to depositors and borrowers  requirements to maintain reserves against deposits  limitations on interest rates payable on deposits  loans  investments  and restrictions on borrowings and on payment of dividends 
the dfi regulates the number and location of branch offices of a state chartered bank  and may permit a bank to maintain branches only to the extent allowable under state law for state banks 
california law presently permits a bank to locate a branch in any locality in the state 
additionally  california law exempts banks from california usury laws 
effect of governmental policies and recent legislation banking has traditionally been a business that depends on rate differentials 
in general  the difference between the interest rate paid by the company on its deposits and other borrowings and the interest rate received on loans extended to its customers and securities held in the company s portfolio comprise the major portion of the company s earnings 
these rates are highly sensitive to many factors which are beyond the control of the company 
accordingly  the earnings and growth of the company are subject to the influence of domestic and foreign economic conditions  including  but not limited to  inflation  recession and unemployment 
the earnings and growth of the company are affected not only by general economic conditions  both domestic and foreign  but also by the monetary and fiscal policies of the united states government and its agencies  particularly the federal reserve board frb 
the frb implements national monetary policies with objectives such as to curb inflation and combat recession by its open market operations in united states government securities  by adjusting the required level of reserves for financial institutions subject to reserve requirements  and by varying the discount rates applicable to borrowing by banks which are members of the federal reserve system 
the actions of the frb in these areas influence the growth of bank loans  investments and deposits and also affect interest rates charged on loans and paid on deposits 
the frb s policies have had a significant effect on the operating results of commercial banks and are expected to continue to do so in the future 
the nature and timing of any future changes in monetary policies are not predictable 
in addition  adverse economic conditions could make a higher provision for loan losses a prudent course and could cause higher loan charge offs  thus adversely affecting the company s net income 
the deposit insurance fund or dif of the fdic insures our customer deposits up to prescribed limits for each depositor 
the federal deposit insurance reform act of and the federal deposit insurance reform conforming amendments act of amended the insurance of deposits by the fdic and collection of assessments from insured depository institutions for deposit insurance 
the fdic approved a final rule to determine risk based assessment rates on november   with rates effective on january   however a new rules were proposed in an insured depository institution s assessment rate under the final rule is based on the new assessment rate schedule  its long term debt issuer ratings or recent financial ratios and supervisory ratings 
the proposed rule would also look at other factors that increase risks to the fdic s insurance fund 
any increase in assessments or the assessment rate could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations or cash flows  depending on the amount of the increase 
furthermore  the fdic is authorized to raise insurance premiums under certain circumstances 
the fdic is authorized to terminate a depository institution s deposit insurance upon a finding by the fdic that the institution s financial condition is unsafe or unsound or that the institution has engaged in unsafe or unsound practices or has violated any applicable rule  regulation  order or condition enacted or imposed by the institution s regulatory agency 
the termination of deposit insurance for the bank would have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
the federal reserve act and frb regulation o place limitations and conditions on loans or extensions of credit to a bank s or bank holding company s executive officers  directors and principal shareholders ie  in most cases  those persons who own  control or have power to vote more than of any class of voting securities  any company controlled by any such executive officer  director or shareholder  or any political or campaign committee controlled by such executive officer  director or principal shareholder 
loans and leases extended to any of the above persons must comply with loan to one borrower limits  require prior full board approval when aggregate extensions of credit to the person exceed specified amounts  must be made on substantially the same terms including interest rates and collateral as  and follow credit underwriting procedures that are not less stringent than  those prevailing at the time for comparable transactions with non insiders  and must not involve more than the normal risk of repayment or present other unfavorable features 
in addition  regulation o provides that the aggregate limit on extensions of credit to all insiders of a bank as a group cannot exceed the bank s unimpaired capital and unimpaired surplus 
regulation o also prohibits a bank from paying an overdraft on an account of an executive officer or director  except pursuant to a written pre authorized interest bearing extension of credit plan that specifies a method of repayment or a written pre authorized transfer of funds from another account of the officer or director at the bank 
from time to time  legislation is enacted which has the effect of increasing the cost of doing business  limiting or expanding permissible activities or affecting the competitive balance between banks and other financial institutions 
proposals to change the laws and regulations governing the operations and taxation of banks and other financial institutions are frequently made in congress  in the california legislature and before various bank regulatory agencies 
the likelihood of any major change and the impact such change may have on the company is impossible to predict 
certain of the potentially significant changes which have been enacted recently and other which are currently under consideration by congress or various regulatory agencies or professional agencies are discussed below 
recent legislation and other changes federal and state laws affecting banking are enacted from time to time  and similarly federal and state regulations affecting banking are also adopted from time to time 
the following include some of the recent laws and regulations affecting banking 
on february   the american recovery and reinvestment act of arra was enacted to provide stimulus to the struggling us economy 
arra authorizes spending of billion  including about billion for tax relief  billion for state and local relief aid  and billion for infrastructure and science 
in addition  arra includes additional executive compensation restrictions for recipients of funds from the us treasury under the troubled assets relief program of the emergency economic stimulus act of eesa 
the provisions of eesa amended by the arra include i expanding the coverage of the executive compensation limits to as many as the most highly compensated employees of a tarp funds recipient and its affiliates for certain aspects of executive compensation limits and ii specifically limiting incentive compensation of covered executives to one third of their annual compensation which is required to be paid in restricted stock that does not vest until all of the tarp funds are no longer outstanding note that if tarp warrants remain outstanding and no other tarp instruments are outstanding  then such warrants would not be considered outstanding for purposes of this incentive compensation restriction 
in addition  the board of directors of any tarp recipient is required under eesa  as amended to have a company wide policy regarding excessive or luxury expenditures  as identified by the treasury  which may include excessive expenditures on entertainment or events  office and facility renovations  aviation or other transportation services  or other activities or events that are not reasonable expenditures for staff development  reasonable performance incentives  or other similar measures conducted in the normal course of the business operations of the tarp recipient 
eesa  as amended by arra  provides for a new incentive compensation restriction for financial institutions receiving tarp funds 
the number of executives and employees covered by this new incentive compensation restriction depends on the amount of tarp funds received by such entity 
for community banks that have or will receive less than million  the new incentive compensation restriction applies only to the highest paid employee 
this new incentive compensation restriction prohibits a tarp recipient from paying or accruing any bonus  retention award  or incentive compensation during the period in which any tarp obligation remains outstanding  except that such prohibition shall not apply to the payment of long term restricted stock by such tarp recipient  provided that such long term restricted stock i does not fully vest during the period in which any tarp obligation remains outstanding  ii has a value in an amount that is not greater than of the total amount of annual compensation of the employee receiving the stock  and iii is subject to such other terms and conditions as the secretary of the treasury may determine is in the public interest 
in addition  this prohibition does not prohibit any bonus payment required to be paid pursuant to a written employment contract executed on or before february   as such valid employment contracts are determined by the treasury 
eesa was amended by arra to also provide additional corporate governance provisions with respect to executive compensation including the following establishment of standards during the period in which any tarp obligation remains outstanding  each tarp recipient shall be subject to the standards in the regulations issued by the treasury with respect to executive compensation limitations for tarp recipients  and the provisions of section m of the internal revenue code of  as applicable nondeductibility of executive compensation in excess of compliance with standards the treasury is required to see that each tarp recipient meet the required standards for executive compensation and corporate governance 
specific requirements for the required standards limits on compensation that exclude incentives for senior executive officers of the tarp recipient to take unnecessary and excessive risks that threaten the value of the financial institution during the period in which any tarp obligation remains outstanding 
a clawback requirement by such tarp recipient of any bonus  retention award  or incentive compensation paid to a senior executive officer and any of the next most highly compensated employees of the tarp recipient based on statements of earnings  revenues  gains  or other criteria that are later found to be materially inaccurate 
a prohibition on such tarp recipient making any golden parachute payment to a senior executive officer or any of the next most highly compensated employees of the tarp recipient during the period in which any tarp obligation remains outstanding 
a prohibition on any compensation plan that would encourage manipulation of the reported earnings of such tarp recipient to enhance the compensation of any of its employees 
a requirement for the establishment of an independent compensation committee that meets at least twice a year to discuss and evaluate employee compensation plans in light of an assessment of any risk posed to the tarp recipient from such plans 
for a non sec company that is a tarp recipient that has received  or less of tarp assistance  the duties of the compensation committee may be carried out by the board of directors of such tarp recipient 
in addition  eesa as amended by arra provides that for any tarp recipient  its annual meeting materials shall include a nonbinding shareholder approval proposal of executive compensation for shareholders to vote 
the sec is to establish regulations to implement this provision 
while nonpublic companies are required to include this proposal  it is not known what the regulations will provide as to executive compensation disclosure requirements of such tarp recipients  and whether they will be as extensive as the existing sec executive compensation requirements 
in addition  shareholders are allowed to present other nonbinding proposals with respect to executive compensation 
on february   the u 
s 
treasury  the federal reserve board  the federal deposit insurance corporation  the office of the comptroller of the currency  and the office of thrift supervision are announced a comprehensive set of measures to restore confidence in the strength of us financial institutions and restart the critical flow of credit to households and businesses 
this program is intended to restore the flows of credit necessary to support recovery 
the core program elements include a new capital assistance program to help ensure that our banking institutions have sufficient capital to withstand the challenges ahead  paired with a supervisory process to produce a more consistent and forward looking assessment of the risks on banks balance sheets and their potential capital needs 
a new public private investment fund on an initial scale of up to billion  with the potential to expand up to trillion  to catalyze the removal of legacy assets from the balance sheets of financial institutions 
this fund will combine public and private capital with government financing to help free up capital to support new lending 
a new treasury and federal reserve initiative to dramatically expand up to trillion the existing term asset backed securities lending facility talf in order to reduce credit spreads and restart the securitized credit markets that in recent years supported a substantial portion of lending to households  students  small businesses  and others 
an extension of the fdic s temporary liquidity guarantee program to october  a new framework of governance and oversight to help ensure that banks receiving funds are held responsible for appropriate use of those funds through stronger conditions on lending  dividends and executive compensation along with enhanced reporting to the public 
in october  the president signed the emergency economic stabilization act of eesa  commonly referred to as the bailout bill in response to the global financial crisis of authorizing the united states secretary of the treasury with authority to spend up to us billion to purchase distressed assets  especially mortgage backed securities  under the troubled assets relief program tarp and make capital injections into banks under the capital purchase program 
eesa gives the government the unprecedented authority to buy troubled assets on balance sheets of financial institutions under the troubled assets relief program and increases the limit on insured deposits from  to  until december  some of the other provisions of eesa are as follows accelerated from to the date that the federal reserve bank could pay interest on deposits of banks held with the federal reserve to meet reserve requirements  to the extent that the u 
s 
treasury purchases mortgage securities as part of tarp  the treasury shall implement a plan to minimize foreclosures including using guarantees and credit enhancements to support reasonable loan modifications  and to the extent loans are owned by the government to consent to the reasonable modification of such loans  limits executive compensation for executives for tarp participating financial institutions including a maximum corporate tax deduction limit of  for each of the top five highest paid executives of such institution  requiring clawbacks of incentive compensation that were paid based on inaccurate or false information  limiting golden parachutes for involuntary and certain voluntary terminations to x their average annual salary and bonus for the last five years  and prohibiting the payment of incentive compensation that encourages management to take unnecessary and excessive risks with respect to the institution  extends the mortgage debt forgiveness provision of the mortgage forgiveness debt relief act of by three years to ease the income tax burden on those involved with certain foreclosures  and qualified financial institutions may count losses on fnma and fhlmc preferred stock against ordinary income  rather than capital gain income 
the temporary liquidity guarantee program was implemented by the fdic on october  to mitigate the lack of liquidity in the financial markets 
the temporary liquidity guarantee program has two primary components the debt guarantee program  by which the fdic will guarantee the payment of certain newly issued senior unsecured debt  and the transaction account guarantee program  by which the fdic will guarantee certain noninterest bearing transaction accounts 
the debt guarantee program provides for an fdic guarantee as to the payment of all senior unsecured debt with a term of more than days issued by a qualified participating entity insured depository institutions  bank and financial holding companies  and certain savings and loan holding companies up to a limit of percent of all senior unsecured debt outstanding on september   and maturing by june  the fdic guarantee is until june   and the fee for such guarantee depends on the term with a maximum of basis points for terms in excess of days 
the transaction account guarantee program is the second part of the fdic s temporary liquidity guarantee program 
the fdic provides for a temporary full guarantee held at a participating fdic insured depository institution of noninterest bearing transaction accounts above the existing deposit insurance limit at the additional cost of basis points per annum 
this coverage became effective on october   and would continue through december  on july   the housing and economic recovery act was was signed by president bush 
it authorizes the federal housing administration to guarantee up to billion in new year fixed rate mortgages for subprime borrowers if lenders write down principal loan balances to percent of current appraisal value 
it is also intended to restore confidence in fannie mae and freddie mac by strengthening regulations and injecting capital into them 
states will be authorized to refinance subprime loans using mortgage revenue bonds 
it also establishes the federal housing finance agency fhfa out of the federal housing finance board fhfb and office of federal housing enterprise oversight ofheo 
in  the federal reserve board  the federal deposit insurance corporation  the office of the comptroller of the currency  and the office of thrift supervision amended their regulatory capital rules to permit banks  bank holding companies  and savings associations as to any of these a financial institution to reduce the amount of goodwill that a banking organization must deduct from tier capital by the amount of any deferred tax liability associated with that goodwill 
however  a financial institution that reduces the amount of goodwill deducted from tier capital by the amount of the deferred tax liability is not permitted to net this deferred tax liability against deferred tax assets when determining regulatory capital limitations on deferred tax assets 
for these financial institutions  the amount of goodwill deducted from tier capital will reflect each institution s maximum exposure to loss in the event that the entire amount of goodwill is impaired or derecognized  an event which triggers the concurrent derecognition of the related deferred tax liability for financial reporting purposes 
on october  the fdic adopted a restoration plan that would increase the rates banks pay for deposit insurance  and proposed rules for adjusting the system that determines what deposit insurance premium rate a bank pays the fdic 
currently  banks pay anywhere from five basis points to basis points for deposit insurance 
under the proposal rule  the assessment rate schedule would be raised uniformly by basis points annualized beginning on january  beginning with the second quarter of  changes would be made to the deposit insurance assessment system to make the increase in assessments fairer by requiring riskier institutions to pay a larger share 
together  the proposed changes would improve the way the system differentiates risk among insured institutions and help ensure that the reserve ratio returns to at least percent by the end of the proposed changes to the assessment system include assessing higher rates to institutions with a significant reliance on secured liabilities  which generally raises the fdic s loss in the event of failure without providing additional assessment revenue 
the proposal also would assess higher rates for institutions with a significant reliance on brokered deposits but  for well managed and well capitalized institutions  only when accompanied by rapid asset growth 
brokered deposits combined with rapid asset growth have played a role in a number of costly failures  including some recent ones 
the proposal also would provide incentives in the form of a reduction in assessment rates for institutions to hold long term unsecured debt and  for smaller institutions  high levels of tier capital 
the fdic also voted to maintain the designated reserve ratio at percent as a signal of its long term target for the fund 
the federal reserve board in october approved final amendments to regulation c that revise the rules for reporting price information on higher priced mortgage loans 
the changes are intended to improve the accuracy and usefulness of data reported under the home mortgage disclosure act 
regulation c currently requires lenders to collect and report the spread between the annual percentage rate apr on a mortgage loan and the yield on a treasury security of comparable maturity if the spread is greater than percentage points for a first lien loan or greater than percentage points for a subordinate lien loan 
this difference is known as a rate spread 
under the final rule  a lender will report the spread between the loan s apr and a survey based estimate of aprs currently offered on prime mortgages of a comparable type average prime offer rate if the spread is equal to or greater than percentage points for a first lien loan or equal to or greater than percentage points for a subordinate lien loan 
the board will publish average prime offer rates based on the primary mortgage market survey currently published by freddie mac 
in setting the rate spread reporting threshold  the board sought to cover subprime mortgages and generally avoid covering prime mortgages 
the changes to regulation c conform the threshold for rate spread reporting to the definition of higher priced mortgage loans adopted by the board under regulation z truth in lending in july of the federal reserve board in july approved a final rule for home mortgage loans to better protect consumers and facilitate responsible lending 
the rule prohibits unfair  abusive or deceptive home mortgage lending practices and restricts certain other mortgage practices 
the final rule also establishes advertising standards and requires certain mortgage disclosures to be given to consumers earlier in the transaction 
the final rule  which amends regulation z truth in lending and was adopted under the home ownership and equity protection act hoepa  largely follows a proposal released by the board in december  with enhancements that address ensuing public comments  consumer testing  and further analysis 
the final rule adds four key protections for a newly defined category of higher priced mortgage loans secured by a consumer s principal dwelling 
for loans in this category  these protections will prohibit a lender from making a loan without regard to borrowers ability to repay the loan from income and assets other than the home s value 
a lender complies  in part  by assessing repayment ability based on the highest scheduled payment in the first seven years of the loan 
to show that a lender violated this prohibition  a borrower does not need to demonstrate that it is part of a pattern or practice 
require creditors to verify the income and assets they rely upon to determine repayment ability 
ban any prepayment penalty if the payment can change in the initial four years 
for other higher priced loans  a prepayment penalty period cannot last for more than two years 
require creditors to establish escrow accounts for property taxes and homeowner s insurance for all first lien mortgage loans 
in addition to the rules governing higher priced loans  the rules adopt the following protections for loans secured by a consumer s principal dwelling  regardless of whether the loan is higher priced creditors and mortgage brokers are prohibited from coercing a real estate appraiser to misstate a home s value 
companies that service mortgage loans are prohibited from engaging in certain practices  such as pyramiding late fees 
in addition  servicers are required to credit consumers loan payments as of the date of receipt and provide a payoff statement within a reasonable time of request 
creditors must provide a good faith estimate of the loan costs  including a schedule of payments  within three days after a consumer applies for any mortgage loan secured by a consumer s principal dwelling  such as a home improvement loan or a loan to refinance an existing loan 
currently  early cost estimates are only required for home purchase loans 
consumers cannot be charged any fee until after they receive the early disclosures  except a reasonable fee for obtaining the consumer s credit history 
for all mortgages  the rule also sets additional advertising standards 
advertising rules now require additional information about rates  monthly payments  and other loan features 
the final rule bans seven deceptive or misleading advertising practices  including representing that a rate or payment is fixed when it can change 
the rule s definition of higher priced mortgage loans will capture virtually all loans in the subprime market  but generally exclude loans in the prime market 
to provide an index  the federal reserve board will publish the average prime offer rate  based on a survey currently published by freddie mac 
a loan is higher priced if it is a first lien mortgage and has an annual percentage rate that is percentage points or more above this index  or percentage points if it is a subordinate lien mortgage 
the new rules take effect on october  the single exception is the escrow requirement  which will be phased in during to allow lenders to establish new systems as needed 
in may  the federal reserve board proposed rules to prohibit unfair practices regarding credit cards and overdraft services that would  among other provisions  protect consumers from unexpected increases in the rate charged on pre existing credit card balances 
the rules  proposed for public comment under the federal trade commission act ftc act  also would forbid banks from imposing interest charges using the two cycle billing method  would require that consumers receive a reasonable amount of time to make their credit card payments  and would prohibit the use of payment allocation methods that unfairly maximize interest charges 
they also include protections for consumers that use overdraft services offered by their bank 
the proposed changes to the board s regulation aa unfair or deceptive acts or practices would be complemented by separate proposals that the board is issuing under the truth in lending act regulation z and the truth in savings act regulation dd 
the provisions addressing credit card practices are part of the board s ongoing effort to enhance protections for consumers who use credit cards  and follow the board s proposal to improve the credit card disclosures under the truth in lending act 
the ftc act proposal includes five key protections for consumers that use credit cards banks would be prohibited from increasing the rate on a pre existing credit card balance except under limited circumstances and must allow the consumer to pay off that balance over a reasonable period of time 
banks would be prohibited from applying payments in excess of the minimum in a manner that maximizes interest charges 
banks would be required to give consumers the full benefit of discounted promotional rates on credit cards by applying payments in excess of the minimum to any higher rate balances first  and by providing a grace period for purchases where the consumer is otherwise eligible 
banks would be prohibited from imposing interest charges using the two cycle method  which computes interest on balances on days in billing cycles preceding the most recent billing cycle 
banks would be required to provide consumers a reasonable amount of time to make payments 
the proposal would also address subprime credit cards by limiting the fees that reduce the available credit 
in addition  banks that make firm offers of credit advertising multiple rates or credit limits would be required to disclose in the solicitation the factors that determine whether a consumer will qualify for the lowest rate and highest credit limit 
the board s proposal under the ftc act also addresses acts or practices in connection with a bank s payment of overdrafts on a deposit account  whether the overdraft is created by check  a withdrawal at an automated teller machine  a debit card purchase  or other transactions 
the proposal requires institutions to provide consumers with notice and an opportunity to opt out of the payment of overdrafts  before any overdraft fees or charges may be imposed on consumers accounts 
in december  the fdic issued a proposed rule to improve the process for determining uninsured depositors at larger institutions in the event of a failure 
the measure is intended to allow the fdic to make funds promptly available to insured deposit customers in the unlikely event that a large financial institution is closed 
the proposal is broken into two parts 
one section relates to so called covered institutions  those that have at least billion in domestic deposits  have more than  deposit accounts  or have total assets of more than billion  regardless of the number of deposits or accounts 
a covered institution would be required to adopt mechanisms that  in the event of a failure  would place provisional holds on large deposit accounts in a percentage specified by the fdic  provide the fdic with deposit account data in a standard format  and allow automatic removal of provisional holds once the fdic makes an insurance determination 
the second part applies to all fdic insured institutions  regardless of size  and governs the specific time and circumstance under which account balances will be determined in the event of a failure 
the fdic is proposing to use the end of day ledger balance as normally calculated by the institution 
by using the end of day ledger  the fdic will be able to apply a single standard across all failed banks in order to treat every transaction equally 
this is also the same deposit balance used for call report and assessment purposes 
there would be no requirements placed on open institutions as a result of this provision 
the fdic places a high priority on providing access to insured deposits promptly and  in the past  has usually been able to allow most depositors access to their deposits on the next business day 
if adopted  the proposed rule would better enable the fdic to continue this practice  especially for the larger  more complex institutions it insures 
the federal reserve board in november approved final rules to implement the basel ii framework for large bank capital requirements 
the new risk based capital requirements apply to large  internationally active banking organizations in the united states 
the new capital adequacy requirements were designed to align regulatory capital requirements with actual risks and are expected to strengthen banking organizations risk management practices 
basel ii would replace the current us rules implementing the basel capital accord of basel i and be mandatory for large  internationally active banking organizations so called core banking organizations with at least billion in total assets or at least billion in foreign exposure and optional for others 
under basel ii  core banking organizations would be required to enhance the measurement and management of their risks  including credit risk and operational risk 
core banking organizations will be required to have rigorous processes for assessing their overall capital adequacy in relation to their total risk profile and to publicly disclose information about their risk profile and capital adequacy 
the new us basel ii rule is technically consistent in most respects with international approaches and includes a number of prudential safeguards as originally proposed in september these safeguards include a requirement that banking organizations satisfactorily complete a four quarter parallel run period before operating under the basel ii framework  a requirement that an institution satisfactorily complete a series of transitional periods before operating under basel ii without floors  and a commitment by the agencies to conduct ongoing analysis of the framework to ensure basel ii is working as intended 
basel ii in the united states will be implemented with retention of the leverage ratio and prompt corrective action pca requirements  which will continue to bolster capital and complement risk based measures 
following a successful parallel run period  a banking organization would have to progress through three transitional periods each lasting at least one year  during which there would be floors on potential declines in risk based capital requirements 
those transitional floors would limit maximum cumulative reductions of a banking organization s risk based capital requirements to percent during the first transitional floor period  percent during the second transitional floor period  and percent during the third transitional floor period 
a banking organization would need approval from its primary federal regulator to move into each of the transitional floor periods  and at the end of the third transitional floor period to move to full basel ii 
in september  the sec and federal reserve board of governors adopted final rules to implement the bank broker provisions of the gramm leach bliley act 
the rules define the scope of securities activities that banks may conduct without registering with the sec as a securities broker and implement the most important broker exceptions for banks adopted by the glb act 
specifically  the rules implement the statutory exceptions that allow a bank  subject to certain conditions  to continue to conduct securities transactions for its customers as part of the bank s trust and fiduciary  custodial and deposit sweep functions  and to refer customers to a securities broker dealer pursuant to a networking arrangement with the broker dealer 
the rules are designed to accommodate the business practices of banks and to protect investors 
the effective date for compliance is the first day of the bank s fiscal year commencing after september  the federal financial regulatory agencies in december issued a new interagency policy statement on the allowance for loan and lease losses alll along with supplemental frequently asked questions 
the policy statement revises and replaces a policy statement on the alll 
the agencies issued the revised policy statement in view of today s uncertain economic environment and the presence of concentrations in untested loan products in the loan portfolios of insured depository institutions 
the policy statement has also been revised to conform with generally accepted accounting principles gaap and post supervisory guidance 
the policy statement described the responsibilities of the boards of directors  management  and banking examiners regarding the alll  factors to be considered in the estimation of the alll  and the objectives and elements of an effective loan review system  including a sound credit grading system 
the policy statement reiterates that each institution has a responsibility for developing  maintaining and documenting a comprehensive  systematic  and consistently applied process appropriate to its size and the nature  scope  and risk of its lending activities for determining the amounts of the alll and the provision for loan and lease losses and states that each institution should ensure controls are in place to consistently determine the alll in accordance with gaap  the institution s stated policies and procedures  management s best judgment and relevant supervisory guidance 
the policy statement also restates that insured depository institutions must maintain an alll at a level that is appropriate to cover estimated credit losses on individually evaluated loans determined to be impaired as well as estimated credit losses inherent in the remainder of the loan and lease portfolio  and that estimates of credit losses should reflect consideration of all significant factors that affect the collectibility of the portfolio as of the evaluation date 
the policy statement states that prudent  conservative  but not excessive  loan loss allowances that represent management s best estimate from within an acceptable range of estimated losses are appropriate 
the office of the comptroller of the currency  the board of governors of the federal reserve system  and the federal deposit insurance corporation in december issued final guidance on sound risk management practices for concentrations in commercial real estate lending 
the agencies observed that the commercial real estate is an area in which some banks are becoming increasingly concentrated  especially with small to medium sized banks that face strong competition in their other business lines 
the agencies support banks serving a vital role in their communities by supplying credit for business and real estate development 
however  the agencies are concerned that rising commercial real estate loan concentrations may expose institutions to unanticipated earnings and capital volatility in the event of adverse changes in commercial real estate markets 
the guidance provides supervisory criteria  including numerical indicators to assist in identifying institutions with potentially significant commercial real estate loan concentrations that may warrant greater supervisory scrutiny  but such criteria are not limits on commercial real estate lending 
california assembly bill was signed by gov 
schwarzenegger on july  and became law on january  among other things  the bill eliminated unnecessary applications that consume time and resources of bank licensees and which in many cases are now perfunctory 
all of current article locations of head office of chapter  and all of chapter branch offices  other places of business and automated teller machines were repealed 
a new chapter bank offices was added 
the new chapter requires notice to the california department of financial institutions cdfi the establishment of offices  rather than the current application process 
many of the current branch applications are perfunctory in nature and or provide for a waiver of application 
banks  on an exception basis  may be subject to more stringent requirements as deemed necessary 
as an example  new banks  banks undergoing a change in ownership and banks in less than satisfactory condition may be required to obtain prior approval from the cdfi before establishing offices if such activity is deemed to create an issue of safety and soundness 
the bill eliminated unnecessary provisions in the banking law that are either outdated or have become undue restrictions to bank licensees 
chapter powers and miscellaneous provisions was repealed 
a new chapter restrictions and prohibited practices was added 
this chapter brings together restrictions in bank activities as formerly found in chapter prohibited practices and penalties 
however  in bringing the restrictions into the new chapter  various provisions were updated to remove the need for prior approval by the dfi commissioner 
the bill renumbered current banking law sections to align like sections 
chapter authorizations for banks was added 
the purpose of the chapter is to provide exceptions to certain activities that would otherwise be prohibited by other laws outside of the financial code 
the bill added article loan and investment limitations to chapter commercial banks 
this article is new in concept and acknowledges that investment decisions are business decisions so long as there is a diversification of the investments to spread any risk 
the risk is diversified in this article by placing a limitation on the loans and investments that can be made to any one entity 
this section is a trade off for elimination of applications to the dfi for approval of investments in securities  which were repealed 
other changes ab made to the banking law authorized a bank or trust acting in any capacity under a court or private trust to arrange for the deposit of securities in a securities depository or federal reserve bank  and provided how they may be held by the securities depository  reduced from to the amount of eligible assets to be maintained at an approved depository by an office of a foreign other nation bank for the protection of the interests of creditors of the bank s business in this state or for the protection of the public interest  enabled the cdfi to issue an order against a bank licensee parent or subsidiary  provided that the examinations may be conducted in alternate examination periods if the cdfi concludes that an examination of the state bank by the appropriate federal regulator carries out the purpose of this section  but the cdfi may not accept two consecutive examination reports made by federal regulators  provided that the cdfi may examine subsidiaries of every california state bank  state trust company  and foreign other nation bank to the extent and whenever and as often as the cdfi shall deem advisable  enabled the cdfi issue an order or a final order to now include any bank holding company or subsidiary of the bank  trust company  or foreign banking corporation that is violating or failing to comply with any applicable law  or is conducting activities in an unsafe or injurious manner  enabled the cdfi to take action against a person who has engaged in or participated in any unsafe or unsound act with regard to a bank  including a former employee who has left the bank 
in california  a new section was added to the financial code that exempts from a bank from obtaining a securities permit for the following transactions any offer but not a sale not involving a public offering by a bank organized under the laws of this state of its securities the execution and delivery of any agreement for the sale of the securities pursuant to the offer if no part of the consideration for the securities is paid to or received by the bank and none of the securities are issued until the sale of the securities is authorized by the commissioner or exempted from authorization 
any stock split by a bank organized under the laws of this state that is effected pursuant to an amendment to its articles  an agreement of merger  or a certificate of ownership that has been approved by the commissioner  unless this exemption is withheld by order of the commissioner any offer or sale of securities by a bank organized under the laws of this state that is either to a person actually approved by the commissioner pursuant to section of the financial code to acquire control of the bank if all of the material terms and conditions of the offer and sale of securities are disclosed in the application for approval specified in section and the offer and sale of securities is in accordance with the terms and subject to the conditions of the approval to acquire control or in a transaction exempted from the approval requirement of section by a regulation or an order of the commissioner  unless this exemption is withheld by order of the commissioner 
in california  effective january   a new law financial code section recognizes the ability of mortgage brokers to obtain the benefit of non interest bearing accounts on trust funds deposited in a commercial bank 
the provision applies to real estate brokers who collect payments or provide services in connection with a loan secured by a lien on real property and permits a mortgage broker to earn interest on an interest bearing account at a financial institution 
interest on funds received by a real estate broker who collects payments or provides services for an institutional investor in connection with a loan secured by commercial real property may inure to the broker  if agreed to in writing by the broker and the institutional investor 
for purposes of this law  commercial real property means real estate improved with other than a one to four family residence 
a california law makes it easier for california banks to accept deposits from local government agencies 
under the old law  local agency deposits over  had to be secured by collateral 
pursuant to the enactment of assembly bill  banks would be able to acquire surplus public deposits exceeding  without pledging collateral if they participate in a deposit placement service where excess amounts are placed in certificates of deposit at other institutions within a network 
such a network of which currently there is only one available in the market permits the entire amount of a customer s deposit to be fdic insured  and the bank taking the original deposit retains the benefit of the full amount of the deposit for lending or other purposes 
ab clarifies that a local agency may deposit up to of its surplus funds in certificates of deposit at a bank  savings association  savings bank  or credit union that participates in such a deposit sharing network 
since the entire amount of the deposits would be fdic insured  a bank would not be required to pledge collateral 
the bill permits agencies to make these deposits until january  it is impossible to predict what effect the enactment of certain of the above mentioned legislation will have on the company 
moreover  it is likely that other bills affecting the business of banks may be introduced in the future by the united states congress or california legislature

item a 
risk factors there are risk factors that may affect the company s business and impact the results of operations  some of which are beyond the control of the company 
difficult market conditions and economic trends have adversely affected the banking industry and could adversely affect the company s business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
the company is operating in a challenging and uncertain economic environment  including generally uncertain conditions nationally and locally in its markets 
financial institutions continue to be affected by declines in the real estate market that have negatively impacted the credit performance of construction  commercial real estate loans  and residential mortgage loans and resulted in significant write downs of assets by many financial institutions 
concerns over the stability of the financial markets and the economy have resulted in decreased lending by financial institutions to their customers and to each other 
the company retains direct exposure to the residential and commercial real estate markets  and it is affected by these events 
continued declines in real estate values  home sales volumes and financial stress on borrowers as a result of the uncertain economic environment  including job losses  could have an adverse affect on the company s borrowers or their customers  which could adversely affect the company s business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
the company s ability to assess the creditworthiness of customers and to estimate the losses inherent in its credit portfolio is made more complex by these difficult market and economic conditions 
the company also expects to face increased regulation and government oversight as a result of these downward trends 
this increased government action may increase the company s costs and limit its ability to pursue certain business opportunities 
in addition  the company may be required to pay even higher fdic deposit insurance premiums than the recently increased level  because financial institution failures resulting from the depressed market conditions and other factors have depleted and may continue to deplete the deposit insurance fund and reduce its ratio of reserves to insured deposits 
a prolonged national economic recession or further deterioration of these conditions in the company s markets could drive losses beyond that which is provided for in its allowance for credit losses and result in the following consequences increases in loan delinquencies  increases in nonperforming assets and foreclosures  decreases in demand for the company s products and services  which could adversely affect its liquidity position  and decreases in the value of the collateral securing the company s loans  especially real estate  which could reduce customers borrowing power 
the company does not believe these difficult conditions are likely to improve in the near future 
a worsening of these conditions would likely exacerbate the adverse effects of these difficult economic conditions on the company  its customers and the other financial institutions in its market 
as a result  the company may experience increases in foreclosures  delinquencies and customer bankruptcies  as well as more restricted access to funds 
the us treasury and the fdic have initiated programs to address economic stabilization  yet the efficacy of these programs in stabilizing the economy and the banking system at large are uncertain 
current levels of market volatility are unprecedented and could adversely impact the company s results of operations and access to capital 
the capital and credit markets have been experiencing volatility and disruption for more than a year 
in recent months  the volatility and disruption has reached unprecedented levels 
in some cases  the markets have produced downward pressure on stock prices and credit capacity for certain issuers without regard to those issuers underlying financial strength 
if the current levels of market disruption and volatility continue or worsen  there can be no assurance that the company will not experience further adverse effects  which may be material  on its ability to access capital and on its business  financial condition and results of operations 
liquidity risk could impair the company s ability to fund operations and jeopardize its financial condition 
liquidity is essential to the company s business 
an inability to raise funds through deposits  borrowings  the sale of loans and other sources could have a substantial negative effect on its liquidity 
the company s access to funding sources in amounts adequate to finance its activities or on terms which are acceptable to it could be impaired by factors that affect the company specifically or the financial services industry or economy in general 
factors that could detrimentally impact the company s access to liquidity sources include a decrease in the level of its business activity as a result of a downturn in the markets in which its loans are concentrated or adverse regulatory action against it 
the company s ability to borrow could also be impaired by factors that are not specific to it  such as a disruption in the financial markets or negative views and expectations about the prospects for the financial services industry in light of the recent turmoil faced by banking organizations and the continued deterioration in credit markets 
the company s financial performance is subject to interest rate risk 
the company s operations are greatly influenced by general economic conditions and by related monetary and fiscal policies of the federal government 
deposit flows and the funding costs are influenced by interest rates of competing investments and general market rates of interest 
lending activities are affected by the demand for loans  which in turn is affected by the interest rates at which such financing may be offered and by other factors affecting the availability of funds 
the company s performance is substantially dependent on net interest income  which is the difference between the interest income received from interest earning assets and the interest expense incurred in connection with our interest bearing liabilities 
to reduce the company s exposure to interest rate fluctuations  management seeks to manage the balances of interest sensitive assets and liabilities  and maintain appropriate maturity and repricing parameters for these assets and liabilities 
a mismatch between the amount of rate sensitive assets and rate sensitive liabilities in any time period may expose the company to interest rate risk 
generally  if rate sensitive assets exceed rate sensitive liabilities  the net interest margin will be positively impacted during a rising rate environment and negatively impacted during a declining rate environment 
when rate sensitive liabilities exceed rate sensitive assets  the net interest margin will generally be positively impacted during a declining rate environment and negatively impacted during a rising rate environment 
increases in the level of interest rates may reduce the overall level of loans originated by the company  and  thus  the amount of loan and commitment fees earned  as well as the market value of investment securities and other interest earning assets 
moreover  fluctuations in interest rates may also result in disintermediation  which is the flow of funds away from depository institutions into direct investments  such as corporate securities and other investment vehicles which  because of the absence of federal deposit insurance  generally pay higher rates of return than depository institutions 
the continued deterioration of local economic conditions in the company s market area could hurt profitability 
the company s operations are located primarily in fresno  madera  kern  and santa clara counties  and are concentrated in fresno county and surrounding areas 
as a result of this geographic concentration  the company s financial results depend largely upon economic conditions in these areas 
the local economy in the company s market areas rely heavily on agriculture  real estate  professional and business services  manufacturing  trade and tourism 
the significant economic downturn experienced in the sub prime lending and credit markets since the later part of  has negatively impacted the company s operations and financial condition to some degree  and may further worsen with further deterioration of local and state wide economic conditions 
poor economic conditions could cause the company to incur losses associated with higher default rates and decreased collateral values in the loan portfolio 
concentrations in commercial and industrial loans  real estate secured commercial loans  and real estate construction loans  may expose the company to increased lending risks  especially in the event of a recession 
the company has significant concentrations in commercial real estate and real estate construction loans 
as of december    and of the company s loan portfolio was concentrated in these two categories  respectively 
in addition  the company has many commercial loans to businesses in the construction and real estate industry 
there has been significant volatility in real estate values in the company s market area in recent years  and the occurrence of an extended real estate recession affecting these market areas would likely reduce the security for many of the company s loans and adversely affect the ability of many of borrowers to repay loan balances due the company and require increased provisions to the allowance for loan losses 
therefore  the company s financial condition and results of operations may be adversely affected by a decline in the value of the real estate securing the company s loans 
the small to medium sized businesses that the company lends to may have fewer resources to weather a downturn in the economy  which may impair a borrower s ability to repay a loan to the company that could materially harm the company s operating results 
the company targets its business development and marketing strategy primarily to serve the banking and financial services needs of small to medium sized businesses 
these small to medium sized businesses frequently have smaller market share than their competition  may be more vulnerable to economic downturns  often need substantial additional capital to expand or compete and may experience significant volatility in operating results 
any one or more of these factors may impair the borrower s ability to repay a loan 
in addition  the success of a small to medium sized business often depends on the management talents and efforts of one or two persons or a small group of persons  and the death  disability or resignation of one or more of these persons could have a material adverse impact on the business and its ability to repay a loan 
economic downturns and other events that negatively impact the company s market areas could cause the company to incur substantial credit losses that could negatively affect the company s results of operations  financial condition and cash flows 
the company faces strong competition  which may adversely affect its operating results 
in recent years  competition for bank customers  the source of deposits and loans for the company has greatly intensified 
this competition includes larger regional and national banks and other fdic insured depository institutions in many of the communities the company serves  finance companies  investment banking and brokerage firms  and insurance companies that offer bank like products  credit unions  which can offer highly competitive rates on loans and deposits because they receive tax advantages not available to commercial banks  and technology based financial institutions including large national and super regional banks offering on line deposit  bill payment  and mortgage loan application services 
some of the financial services organizations with which the company competes are not subject to the same degree of regulation as is imposed on bank holding companies and federally insured financial institutions 
as a result  these non bank competitors have certain advantages over the company in accessing funding and in providing various banking related services 
by virtue of their larger capital position  regional and national banks have substantially larger lending limits than the company  and can provide certain services to their customers which the company is not able to offer directly  such as trust and international services 
many of these larger banks also operate with greater economies of scale which result in lower operating costs than the company on a per unit basis 
other existing single or multi branch community banks  or new community bank start ups  have marketing strategies similar to united security bancshares 
these other community banks can open new branches in the communities the company serves and compete directly for customers who want the high level of service community banks offer 
other community banks also compete for the same management personnel and the same potential acquisition and merger candidates 
ultimately  competition can drive down the company s interest margins and reduce profitability  as well as make it more difficult for the company to achieve its growth objectives 
the company s growth and expansion strategy may not prove to be successful and as a result  its market value and profitability may suffer 
the company plans to grow operations within its market area and expand into new market areas when it makes strategic business sense  however the company s capacity to manage any such growth will depend primarily on the ability to attract and retain qualified personnel  monitor operations  maintain earnings and control costs 
the company expects to continue to grow its assets and deposits  the products and services which it offers and accordingly the scale of its operations 
the company s ability to manage growth successfully will depend on the ability to maintain cost controls and asset quality while attracting additional loans and deposits on favorable terms 
if the company grows too quickly and is not able to control costs and maintain asset quality  this rapid growth could materially adversely affect the financial performance of the company 
the future successful growth of the company will depend on the ability of its officers and other key employees to continue to implement and improve operational  credit  financial  management and other internal risk controls and processes  reporting systems and procedures  and to manage a growing number of customer relationships 
the company may not successfully implement improvements to management information and control systems  and control procedures and processes  in an efficient or timely manner and may discover deficiencies in existing systems and controls 
in particular  the company s controls and procedures must be able to accommodate an increase in expected loan volume and the infrastructure that comes with growth 
thus  the company s growth strategy may divert management from existing businesses and may require the company to incur additional expenditures to expand its administrative and operational infrastructure 
if the company is unable to manage future expansion in its operations  it may experience compliance and operational problems  need to slow the pace of growth  or need to incur additional expenditures beyond current projections to support such growth  any one of which could adversely affect the company s business and profitability 
the company may need to raise additional capital in the future and such capital may not be available when needed or at all 
the company may need to raise additional capital in the future to provide it with sufficient capital resources and liquidity to meet its commitments and business needs 
in addition  the company may elect to raise additional capital to support its business or to finance acquisitions  if any 
the company s ability to raise additional capital  if needed  will depend on  among other things  conditions in the capital markets at that time  which are outside of its control  and its financial performance 
the ongoing liquidity crisis and the loss of confidence in financial institutions may increase the company s cost of funding and limit its access to some of its customary sources of capital  including  but not limited to  inter bank borrowings  repurchase agreements and borrowings from the discount window of the federal reserve 
the company cannot assure you that such capital will be available to it on acceptable terms or at all 
any occurrence that may limit its access to the capital markets  such as a decline in the confidence of investors  depositors of the banks or counterparties participating in the capital markets  may adversely affect the company s capital costs and its ability to raise capital and  in turn  its liquidity 
an inability to raise additional capital on acceptable terms when needed could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
the loss of any of the company s executive officers or key personnel could be damaging to the business 
the company depends upon the skills and reputations of its executive officers and key employees for its future success 
the loss of any of these key persons or the inability to attract and retain other key personnel could adversely affect the company s business operations 
the company could experience loan losses  which exceed the overall allowance for loan losses 
the risk of credit losses on loans and leases varies with  among other things  general economic conditions  the type of loan being made  the creditworthiness of the borrower  and  in the case of collateralized loans  the value and marketability of the collateral 
the company maintains an allowance for loan losses based upon  among other things  historical experience  an evaluation of economic conditions  and regular reviews of delinquencies and loan portfolio quality 
based upon such factors  management makes various assumptions and determinations about the ultimate collectibility of the loan portfolio and provides an allowance for losses based upon a percentage of the outstanding balances and for specific loans where their collectibility is considered to be questionable 
as of december   the company s allowance for loan losses was approximately million representing of gross outstanding loans 
although management believes that the allowance is adequate  there can be no absolute assurance that it will be sufficient to cover future loan losses 
although the company uses the best information available to make determinations with respect to adequacy of the allowance for loan losses  future adjustments may be necessary if economic conditions change substantially from the assumptions used or if negative developments occur with respect to non performing or performing loans 
if management s assumptions or conclusions prove to be incorrect and the allowance for loan losses is not adequate to absorb future losses  or if company s regulatory agencies require an increase in the allowance for loan losses  the company s earnings  and potentially its capital  could be significantly and adversely impacted 
the company may become subject to environmental liability risk associated with lending activities 
a significant portion of the company s loan portfolio is secured by real property 
during the ordinary course of business  we may foreclose on and take title to properties securing certain loans 
in doing so  there is a risk that hazardous or toxic substances could be found on these properties 
if hazardous or toxic substances are found  the company may be liable for remediation costs  as well as for personal injury and property damage 
environmental laws may require the company to incur substantial expenses and may materially reduce the affected property s value or limit the ability to use or sell the affected property 
in addition  future laws or more stringent interpretations or enforcement policies with respect to existing laws may increase our exposure to environmental liability 
although the company has policies and procedures to perform an environmental review before initiating any foreclosure action on nonresidential real property  these reviews may not be sufficient to detect all potential environmental hazards 
the remediation costs and any other financial liabilities associated with an environmental hazard could have a material adverse effect on the company s financial condition and results of operations 
the regulatory environment under which the company operates may have an adverse impact on the banking industry 
the company is subject to extensive regulatory supervision and oversight from both federal and state authorities 
regulatory oversight of the company is provided by the federal reserve bank frb and the california department of financial institutions dfi 
future legislation and government may adversely impact the company and the commercial banking industry in general 
future regulatory changes may also alter the structure and competitive relationship among financial institutions 
the company may be exposed to compliance risk resulting from violations or nonconformity with laws  rules  regulations  internal policies and procedures  or ethical standards set forth by regulatory authorities 
the company may also be subject to compliance risk in situations where laws or rules governing certain products or activities of the company s customers may be uncertain or untested 
compliance risk exposes the company to fines  civil money penalties  payment of damages  and the potential voiding of contracts 
compliance risk can result in diminished reputation  reduced franchise value  limited business opportunities  and reduced growth potential 
if the company lost a significant portion of its low cost core deposits  it would negatively impact profitability 
the company s profitability depends in part on its success in attracting and retaining a stable base of low cost deposits 
as of december   noninterest bearing checking accounts comprised of the company s deposit base  and interest bearing checking and money market accounts comprised an additional and  respectively 
the company considers these deposits to be core deposits 
if the company lost a significant portion of these low cost deposits  it would negatively impact its profitability and long term growth objectives 
while management generally does not believe these deposits are sensitive to interest rate fluctuations  the competition for these deposits in the company s market area is strong and if the company were to lose a significant portion of these low cost deposits  it would negatively affect business operations 
the company s internal controls and procedures may fail or be circumvented 
management regularly reviews and updates our internal controls  disclosure controls and procedures  and corporate governance policies and procedures 
any system of controls  however well designed and operated  is based  in part  on certain assumptions and can provide only reasonable  not absolute  assurances that the objectives of the system are met 
any failure or circumvention of the company s controls and procedures or failure to comply with regulations related to controls and procedures could have a material adverse effect the company s business  results of operations and financial condition 
the company s information systems may experience an interruption or breach in security 
the company relies heavily on communications and information systems to conduct its business 
any failure  interruption or breach in security of these systems could result in failures or disruptions in customer relationship management  general ledger  deposit  loan and other systems 
while the company has policies and procedures designed to prevent or limit the effect of the failure  interruption or security breach of its information systems  there can be no assurance that we can prevent any such failures  interruptions or security breaches or  if they do occur  that they will be adequately addressed 
the occurrence of any failures  interruptions or security breaches of the company s information systems could damage our reputation  result in a loss of customer business  subject the company to additional regulatory scrutiny  or expose it to civil litigation and possible financial liability  any of which could have a material adverse effect on the company s financial condition and results of operations 
the company continually encounters technological change 
the financial services industry is continually undergoing rapid technological change with frequent introductions of new technology driven products and services 
the effective use of technology increases efficiency and enables financial institutions to better serve customers and to reduce costs 
the company s future success depends  in part  upon its ability to address the needs of its customers by using technology to provide products and services that will satisfy customer demands  as well as to create additional efficiencies in the company s operations 
many of the company s competitors have substantially greater resources to invest in technological improvements 
we may not be able to effectively implement new technology driven products and services or be successful in marketing these products and services to the company s customers and even if such products and services are implemented  the company may incur substantial costs in doing so 
failure to successfully keep pace with technological change affecting the financial services industry could have a material adverse impact on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations the company is subject to other than temporary impairment risk the company recognizes an impairment charge when the decline in the fair value of equity  debt securities and cost method investments below their cost basis are judged to be other than temporary 
significant judgment is used to identify events or circumstances that would likely have a significant adverse effect on the future use of the investment 
the company considers various factors in determining whether an impairment is other than temporary  including the severity and duration of the impairment  forecasted recovery  the financial condition and near term prospects of the investee  and our ability and intent to hold the investment for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in market value 
information about unrealized gains and losses is subject to changing conditions 
the values of securities with unrealized gains and losses will fluctuate  as will the values of securities that we identify as potentially distressed 
our current evaluation of other than temporary impairments reflects our intent to hold securities for a reasonable period of time sufficient for a forecasted recovery of fair value 
however  our intent to hold certain of these securities may change in future periods as a result of facts and circumstances impacting a specific security 
if our intent to hold a security with an unrealized loss changes  and we do not expect the security to fully recover prior to the expected time of disposition  we will write down the security to its fair value in the period that our intent to hold the security changes 
the process of evaluating the potential impairment of goodwill and other intangibles is highly subjective and requires significant judgment 
the company estimates expected future cash flows of its various businesses and determines the carrying value of these businesses 
the company exercises judgment in assigning and allocating certain assets and liabilities to these businesses 
the company then compares the carrying value  including goodwill and other intangibles  to the discounted future cash flows 
if the total of future cash flows is less than the carrying amount of the assets  an impairment loss is recognized based on the excess of the carrying amount over the fair value of the assets 
estimates of the future cash flows associated with the assets are critical to these assessments 
changes in these estimates based on changed economic conditions or business strategies could result in material impairment charges in future periods 
if the goodwill that the company recorded in connection with a business acquisition becomes impaired  it could require charges to earnings  which would have a negative impact on the company s financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
goodwill represents the amount of acquisition cost over the fair value of net assets the company acquired in the purchase of another financial institution 
the company reviews goodwill for impairment at least annually  or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of the asset might be impaired 
the company determines impairment by comparing the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill 
if the carrying amount of the reporting unit goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill  an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess 
any such adjustments are reflected in the company s results of operations in the periods in which they become known 
at december   the company s goodwill totaled million 
while the company has not recorded any such impairment charges since it initially recorded the goodwill  there can be no assurance that the company s future evaluations of goodwill will not result in findings of impairment and related write downs  which may have a material adverse effect on its financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
the company relies on dividends from its subsidiaries for most of its revenue 
united security bancshares is a separate and distinct legal entity from its subsidiaries 
the company receives substantially all of its revenue from dividends from its subsidiary  united security bank 
these dividends are the principal source of funds to pay dividends on common stock and interest on the company s junior subordinated debt 
various federal and or state laws and regulations limit the amount of dividends that united security bank and certain non bank subsidiaries may pay to united security bancshares 
also  united security bancshares right to participate in a distribution of assets upon a subsidiary s liquidation or reorganization is subject to the prior claims of the subsidiary s creditors 
in the event united security bank is unable to pay dividends to united security bancshares  the company may not be able to service debt  pay obligations or pay dividends on common stock 
the inability to receive dividends from united security bank could have a material adverse effect on united security bancshares business  financial condition and results of operations 
the holders of the company s junior subordinated debentures have rights that are senior to those of the company s shareholders 
on july  the company issued million of floating rate junior subordinated debentures in connection with a million trust preferred securities issuance by its subsidiary  united security bancshares capital trust ii 
the junior subordinated debentures mature in july the company conditionally guarantees payments of the principal and interest on the trust preferred securities 
the company s junior subordinated debentures are senior to holders of common stock 
as a result  the company must make payments on the junior subordinated debentures and the related trust preferred securities before any dividends can be paid on our common stock and  in the event of bankruptcy  dissolution or liquidation  the holders of the debentures must be satisfied before any distributions can be made to the holders of common stock 
the company has the right to defer distributions on our junior subordinated debentures and the related trust preferred securities for up to five years  during which time no dividends may be paid to holders of common stock 
severe weather  natural disasters  acts of war or terrorism and other external events could significantly impact the company s business 
severe weather  natural disasters  including but not limited to earthquakes and droughts  acts of war or terrorism and other adverse external events could have a significant impact on the company s ability to conduct business 
such events could affect the stability of our deposit base  impair the ability of borrowers to repay outstanding loans  impair the value of collateral securing loans  cause significant property damage  result in loss of revenue and or cause the company to incur additional expenses 
severe weather or natural disasters  acts of war or terrorism or other adverse external events may occur in the future 
although management has established disaster recovery policies and procedures  there can be no assurance of the effectiveness of such policies and procedures  and the occurrence of any such event could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations

current trends affecting results of operations and financial position the company s overall operations are impacted by a number of factors  including not only interest rates and margin spreads  which impact results of operations  but also the composition of the company s balance sheet 
one of the primary strategic goals of the company is to maintain a mix of assets that will generate a reasonable rate of return without undue risk  and to finance those assets with a low cost and stable source of funds 
liquidity and capital resources must also be considered in the planning process to mitigate risk and allow for growth

with approximately of the loan portfolio in floating rate instruments at december   the effects of market rates continue to be realized almost immediately on loan yields 
loans yielded during the year ended december   as compared to and for the years ended december  and december   respectively 
with a significant increase in nonaccrual loans during  and specifically during the second half of  the company reversed approximately million in interest income during the year  reducing the loan yield by approximately basis points during the year ended december  loan yield was enhanced during  as a nonperforming loan was paid off during the first quarter of  providing an additional  in previously unrecognized interest income that would not have otherwise been recognized during  and an enhancement to loan yield of approximately basis points for the year ended december  although market rates of interest declined so rapidly during  deposit repricing was slow to follow the decline in loan rates during the second half of however  with the recent stock market declines  combined with more substantial fdic insurance coverage  deposit rates have begun to decline as investors have sought safety in bank deposits 
borrowing rates have declined significantly during the fourth quarter of  resulting in overnight and short term borrowing rates of less than at december  the company has benefited from these rate declines  as it has utilized overnight and short term borrowing lines through the federal reserve and federal home loan bank to a greater degree during the company s average cost of funds was for the year ended december  as compared to and for the years ended december  and  respectively 
total noninterest income of million reported for the year ended december  decreased million or as compared to the year ended december   primarily as the result of reductions of approximately million in sfas no 
fair market value gains between the two twelve month periods on the company s junior subordinated debt

the stock dividends for the third and fourth quarters of replace the normal quarterly cash dividends and reflect a similar value 
although the company s capital position remains strong  the change in the dividend from cash to stock was employed as a precaution against uncertainties in the current economic environment  and specifically the real estate family residential real estate market which has had an impact on the company s construction and related land and lot loan portfolio 
the company believes  given the current uncertainties in the economy and unprecedented declines in real estate valuations in our markets  it is prudent to retain capital in this environment  and better position the company for future growth opportunities

approximately half of the decline in loans experienced during was the result of oreo properties that were transferred from the loan portfolio in settlement of loan obligations  the majority of which were transferred during the fourth quarter of the most significant declines in loan balances experienced during were in construction loans which decreased million or and in real estate mortgage loans which decreased million or between december  and december  on average  loan volume remained stable between and  with loans averaging million or of average earning assets for the year ended december  as compared to million or of average earning assets for the year ended december  deposits of million at december  declined million or during the year ended december  primarily as the result of a decline in brokered time deposits  and deposits obtained from the state of california 
as part of its asset liability strategy  the company chose to let brokered time deposits mature during  and to use alternative lower cost funding sources including fhlb term advances and overnight borrowings from the federal reserve 
this strategy has worked well for the company during and helped to reduce funding costs significantly  although the company will seek to attract additional deposits during as they continue to become less expensive  relative to wholesale funding sources 
wholesale borrowings  including fhlb advances and federal reserve overnight borrowings  increased million during to a balance of million at december  the average cost of those wholesale borrowings was and for the years ended december  and december   representing a cost reduction of basis points between the two twelve month periods 
although the company has realized significant interest expense reductions by utilizing these borrowing lines  the use of such lines are monitored closely to ensure sound balance sheet management in light of the current economic and credit environment 
the cost of the company s subordinated debentures issued by usb capital trust ii has declined significantly as market rates of interest have fallen during the year ended december  with pricing at month libor plus basis points  the effective cost of the subordinated debt was at december   representing a rate reduction of basis points between december  and december  as a result of interest rate changes experienced during in relation to market spreads for junior subordinated debentures  the company recorded an additional million pretax fair value gain on its junior subordinated debt bringing the total cumulative gain recorded on the debt to million at december  nonperforming assets increased significantly during the second half of as real estate markets continue to suffer from the mortgage crisis which began during mid nonaccrual loans totaled million at december   representing an increase of million as compared to the balance of million reported at december  the increase in nonaccrual loans experienced during is comprised largely of construction and real estate development loans 
in determining the adequacy of the underlying collateral related to theses loans  management monitors trends within specific geographical areas  loan to value ratios  appraisals  and other credit issues related to the specific loans 
during the later part of  the company successfully worked with many of its borrowers to re margin loans as collateral values declined  then weakening the company s credit position and increasing the potential for losses 
impaired loans of million at december  increased million during the year ended december  and increased  during the fourth quarter of classified loans comprised of the total of nonaccrual  impaired  and substandard loans totaled million at december   representing an increase of million from the balance of million reported at december   but a decrease of million from the balance of million reported at september  the decrease in classified loans experienced during the fourth quarter of is primarily the result of more than in nonaccrual loans that were transferred to oreo during that quarter 
other real estate owned through foreclosure increased million between december  and december   as five properties were moved through foreclosure proceedings during the first nine months of  and an additional nine properties were moved during the fourth quarter of  when all other means of collection failed 
one of those foreclosed properties totaling million was subsequently sold during the second quarter of as a result of these events  nonperforming assets as a percentage of total assets increased from at december  to at december  management continues to monitor economic conditions in the real estate market for signs of further deterioration or improvement which may impact the level of the allowance for loan losses required to cover identified losses in the loan portfolio 
increased charge offs and additional loan loss provisions made during the year ended december  impacted earnings during much of  but the provisions made to the allowance for credit loses  totaling   million  and million during the first  second  third  and fourth quarters of  respectively  are adequate to cover inherent losses in the loan portfolio 
loan and lease net charge offs totaled million for the year ended december  as compared to net charge offs of million and  for the years ended december  and december   respectively 
the company continues to emphasize relationship banking and core deposit growth  and has focused greater attention on its market area of fresno  madera  and kern counties  as well as campbell  in santa clara county 
the san joaquin valley and other california markets have shown weaker demand for construction lending and commercial lending from small and medium size businesses  as commercial and residential real estate markets declined during and throughout the year ended december  has presented significant challenges for the banking industry with tightening credit markets  weakening real estate markets  and increased loan losses adversely affecting the industry 
the company continually evaluates its strategic business plan as economic and market factors change in its market area 
growth and increasing market share will be of primary importance during and beyond 
the banking industry is currently experiencing continued pressure on net margins as well as asset quality resulting from conditions in the sub prime real estate market  and a general deterioration in credit markets 
as a result  market rates of interest and asset quality will continue be an important factor in the company s ongoing strategic planning process 
application of critical accounting policies and estimates the company s consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and follow general practices within the industry in which it operates 
application of these principles requires management to make estimates  assumptions  and judgments that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes 
these estimates  assumptions  and judgments are based on information available as of the date of the financial statements  accordingly  as this information changes  the financial statements could reflect different estimates  assumptions  and judgments 
certain policies inherently have a greater reliance on the use of estimates  assumptions  and judgments and as such have a greater possibility of producing results that could be materially different than originally reported 
estimates  assumptions  and judgments are necessary when assets and liabilities are required to be recorded at fair value  when a decline in the value of an asset not carried on the financial statements at fair value warrants an impairment write down or valuation reserve to be established  or when an asset or liability needs to be recorded contingent upon a future event 
carrying assets and liabilities at fair value inherently results in more financial statement volatility 
the fair values and the information used to record valuation adjustments for certain assets and liabilities are based either on quoted market prices or are provided by other third party sources  when available 
when third party information is not available  valuation adjustments are estimated using the company s own assumptions about the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability 
the most significant accounting policies followed by the company are presented in note to the company s consolidated financial statements included herein 
these policies  along with the disclosures presented in the other financial statement notes and in this financial review  provide information on how significant assets and liabilities are valued in the financial statements and how those values are determined 
based on the valuation techniques used and the sensitivity of financial statement amounts to the methods  assumptions  and estimates underlying those amounts  management has identified the determination of the allowance for loan losses  other real estate owned through foreclosure  impairment of collateralized mortgage obligations and other investment securities  and fair value estimates on junior subordinated debt to be accounting areas that require the most subjective or complex judgments  and as such could be most subject to revision as new information becomes available 
allowance for credit losses the allowance for credit losses represents management s estimate of probable credit losses inherent in the loan portfolio 
determining the amount of the allowance for credit losses is considered a critical accounting estimate because it requires significant judgment and the use of estimates related to the amount and timing of expected future cash flows on impaired loans  estimated losses on pools of homogeneous loans based on historical loss experience  and consideration of current economic trends and conditions  all of which may be susceptible to significant change 
the loan portfolio also represents the largest asset type on the consolidated balance sheet 
note to the consolidated financial statements describes the methodology used to determine the allowance for credit losses and a discussion of the factors driving changes in the amount of the allowance for credit losses is included in the asset quality and allowance for credit losses section of this financial review 
if the loan portfolio were to increase by proportionally throughout all loan classifications  the additional estimated provision to the allowance that would be required  based on the percentage loss allocations utilized at december   would be approximately million pretax  net of tax  or per share basic and diluted 
this estimate is comprised of an additional million  net of tax  or per share basic and diluted for criticized loans those classified as special mention or worse and excluding those considered impaired under sfas no 
 and an additional   net of tax  or per share basic and diluted for the remainder of the loan portfolio that is performing 
other real estate owned real estate properties acquired through  or in lieu of  loan foreclosure are to be sold and are initially recorded at fair value of the property  less estimated costs to sell 
the excess  if any  of the loan amount over the fair value of the collateral is charged to the allowance for credit losses 
the determination of fair value is generally based upon pre approved  external appraisals 
as real estate markets declined during and essentially became illiquid in many areas  management was required to use additional judgment in determining the factors associated with fair value of the real estate  including the term over which the properties could be disposed in an orderly liquidation 
this became necessary as many appraisals were based upon comparable sales which were deeply discounted forced liquidations or bulk sales caused by the severity of the housing crises 
subsequent declines in the fair value of other real estate owned  along with related revenue and expenses from operations  are charged to noninterest expense 
the fair market valuation of such properties is based upon estimates  and as such  is subject to change as circumstances in the company s market area  or general economic trends  change 
impairment of investment securities investment securities classified as available for sale afs are carried at fair value and the impact of changes in fair value are recorded on the company s consolidated balance sheet as an unrealized gain or loss in accumulated other comprehensive income loss  a separate component of shareholders equity 
securities classified as afs or held to maturity htm are subject to review to identify when a decline in value is other than temporary 
factors considered in determining whether a decline in value is other than temporary include whether the decline is substantial  the duration of the decline  the reasons for the decline in value  whether the decline is related to a credit event or to a change in interest rate  our ability and intent to hold the investment for a period of time that will allow for a recovery of value  and the financial condition and near term prospects of the issuer 
when it is determined that a decline in value is other than temporary  the carrying value of the security is reduced to its estimated fair value  with a corresponding charge to earnings 
at december   the company held three private label collateralized mortgage obligations cmo s with an amortized cost of million and carrying value of million 
impairment analysis on these three cmo s was performed utilizing the services of a third party investment broker specializing in private label cmo s  and was based upon estimated cash flows 
estimated cash flows were based upon assumptions of future prepayments and default rates  and thus may be subject to revision as events change in the future 
at december   the company did not have any investment securities considered other than temporarily impaired 
fair value effective january   the company adopted sfas no 
 the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities  and sfas no 
 fair value measurements  choosing to apply the pronouncement to its junior subordinated debt 
sfas no defines how applicable assets and liabilities are to be valued  and requires expanded disclosures about financial instruments carried at fair value 
sfas no 
establishes a hierarchical disclosure framework associated with the level of pricing observability utilized in measuring financial instruments at fair value 
the degree of judgment utilized in measuring the fair value of financial instruments generally correlates to the level of pricing observability 
financial instruments with readily available active quoted prices or for which fair value can be measured from actively quoted prices generally will have a higher degree of pricing observability and a lesser degree of judgment utilized in measuring fair value 
conversely  financial instruments infrequently traded or not quoted in an active market will generally have little or no pricing observability and a higher degree of judgment utilized in measuring fair value 
pricing observability is impacted by a number of factors  including the type of financial instrument  whether the financial instrument is new to the market and not yet established and the characteristics specific to the transaction 
determining fair values under sfas no 
may include judgments related to measurement factors that may vary from actual transactions executed in the marketplace 
for the year ended december   the company recorded fair value gains related to its junior subordinated debt totaling million 
see notes an of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information about financial instruments carried at fair value 
goodwill business combinations involving the company s acquisition of the equity interests or net assets of another enterprise or the assumption of net liabilities in an acquisition of branches constituting a business may give rise to goodwill 
the acquisition of taft national bank during april gave rise to goodwill totaling approximately million  and the recent acquisition of legacy bank resulted in goodwill of approximately million 
goodwill represents the excess of the cost of an acquired entity over the net of the amounts assigned to assets acquired and liabilities assumed in transactions accounted for under the purchase method of accounting 
the value of goodwill is ultimately derived from the company s ability to generate net earnings after the acquisition 
a decline in net earnings could be indicative of a decline in the fair value of goodwill and result in impairment 
for that reason  goodwill is assessed for impairment at a reporting unit level at least annually using an internal cash flow model 
while the company believes all assumptions utilized in its assessment of goodwill for impairment are reasonable and appropriate  changes in earnings  the effective tax rate  historical earnings multiples and the cost of capital could all cause different results for the calculation of the present value of future cash flows 
income taxes deferred income taxes are provided for the temporary differences between the financial reporting basis and the tax basis of the company s assets and liabilities 
deferred taxes are measured using current tax rates applied to such taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered 
if the company s future income is not sufficient to apply the deferred tax assets within the tax years to which they may be applied  the deferred tax asset may not be realized and the company s income will be reduced 
on january  the company adopted financial accounting standards board fasb interpretation fin  accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 

fin clarifies sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  to indicate a criterion that an individual tax position would have to meet for some or all of the income tax benefit to be recognized in a taxable entity s financial statements 
under the guidelines of fin  an entity should recognize the financial statement benefit of a tax position if it determines that it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on examination 
the term more likely than not means a likelihood of more than percent 
in assessing whether the more likely than not criterion is met  the entity should assume that the tax position will be reviewed by the applicable taxing authority 
the company reviewed its various tax positions  including its ongoing reit case with the california franchise tax board ftb  as of january  adoption date  and then again each subsequent quarter thereafter in light of the adoption of fin the bank  with guidance from advisors believes the case related to consent dividends taken by the bank s reit during has merit with regard to points of law  and that the tax law at the time allowed for the deduction of the consent dividend 
however  the bank  with the concurrence of advisors  cannot conclude that it is more than likely as defined in fin that the bank will prevail in its case with the ftb 
as a result of this determination  effective january  the company recorded an adjustment of  to beginning retained earnings upon adoption of fin to recognize the potential tax liability under the guidelines of the interpretation 
the adjustment includes amounts for assessed taxes  penalties  and interest 
during the years ended december  and  the company increased the unrecognized tax liability by an additional  and  respectively  in interest for the period  bringing the total recorded tax liability under fin to  and  at december  and december   respectively 
it is the company s policy to recognize interest and penalties under fin as a component of income tax expense 
pursuant to fin  the company will continue to re evaluate existing tax positions  as well as new positions as they arise 
if the company determines in the future that its tax positions are not more likely than not to be sustained as defined by taxing authorities  the company may need to recognize additional tax liabilities 
revenue recognition the company s primary sources of revenue are interest income from loans and investment securities 
interest income is generally recorded on an accrual basis  unless the collection of such income is not reasonably assured or cannot be reasonably estimated 
pursuant to sfas no 
 accounting for nonrefundable fees and costs associated with originating or acquiring loans and initial direct costs of leases  nonrefundable fees and costs associated with originating or acquiring loans are recognized as a yield adjustment to the related loans by amortizing them into income over the term of the loan using a method which approximates the interest method 
other credit related fees  such as standby letter of credit fees  loan placement fees and annual credit card fees are recognized as noninterest income during the period the related service is performed 
for loans placed on nonaccrual status  the accrued and unpaid interest receivable may be reversed at management s discretion based upon management s assessment of collectibility  and interest is thereafter credited to principal to the extent necessary to eliminate doubt as to the collectibility of the net carrying amount of the loan 
results of operations for the year ended december   the company reported net income of million or per share diluted as compared to million or per share diluted for the year ended december   and million or per share diluted for the year ended december  net income decreased million between december  and december  as the result of increased provisions for credit losses taken during the third and fourth quarters  combined with significant declines in market rates of interest 
net income for decreased million from the previous year as the result of additional loan loss provisions taken during the fourth quarter  which more than offset increased net interest income realized from increased volume in earning assets 
the company s return on average assets was for the year ended december  as compared to and for the same twelve month periods of and  respectively 
the company s return on average equity was for the year ended december  as compared to and for the same twelve month periods of and  respectively 
declines in the return on average assets and average equity experienced by the company during were primarily the result of decreasing net interest margins  and additional loan loss provisions taken during the year 
net interest income net interest income  the most significant component of earnings  is the difference between the interest and fees received on earning assets and the interest paid on interest bearing liabilities 
earning assets consist primarily of loans  and to a lesser extent  investments in securities issued by federal  state and local authorities  and corporations  as well as interest bearing deposits and overnight funds with other financial institutions 
these earning assets are funded by a combination of interest bearing and noninterest bearing liabilities  primarily customer deposits and short term and long term borrowings 
net interest income before provision for credit losses totaled million for the year ended december  as compared to million for the year ended december   and million for the year ended december  this represents a decrease of million or between the years ended december  and  as compared to an increase of million or between and the decrease in net interest income between and is primarily the result of decreased yields on interest earning assets  which more than offset the decreased yields on interest bearing liabilities 
the increase in net interest income between and is the result of increased volume in earning assets which more than outweighed rate and volume increases experienced in interest bearing liabilities

loan interest income includes loan fees of approximately   and  for the years ended december    and  respectively 
applicable nontaxable securities yields have not been calculated on a tax equivalent basis because they are not material to the company s results of operations 
as summarized in table  the increase in net interest income between the two twelve month periods ended december  and is comprised of a decrease in total interest income of approximately million  which was only partially offset by a decrease in total interest expense of approximately million 
the bank s net interest margin  as shown in table  decreased to at december  from at december   a decrease of basis points basis points between the two periods 
the net margin of reported during represents a decrease of basis points from the net margin realized by the company during while average assets have grown over the past three years and the balance sheet mix has changed  interest rate movements over those three years have played a significant role in net interest income trends 
as a result of changes in market rates of interest  the prime rate averaged for the year ended december  as compared to and for the years ended december  and  respectively 
both the company s net interest income and net interest margin are affected by changes in the amount and mix of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities  referred to as volume change 
both are also affected by changes in yields on interest earning assets and rates paid on interest bearing liabilities  referred to as rate change 
the following table sets forth the changes in interest income and interest expense for each major category of interest earning asset and interest bearing liability  and the amount of change attributable to volume and rate changes for the years indicated 
changes in interest income and expense  which are not attributable specifically to either rate or volume  are allocated proportionately between the two variances based on the absolute dollar amounts of the change in each

loans were most adversely impacted by yield declines as approximately two thirds of the loan portfolio is comprised of floating rate instruments 
total interest expense decreased approximately million between the years ended december  and  primarily as a result of decreased rates paid on deposit accounts and other borrowings as market rates of interest continued to decline throughout most of rates paid on interest bearing liabilities decreased in all categories  with the greatest decreases experienced in time deposits  borrowings through the fhlb and the frb  and the company s junior subordinated debt 
the company s interest bearing liability mix changed during with declines in average deposit accounts  especially time deposits  which was more than offset by increases in the average volume of other borrowings including fhlb advances and overnight borrowings from the federal reserve 
on average  time deposits decreased million  interest bearing demand accounts decreased by million  and savings accounts decreased by million between the years ended december  and december  the decrease in average deposits was more than offset by increases of more than million in other borrowings between the years ended december  and december  total interest income increased approximately million or between the years ended december  and  and was attributable primarily to increase in earning asset volume  as well as the yields on those earning assets to a lesser degree 
earning asset growth was almost exclusively in loans  with minimal growth in investments 
on average  loans grew by approximately million between and the company continues to maintain a high percentage of loans in its earning asset mix with loans averaging of total earning assets for the year ended december   as compared to and for the years ended december  and  respectively 
total interest expense increased approximately million between the years ended december  and  both as a result of increased volumes in time deposits and other borrowings  as well as increased rates paid on deposit accounts as deposit rates continued to rise throughout much of deposit rates began to decline during the fourth quarter of as market rates of interest declined as a result of the federal reserves actions to protect a faltering economy 
between the years ended december  and december   rates paid on interest bearing liabilities increased in all categories except other borrowing and junior subordinated debt  with the greatest increases experienced in time deposits  money market deposits  and savings accounts 
the increases experienced in savings account rates during were largely the result of more than million in savings accounts purchased with legacy bank during february  many of which carried high preferential interest rates 
some of those savings accounts have been closed  and the company has been able to reduce the cost of the remaining accounts as the preferential rate terms of the savings accounts expired 
provision for credit losses provisions for credit losses and the amount added to the allowance for credit losses is determined on the basis of management s continuous credit review of the loan portfolio  consideration of past loan loss experience  current and future economic conditions  and other pertinent factors 
such factors consider the allowance for credit losses to be adequate when it covers estimated losses inherent in the loan portfolio 
based on the condition of the loan portfolio  management believes the allowance is sufficient to cover risk elements in the loan portfolio 
for the year ended december  the provision to the allowance for credit losses amounted to million as compared to million and  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
increases in the provision to the allowance for credit losses during  including provisions of million and million in the third and fourth quarters of  respectively  were the result of higher levels of nonperforming loans during the year  and general deterioration in the housing and credit markets which began during the later part of  and continued throughout as with  increases in the provision to the allowance for credit losses during included larger provisions during the third and fourth quarters of the year as the economy and the banking industry began to realize the full impact of the weakened housing and credit markets during the later part of provisions of million and million were made in the third and fourth quarters of the amount provided to the allowance for credit losses during brought the allowance to of net outstanding loan balances at december   as compared to of net outstanding loan balances at december   and at december  noninterest income the following table summarizes significant components of noninterest income for the years indicated and the net changes between those years years ended december  increase decrease during year in thousands customer service fees gain on disposition of securities gain loss on sale of oreo proceeds from life insurance gain loss on swap ineffectiveness gain on fair value option of financial liabilities gain on sale of investment gain loss on sale of fixed assets shared appreciation income other total noninterest income consists primarily of fees and commissions earned on services that are provided to the company s banking customers and  to a lesser extent  gains on sales of company assets and other miscellaneous income 
noninterest income for the year ended december  decreased million or when compared to the previous year  and decreased  or when compared to the year ended december  decreases in noninterest income experienced during were primarily the result of a decrease sfas no 
fair value gains recorded on the company s junior subordinated debt  as well as an employee death benefit payment received during that did not occur again during the gain on disposition of securities totaling  during was the result of an early call on municipal bonds with an amortized cost of approximately  the municipal bonds were redeemed at face value  resulting in a recognized gain on the remaining unaccreted discount 
customer service fees continue to provide a substantial part of noninterest income over the three years presented 
customer service fees decreased  between the years ended december and december   which is attributable almost exclusively to decreases in atm fee income 
increases of million in customer service fees between and were comprised of increases in atm and overdraft charges  as well as additional fee revenue generated by the campbell branch acquired during february increases in noninterest income experienced during were primarily the result of a million gain recognized on the change in fair value to the company s junior subordinated debt 
with the deterioration in credit markets during the second half of  the rate on the company s junior subordinated debt was far below current market rates of interest on similar instruments  resulting in the significant gains recorded during the third and fourth quarters of this was offset during by a decline in gain on sale of investments  and gain on sale of fixed assets 
declines in gain on sale of investments resulted from a million gain on the sale of an investment in correspondent bank during the first quarter of  which was not again experienced during declines in gain on sale of fixed assets resulted from a million gain on the sale of the company s administrative headquarters during the third quarter of  which was not again experienced during noninterest income was further enhanced during the years ended december  and december  from death benefit proceeds realized from the company s bank owned life insurance totaling  and  during those two years  respectively 
shared appreciation income has fluctuated over the three years presented  with increases of  between and  as compared to decreases of  between and shared appreciation income results from agreements between the company and the borrower on certain construction loans where the company agrees to receive interest on the loan at maturity rather than monthly and the borrower agrees to share in the profits of the project 
the profit is determined by the appraised value of the completed project and subsequent refinancing or sale of the project 
due to the difficulty in calculating future values  shared appreciation income is recognized when received 
the company does not participate in a significant number of shared appreciation projects  and as a result  does not anticipate large amounts of shared appreciation income on an ongoing basis 
noninterest expense the following table sets forth the components of total noninterest expense in dollars and as a percentage of average earning assets for the years ended december   and of of of average average average earning earning earning dollars in thousands amount assets amount assets amount assets salaries and employee benefits occupancy expense data processing professional fees directors fees amortization of intangibles correspondent bank service charges impairment loss on other investments impairment loss on oreo impairment loss on intangible assets loss on lease assets held for sale loss on ca tax credit partnership oreo expense other total noninterest expense  excluding provision for credit losses and income tax expense  totaled million for the year ended december  as compared to million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
these figures represent an increase of  or between the years ended december  and and an increase of million or between the years ended december  and as a percentage of average earning assets  total noninterest expense has remained relatively stable over the past three years as the company has successfully controlled overhead expenses while experiencing profitable growth 
noninterest expense amounted to of average earning assets for the year ended december  as compared to at december  and at december  increases in noninterest expense between the years ended december  and december  include impairment losses of  on oreo  and  on intangible assets 
with economic conditions deteriorating during  increased emphasis has been placed on impairment review  as the values on many assets have declined 
impairment losses on oreo properties are also a function of an increase in the volume of oreo acquired during  which is also reflected in the increase of  in oreo expense during decreases in noninterest expense have been realized in many categories during including a decrease of  in salary expense   in data processing expense  and  in professional fees 
the decrease in salary expense between the years ended december  and december  is primarily the result of a reduction in bonuses and incentives paid during  many of which are based upon the company s net income 
increases in noninterest expense during included costs associated with the new branch operations in campbell  california  resulting from the merger with legacy bank  additional employee costs associated with the new financial services department acquired during november  increased professional fees associated with the resolution of impaired loans  losses on lease assets held for sale  and increased amortization costs for intangible assets 
losses on lease assets held for sale totaled  for the year ended december  and are the result of charge offs of foreclosed lease assets  mainly equipment and furniture  which the company has determined have no value or cannot be located 
decreases in oreo expense during were the primarily result of additional disposal and clean up costs  incurred during on a single oreo property  which was in the process of liquidation 
these additional oreo costs were not incurred again during during the years ended december    and  the company recognized stock based compensation expense of  per share basic and diluted   per share basic and diluted  and  per share basic and diluted  respectively 
this expense is included in noninterest expense under salaries and employee benefits 
under the current pool of stock options  the company expects stock based compensation expense to be about  per quarter during  then to  per quarter for  and decline after that through if new stock options are issued  or existing options fail to vest due  for example  to forfeiture  actual stock based compensation expense in future periods will change 
income taxes on december  the california franchise tax board ftb announced certain tax transactions related to real estate investment trusts reits and regulated investment companies rics will be disallowed pursuant to senate bill and assembly bill  which were signed into law in the th quarter of as a result  the company reversed related net state tax benefits recorded in the first three quarters of and has taken no related tax benefits since that time 
the company continues to review the information available from the ftb and its financial advisors and believes that the company s position has merit 
the company will pursue its tax claims and defend its use of these entities and transactions 
at this time  the company cannot predict the ultimate outcome 
during the first quarter of  the ftb notified the company of its intent to audit the reit for the tax years ended december and the company has retained legal counsel to represent it in the tax audit  and counsel has provided the ftb with documentation supporting the company s position 
the ftb concluded its audit during january during april  the ftb issued a notice of proposed assessment to the company  which included proposed tax and penalty assessments related to the tax benefits taken for the reit during the company still believes the case has merit based upon the fact that the ftb is ignoring certain facts of law in the case 
the issuance of the notice of proposed assessment by the ftb will not end the administrative processing of the reit issue because the company has asserted its administrative protest and appeal rights pending the outcome of litigation by another taxpayer presently in process on the reit issue in the los angeles superior court city national v

commercial real estate is the core of this segment of the portfolio  with balances of million  million  and million at december    and  respectively 
commercial real estate loans are generally a mix of short to medium term  fixed and floating rate instruments and  are mainly tied to commercial income and multi family residential properties 
the company does not currently offer traditional residential mortgage loans  but may purchase mortgage portfolios 
as a result of real estate mortgage purchases over the past several years  that portion of the portfolio has remained stable with balances of million  million  and million at december   and  respectively

as of december   there were two other investment securities with a total weighted average life of years that have been temporarily impaired for twelve months or more 
the unrealized losses are due in most part to interest rate changes  as well as credit downgrades in some of the portfolio including three collateralized mortgage obligations 
the company has the ability and intent to hold all investment securities with identified impairments resulting from interest rate changes and credit downgrades to the earlier of the forecasted recovery or the maturity of the underlying investment security 
the company believes that credit downgrades on securities within the portfolio are a result of the severity of the current economic downturn and does not believe the downgrades will result in other than temporary impairment of those securities

brokered and other time deposits were allowed to runoff as they matured during  as the company sought other less expensive funding sources including fhlb advances and overnight borrowings from the federal reserve 
in addition  time deposits from the state of california  which totaled million at both december  and december   were not renewed by the state of california during the company had increased brokered deposits throughout as part of its liquidity strategy begun during to fund loan growth as core deposits became increasingly difficult to obtain and pricing became more competitive 
as market rates of interest declined during  brokered deposit pricing did not decline to the same degree  due largely to liquidity and credit issues in the market place 
as a result  brokered deposits and other time deposits became less attractive as a funding source

increases in time deposits of  and over experienced during were largely the result of brokered time deposits obtained by the company as part of its liquidity strategy to fund loan growth during the year 
the company s deposit base consists of two major components represented by noninterest bearing demand deposits and interest bearing deposits 
interest bearing deposits consist of time certificates  now and money market accounts and savings deposits

short term borrowings the company has the ability to obtain borrowed funds consisting of federal funds purchased  securities sold under agreements to repurchase repurchase agreements and federal home loan bank fhlb advances as alternatives to retail deposit funds 
the company has established collateralized and uncollateralized lines of credit with several correspondent banks  as well as a securities dealer  for the purpose of obtaining borrowed funds as needed 
the company may continue to borrow funds in the future as part of its asset liability strategy  and may use these funds to acquire certain other assets as deemed appropriate by management for investment purposes and to better utilize the capital resources of the bank 
federal funds purchased represent temporary overnight borrowings from correspondent banks and are generally unsecured 
repurchase agreements are collateralized by mortgage backed securities and securities of us government agencies  and generally have maturities of one to six months  but may have longer maturities if deemed appropriate as part of the company s asset liability management strategy 
fhlb advances are collateralized by the company s investment in fhlb stock  securities  and certain qualifying mortgage loans 
in addition  the company has the ability to obtain borrowings from the federal reserve bank of san francisco  which would be collateralized by certain pledged loans in the company s loan portfolio 
the lines of credit are subject to periodic review of the company s financial statements by the grantors of the credit lines 
lines of credit may be modified or revoked at any time if the grantors feel there are adverse trends in the company s financial position 
the company had collateralized and uncollateralized lines of credit aggregating million and million  as well as fhlb lines of credit totaling million and million at december  and  respectively 
at december   the company had total outstanding balances of million drawn against its fhlb line of credit 
of the million in fhlb borrowings outstanding at december   million was in borrowings with maturities of one year or less with an average rate of  and the other million consists of a two year fhlb advance  with an average fixed rate of 
these lines of credit generally have interest rates tied to the federal funds rate or are indexed to short term us treasury rates or libor

implicit in lending activities is the fact that losses will be experienced and that the amount of such losses will vary from time to time  depending on the risk characteristics of the loan portfolio as affected by local economic conditions and the financial experience of borrowers 
the allowance for credit losses is maintained at a level deemed appropriate by management to provide for known and inherent risks in existing loans and commitments to extend credit 
the adequacy of the allowance for credit losses is based upon management s continuing assessment of various factors affecting the collectibility of loans and commitments to extend credit  including current economic conditions  past credit experience  collateral  and concentrations of credit 
there is no precise method of predicting specific losses or amounts which may ultimately be charged off on particular segments of the loan portfolio 
the collectibility of a loan is subjective to some degree  but must relate to the borrower s financial condition  cash flow  quality of the borrower s management expertise  collateral and guarantees  and the state of the local economy 
when determining the adequacy of the allowance for credit losses  the company follows  in accordance with gaap  the guidelines set forth in the interagency policy statement on the allowance for loan and lease losses statement issued jointly by banking regulators during  and updated and revised in the statement outlines characteristics that should be used in segmentation of the loan portfolio for purposes of the analysis including risk classification  past due status  type of loan  industry or collateral 
it also outlines factors to consider when adjusting the loss factors for various segments of the loan portfolio 
securities and exchange commission staff accounting bulletin no 
was also released at this time which represents the sec staff s view relating to methodologies and supporting documentation for the allowance for loan and lease losses that should be observed by all public companies in complying with the federal securities laws and the commission s interpretations 
it is also generally consistent with the guidance published by the banking regulators 
the company segments the loan and lease portfolio into eleven segments  primarily by loan class and type  that have homogeneity and commonality of purpose and terms for analysis under sfas no 
those loans which are determined to be impaired under sfas no 
are not subject to the general reserve analysis under sfas no 
 and evaluated individually for specific impairment 
the eleven segments of the company s loan portfolio are as follows subtotals are provided as needed to allow the reader to reconcile the amounts to the company s loan classification reported elsewhere in these financial statements loan segments for loan loss reserve analysis loan balance at december  dollars in s commercial and business loans government program loans total commercial and industrial commercial real estate term loans single family residential loans home improvement home equity loans total real estate mortgage total real estate construction loans total agricultural loans consumer loans overdraft protection lines overdrafts total installment other total lease financing total loans the company s methodology for assessing the adequacy of the allowance for credit losses consists of several key elements  which include the formula allowance  specific allowances for problem graded loans classified loans and the unallocated allowance in addition  the allowance analysis also incorporates the results of measuring impaired loans as provided in statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting by creditors for impairment of a loan and sfas  accounting by creditors for impairment of a loan income recognition and disclosures 
the formula allowance is calculated by applying loss factors to outstanding loans and certain unfunded loan commitments 
loss factors are based on the company s historical loss experience and on the internal risk grade of those loans and  may be adjusted for significant factors that  in management s judgment  affect the collectibility of the portfolio as of the evaluation date 
factors that may affect collectibility of the loan portfolio include levels of  and trends in delinquencies and nonaccrual loans  trends in volumes and term of loans  effects of any changes in lending policies and procedures including those for underwriting  collection  charge off  and recovery  experience  ability  and depth of lending management and staff  national and local economic trends and conditions and  concentrations of credit that might affect loss experience across one or more components of the portfolio  including high balance loan concentrations and participations 
management determines the loss factors for problem graded loans substandard  doubtful  and loss  special mention loans  and pass graded loans  based on a loss migration model 
the migration analysis incorporates loan losses over the past twelve quarters three years and loss factors are adjusted to recognize and quantify the loss exposure from changes in market conditions and trends in the company s loan portfolio 
for purposes of this analysis  loans are grouped by internal risk classifications  which are pass  special mention  substandard  doubtful  and loss 
certain loans are homogenous in nature and are therefore pooled by risk grade 
these homogenous loans include consumer installment and home equity loans 
special mention loans are currently performing but are potentially weak  as the borrower has begun to exhibit deteriorating trends  which if not corrected  could jeopardize repayment of the loan and result in further downgrade 
substandard loans have well defined weaknesses which  if not corrected  could jeopardize the full satisfaction of the debt 
a loan classified as doubtful has critical weaknesses that make full collection of the obligation improbable 
classified loans  as defined by the company  include loans categorized as substandard  doubtful  and loss 
at december  problem graded or classified loans totaled million or of gross loans  as compared to million or of gross loans at september   and million or of gross loans at december  loan participations are reviewed for allowance adequacy under the same guidelines as other loans in the company s portfolio  with an additional participation factor added  if required  for specific risks associated with participations 
in general  participations are subject to certain thresholds set by the company  and are reviewed for geographic location as well as the well being of the underlying agent bank 
the formula allowance includes reserves for certain off balance sheet risks including letters of credit  unfunded loan commitments  and lines of credit 
reserves for undisbursed commitments are generally formula allocations based on the company s historical loss experience and other loss factors  rather than specific loss contingencies 
at december   and the formula reserve allocated to undisbursed commitments totaled   and  respectively 
specific allowances are established based on management s periodic evaluation of loss exposure inherent in classified loans  impaired loans  and other loans in which management believes there is a probability that a loss has been incurred in excess of the amount determined by the application of the formula allowance 
specific allowance amounts include those calculated under sfas no 
under sfas no 
 for impaired loans  specific allowances are determined based on the collateralized value of the underlying properties  the net present value of the anticipated cash flows  or the market value of the underlying assets 
under sfas no 
 for classified loans excluding impaired loans  specific allowances  where required  are determined on the basis of additional risks involved with individual loans that may be in excess of risk factors associated with the loan portfolio as a whole 
the specific allowance is different from the formula allowance in that the specific allowance is determined on a loan by loan basis based on risk factors directly related to a particular loan  as opposed to the formula allowance which is determined for a pool of loans with similar characteristics  based on past historical trends and other risk factors which may be relevant on an ongoing basis 
the unallocated portion of the allowance is the result of both expected and unanticipated changes in various conditions that are not directly measured in the determination of the formula and specific allowances 
the conditions may include  but are not limited to  general economic and business conditions affecting the key lending areas of the company  credit quality trends  collateral values  loan volumes and concentrations  and other business conditions 
the following table summarizes the specific allowance  formula allowance  and unallocated allowance at december   september  and december  balance balance balance in s december  september  december  specific allowance impaired loans formula allowance special mention and classified loans total allowance for special mention and classified loans formula allowance for pass loans unallocated allowance total allowance impaired loans increased approximately million between december  and december   and increased approximately  million during the quarter ended december  the specific allowance related to impaired loans increased million and  for the year ended and quarter ended december   respectively 
the formula allowance related to loans that are not impaired including special mention and substandard increased approximately  between december  and december   but decreased  during the quarter ended december  increases for the year ended december  were the result of increases in the volume of substandard and special mention loans  as well as minor increases in adjusting factors for current economic trends and conditions  and trends in delinquent and nonaccrual loans 
even though the level of pass loans decreased approximately million during the year ended december   the related formula allowance decreased only  during as a result of an increase in commercial and industrial loans which have a higher percentage loss allocation  as well as factor allocation increases due to current economic conditions 
at december   the company segregated approximately million of the total million in substandard classified loans for purposes of the quarterly analysis of the adequacy of the allowance for credit losses under sfas no 
many of these loans had been downgraded to substandard because the borrowers had other direct or indirect lending relationships which were classified as substandard or impaired 
the million in substandard loans consists of ten borrowing relationships  which although classified as substandard  the company believes are performing and therefore do not warrant the same loss factors as other substandard loans in the portfolio 
the adequacy of the allowance for credit losses related to this million pool of substandard loans was based upon current payment history  loan to value ratios  future anticipated performance  and other various factors 
the formula allowance for credit losses related to these substandard loans totaled million at december  this formula reserve is included in the formula allowance for special mention and classified loans totaling million in the table above 
the company s methodology includes features that are intended to reduce the difference between estimated and actual losses 
the specific allowance portion of the analysis is designed to be self correcting by taking into account the current loan loss experience based on that portion of the portfolio 
by analyzing the probable estimated losses inherent in the loan portfolio on a quarterly basis  management is able to adjust specific and inherent loss estimates using the most recent information available 
in performing the periodic migration analysis  management believes that historical loss factors used in the computation of the formula allowance need to be adjusted to reflect current changes in market conditions and trends in the company s loan portfolio 
there are a number of other factors  which are reviewed when determining adjustments in the historical loss factors 
they include trends in delinquent and nonaccrual loans  trends in loan volume and terms  effects of changes in lending policies  concentrations of credit  competition  national and local economic trends and conditions  experience of lending staff  loan review and board of directors oversight  high balance loan concentration  and other business conditions 
other than the segregation of approximately million in substandard loans at december  discussed above  there were no changes in estimation methods or assumptions during that affected the methodology for assessing the overall adequacy of the allowance for credit losses 
management and the company s lending officers evaluate the loss exposure of classified and impaired loans on a weekly and monthly basis  and through discussions and officer meetings as conditions change 
the company s loan committee meets weekly and serves as a forum to discuss specific problem assets that pose significant concerns to the company  and to keep the board of directors informed through committee minutes 
all special mention and classified loans are reported quarterly on criticized asset reports  which are reviewed by senior management 
with this information  the migration analysis and the impaired loan analysis are performed on a quarterly basis and adjustments are made to the allowance as deemed necessary 
as the real estate market and economic crisis became more severe during the later part of  the company successfully worked with many of its borrowers to re margin loans as collateral values declined  weakening the company s credit position and increasing the potential for losses 
this process of working with potentially troubled borrowers was monitored closely through the loan review process 
impaired loans are calculated under sfas no 
 and are measured based on the present value of the expected future cash flows discounted at the loan s effective interest rate or the fair value of the collateral if the loan is collateral dependent 
the amount of impaired loans is not directly comparable to the amount of nonperforming loans disclosed later in this section 
the primary differences between impaired loans and nonperforming loans are i all loan categories are considered in determining nonperforming loans while impaired loan recognition is limited to commercial and industrial loans  commercial and residential real estate loans  construction loans  and agricultural loans  and ii impaired loan recognition considers not only loans days or more past due  restructured loans and nonaccrual loans but also may include problem loans other than delinquent loans 
the company considers a loan to be impaired when  based upon current information and events  it believes it is probable the company will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement 
impaired loans include nonaccrual loans  restructured debt  and performing loans in which full payment of principal or interest is not expected 
management bases the measurement of these impaired loans on the fair value of the loan s collateral or the expected cash flows on the loans discounted at the loan s stated interest rates 
cash receipts on impaired loans not performing to contractual terms and that are on nonaccrual status are used to reduce principal balances 
impairment losses are included in the allowance for credit losses through a charge to the provision  if applicable 
at december  and  the company s recorded investment in loans for which impairment has been recognized totaled million and million  respectively 
included in total impaired loans at december   are million of impaired loans for which the related specific allowance is million  as well as million of impaired loans that as a result of write downs or the fair value of the collateral  did not have a specific allowance 
total impaired loans at december  included million of impaired loans for which the related specific allowance is million  as well as million of impaired loans that as a result of write downs or the fair value of the collateral  did not have a specific allowance 
the average recorded investment in impaired loans was million  million and million during the years ended december   and  respectively 
in most cases  the company uses the cash basis method of income recognition for impaired loans 
in the case of certain troubled debt restructuring for which the loan is performing under the current contractual terms  income is recognized under the accrual method 
for the years ended december  and  the company recognized no income on such loans 
for the year ended december  the company recognized income of  on such loans 
the greatest increase in impaired loans during the year ended december  has been in real estate construction loans  with that loan category comprising more than of total impaired loans at december  impaired construction loans decreased million during the fourth quarter of  partially as the result of the transfer of approximately million in construction loans from impaired status to oreo during the fourth quarter of although construction loans are generally collateral dependent and the related collateral is considered adequate to cover the loan s carrying value in many cases  the specific reserve related to impaired construction loans has increased approximately million since december  as property valuations have declined 
specific collateral related to impaired loans is reviewed for current appraisal information  economic trends within geographic markets  loan to value ratios  and other factors that may impact the value of the loan collateral 
adjustments are made to collateral values as needed for these factors 
of total impaired loans  approximately million or are secured by real estate  and million of total impaired loans are for the purpose of residential construction  residential and commercial acquisition and development  and land development 
residential construction loans are made for the purpose of building residential single family homes 
residential and commercial acquisition and development loans are made for the purpose of purchasing land  and developing that land if required  and to develop real estate or commercial construction projects on those properties 
land development loans are made for the purpose of converting raw land into construction ready building sites

the company continues to experience increased competition from major banks  local independents and non bank institutions creating pressure on loan pricing 
with interest rates decreasing basis points during the fourth quarter of  another basis points during  indications are that the economy will continue to suffer in the near future as a result of sub prime lending problems  a weakened real estate market  and tight credit markets 
both business and consumer spending have slowed during the past several quarters  and current gdp projections for the next year have softened significantly 
it is difficult to determine to what degree the federal reserve will adjust short term interest rates in its efforts to influence the economy  or what magnitude government economic support programs will reach 
it is likely that the business environment in california will continue to be influenced by these domestic as well as global events 
the local market has remained relatively more stable economically during the past several years than other areas of the state and the nation  which have experienced more volatile economic trends  including significant deterioration of residential real estate markets 
although the local area residential housing markets have been hit hard  they continue to perform better than other parts of the state  which should bode well for sustained  but slower growth in the company s market areas of fresno and madera  kern  and santa clara counties 
local unemployment rates in the san joaquin valley remain high primarily as a result of the areas agricultural dynamics  however unemployment rates have increased recently as the national economy has declined 
it is difficult to predict what impact this will have on the local economy 
the company believes that the central san joaquin valley will continue to grow and diversify as property and housing costs remain reasonable relative to other areas of the state 
management recognizes increased risk of loss due to the company s exposure from local and worldwide economic conditions  as well as potentially volatile real estate markets  and takes these factors into consideration when analyzing the adequacy of the allowance for credit losses 
the following table provides a summary of the company s allowance for credit losses  provisions made to that allowance  and charge off and recovery activity affecting the allowance for the years indicated

no assurance can be given  however  that the economic conditions which may adversely affect the company s service areas or other circumstances will not be reflected in increased losses in the loan portfolio 
management is not currently aware of any conditions that may adversely affect the levels of losses incurred in the company s loan portfolio 
although the company does not normally allocate the allowance for credit losses to specific loan categories  an allocation to the major categories has been made for the purposes of this report as set forth in the following table 
the allocations are estimates based on the same factors as considered by management in determining the amount of additional provisions to the credit loss allowance and the overall adequacy of the allowance for credit losses 
allowance allowance allowance allowance allowance for credit of for credit of for credit of for credit of for credit of dollars in thousands losses loans losses loans losses loans losses loans losses loans commercial and industrial real estate mortgage real estate construction agricultural installment other lease financing not allocated during  reserve allocations increased significantly for commercial and industrial loans  and to lesser extent  construction and agricultural loans 
as with prior years  the significant reserve allocation for lease financing loans is the result of specific reserves allocated to a lease portfolio that has been nonperforming since and is in the process of litigation see discussion following 
increased reserve allocations for commercial and industrial loans  construction loans  as well as agricultural loans  are the result of increases in special mention and substandard loans in those categories  with an increase in the volume of loans considered impaired 
successful re margining of a number of the company s problem loans during the third and fourth quarters of helped to reduce potential loss exposure in the loan portfolio 
during  reserve allocations increased significantly for commercial and industrial loans  construction loans  and to lesser extent  agricultural loans 
increased reserve allocations for commercial and industrial loans  as well as agricultural loans are the result of increased loan volume  as well as increases in substandard loans in those categories 
increases in reserve allocations for construction loans are primarily the result of increases in special mention and substandard loans in those categories 
reserve allocations decreased for lease financing loans as a result of positive results in the litigation process related to the company s nonperforming purchased lease portfolio 
during  reserve allocations increased for commercial and industrial loans  leasing financing  real estate mortgage loans  and installment loans 
increased reserve allocations for commercial and industrial loans are the result of increased loan volume  while increases in reserve allocations for real estate mortgage and installment loans are primarily the result of increases in substandard loans in those categories 
reserve allocations decreased for real estate construction loans as a result of significant decreases in the level of substandard loans in that category between december  and december  the company believes that under generally accepted accounting principles  a total loss of principal is not probable at this time and the specific allowance of million calculated for the impaired lease portfolio at december  under sfas no 
is in accordance with gaap 
during a regulatory examination in the fourth quarter of  the lease portfolio in question was classified as doubtful by the bank s regulators based upon state regulatory guidelines 
california financial code no 
requires that a credit  where interest is past due and unpaid for more than one year and is not well secured and not in the process of collection  be charged off 
the regulators requested that the bank charge off the principal balance in the first or second quarter of for regulatory purposes if the judge had not made a ruling on the case by march  or  if a ruling had been made but no principal payments have been received by june  the court did not rule by march   and has not made a final ruling on the case at the time of this k filing 
as a result  effective march   the company charged off the entire million principal balance for regulatory purposes 
as a result of the regulatory charge off  the company carries a difference between its regulatory accounting principles rap books and its generally accepted accounting principles gaap books 
the financial entries made for regulatory reporting purposes resulted in a million reduction in loan balances with a corresponding reduction in the reserve for credit losses 
additional provisions for credit losses of million were also required for regulatory accounting purposes  which resulted in a reduction of million in regulatory net income net tax benefit of million for the year ended december  as compared to the financial statements presented under gaap in the company s annual report on form k 
the following summarizes the company s allowance for credit losses related to the specific  formula  and unallocated reserves for the year ends shown december  dollars in s formula allowance specific allowance unallocated allowance total allowance at december   the allowance for credit losses totaled million  and consisted of million in formula allowance  million in specific allowance  and  in unallocated reserve 
at december   million of the specific allowance was allocated to lease financing loans  and the remaining million  million    and  were allocated to commercial and industrial loans  real estate construction loans  agricultural loans  commercial real estate loans  residential real estate loans  respectively 
at december   the allowance for credit losses totaled million  and consisted of million in formula allowance  and million in specific allowance 
at december   million of the specific allowance was allocated to lease financing loans  and the remaining    million and million were allocated to commercial real estate  agricultural  installment  commercial and industrial loans  and real estate construction loans  respectively 
the allowance for credit losses totaled million at december   and consisted of million in formula allowance  million in specific allowance  and  in unallocated allowance 
at december   million of the specific allowance was allocated to lease financing loans  and the remaining     and  were allocated to commercial real estate  agricultural  installment  commercial and industrial loans  and real estate construction loans  respectively 
the total formula allowance decreased approximately  between and  primarily as the result of decreased volume in pass loans 
the formula allowance for construction loans decreased  during  and the decreased  for commercial real estate loans  wit only minor changes in other loan categories 
between december  and december   sub substandard loans increased million  while special mention and doubtful loans increased million and million  respectively 
increases in loan downgrades experienced during were primarily the result of continued deterioration in the overall economy  including the residential construction market  which in turn has impacted other sectors of the lending portfolio 
the total formula allowance increased approximately  between and  primarily as the result of increased volume in pass loans 
there were only minor formula allowance allocation changes between loan categories occurring between december  and december   and so most changes in the formula allowance during were the result of volume changes 
between december  and december   sub substandard loans increased million  while special mention and doubtful loans increased million and  million  respectively 
increases in loan downgrades experienced during were primarily the result of deteriorating economic factors in the residential construction market  which in turn has impacted other sectors of the lending portfolio 
although in some instances  the downgrading of a loan resulting from the factors used by the company in its allowance analysis has been reflected in the formula allowance  management believes that in some instances  the impact of material events and trends has not yet been reflected in the level of nonperforming loans or the internal risk grading process regarding these loans 
accordingly  the company s evaluation of probable losses related to these factors may be reflected in the unallocated allowance 
the evaluation of the inherent losses concerning these factors involve a higher degree of uncertainty because they are not identified with specific problem credits  and therefore the company does not spread the unallocated allowance among segments of the portfolio 
at december   the company had an unallocated allowance of  at december  the company had no unallocated allowance  reflecting a decrease from the balance of  at december  management s estimates of the unallocated allowance are based upon a number of underlying factors including the effect of deteriorating national and local economic trends  the effects of export market conditions on certain agricultural and manufacturing borrowers  the effects of abnormal weather patterns on agricultural borrowers  as well as other borrowers that may be impacted by such conditions  the effect of increased competition in the company s market area and the resultant potential impact of more relaxed underwriting standards to borrowers with multi bank relationships  the effect of soft real estate markets  and the effects of having a larger number of borrowing relationships which are close to the company s lending limit  any one if which were not to perform to contractual terms  would have a material impact on the allowance 
the company s loan portfolio has concentrations in commercial real estate  commercial  and construction loans  however these portfolio percentages fall within the company s loan policy guidelines 
it is the company s policy to discontinue the accrual of interest income on loans for which reasonable doubt exists with respect to the timely collectibility of interest or principal due to the inability of the borrower to comply with the terms of the loan agreement 
such loans are placed on nonaccrual status whenever the payment of principal or interest is days past due or earlier when the conditions warrant  and interest collected is thereafter credited to principal to the extent necessary to eliminate doubt as to the collectibility of the net carrying amount of the loan 
management may grant exceptions to this policy if the loans are well secured and in the process of collection 
the following table sets forth the company s nonperforming assets as of the dates indicated december  dollars in thousands  except footnote nonaccrual loans restructured loans total non performing loans other real estate owned total non performing assets loans  past due days or more  still accruing non performing loans to total gross loans non performing assets to total gross loans included in nonaccrual loans at december  are restructured loans totaling  there were no nonaccrual loans at december  and  which are restructured 
the interest income that would have been earned on nonaccrual loans outstanding at december  in accordance with their original terms is approximately million 
non performing assets have increased between december  and december  as declines in real estate markets and related sectors experienced since the later part of resulting from lending problems continued to impact credit markets and the general economy throughout nonaccrual loans increased million between december  and december   with construction loans comprising approximately of total nonaccrual loans at december   and commercial and industrial loans comprising another 
the following table summarizes the nonaccrual totals by loan category for the periods shown 
non performing assets increased between december  and december as housing markets and related sectors experienced declines during the second half of the year as a result of sub prime lending problems which impacted credit markets and the overall economy worldwide 
economic conditions in the san joaquin valley remained strong during much of  although as a result of the decline in the housing sector and related real estate valuations  nonperforming assets increased during the years and additional charge offs were taken during the third and fourth quarters of non performing assets increased during  totaling of total loans at december  as compared to of total loans at december  non performing loans  a component of non performing assets  increased nearly million during primarily as the result of real estate construction and real estate development loans which become impaired during the period 
some  but not all  of these nonperforming real estate credits were outside the company s immediate market area  specifically southern california and the san francisco bay area 
the following table summarizes the nonaccrual totals by loan category for the periods shown balance balance balance change from change from nonaccrual loans in s december  september  december  september  december  commercial and industrial real estate mortgage real estate construction agricultural installment other lease financing total nonaccrual loans increases in nonaccrual construction loans between december  and december  are the result of a significant slowdown in new housing starts and the resultant depreciation in land  and both partially completed and completed construction projects 
nonaccrual construction loans decreased million during the fourth quarter of  primarily as the result of construction loans that were transferred to other real estate owned 
as with impaired loans  a large percentage of nonaccrual loans were made for the purpose of residential construction  residential and commercial acquisition and development  and land development 
the following table summarizes nonaccrual balances by purpose at december  in s december  residential construction residential and commercial acquisition and development land development other purposes total nonaccrual loans during the nine months ended september   five loans totaling approximately million were transferred from nonaccrual status to other real estate owned  and during the quarter ended december   an additional nine loans totaling million were transferred to other real estate owned  bringing the total oreo balance to million at december  charges to the reserve for loan and lease losses at the time of transfer to other real estate owned to record the underlying collateral at fair value totaled million for the year ended december  non performing assets totaled of total loans at december  as compared to of total loans at december  a nonaccrual land development loan transferred to other real estate owned during the fourth quarter of with a principal balance of million and accrued interest of  million total is a shared appreciation credit  and as such  the company agreed to receive interest on the loan as lots sold rather than monthly  and the borrower agreed to share in the profits of the project 
interest was accrued and recognized in income on an ongoing basis 
upon moving the credit to nonaccrual status during the first quarter of  the company ceased to accrue additional interest on the loan and continued to carry  on its books  the previously accrued interest amount of  because it was supported by the most recent appraised value of the property at that time plus an added value for the recording of the approved map for the lots which was imminent 
upon foreclosure and transfer to other real estate owned during the fourth quarter of  the company obtained an updated appraisal to determine the current fair value of the property 
as a result of significant deterioration in the housing markets during this period  the company adjusted the carrying value of the property down by million during the fourth quarter of with a charge against the allowance for credit losses 
other real estate owned through foreclosure increased to million or of total assets at december   as compared to million or of total assets at december  during  three properties with net collateral value totaling million were transferred from nonaccrual loans  one of which was subsequently sold during the year 
the company increased its focus on the resolution of impaired assets during the later part of and will continue to do so until nonperforming assets return to minimal levels 
a million loan classified as restructured at december   paid off during the first quarter of  resulting in the recognition of approximately million in previously unrecognized interest income during  and the overall reduction of restructured loans at december  loans past due more than days are receiving increased management attention and are monitored for increased risk 
the company continues to move past due loans to nonaccrual status in its ongoing effort to recognize loan problems at an earlier point in time when they may be dealt with more effectively 
as impaired loans  nonaccrual and restructured loans are reviewed for specific reserve allocations and the allowance for credit losses is adjusted accordingly 
except for the loans included in the above table  and the land development loan discussed above  there were no loans at december  where the known credit problems of a borrower caused the company to have serious doubts as to the ability of such borrower to comply with the present loan repayment terms and which would result in such loan being included as a nonaccrual  past due or restructured loan at some future date 
liquidity and asset liability management the primary function of asset liability management is to provide adequate liquidity and maintain an appropriate balance between interest sensitive assets and interest sensitive liabilities 
liquidity liquidity management may be described as the ability to maintain sufficient cash flows to fulfill both on and off balance sheet financial obligations  including loan funding commitments and customer deposit withdrawals  without straining the company s equity structure 
to maintain an adequate liquidity position  the company relies on  in addition to cash and cash equivalents  cash inflows from deposits and short term borrowings  repayments of principal on loans and investments  and interest income received 
the company s principal cash outflows are for loan origination  purchases of investment securities  depositor withdrawals and payment of operating expenses 
other sources of liquidity not on the balance sheet at december  include unused collateralized and uncollateralized lines of credit from other banks  the federal home loan bank  and from the federal reserve bank totaling million 
cash and cash equivalents have declined during the three years ended december    and  with period end balances as follows from consolidated statements of cash flows in s balance december  december  december  december  cash and cash equivalents decreased million during the year ended december   as compared to a decrease of million and million during the years ended december  and  respectively 
the company has maintained positive cash flows from operations over the past three years  which amounted to million  million  and million for the years ended december    and  respectively 
the company experienced net cash outflows from investing activities totaling million during the year ended december   as purchases of investment securities interest bearing deposits in other banks exceeded net loan payoffs and maturities of investment securities during the period 
the company experienced net cash outflows from investing activities totaling million and million during the years ended december  and  respectively  as loan growth has exceeded net maturities of investment securities as well as other investment instruments during those years 
net cash flows from financing activities  including deposit growth and borrowings  have traditionally provided funding sources for loan growth  but during and the company experienced net cash outflows totaling million and million  respectively  as declines in net deposit accounts  as well as repurchases of the company s common stock  exceeded growth in financing categories  including borrowings 
the company has the ability to decrease loan growth  increase deposits and borrowings  or a combination of both to manage balance sheet liquidity 
liquidity risk arises from the possibility the company may not be able to satisfy current or future financial commitments  or the company may become unduly reliant on alternative funding sources 
the company maintains a liquidity risk management policy to address and manage this risk 
the policy identifies the primary sources of liquidity  establishes procedures for monitoring and measuring liquidity  and establishes minimum liquidity requirements  which comply with regulatory guidance 
the liquidity position is continually monitored and reported on a monthly basis to the board of directors 
the policy also includes a contingency funding plan to address liquidity needs in the event of an institution specific or a systemic financial market crisis 
in addition to unused lines of credit from other banks totaling million  the contingency plan includes steps that may be taken in the event the total liquidity ratio falls or is projected to fall below for any extended period of time 
the bank alco committee shall take steps to correct this condition using one or more of the following methods as needed investments near maturity may be sold to meet temporary funding needs but may need to be replaced to maintain liquidity ratios within acceptable limits 
unsecured fed funds lines with correspondents may be used to fund short term peaks in loan demand or deposit run off 
other off balance sheet funding sources such as credit lines at fhlb or the frb may be used for longer periods 
the bank will not rely on brokered money as a primary source of funds 
however  if may be prudent to utilize brokered deposits particularly at times when the interest costs are lower than could be obtained in the local market 
however  the sum of all brokered deposits will not exceed of the total deposits of the bank 
the bank may elect to operate a telemarketing money desk for the purpose of acquiring certificates of deposits from both the local market and national market 
the board of directors and management recognize that deposits acquired through money desk operations may be considered a higher cost and more volatile type of deposit than traditional bank deposits 
selling whole loans or participation in loans or by increasing the amounts sold in existing participation loans are additional means for increasing liquidity 
the state of california treasurer is a reliable source of deposits 
the bank can typically accept cd s from this source up to of equity as long as it has sufficient collateral pledged 
marketing for cd s within our marketplace is another means for raising funds or through programs that post our rates on their website  deposits from these sources should not exceed of the banks total deposits for extended periods beyond days without board approval 
should the bank become illiquid in spite of these steps  it will curtail its lending activities 
the first step in this process will be to curtail credit marketing and tighten pricing guidelines 
the second step will be to encourage loan payoffs on a selective basis where circumstances and loan documentation provide this opportunity 
only as a last resort will the bank totally curtail lending activities to credit worthy customers 
the company continues to utilize liability management  when needed  as part of its overall asset liability management strategy 
through the discretionary acquisition of short term borrowings  the company has been able to provide liquidity to fund asset growth while  at the same time  better utilizing its capital resources  and better controlling interest rate risk 
the borrowings are generally short term and more closely match the repricing characteristics of floating rate loans  which comprise approximately of the company s loan portfolio at december  this does not preclude the company from selling assets such as investment securities to fund liquidity needs but  with favorable borrowing rates  the company has maintained a positive yield spread between borrowed liabilities and the assets which those liabilities fund 
if  at some time  rate spreads become unfavorable  the company has the ability to utilize an asset management approach and  either control asset growth or  fund further growth with maturities or sales of investment securities 
the company s liquid asset base which generally consists of cash and due from banks  federal funds sold  securities purchased under agreements to resell reverse repos and investment securities  is maintained at a level deemed sufficient to provide the cash outlay necessary to fund loan growth as well as any customer deposit runoff that may occur 
within this framework is the objective of maximizing the yield on earning assets 
this is generally achieved by maintaining a high percentage of earning assets in loans  which historically have represented the company s highest yielding asset 
at december   the bank had of total assets in the loan portfolio and a loan to deposit ratio of 
liquid assets at december  include cash and cash equivalents totaling million as compared to million at december  liabilities used to fund liquidity sources include core and non core deposits as well as short term borrowings 
core deposits  which comprise approximately of total deposits at december   provide a significant and stable funding source for the company 
at december   unused lines of credit with the federal home loan bank and the federal reserve bank totaling million are collateralized in part by certain qualifying loans in the company s loan portfolio 
the carrying value of loans pledged on these used and unused borrowing lines totaled million at december  for further discussion of the company s borrowing lines  see short term borrowings included in previously in the financial condition section of this financial review 
enacted during as part of the government s emergency economic stabilization act  tarp treasury asset recovery program is a voluntary program established only for healthy financial institutions 
in order to receive tarp capital  institutions must undergo an extensive review by their primary regulator and the us treasury department 
along with high rates of interest  tarp capital comes with restrictions  including a us treasury department right to buy shares warrants in the company  and significant oversight requirements 
at this time  the company has not used tarp monies to increase capital 
the liquidity of the parent company  united security bancshares  is primarily dependent on the payment of cash dividends by its subsidiary  united security bank  subject to limitations imposed by the financial code of the state of california 
during and  total dividends paid by the bank to the parent company totaled million and million  respectively 
the company currently believes the bank has the ability in the future to pay sufficient cash dividends to the company to cover its ongoing cash requirements including quarterly interest payments on its junior subordinated debt

regulatory matters capital adequacy capital adequacy for bank holding companies and their subsidiary banks has become increasingly important in recent years 
continued deregulation of the banking industry since the s has resulted in  among other things  a broadening of business activities allowed beyond that of traditional banking products and services 
because of this volatility within the banking and financial services industry  regulatory agencies have increased their focus upon ensuring that banking institutions meet certain capital requirements as a means of protecting depositors and investors against such volatility 
during july  the company redeemed its million in trust preferred securities originally issued during under united security bancshares capital trust i 
during the same month  the company issued million in new trust preferred securities with similar terms under newly formed united security bancshares capital trust ii 
under applicable regulatory guidelines  the trust preferred securities qualify as tier capital up to a maximum of of tier capital 
any additional portion will qualify as tier capital 
as shareholders equity increases  the amount of tier capital that can be comprised of trust preferred securities will increase 
the board of governors of the federal reserve system board of governors has adopted regulations requiring insured institutions to maintain a minimum leverage ratio of tier capital the sum of common stockholders equity  noncumulative perpetual preferred stock and minority interests in consolidated subsidiaries  minus intangible assets  identified losses and investments in certain subsidiaries  plus unrealized losses or minus unrealized gains on available for sale securities to total assets 
institutions which have received the highest composite regulatory rating and which are not experiencing or anticipating significant growth are required to maintain a minimum leverage capital ratio of tier capital to total assets 
to be considered well capitalized  the institution must maintain a leverage capital ratio of 
all other institutions are required to maintain a minimum leverage capital ratio of at least to basis points above the minimum requirements 
the board of governors has also adopted a statement of policy  supplementing its leverage capital ratio requirements  which provides definitions of qualifying total capital consisting of tier capital and tier supplementary capital  including the allowance for loan losses up to a maximum of of risk weighted assets and sets forth minimum risk based capital ratios of capital to risk weighted assets 
the most highly rated insured institutions are required to maintain a minimum ratio of qualifying total capital to risk weighted assets of  at least one half of which must be in the form of tier capital 
to be considered well capitalized  institutions must maintain a ratio of qualifying total capital to risk weighted assets of  at least one half of which must be in the form of tier capital 
the following table sets forth the company s and the bank s actual capital positions at december  and the regulatory minimums for the company and the bank to be well capitalized under the guidelines discussed above company bank regulatory actual actual minimums capital ratios capital ratios well capitalized total risk based capital ratio tier capital to risk weighted assets leverage ratio under federal reserve guidelines  the company and the bank are required to maintain a total risk based capital ratio of  tier capital to risk weighted assets of  and a leverage ratio of  to be considered well capitalized 
as is indicated by the above table  the company and the bank exceeded all applicable regulatory capital guidelines at december  management believes that  under the current regulations  both will continue to meet their minimum capital requirements in the foreseeable future 
dividends dividends paid to shareholders by the company are subject to restrictions set forth in the california general corporation law 
the california general corporation law provides that a corporation may make a distribution to its shareholders if retained earnings immediately prior to the dividend payout are at least equal the amount of the proposed distribution 
the primary source of funds with which dividends will be paid to shareholders will come from cash dividends received by the company from the bank 
during the year ended december   the company received million in cash dividends from the bank  from which the company declared million in dividends to shareholders 
the bank as a state chartered bank is subject to dividend restrictions set forth in california state banking law  and administered by the california commissioner of financial institutions commissioner 
under such restrictions  the bank may not pay cash dividends in an amount which exceeds the lesser of the retained earnings of the bank or the bank s net income for the last three fiscal years less the amount of distributions to shareholders during that period of time 
if the above test is not met  cash dividends may only be paid with the prior approval of the commissioner  in an amount not exceeding the bank s net income for its last fiscal year or the amount of its net income for the current fiscal year 
such restrictions do not apply to stock dividends  which generally require neither the satisfaction of any tests nor the approval of the commissioner 
notwithstanding the foregoing  if the commissioner finds that the shareholders equity is not adequate or that the declarations of a dividend would be unsafe or unsound  the commissioner may order the state bank not to pay any dividend 
the frb may also limit dividends paid by the bank 
this is not the case with the bank 
year to date dividends of million and million paid to shareholders and the company  respectively  through december  were within the maximum allowed under those regulatory guidelines  and did not require prior approval of the commissioner

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate sensitivity and market risk an interest rate sensitive asset or liability is one that  within a defined time period  either matures or is subject to interest rate adjustments as market rates of interest change 
interest rate sensitivity is the measure of the volatility of earnings from movements in market rates of interest  which is generally reflected in interest rate spread 
as interest rates change in the market place  yields earned on assets do not necessarily move in tandem with interest rates paid on liabilities 
interest rate sensitivity is related to liquidity in that each is affected by maturing assets and sources of funds 
interest rate sensitivity is also affected by assets and liabilities with interest rates that are subject to change prior to maturity 
the object of interest rate sensitivity management is to minimize the impact on earnings from interest rate changes in the marketplace 
in recent years  deregulation  causing liabilities to become more interest rate sensitive  combined with interest rate volatility in the capital markets  has placed additional emphasis on this principal 
when management decides to maintain repricing imbalances  it usually does so on the basis of a well conceived strategy designed to ensure that the risk is not excessive and that liquidity is properly maintained 
the company s interest rate risk management is the responsibility of the asset liability management committee alco  which reports to the board of directors on a periodic basis  pursuant to established operating policies and procedures 
as part of its overall risk management  the company pursues various asset and liability management strategies  which may include obtaining derivative financial instruments to mitigate the impact of interest fluctuations on the company s net interest margin 
during the second quarter of  the company entered into a five year amortizing interest rate swap agreement with the purpose of minimizing interest rate fluctuations on its interest rate margin and equity 
the interest rate swap agreement matured on september  under the interest rate swap agreement  the company received a fixed rate and pays a variable rate based on the prime rate prime 
the swap qualified as a cash flow hedge under sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  as amended  and was designated as a hedge of the variability of cash flows the company receives from certain variable rate loans indexed to prime 
in accordance with sfas no 
 the swap agreement was measured at fair value and reported as an asset or liability on the consolidated balance sheet 
the portion of the change in the fair value of the swap that was deemed effective in hedging the cash flows of the designated assets were recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income and reclassified into interest income when such cash flow actually occured 
any ineffectiveness resulting from the hedge was recorded as a gain or loss in the consolidated statement of income as part of noninterest income 
the amortizing hedge had a remaining notional value of million and duration of approximately three months at december   and matured on september  during the years ended december  and   and  respectively  was reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income as a reduction to interest income 
the company performed a quarterly analysis of the effectiveness of the interest rate swap agreement at december  and for each of the quarters ended march  and june  as a result of a correlation analysis  the company determined that the swap remained highly effective in achieving offsetting cash flows attributable to the hedged risk during the term of the hedge and  therefore  continued to qualify for hedge accounting under the guidelines of sfas no 
however  during the second quarter of  the company determined that the underlying loans being hedged were paying off faster than the notional value of the hedge instrument was amortizing 
this difference between the notional value of the hedge and the underlying hedged assets is considered an overhedge pursuant to sfas no 
guidelines and may constitute ineffectiveness if the difference is other than temporary 
the company determined during that the difference was other than temporary and  as a result  reclassified a net total of  of the pretax hedge loss reported in other comprehensive income into earnings during as of december   the notional value of the hedge was still in excess of the value of the underlying loans being hedged by approximately million  but had improved from the million difference existing at december  as a result  the company recorded a pretax hedge gain related to swap ineffectiveness of approximately  during the december  with the interest rate swap maturing on september   the company recognized the remaining hedge ineffectiveness gains of  during amounts recognized as hedge ineffectiveness gains or losses are reflected in noninterest income 
interest rate risk can be measured through various methods including gap  duration and market value analysis as well as income simulation models  which provides a dynamic view of interest rate sensitivity based on the assumptions of the company s management 
the company employs each of these methods and refines these processes to make the most accurate measurements possible 
the information provided by these calculations is the basis for management decisions in managing interest rate risk 
from the gap report below  the company is apparently subject to interest rate risk to the extent that its liabilities have the potential to reprice more quickly than its assets within the next year 
at december   the company had a cumulative month gap of million or of total earning assets 
management believes the gap analysis shown below is not entirely indicative of the company s actual interest rate sensitivity  because certain interest sensitive liabilities would not reprice to the same degree as interest sensitive assets 
for example  if the prime rate were to change by basis points  the floating rate loans included in the million immediately adjustable category would change by the full basis points 
interest bearing checking and savings accounts which are also included in the immediately adjustable column probably would move only a portion of the basis point rate change and  in fact  might not even move at all 
the effects of market value risk have been mitigated to some degree by the makeup of the bank s balance sheet 
loans are generally short term or are floating rate instruments 
at december   million or of the loan portfolio matures or reprices within one year  and less than of the portfolio matures or reprices in more than years 
total investment securities including call options and prepayment assumptions  have a combined duration of approximately years 
more than million or of interest bearing liabilities mature or can be repriced within the next months  even though the rate elasticity of deposits with no defined maturities may not necessarily be the same as interest earning assets 
the following table sets forth the company s gap  or estimated interest rate sensitivity profile based on ending balances as of december   representing the interval of time before earning assets and interest bearing liabilities may respond to changes in market rates of interest 
assets and liabilities are categorized by remaining interest rate maturities rather than by principal maturities of obligations

see above for discussion of the impact of floating rate cd s 
the company utilizes a vendor purchased simulation model to analyze net interest income sensitivity to movements in interest rates 
the simulation model projects net interest income based on a   and basis point rise and a   and basis point fall in interest rates ramped over a twelve month period  with net interest impacts projected out as far as twenty four months 
in addition  a most likely scenario is projected based upon expected rate changes over the month period 
the model is based on the actual maturity and repricing characteristics of the company s interest sensitive assets and liabilities 
the model incorporates assumptions regarding the impact of changing interest rates on the prepayment of certain assets and liabilities 
projected net interest income is calculated assuming customers will reinvest maturing deposit accounts and the company will originate new loans 
the balance sheet growth assumptions utilized correspond closely to the company s strategic growth plans and annual budget 
excess cash is invested in overnight funds or other short term investments such as us treasuries 
cash shortfalls are covered through additional borrowing of overnight or short term funds 
the board of directors has adopted an interest rate risk policy which establishes maximum decreases in net interest income of and in the event of a bp and bp increase or decrease in market interest rates over a twelve month period 
based on the information and assumptions utilized in the simulation model at december   the resultant projected impact on net interest income falls within policy limits set by the board of directors for all rate scenarios simulated 
the company also utilizes the same vendor purchased simulation model to project the impact of changes in interest rates on the underlying market value of all the company s assets  liabilities  and off balance sheet accounts under alternative interest rate scenarios 
the resultant net value  as impacted under each projected interest rate scenario  is referred to as the market value of equity mv of equity 
this technique captures the interest rate risk of the company s business mix across all maturities 
the market analysis is performed using an immediate rate shock of   and basis points up and down calculating the present value of expected cash flows under each rate environment at applicable discount rates 
the market value of loans is calculated by discounting the expected future cash flows over either the term to maturity for fixed rate loans or scheduled repricing for floating rate loans using the current rate at which similar loans would be made to borrowers with similar credit ratings 
the market value of investment securities is based on quoted market prices obtained from reliable independent brokers 
the market value of time deposits is calculated by discounting the expected cash flows using current rates for similar instruments of comparable maturities 
the market value of deposits with no defined maturities  including interest bearing checking  money market and savings accounts is calculated by discounting the expected cash flows at a rate equal to the difference between the cost of these deposits and the alternate use of the funds  federal funds in this case 
assumed maturities for these deposits are estimated using decay analysis and are generally assumed to have implied maturities of less than five years 
for noninterest sensitive assets and liabilities  the market value is equal to their carrying value amounts at the reporting date 
the company s interest rate risk policy establishes maximum decreases in the company s market value of equity of and in the event of an immediate and sustained bp and bp increase or decrease in market interest rates 
as shown in the table below  the percentage changes in the net market value of the company s equity are within policy limits for both rising and falling rate scenarios 
the following sets forth the analysis of the company s market value risk inherent in its interest sensitive financial instruments as they relate to the entire balance sheet at december  and december  in thousands 
fair value estimates are subjective in nature and involve uncertainties and significant judgment and  therefore  cannot be determined with absolute precision 
assumptions have been made as to the appropriate discount rates  prepayment speeds  expected cash flows and other variables 
changes in these assumptions significantly affect the estimates and as such  the obtained fair value may not be indicative of the value negotiated in the actual sale or liquidation of such financial instruments  nor comparable to that reported by other financial institutions 
in addition  fair value estimates are based on existing financial instruments without attempting to estimate future business
