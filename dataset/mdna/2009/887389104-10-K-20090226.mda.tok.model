critical accounting policies and estimates the company s financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented 
the following paragraphs include a discussion of some critical areas that require a higher degree of judgment  estimates and complexity 
revenue recognition the company recognizes revenue when title passes to the customer

 employers accounting for postretirement benefits other than pensions  as applicable and as amended by sfas no 
 employers accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans 
the measurement of liabilities related to these plans is based on management s assumptions related to future events  including discount rates  rates of return on pension plan assets  rates of compensation increases and health care cost trend rates 
management regularly evaluates these assumptions and adjusts them as required and appropriate 
other plan assumptions are also reviewed on a regular basis to reflect recent experience and the company s future expectations 
actual experience that differs from these assumptions may affect future liquidity  expense and the overall financial position of the company 
while the company believes that current assumptions are appropriate  significant differences in actual experience or significant changes in these assumptions may materially affect the company s pension and other postretirement employee benefit obligations and its future expense and cash flow 
a discount rate is used to calculate the present value of expected future pension and postretirement cash flows as of the measurement date 
the company establishes the discount rate by constructing a portfolio of high quality corporate bonds and matching the coupon payments and bond maturities to projected benefit payments under the company s pension plans 
the bonds included in the portfolio are generally non callable and rated aa or higher by standard poor s 
a lower discount rate will result in a higher benefit obligation  conversely  a higher discount rate will result in a lower benefit obligation 
the discount rate is also used to calculate the annual interest cost  which is a component of net periodic benefit cost 
for expense purposes in  the company applied a discount rate of 
for expense purposes for  the company will apply this same discount rate 
a percentage point reduction in the discount rate would increase pension expense by approximately million for the expected rate of return on plan assets is determined by analyzing the historical long term performance of the company s pension plan assets  as well as the mix of plan assets between equities  fixed income securities and other investments  the expected long term rate of return expected for those asset classes and long term inflation rates 
short term asset performance can differ significantly from the expected rate of return  especially in volatile markets 
a lower than expected rate of return on pension plan assets will increase pension expense and future contributions 
for expense purposes in  the company applied an expected rate of return of for the company s pension plan assets 
for expense purposes for  the company will continue to use this same expected rate of return on plan assets 
a percentage point reduction in the expected rate of return would increase pension expense by approximately million for short term asset performance can differ significantly from the expected rate of return  especially in volatile markets 
a lower than expected rate of return on pension plan assets will increase pension expense and future contributions 
for measurement purposes for postretirement benefits  the company assumed a weighted average annual rate of increase in the per capita cost health care cost trend rate for medical benefits of for  declining steadily for the next years to  and for prescription drug benefits for  declining steadily for the next years to 
the assumed health care cost trend rate may have a significant effect on the amounts reported 
a one percentage point increase in the assumed health care cost trend rate would have increased the total service and interest components by million and would have increased the postretirement obligation by million 
a one percentage point decrease would provide corresponding reductions of million and million  respectively

in september  the world trade organization wto ruled that cdsoa payments are not consistent with international trade rules 
in february  us legislation was enacted that would end cdsoa distributions for imports covered by antidumping duty orders entering the us after september  instead  any such antidumping duties collected would remain with the us treasury

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk changes in short term interest rates related to several separate funding sources impact the company s earnings

under the terms of the interest rate swaps  the company receives interest at fixed rates and pays interest at variable rates 
the maturity date of the interest rate swaps is february  if the market rates for short term borrowings increased by one percentage point around the globe  the impact would be an increase in interest expense of million with a corresponding decrease in income before income taxes of the same amount

in addition to the direct impact of the hedged amounts  changes in exchange rates also affect the volume of sales or foreign currency sales price as competitors products become more or less attractive
