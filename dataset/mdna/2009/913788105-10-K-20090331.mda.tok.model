item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations executive summary the year marked our second full year as a publicly traded company 
consistent with our operating history  we continued to grow our business in the rapidly expanding battery and supply chain management industries 
overall  our revenue growth compared to was accomplished by increasing our penetration of new and existing customer accounts and diversifying our product mix 
for the full year  our revenues increased to million  up million  or  from million for our operating income decreased to million in  down million from million in our net income decreased to million in  down million from million in our revenues from sources other than brink s home security and its authorized dealers rose to million from million for  reflecting growth of new and existing customer accounts and improved product mix 
growth in our higher margin business for was driven approximately by volume and by price increases 
revenues from brink s home security and its authorized dealers decreased to million  down compared to million for we believe this decrease primarily reflects slower growth in the residential housing market 
gross margin improved as a percentage of revenues for the year ended december  to compared to for the comparable period in due primarily to an improved product mix 
we believe the revenue growth in over in our battery and related power accessory business reflects more focused marketing efforts and increased market penetration 
we also expanded our battery  charger and power accessory lines to better meet the evolving needs of our customers and ultimately  the end user 
we will continue to capitalize on favorable industry trends  such as the growing demand for productivity mobility and portability in the consumer electronics industry 
while s financial results were comparatively strong  the year was not without its challenges 
throughout the full year  we faced higher raw material costs as prices of lead  copper and zinc reached new levels 
sales to brink s home security and its authorized dealers was down in  offset by continued growth and strength of our battery and related power accessory business 
our business has also been impacted by the severest recession to hit the us economy in over a generation 
despite these challenges  we are on financially sound footing with a strong balance sheet and line of credit to provide the resources for continued growth 
in december  roger tannery  our chief financial officer  resigned and in january we entered into a separation agreement with randy hardin who had served as our chief executive officer since ian edmonds  our executive vice president and chief operating officer  was appointed to fill both positions on an interim basis 
in the fourth quarter of  we expensed  in connection with mr 
tannery s resignation 
the total payments due to or for the benefit of mr 
hardin under his separation agreement total approximately  payable over a two year period  will be expensed in the first quarter of in march we entered into an agreement canceling the arrangement we had with our primary independent sourcing agent 
the total payments due to our former independent sourcing agent under this cancellation agreement total million  payable over a three year period  of which  was expensed in and approximately million will be expensed in the first quarter of we remain cautiously optimistic and opportunistic about our core business  though growing slower than we anticipated  is strong despite the recession 
in addition to taking steps to manage the difficult economic conditions  we are also focused on developing higher margin products and markets  and diversifying our markets to minimize our exposure to the broader economy 
in january  we completed the acquisition of the assets and hunting product line  including all tangible and intangible property related thereto  marketed under the tradename monarch 
the high quality monarch product line is a strategic extension of both our existing outdoor product line and customer base 
we plan to leverage our global network of suppliers and expertise in supply chain logistics to reduce manufacturing and other supply chain costs for the acquired product line 
we are cautiously and diligently evaluating markets and acquisition opportunities that will facilitate reaching our strategic objectives 
we remain conservative on this front due to the economic climate 
however  we believe that the current recession and the associated deterioration in stock values and market prices has created growth opportunities 
we believe that with our strong balance sheet  a relatively healthy core business and unused capacity under our banking facility  we are well positioned to take advantage of these opportunities 
we continue to make the necessary investments in our infrastructure  namely  our distribution facilities  our warehouse management system and our people  to support and facilitate our immediate and long term growth objectives 
results of operations year ended december  compared to december revenues net revenues for the year ended december  were million compared to net revenues of million for the similar period in  an increase of million  or 
revenues from brink s home security and its authorized dealers  was million compared to million in the period  a decrease of million  or 
as most of our brink s home security business is related to residential security systems  we attribute this decrease primarily to the overall slowdown in the residential construction industry  thus slowing the demand for certain security products 
revenues from batteries and related power accessories increased million to approximately million in from million in  or 
we attribute this increase to a more focused marketing effort to existing and new accounts 
cost of sales cost of sales is comprised of the base product cost  commissions to sourcing agents  freight  duty and servicing fees where applicable 
cost of sales totaled million for the year ended december   compared to million in the comparable period  an increase of million  or 
cost of sales as a percentage of sales decreased to in the period from for the comparable period 
this cost decrease was attributable to higher margins on batteries and related power accessories but offset by lower margins earned on sales to brink s home security and its authorized dealers 
our overall gross margin for the year ended december   was approximately compared to a gross margin of for the comparable period in operating expenses selling  general and administrative expenses increased approximately million or to approximately million from million for the similar period in of this increase  approximate amounts totaling million was attributable to bad debts  million was attributable to compensation and other employee related expenses  including the amount payable to our former chief financial officer under his separation agreement  million for additional facilities costs including the transition to a larger warehouse facility  million for sales related costs including marketing  travel and trade show participation  and general corporate expenses of million 
interest expense our interest expense totaled million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december   a decrease of million  or 
the decrease is due to a decrease in the interest rate on the portion of our outstanding borrowings under our bank line of credit that were not hedged under our swap agreement 
for the year ended december  the average outstanding loan balance on our line of credit was million  compared to million for the year ended december  liquidity we had cash and cash equivalents of million and million at december  and  respectively 
net cash provided by operating activities was million through december compared to cash used in operations of million for cash used in investing activities was million through december compared to million for the cash used in was used for the purchase of property and equipment totaling million and restricted cash deposited in escrow totaling million under the monarch asset purchase agreement 
the cash used in was used for the purchase of property and equipment 
net cash provided by financing activities during was million compared to million used by financing activities for the net cash provided by financing activities for included a million net change in our line of credit and a million reduction in our notes payable to zunicom 
the net cash used in was related to million in net borrowings under our line of credit 
we have a million line of credit with compass bank  which matures on july  this credit facility bears interest at libor index rate plus a sliding range from to based on quarterly covenant performance 
at december  that rate was 
in june  we entered into an interest rate swap agreement which locks in a fixed rate of on the first million outstanding under the line of credit  thus swapping the fixed rate for the current variable rate as calculated under the original loan agreement through its maturity date of july  the interest rate swap is accounted for as an effective cash flow hedge and the unrealized gains or losses related to the change in fair value is recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income loss 
the line of credit is due on demand and is secured by accounts receivable  inventories and equipment 
the line s availability is based on a borrowing formula  which allows for borrowings equal to of our eligible accounts receivable and a percentage of eligible inventory 
in addition  we must maintain certain financial covenants including ratios on funded debt to ebitda  as well as a fixed charge ratio 
at december   approximately million was outstanding under the line of credit and approximately million remained available for borrowings under the line of credit based on the borrowing formula 
as of december   we were in default of the loan agreement with compass as a result of our failure to satisfy certain financial and non financial covenants 
we also expect that we will be in default for the quarter ending march  as a result of our failure to satisfy certain financial covenants 
this latter failure is attributable to the fact that we will incur charges of approximately million in the first quarter of relating to the separation agreements that we entered into with our former chief executive officer and independent sourcing agent see note l in the first quarter of the bank has waived the events of default that existed at december  and those that we believe exist with respect to the quarter ended march  in addition  the bank intends to modify the relevant covenants such that we may be in compliance commencing with the quarter ending june  capital resources at december  we did not have any material commitments for capital expenditures 
we may enter into various commitments during if expansion opportunities arise 
material items will be disclosed in press releases and other appropriate filings as they develop 
we have no off balance sheet financing arrangements 
contractual obligations the following table summarizes the amounts of payments due under specified contractual obligations at december  payments due by period contractual obligations total less than year years years more than years long term debt facilities leases equipment leases separation agreement total in  we issued two notes to our former parent  zunicom 
these obligations are reflected in the table above as long term debt 
one note  in the original principal amount of million  represented the final dividend prior to our ipo 
the second note  in the original principal amount of million  represented the value of zunicom s net operating losses that we were able to use to offset our taxable income in the years prior to the ipo 
both notes bear interest at  require quarterly payments of interest and principal beginning september  and mature on june  the aggregate balance due on the notes as of december  was million 
in december we entered into a separation agreement with our former chief financial officer 
under the agreement  we are obligated to make payments aggregating approximately  over a twelve month period ending december  which includes the premiums payable to our health insurance carrier for as long as he is entitled to maintain such insurance under cobra 
the table above does not include payments due to randy hardin under his separation agreement or to our former independent sourcing agent  under his cancellation agreement

the former sourcing agent will receive aggregate payments of million over a three year period  including  which was accrued in international currency fluctuation the goods that we purchase from asia are subject to international currency fluctuations 
management does not believe that the fluctuation in currency presents a serious threat to its operations 
critical accounting policies our financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  which require us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and revenues and expenses during the periods reported 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
we believe the following are the critical accounting policies which could have the most significant effect on our reported results and require the most difficult  subjective or complex judgments by management 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue in accordance with staff accounting bulletin no 
when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the price is fixed and determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured 
we are a distributor who purchases both finished goods and components from domestic and international suppliers 
we add value to products and components by packaging them in customer specified kits or tailor made units that are convenient for the customer to order and ship 
additionally  we have several customers that require specific battery pack assemblies 
we obtain batteries and components and reconfigure finished goods based upon customer specifications 
we refer to this process as battery pack assemblies 
we recognize sales of finished goods at the time the customer takes title to the product 
we sell products to several customers in bulk quantities 
we obtain the order from the customer and arrange for the delivery of the product directly from our vendor to the customer to reduce freight costs and wear and tear on the product from excessive handling 
we refer to these transactions as drop shipments because the product is shipped directly from our vendor to our customer 
we also have an inventory fulfillment agreement with brink s home security 
we purchase  handle  assemble and deliver security and installation components to brink s home security and to its authorized dealers 
revenues from drop shipment transactions and pursuant to the brink s home security agreement  are recognized on a gross basis at the time the customer takes title to the product  based on our analysis of the criteria defined in emerging issues task force issue no 
for gross revenue reporting 
specifically  i we are the primary obligor  ii we have general and physical loss inventory risk  iii we have credit risk  iv in most cases  we have discretion in supplier selection and product specifications  and v we have reasonable latitude within economic constraints to negotiate prices and terms with our customers 
income taxes in january  we adopted the financial accounting standards board interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
fin 
this interpretation clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in a company s financial statements 
fin requires companies to determine whether it is more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained upon examination by the appropriate taxing authorities before any part of the benefit can be recorded in the financial statements 
it also provides guidance on the recognition  measurement and classification of income tax uncertainties  along with any related interest and penalties 
we did not recognize any adjustments to the financial statements as a result of our implementation of fin we utilize the asset and liability approach to accounting and reporting for income taxes in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
deferred income tax assets and liabilities are computed annually for differences between the financial and tax basis of assets and liabilities that will result in taxable or deductible amounts in the future based on enacted tax laws and rates applicable to the periods in which the differences are expected to affect taxable income 
valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized 
income tax expense or benefit is the tax payable or refundable for the period plus or minus the change during the period in deferred tax assets and liabilities 
we use an estimate of our annual income tax rate to recognize a provision for income taxes in financial statements for interim periods 
however  changes in facts and circumstances could result in adjustments to our effective tax rate in future quarterly or annual periods 
accounts receivable trade accounts receivable are stated at the amount we expect to collect 
we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
management considers the following factors when determining the collectibility of specific customer accounts customer credit worthiness  past transaction history with the customer  current economic industry trends and changes in customer payment terms 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  adversely affecting their ability to make payments  additional allowances would be required 
based on management s assessment  we provide for estimated uncollectible amounts through a charge to earnings and a credit to a valuation allowance 
balances that remain outstanding after the company has used reasonable collection efforts are written off through a charge to the valuation allowance and a credit to accounts receivable 
stock based compensation we account for stock options under the provisions of financial accounting standards no 
revised  share based payment fas r  which requires the recognition of the fair value of stock based compensation 
under the fair value recognition provisions for fas r  stock based compensation cost is estimated at the grant date based on the fair vlaue of the awards expected to vest and recognized as expense ratably over the requisite service period of the award 
we have used the black scholes valuation model to estimate fair value of our stock based awards  which requires various judgmental assumptions including estimating stock price volatility  forfeiture rates and expected life 
our computation of expected volatility is based on a combination of historical and market based implied volatility 
in addition  we consider many factors when estimating expected forfeitures and expected life  including types of awards  employee class and historical experience 
if any of the assumptions used in the black scholes model change significantly  stock based compensation expense may differ materially in the future from that recorded in the current period 
recent accounting pronouncements in march  the fasb issued sfas no 
 disclosures about derivative instruments and hedging activities  an amendment of fasb statement no 
sfas no 

sfas no 
requires enhanced disclosures about an entity s derivative and hedging activities and thereby improves the transparency of financial reporting 
sfas no 
is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years and interim periods beginning after november   with early application encouraged 
sfas no 
encourages  but does not require  comparative disclosures for earlier periods at initial adoption 
management is currently evaluating the effects of sfas no 
 but the standard is not expected to have a material impact on the company s financial statements 
on january  we adopted sfas no 
 fair value measurements 
sfas no 
which defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value in generally accepted accounting principles and expands disclosures about fair value measurements 
sfas no 
does not require any new fair value measurements  but provides guidance on how to measure fair value by providing a fair value hierarchy used to classify the source of the information 
on december   the fasb issued fsp fas b which would delay the effective date of sfas no 
for all nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities  except those that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis at least annually 
this proposed fsp partially defers the effective date of sfas no 
to fiscal years beginning after november  and interim periods within those fiscal years for items within the scope of this fsp 
the adoption of sfas no 
for nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities is not expected to have a material impact on the company s financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
r  business combinations sfas r  which replaces sfas the provisions of sfas no 
r are similar to those of sfas no 
 however  sfas no 
r requires companies to record most identifiable assets  liabilities  noncontrolling interests and goodwill acquired in a business combination at full fair value 
sfas no 
r also requires companies to record fair value estimates of contingent consideration and certain other potential liabilities during the original purchase price allocation and to expense acquisition costs as incurred 
this statement applies to all business combinations  including combinations by contract alone 
further  under sfas no 
r  all business combinations will be accounted for by applying the acquisition method 
sfas no 
r is effective for fiscal years beginning on or after december  the company will apply the provisions of sfas no 
r to business combinations after december item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk as a smaller reporting company we are not required to provide the information required by this item
