founded in as a catalog company  today we are a multi channel specialty retailer generating billion in net sales in fiscal our proprietary merchandise assortment reflects a sophisticated yet relaxed and casual lifestyle 
a commitment to providing superior customer service is manifest in all aspects of our business 
we serve our customers through an expanding base of retail stores  as well as our catalog and e commerce channels

for a more detailed description of our business  see item business of part i of this report 
we currently have two operating segments retail and direct 
we believe there is an opportunity for us to grow our premium retail store base to to stores in more than identified markets nationwide 
in fiscal  we opened premium retail stores  increasing our total premium store count to  covering markets 
approximately percent of these stores are located in traditional malls  percent in lifestyle centers and percent in street locations 
in addition to our premium retail stores we also had merchandise clearance outlets in operation at the end of fiscal in an effort to sustain our financial stability in these challenging macroeconomic conditions  which are evidenced in our business by low retail store traffic levels and a highly competitive retail selling environment  we currently plan to open no more than ten retail stores during fiscal  the majority of which are planned for opening in the first half of the year 
new premium retail stores will average approximately  square feet 
as of march   one premium retail store has been opened in the first quarter of fiscal  for a premium retail total store count of though it is our present intention to open no more than ten new retail stores in fiscal  we do not maintain a specific rollout plan beyond a one year horizon 
as evidenced by the reduction in store growth plans for fiscal  we continually reassess store rollout plans based on the overall retail environment  the performance of the retail business  our access to working capital and external financing and the availability of suitable store locations 
for example  it is possible that in any year we will increase planned store openings  particularly if we experience strong retail sales and have access to the necessary working capital or external financing 
likewise  we would be inclined to curtail store rollout if we were to experience weaker retail sales or if we did not have adequate working capital or access to financing  or as a part of a cost containment initiative 
during fiscal  our merchandise was offered through two core catalog titles northcountry and coldwater creek  which differentiate the merchandise assortment offered in each title to cater to the various lifestyles of our core customer 
we continue to evaluate our catalogs to ensure that we are reaching the greatest number of customers in the most effective and efficient manner possible 
as a result  we began offering our merchandise under a single catalog title during late fiscal and expect to continue to operate under one catalog title during fiscal as part of our focus on efficiently managing resources and containing costs  we decreased catalog circulation to approximately million catalogs in fiscal from approximately million mailed in fiscal we currently plan to mail approximately million catalogs in fiscal company initiatives during fiscal our business continued to be affected by increasingly challenging macroeconomic conditions  which are evidenced in our business by a highly competitive retail selling environment  low retail store traffic levels and a shift in customer purchasing toward more value priced 
table of contents merchandise 
these conditions worsened in our third and fourth fiscal quarters with the deterioration of the financial  credit and housing markets which led to further decline in consumer confidence and the decreased availability of consumer credit 
we expect to continue to face these challenging conditions  during fiscal and for the foreseeable future 
our efforts in fiscal will continue to be focused on certain initiatives which we implemented during fiscal we believe these initiatives will continue to further our goal of becoming one of the premier specialty retailers for women years of age and older in the united states 
these key initiatives include increased focus on product and customer experience injecting product and the customer into decision making throughout the company restoration of the full price heritage of the coldwater creek brand shift in marketing approach increased efficiency in the use of resources our product and the customer experience are the foundation of all decision making at coldwater creek 
our highest priority is to continually improve our product and assortment as we believe that our success depends on offering the appropriate balance of fashion  fit and value that is relevant to the entire range of our target customer base 
we are focused on expanding our product by offering more diversity in fit and fabrics to ensure we are more relevant to our entire customer demographic 
during  we were able to make progress in this initiative by lowering our style and color count by approximately percent  allowing us to better execute on our product offerings 
in addition  we were able to expand our direct sourcing from percent of our apparel in fiscal to approximately percent of our apparel in fiscal we believe there is opportunity to slightly increase our direct sourcing during fiscal during the twelve month period ended january   we reduced our retail inventory per square foot by approximately percent  while premium retail square footage grew by approximately percent over the same period 
we believe these efforts have positioned us to continue to improve on our product and customer experience in fiscal during the fourth quarter of fiscal  we made some changes to our merchandising team and its structure 
these changes have enabled us to better integrate our merchandise design and product development teams  which we believe will enable us to offer a more compelling product and enhance efficiency 
we are committed to restoring the full price heritage to our brand by continuing to be more prudent with promotional activity and discounting 
specifically  we have begun to limit the frequency  length  duration  and amount of our overall promotion cadence 
however  we will continue to have promotions to drive traffic to our stores and to remain competitive in this challenging environment 
during fiscal  we refined our promotional approach to feature fewer  but more targeted campaigns 
this is evidenced by a reduction in transactions carrying a promotional discount from percent during fiscal to percent during fiscal we believe that prudently managing our promotions and discounting  accompanied with lowering our style and color count  reducing our retail inventories per square foot  and expanding our direct sourcing program  is critical to improving margins and returning to our full price heritage 
in addition  we have seen a shift in customer purchasing toward more value priced merchandise  which we believe is a result of today s challenging economic conditions and the decline in consumer confidence 
therefore  during fiscal  we will continue to work towards offering quality merchandise at a compelling price point 
we define promotional discounts generally as temporary offerings 
these include coupons and in store promotions to customers for specified dollar or percentage discounts 

table of contents historically  we have used a broad based marketing strategy of catalog circulation and national magazine advertising 
during fiscal we shifted to a more point of sale  in store focus through programs such as personal shopper 
we are also working to create a consistent message across all of our distribution channels to drive customers to our stores 
we are developing traffic drivers through innovative e mail campaigns  retail mailers and newspaper ads  as well as through our customer loyalty programs  as we continue to be focused on maintaining and better engaging our best customers  as well as attracting new customers through select advertising placement 
we continue to test and refine these promotions to ensure that we are reaching the greatest number of customers in the most cost effective and efficient manner possible 
as a result of this more focused approach  during fiscal  marketing expense  primarily national magazine advertising and catalog circulation  decreased approximately million  as compared with fiscal during fiscal we decreased national magazine advertising circulation by percent compared to fiscal our investment in national magazine advertisements decreased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal we expect to reduce our investment in national magazine advertisements further during fiscal catalog circulation also decreased by million  or percent  during the same period  from million catalogs to million catalogs 
the decrease in catalog circulation was primarily due to reduced northcountry catalog mailings and the discontinuation of spirit catalog mailings 
we continue to evaluate our catalogs to ensure that we are reaching the greatest number of customers in the most effective and efficient manner possible 
as a result  we began offering our merchandise under a single catalog title during late fiscal and expect to continue to operate under one catalog title during fiscal we have added approximately  net new addresses to our e mail database since february  and conducted more targeted e mail campaigns  which resulted in an additional percent or million e mails being delivered during fiscal  as compared with fiscal in addition to a more focused approach on marketing  we have carefully evaluated our entire organization to determine where we can improve operational efficiencies 
we remain focused on further reducing our cost structure and preserving capital as business conditions warrant 
during the third and fourth quarters of fiscal  we realigned staffing of our retail operations  resulting in additional cost savings 
we also completed a plan to right size our organizational structure for the current environment by eliminating certain corporate support positions 
we believe that these select staff reductions  as well as reduced travel  lower catalog page counts  more cost effective advertising and other cost savings initiatives could result in approximately million of additional sg a savings in fiscal in addition  we reduced our planned capital expenditures to approximately million in fiscal  down from approximately million in fiscal  which is based on opening no more than ten new retail stores during fiscal we are also continuing to improve various information technology tools and systems to enhance operating efficiency and enable our infrastructure to accommodate growth 
during fiscal  we continued activities to enhance or replace several fundamental systems  such as our inventory planning and allocation systems 
we also continued efforts to enhance our financial and human resources systems  which we installed in fiscal we also continued to make improvements in our distribution infrastructure  processes and technology in order to expedite the flow of merchandise through our distribution center  with the goal of moving product more quickly to our direct customers and premium retail stores 
although we have made substantial progress on these initiatives during  our business remains subject to the challenging macroeconomic conditions 
we are continuing to focus on lowering our cost structure  prudently managing our growth and improving our merchandise assortment and inventory management  which we believe will allow us to navigate through this difficult environment

net sales decreased during fiscal as compared to fiscal primarily due to decreases in comparable premium store sales and decreases in sales through our direct segment 
this decrease was partially offset by sales resulting from the addition of premium retail stores and five merchandise clearance outlet stores since february  
table of contents comparable premium retail store sales growth by quarter is as follows percentage increase decrease premium retail store base fiscal fiscal fiscal fiscal fourth quarter third quarter second quarter first quarter we believe our sales performance for fiscal was negatively impacted by the current challenging economic conditions  which are evidenced in our business by a highly competitive retail selling environment  low retail store traffic levels and a shift in customer purchasing toward more value priced merchandise 
during fiscal  we experienced a decline in comparable premium retail store traffic of and a decrease in average transaction value in both our premium retail stores and direct channel of and  respectively  as compared to fiscal the decrease in average transaction value was primarily due to higher levels of markdowns in both segments 
during fiscal  catalog circulation also decreased by million  or percent  compared to fiscal we define comparable premium stores as those stores in which the gross square footage has not changed by more than percent in the previous months and which have been open for at least consecutive months provided that store has been considered comparable for the entire quarter without closure for seven consecutive days or moving to a different temporary or permanent location 
due to the extensive promotions that occur as part of the opening of a premium store  we believe waiting months rather than months to consider a store comparable provides a better view of the growth pattern of the premium retail store base 
the calculation of comparable store sales varies across the retail industry and as a result  the calculations of other retail companies may not be consistent with our calculation 
we define markdowns generally as permanent reductions from the original selling price 
shipping fees received from customers for delivery of merchandise decreased million to million for fiscal as compared to fiscal as a result of lower direct sales in fiscal we experienced an increase in co branded credit card marketing fee revenue and royalty revenue of million for fiscal as compared to fiscal the increase in revenue from the co branded credit card program is the result of an increase in sales royalty and revenue sharing

table of contents the decrease in marketing expenses as a percentage of net sales was driven primarily by decreased catalog and national magazine advertising circulation and the discontinuation of testing of television advertising 
the reduced leveraging in employee expenses is primarily due to the decrease in comparable store sales  partially offset by expense reductions as a result of cost savings initiatives 
the reduced leveraging in overhead expenses is also primarily due to the decrease in comparable store sales  partially offset by a decrease in store pre opening costs and expense reductions as a result of cost savings initiatives

seasonality as with many apparel retailers  our net sales  operating results  liquidity and cash flows have fluctuated  and will continue to fluctuate  as a result of a number of factors  including the following the composition  size and timing of various merchandise offerings  the number and timing of premium retail store openings  the timing of catalog mailings and the number of catalogs mailed  the timing of e mail campaigns  customer response to merchandise offerings  including the impact of economic and weather related influences  the actions of competitors and similar factors  overall merchandise return rates  including the impact of actual or perceived service and quality issues  our ability to accurately estimate and accrue for merchandise returns and the costs of obsolete inventory disposition  market price fluctuations in critical materials and services  including paper  production  postage and telecommunications costs  the timing of merchandise receiving and shipping  including any delays resulting from labor strikes or slowdowns  adverse weather conditions  health epidemics or national security measures  and shifts in the timing of important holiday selling seasons relative to our fiscal quarters  including valentine s day  easter  mother s day  thanksgiving and christmas 
we alter the composition  magnitude and timing of merchandise offerings based upon an understanding of prevailing consumer demand  preferences and trends 
the timing of merchandise offerings may be further impacted by  among other factors  the performance of various third parties on which we are dependent 
additionally  the net sales we realize from a particular merchandise offering may impact more than one fiscal quarter and year and the amount and pattern of the sales realization 
table of contents may differ from that realized by a similar merchandise offering in a prior fiscal quarter or year 
the majority of net sales from a merchandise offering generally are realized within the first several weeks after its introduction with an expected significant decline in customer demand thereafter 
our business materially depends on sales and profits from the november and december holiday shopping season 
in anticipation of traditionally increased holiday sales activity  we incur certain significant incremental expenses  including the hiring of a substantial number of temporary employees to supplement the existing workforce 
additionally  as gift items and accessories are more prominently represented in the november and december holiday season merchandise offerings  we typically expect  absent offsetting factors  to realize higher consolidated gross margins and earnings in the second half of our fiscal year 
if  for any reason  we were to realize significantly lower than expected sales or profits during the november and december holiday selling season  as we did in fiscals and  our financial condition  results of operations  including related gross margins and cash flows for the entire fiscal year will be materially adversely affected 
liquidity and capital resources in recent fiscal years  we financed ongoing operations and growth initiatives primarily from cash flow generated by operations  trade credit arrangements and the proceeds from our may public offering of common stock 
however  as we produce catalogs  open retail stores and purchase inventory in anticipation of future sales realization  and as operating cash flows and working capital experience fluctuations  we may occasionally utilize our bank credit facility 
on february   we entered into a secured credit agreement the agreement with wells fargo retail finance  llc 
this credit facility replaces our previous unsecured revolving line of credit with wells fargo bank  na pursuant to the amended and restated credit agreement dated february   as amended on april  and january  the prior agreement 
the agreement provides for a million revolving line of credit  with subfacilities for the issuance of up to million in letters of credit and swingline advances of up to million 
the credit facility has a maturity date of february  the actual amount of credit that is available from time to time under the agreement is limited to a borrowing base amount that is determined according to  among other things  a percentage of the value of eligible inventory plus a percentage of the value of eligible credit card receivables  as reduced by certain reserve amounts that may be required by the lender 
the proceeds of any borrowings under the agreement are available for working capital and other general corporate purposes 
we did not incur any material early termination penalties in connection with the termination of the prior agreement 
borrowings under the agreement will generally accrue interest at a margin ranging from to determined according to the average unused availability under the credit facility over a reference rate of  at the company s election  either libor or a base rate as defined in the agreement 
letters of credit under the credit facility accrue fees at a rate equal to interest margin that is in effect from time to time 
commitment fees accrue at a rate of  which is assessed on the average unused portion of the credit facility maximum amount 
the agreement has financial covenants that are limited to capital expenditures  minimum inventory book value and maximum facility usage as a percentage of the borrowing base value 
the agreement also contains various restrictive covenants relating to customary matters  such as indebtedness  liens  investments  acquisitions  mergers  dispositions and dividends 
the agreement generally contains customary events of default for credit facilities of this type 
upon an event of default that is not cured or waived within any applicable cure periods  in addition to other remedies that may be available to the lender  the obligations under the agreement may be accelerated  outstanding letters of credit may be required to be cash collateralized and remedies may be exercised against the collateral 

table of contents as of january  and february  we had no borrowings outstanding under the prior agreement and million and million in commercial letters of credit issued  respectively 
operating activities generated million  million and million of positive cash flow during fiscals  and  respectively 
on a comparative year to year basis  the million increase in cash flows from operating activities in fiscal from fiscal resulted primarily from lower operating expenses  reduced payments on inventory purchases  reduced marketing costs and taxes received of million versus taxes paid of million in the comparable period 
we also experienced an increase in cash collected on tenant allowances of million as total cash collected was million in fiscal as compared to million in fiscal this increase was offset by decreased revenue and lower gross margins and a decrease in cash collected on interest income of million 
on a comparative year to year basis  the million decrease in cash flows from operating activities in fiscal from fiscal resulted primarily from higher operating expenses and inventory purchases  including accelerated payments of million on inventory purchases to take advantage of early payment discounts  primarily related to our retail expansion 
we also experienced a decrease in cash collected on tenant allowances of million as total cash collected was million in fiscal as compared to million in fiscal operating cash flows also decreased as a result of a decrease of million in fees collected from our co branded credit card program and a decrease in cash collected on interest income of million 
this decrease was offset by increased revenues and lower taxes paid of million in fiscal as compared to fiscal cash outflows from investing activities principally consisted of capital expenditures which totaled million  million and million during fiscal  fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
capital expenditures in fiscal primarily related to leasehold improvements and furniture and fixtures associated with the opening of additional premium retail stores  five merchandise clearance outlet stores and four premium retail stores under construction  and to a lesser extent the remodeling of certain existing stores  and the expansion of our it and distribution infrastructure

capital expenditures in fiscal primarily relate to leasehold improvements and furniture and fixtures associated with the opening of additional premium retail stores  and to a lesser extent our opening of three new outlet stores  the remodeling of certain existing stores  and the expansion of our it and distribution infrastructure 
cash outflows for fiscal and fiscal were offset by cash inflows of million and million  respectively  related to the proceeds from the sale of certain assets 
cash inflows from financing activities were million during fiscal compared with cash outflows from financing activities of million for fiscal and cash inflows from financing activities of million for fiscal during fiscal  cash inflows of million related to stock option exercises  purchases of shares under our employee stock purchase plan and tax benefits related to the exercise of stock options were offset by million in cash outflows related to payments on our capital lease and other financing obligations 
the cash outflows in fiscal related to the purchase and retirement of our common stock of million  partially offset by cash inflows of million related to stock option exercises  purchases of shares under our employee stock purchase plan and tax benefits related to the exercise of stock options 
the cash inflows in fiscal were derived from activity related to stock option exercises and tax benefits related to the exercise of stock options 

table of contents as a result of the foregoing  we had million in working capital at january   compared with million at february  our current ratio was at january   compared with at february  capital expenditures for the full year in fiscal are expected to be approximately million  primarily associated with the premium retail store expansion  store related expenditures and  to a lesser extent  investments in information technology and other corporate related capital expenditures 
the deterioration of the financial  credit and housing markets has led to declines in consumer confidence  reduced credit availability  and liquidity concerns 
we have factored these concerns into our current business and have responded by implementing significant cost and capital savings initiatives 
in addition  we have reduced our store growth plans for fiscal to no more than ten new retail stores  which will result in capital expenditures of approximately million 
we have also invested our cash deposits in us treasury bills and money market funds that are invested in us treasury securities 
we have no borrowings outstanding under our prior or new credit facility and do not anticipate borrowing under our new credit facility during fiscal we believe cash flow from operations and current cash on hand will be sufficient to fund current operations and retail store openings under our current store roll out plan 
however  if the macroeconomic environment were to continue to deteriorate  it is possible that consumer spending could decline further and impact our cash flows  which may require us to borrow under our credit facility 
it is also possible that due to the impact of worsening economic conditions on our business  should we need to access our credit facility  it may not be available in full  or at all  for future borrowings  due to borrowing base and other limitations 
future outlook we continue to operate and compete in increasingly challenging economic conditions 
these conditions worsened in our third and fourth fiscal quarters with the deterioration of the financial  credit and housing markets which led to further decline in consumer confidence and the decreased availability of consumer credit 
these conditions have carried into the first quarter of fiscal and continue to have a negative impact on our sales  gross margins and earnings 
we believe the current conditions  in particular low retail store traffic levels  highly competitive retail selling environment and a shift in customer purchasing toward more value priced merchandise  will continue into fiscal and the foreseeable future 
given the current macroeconomic outlook  our main focus for the foreseeable future will continue to be preservation of our brand and core competencies  and the prudent management of our business  including controlling costs  managing our inventory levels and preserving cash 
for this reason  we determined during the third quarter of fiscal to significantly decrease our store rollout plans for fiscal we continue to believe that our retail expansion will be the key driver for our long term growth 
however  we intend to pursue a significantly scaled back store rollout program until such time as we experience a sustained improvement in economic conditions 
critical accounting policies and estimates preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
note to our consolidated financial statements describes the significant accounting policies used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
management believes the most complex and sensitive judgments  because of their significance to our consolidated financial statements  result primarily from the need to make estimates about effects of matters that are inherently uncertain 
the most significant areas involving management judgments are described below 
actual results in these areas could differ from management s estimates 

table of contents sales returns we recognize sales and the related cost of sales for our direct segment at the time the merchandise is expected to be delivered to our customer and for our retail segment at the point of sale with a customer in a store 
we reduce our sales and costs of sales and establish an accrual for expected sales returns based on historical experience and future expectations 
the ability to reasonably estimate sales returns is made more complex by the fact that we offer our customers a return policy whereby they may return merchandise for any reason and at any time without any restrictions as to condition or time of purchase to any of our locations 
the actual amount of sales returns we subsequently realize may fluctuate from estimates due to several factors  including size and fit  merchandise mix  actual or perceived quality  differences between the actual product and its presentation in the catalog or web site  timeliness of delivery and competitive offerings 
we continually track subsequent sales return experience  compile customer feedback to identify any pervasive issues  reassess the marketplace  compare our findings to previous estimates and adjust the sales return accrual and cost of sales accordingly 
provisions for sales returns were as follows in thousands balance at beginning of period additions charged to net income deductions for actual returns current year adjustments to prior year reserve balance at end of period fiscal year ended february  february  january  inventory valuation our inventories consist of merchandise purchased for resale and are recorded at the lower of cost or market 
the nature of our business requires that we make substantially all of our merchandising and marketing decisions and corresponding inventory purchase commitments with vendors several months in advance of the time in which a particular merchandise item is intended to be included in the merchandise offerings 
these decisions and commitments are based upon  among other possible considerations  historical sales with identical or similar merchandise  our understanding of then prevailing fashion trends and influences  and an assessment of likely economic conditions and various competitive factors 
we continually make assessments as to whether the carrying cost of inventory exceeds its market value  and  if so  by what dollar amount 
to determine whether inventory should be written down we consider current and anticipated demand and customer preferences in addition to the current and future estimated selling price 
the carrying value of the inventory is reduced to its net realizable value with a corresponding charge to cost of sales 
during fiscal and we have experienced declining gross margins due to an increase in the amount of inventory being sold with markdowns and promotional discounts 
during fiscal  we experienced significantly lower customer traffic than originally anticipated which resulted in an increase in slow moving and aged inventory 
fiscal included an approximate million write down of overstocked inventory that was liquidated through third parties 
though we currently believe our inventory write down is adequate based upon current forecasts which consider current and future selling prices  actual results may differ from our estimates if we are required to markdown or discount merchandise beyond our current expectations 

table of contents stock based compensation effective january   our accounting policy related to stock option accounting changed upon our adoption of sfas r 
sfas r requires us to expense the fair value of employee stock options and other forms of stock based compensation 
under the fair value recognition provisions of sfas r  share based compensation cost is estimated at the grant date based upon the value of the award and is recognized as expense ratably over the requisite service period of the award generally the vesting period of the equity award 
determining the appropriate fair value model and calculating the fair value of share based awards requires judgment  including estimating the expected life of the share based award  the expected stock price volatility over the expected life of the share based award and forfeitures 
to determine the fair value of stock options on the date of grant  we use the black scholes option pricing model 
inherent in this model are assumptions related to expected stock price volatility  option life  risk free interest rate and dividend yield 
the risk free interest rate is a less subjective assumption as it is based on factual data derived from public sources 
we use a dividend yield of zero as we have never paid cash dividends and have no intention to pay cash dividends in the immediate future 
the expected stock price volatility and option life assumptions require a greater level of judgment 
our expected stock price volatility assumption is based upon a combination of both the implied and historical volatilities of our stock which is obtained from public data sources 
the expected life represents the weighted average period of time that share based awards are expected to be outstanding  giving consideration to vesting schedules and historical exercise patterns 
we determine the expected life assumption based upon the exercise and post vesting behavior that has been exhibited historically  adjusted for specific factors that may influence future exercise patterns 
if expected volatility or expected life were to increase  that would result in an increase in the fair value of our stock options which would result in higher compensation charges  while a decrease in volatility or the expected life would result in a lower fair value of our stock option awards resulting in lower compensation charges 
we also grant restricted stock units and common stock which are less subjective in determining fair value as the fair value of these awards is based upon the fair market value of our common stock on the date of grant and not on an option pricing model 
we estimate forfeitures for all of our awards based upon historical experience of stock based pre vesting forfeitures 
we believe that our estimates are based upon outcomes that are reasonably likely to occur 
if actual forfeitures are higher than our estimates it would result in lower compensation expense and to the extent the actual forfeitures are lower than our estimate we would record higher compensation expense 
impairment of long lived assets long lived assets  more specifically leasehold improvements and furniture and fixtures at our retail stores and day spas  are subject to a review for impairment if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable 
if the future undiscounted cash flows generated by an asset or asset group is less than its carrying amount  it is considered to be impaired and would be written down to its fair value 
during the second quarter of fiscal  management determined that our day spa concept needed to be evaluated for impairment 
consequently  we concluded that certain day spa locations were impaired and we recorded a charge of million 
the deterioration of the financial  credit  and housing markets have had a severe impact on consumer confidence and discretionary spending 
these market conditions have had a negative effect on our business resulting in us evaluating certain retail stores for impairment 
based on this evaluation we concluded that these retail stores were not impaired 
though we believe that no impairment of our long lived assets exists as of january   if market conditions were to continue to deteriorate for 
table of contents an extended period of time  it is possible that we could record impairments of certain long lived assets in the future 
contingent liabilities contingent liabilities are accounted for in accordance with sfas  accounting for contingencies 
according to sfas  an estimated loss from a loss contingency is charged to income if a it is probable that an asset had been impaired or a liability had been incurred at the date of the financial statements and b the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated 
if a probable loss cannot be reasonably estimated no accrual is recorded but disclosure of the contingency in the notes to the financial statements is required 
gain contingencies are not recorded until realized 
we are involved in litigation and administrative proceedings arising in the normal course of our business 
actions filed against us from time to time include commercial  intellectual property infringement  customer and employment claims  including class action lawsuits alleging that we violated federal and state wage and hour and other laws 
if the recognition criteria of sfas have been met  liabilities have been recorded 
the assessment of the outcome of litigation can be very difficult to predict as it is subject to many factors  including those not within our control  and is highly dependent on individual facts and circumstances 
litigation is subject to highly complex legal processes and the final outcome of these matters could vary significantly from the amounts that have been recorded in the financial statements 
recently issued accounting standards see note to our consolidated financial statements 
off balance sheet liabilities and other contractual obligations we do not have any material off balance sheet arrangements as defined by item a of regulation s k 
the following tables summarize our minimum contractual commitments and commercial obligations as of january  in thousands payments due in fiscal year total thereafter contractual obligations operating leases a contractual commitments b capital leases c other financing obligations d other long term liabilities e f total a 
we lease retail store space as well as other property and equipment under operating leases 
retail store leases require the payment of additional rent based on sales above a specified minimum 
the operating lease obligations noted above do not include any contingent rental expense we may incur based on future sales above the specified minimums or payments made for maintenance  insurance and real estate taxes 
several lease agreements provide lease renewal options 
future operating lease obligations would change if these renewal options were exercised 
b 
contractual commitments include inventory purchase orders of million 
we expect to pay substantially all of these commitments in the next twelve months 
the actual timing of the payments is subject to change based upon actual receipt of the inventory and the terms of payment with the vendor 

table of contents c 
the weighted average interest rate on the capital leases is approximately percent 
payments represent the principal and accrued interest of million and interest expense to be incurred of approximately million 
d 
payments on other financing obligations represent interest expense to be incurred of approximately million and principal amounts due in the next twelve months of approximately million which has been recorded as a current liability 
e 
other long term liabilities primarily include amounts on our january  consolidated balance sheet representing obligations under our supplemental executive retirement plan of million  million related to our employee retention compensation program  and asset retirement obligations under certain of our lease arrangements of million 
we expect payments of approximately million during the next twelve months related to the supplemental executive retirement plan 
the payments above relating to the million retention program  of which million will be paid during the next twelve months  do not include million of additional compensation that is to be recognized over the employees remaining service periods 
f 
we have excluded million and million of deferred rents and deferred revenue  respectively  from the other long term liabilities in the above table 
these amounts have been excluded as deferred rents relate to operating leases which are already reflected in the operating lease category above and the deferred revenue does not represent a contractual obligation that will be settled in cash 
our only individually significant operating lease is for our distribution center and customer contact center located in mineral wells  west virginia 
during the third quarter of fiscal  construction was completed on the  square foot expansion to this distribution center  increasing the distribution center size from  square feet to  square feet 
as a result  the distribution center operating lease was amended to include the expansion and extend the lease term from approximately years to years 
our remaining lease commitment as of january  is approximately million and has been reflected in the schedule above 
all other operating leases primarily pertain to retail and outlet stores  day spas and to various equipment and technology 
subsequent to january   we entered into additional retail leases with minimum lease payment requirements  and as a result  as of march  our operating lease commitments increased by million 
as of january  we had million in letters of credit issued  of which million was issued under our prior credit facility with wells fargo bank  na related to inventory purchase commitments and million under a separate letter of credit related to our distribution facility 
subsequent to january  the outstanding letters of credit under our prior credit facility were transferred to our new credit facility with wells fargo retail finance  llc 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we have not been materially impacted by fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates as substantially all of our business is transacted in  and is expected to continue to be transacted in  us dollars or us dollar based currencies 
we have been immaterially impacted by fluctuations in interest rates as a result of our relatively modest bank borrowings in recent fiscal years 
during the twelve month period ended january   we did not have borrowings under our credit facility and  consequently  did not have any material exposure to interest rate market risks during or at the end of this period 
however  as any future borrowings under our amended and restated bank credit facility will be at a variable rate of interest  we could potentially be materially adversely impacted should we require significant borrowings in the future  particularly during a period of rising interest rates 
we have not used  and currently do not anticipate using  any derivative financial instruments
