item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto located elsewhere in this report 
overview we develop  manufacture and market the essure permanent birth control system  an innovative and proprietary medical device for women that was approved for marketing in the united states in november by the us food and drug administration  or fda 
the essure system uses a soft and flexible micro insert that is delivered into a woman s fallopian tubes to provide permanent birth control by causing a benign tissue in growth that blocks the fallopian tubes 
a successfully placed essure micro insert and the subsequent tissue growth prohibits the egg from traveling through the fallopian tubes and therefore prevents fertilization 
the effectiveness rate of the essure system is after four years of follow up 
on january   we acquired all of the outstanding shares of conceptus sas 
as a result of this transaction  conceptus sas became our wholly owned subsidiary  which sells essure directly in france and utilizes distributors to sell essure throughout the rest of europe 
we believe the acquisition of conceptus sas expands our presence in international markets and will increase our revenues as we will recognize sales at end user pricing as compared to the price at which we previously sold the essure product directly to conceptus sas 
our consolidated financial statements for the year ended december  include the financial results of conceptus sas beginning from the acquisition date of january  consolidated net sales for the year ended december  were million of which were generated in the united states 
for financial information about geographic areas and for segment information with respect to net sales  refer to the information set forth in note of our consolidated financial statements 
the essure procedure the essure procedure is typically performed in the office setting and is intended to be a less invasive and a less costly solution to tubal ligation  the leading form of permanent birth control in the united states and worldwide 
laparoscopic tubal ligation and tubal ligation by laparotomy typically involve abdominal incisions and or punctures  general or regional anesthesia  four to ten days of normal recovery time and the risks associated with an incisional procedure 
the essure procedure does not require cutting or penetrating the abdomen  which lowers the likelihood of post operative pain due to the incisions punctures  and it can be performed in an outpatient setting 
currently  the majority of the essure procedures are performed using conscious sedation  such as iv sedation with a local anesthesia 
general anesthesia is not typically used unless required by hospital protocol  if requested by the patient  or based on the experience and comfort level of the physician 
in the pivotal trial of the essure system  the average hysteroscopic procedure time was minutes 
a patient is typically discharged approximately minutes after the essure procedure 
no overnight hospital stay is required 
furthermore  the essure system is effective without drugs or hormones 
there is a three month waiting period after the procedure during which the woman must use another form of birth control while tissue in growth occurs 
at days following the procedure  us patients complete a confirmation test called a hysterosalpingogram  or hsg  which can determine whether the device was placed successfully and whether the fallopian tubes are occluded 
outside of the united states  patients are required to return for a pelvic x ray at three months post procedure with a subsequent hsg if device location on the initial radiographic image appears suspicious 
we believe that the essure system is a better alternative to tubal ligation for physicians  hospitals and payers 
the essure system is a less invasive permanent birth control option for physicians to offer to their patients  hospitals are able to utilize their facilities more cost effectively with the essure procedure compared with tubal ligation  and payers are able to experience cost reductions resulting from the elimination of overhead and procedural costs related to anesthesia and post operative hospital 
table of contents stays associated with tubal ligations 
in addition  we believe the essure procedure is superior to other non tubal ligation permanent contraception alternatives because  unlike other device designs  the essure procedure does not involve the use of radio frequency rf energy  which subjects the patient to risks of thermal injury  bowel injury and dilutional hyponatremia 
published reports estimate that approximately  tubal ligation procedures are performed each year in the united states 
we intend to capture the majority share of this market and establish the essure procedure as the gold standard for permanent birth control 
we also believe the essure system is a solution for women whose family is complete but are using temporary methods of birth control 
in addition  payers may also benefit from the reduction of unplanned pregnancies associated with non permanent birth control methods used by patients who have chosen to avoid the drawbacks of traditional permanent birth control methods but who may otherwise elect to use the essure system 
critical accounting estimates and policies we follow accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  or gaap  in preparing our financial statements 
as part of this work  we must make many estimates and judgments about future events 
these affect the value of the assets and liabilities  contingent assets and liabilities and revenues and expenses reported in our financial statements 
we believe these estimates and judgments are reasonable and we make them in accordance with policies based on information available at the time 
however  actual results could differ from our estimates and could require us to record adjustments to expenses or revenues material to our financial position and results of operations in future periods 
we believe our most critical accounting policies  estimates and judgments include the following revenue recognition  stock based compensation expense  excess and obsolete inventory  allowance for doubtful accounts  cash equivalents and marketable securities  warranty obligation  impairment of long lived assets  debt  contingent liabilities  and income taxes 
revenue recognition our revenue is primarily comprised of the sale of our essure system 
we recognize revenue in accordance with the securities and exchange commission  or sec  staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements or sab under this standard  the following four criteria must be met in order to recognize revenue persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  our selling price is fixed or determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
the four revenue recognition criteria and other revenue related pronouncements are applied to our sales as described in the following paragraphs 
we recognize revenues from our essure system when we ship the device 
we recognize revenue upon shipment of the system as we have no continuing obligations subsequent to shipment 
we do not accept returns of the essure system 
we obtain written authorizations from our customers for a specified amount of product at a specified price and the price is not dependent on actual essure procedures performed 

table of contents for sales through distributors we recognize revenues upon shipment as we have no continuing obligations subsequent to shipment 
our distributors are responsible for all marketing  sales  training and warranty of the essure device in their respective territories 
our standard terms and conditions do not provide price protection or stock rotation rights to any of our distributors 
in addition  our distributor agreements do not allow the distributor to return or exchange the essure system and the distributor is obligated to pay us for the sale regardless of their ability to resell the product 
additionally  we require physicians to be preceptored between and cases by a certified trainer before being able to perform the procedure independently 
there are no revenues associated with the training activities 
we do not charge a fee for the activity and no commitment arises for the physician from the preceptorship 
physician training is provided upfront and we have no obligation subsequent to the initial training 
training costs have not been significant from inception to date 
we assess the credit worthiness of all customers in connection with their purchases 
we only recognize revenue when collectability is reasonably assured 
certain sales of our essure system require delivery of additional items 
these obligations are fulfilled after shipment of the essure system  and in these cases  we recognize revenue in accordance with the multiple element accounting guidance set forth in emerging issues task force no 
 revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables or eitf when we have objective and reliable evidence of fair value of the undelivered elements we defer revenue attributable to the post shipment obligations and recognize such revenue when the obligation is fulfilled 
otherwise we defer all revenue until all elements are delivered 
stock based compensation expense effective january   we adopted the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards  or sfas  no 
r  share based payment  or sfas r  which establishes accounting for stock based awards exchanged for employee services 
accordingly  stock based compensation cost is measured at grant date  based on the fair value of the award which is computed using the black scholes option valuation model  and is recognized as expense over the employee requisite service period 
we previously applied accounting principles board  or apb  opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and related interpretations and provided the required pro forma disclosures of sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation 
the fair value of each option award is estimated on the date of grant using the black scholes option valuation model with the weighted average assumptions shown in note summary of significant accounting policies of our notes to consolidated financial statements 
the black scholes option valuation model requires the input of highly subjective assumptions  including the expected life of the stock based award and the stock price volatility 
the assumptions used in calculating the fair value of share based compensation represent management s best estimates  but these estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of management s judgment 
as a result  if other assumptions had been used  our stock based compensation expense could have been materially different 
in addition  we are required to estimate the expected forfeiture rate and only recognize expense for those shares expected to vest 
if our actual forfeiture rate is materially different from our estimate  the share based compensation expense could be materially different 
the expected term of the options granted is derived from historical data on employee exercise and post vesting employment termination behavior 
the risk free interest rate for periods equal to the estimated life of the option is based on the us treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant 
expected volatility is based on historical volatility of our stock 
as stock based compensation expense recognized in the consolidated statement of operations is based on awards ultimately expected to vest  it is reduced for estimated forfeitures 
sfas r requires forfeitures to be estimated at the time of grant and revised  if necessary  in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates 
forfeitures are estimated based on historical experience 

table of contents excess and obsolete inventory inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market  cost being determined on the first in  first out method 
inventory reserves are recorded when conditions indicate that the selling price may be less than the cost 
reserves for potentially excess and obsolete inventories are provided based on historical experience and current product demand 
once established  the original cost of the inventory less the related inventory reserve represents the new cost basis 
reversal of these reserves is recognized only when the related inventory has been scrapped or sold 
as of december  and  our reserves were approximately million and million  respectively 
allowance for doubtful accounts we assess the credit worthiness of our customers on an ongoing basis in order to mitigate the risk of loss from customers not paying us 
however  we account for the possibility that certain customers may not pay us by maintaining an allowance for doubtful accounts 
we perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers and adjust credit limits based upon payment history and the customer s current credit worthiness  as determined by our review of their current credit information 
we monitor collections and payments from our customers and maintain our allowance for doubtful accounts based upon our historical experience and any specific customer collection issues that we have identified 
our exposure to credit losses may change as we increase our receivables 
changes in customer type and mix  as well as domestic and international economic climate  will also impact potential credit losses 
despite the significant amount of analysis used to compute the required allowance  if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of our ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
in addition  our increase in sales may result in a higher accounts receivable balance  which may require a higher balance in the allowance 
as of december  and  our allowance for doubtful accounts totaled approximately million and million  respectively 
cash equivalents and marketable securities we consider all highly liquid investments with maturity from date of purchase of three months or less to be cash equivalents 
we maintain deposits with three financial institutions and invest our excess cash primarily in money market funds  commercial paper  corporate notes  municipal bonds and government securities  which bear minimal risk 
our cash and cash equivalents in our operating accounts are with third party financial institutions 
at times  these balances exceed the federal deposit insurance corporation insurance limits 
while we monitor the cash balances in our operating accounts and adjust the cash balances as appropriate  these cash balances could be impacted if the underlying financial institutions fail or are subject to other adverse conditions in the financial markets 
to date we have experienced no loss or lack of access to cash in our operating accounts 
at december  long term investments consist of auction rate securities ars 
as of december   we held million par value in ars backed by federal and state student loans which are variable rate debt instruments and bear interest rates that reset approximately every days 
these ars have a contractual maturity ranging from through our ars are long term debt instruments backed by student loans  a substantial portion of which are guaranteed by the united states government 
prior to  our ars were highly liquid  using a dutch auction process that resets the applicable interest rate at predetermined intervals  typically every days  to provide liquidity at par 
we have experienced failed auction in on all of our ars 
the failures of these auctions do not affect the value of the collateral underlying the ars  and we continue to earn and receive interest on our ars at a pre determined formula with spreads tied to particular interest rate indexes 
in november  we accepted an offer from ubs ag ubs  providing us with rights related to our auction rate security rights the rights 
the rights permit us to require ubs to purchase our ars at par value  which is defined as the price equal to the liquidation preference of the ars plus 
table of contents accrued but unpaid dividends or interest  at any time during the period of june  through july  conversely  ubs has the right  at its discretion  to purchase or sell our ars at any time until july   so long as we receive payment at par value upon any sale or disposition 
we expect to sell our ars under the rights at par value 
however  if the rights are not exercised before july  they will expire and ubs will have no further rights or obligation to buy our ars 
so long as we hold our ars  they will continue to accrue interest as determined by the auction process or the terms of the ars if the auction process fails 
ubs s obligations under the rights are not secured by its assets and do not require ubs to obtain any financing to support its performance obligations under the rights 
ubs has disclaimed any assurance that it will have sufficient financial resources to satisfy its obligations under the rights 
we have accounted for the rights as a freestanding financial instrument and elected to record the value of the rights under the fair value option of sfas no 
 establishing the fair value option for financial assets and liabilities 
as a result  upon acceptance of the offer from ubs  we recorded approximately million as the fair value of the rights with a corresponding credit to other income 
as a result of our elections to record the rights at fair value  unrealized gains and losses will be included in earnings in future periods 
we estimated the fair value of the rights using the expected value that we will receive from ubs which was calculated as the difference between the anticipated recognized loss and par value of the ars as of the option exercise date 
this value was discounted by using a ubs credit default rate to account for the consideration of ubs credit risk 
although the rights represent the right to sell the securities back to ubs at par  we will be required to periodically assess the economic ability of ubs to meet that obligation in assessing the fair value of the rights 
we will continue to classify the ars as long term investments until june   one year prior to the expected settlement 
prior to accepting the ubs offer  we recorded our ars as available for sale investments 
we recorded unrealized gains and losses on our available for sale securities  in accumulated other comprehensive income loss in the stockholders equity section of our balance sheets 
such an unrealized loss did not change net income loss for the applicable accounting period 
in connection with our acceptance of the ubs offer in november  resulting in our right to require ubs to purchase our ars at par value beginning on june   we transferred our ars from available for sale to trading securities in accordance with sfas the transfer to trading securities reflects our intent to exercise our put option during the period june  to july  prior to our agreement with ubs  our intent was to hold our ars until we realized the par value 
we recorded a temporary reduction in carrying value of million for the nine months ended september   which was recorded as an unrealized loss in accumulated other comprehensive loss 
upon transfer to trading securities  we transferred the million recorded as unrealized loss in accumulated other comprehensive loss and recorded an unrealized loss of million in other expense  net in the fourth quarter of  representing the difference between the par and fair value of the ars at the date of transfer 
we determined that use of a valuation model was the best available technique for measuring the fair value of our ars 
we used a trinomial discount model weighting estimated future cash flows  quality of collateral and the probability of future successful auctions occurring 
in determining a discount factor for each ars  the model weights various factors  including assessments of credit quality  duration  insurance wraps  portfolio composition  discount rates  overall capital market liquidity and comparable securities  if any 
in the future we expect any changes in the fair value of our ars to be materially offset in part by changes in the fair value of our put option with ubs 
we continue to monitor the market for ars and consider its impact if any on the fair market value of our investments 
if the market conditions deteriorate further  we may be required to record additional unrealized losses in earnings  offset partially by corresponding increases in the put option 
we believe that  based on our current cash and cash equivalents balance  the current lack of liquidity in the credit and capital markets will not have a material impact on our liquidity  cash flows or ability to fund our operations 

table of contents in november we entered into a demand revolving credit line agreement with ubs  payable on demand  in an amount equal to a specified percentage of fair value of our auction rate securities at a net no cost  meaning that the interest we pay on the credit line will not exceed the interest that we receive on the auction rate securities that we have pledged as security for the credit line 
additionally  under the terms of the settlement agreement  if ubs is able to sell our auction rate securities at par  proceeds would be utilized to first repay any outstanding balance under the demand revolving credit line 
we are still able to sell the auction rate securities  but in such a circumstance  if we sold at less than par  we would not be entitled to recover the par value support from ubs 
see note credit line  for more information about this line of credit  note long term investment and note fair value measurements of our notes to consolidated financial statements for information about the accounting treatment of our ars 
warranty obligation we provide for the estimated cost of our product warranties at the time revenue is recognized 
we record a liability for the estimated future costs associated with warranty claims  which is based upon historical experiences and our estimate of the level of future costs 
warranty costs are reflected in the statement of operations as a cost of goods sold 
we expect that warranty expense will increase as and if we increase our net sales 
warranty reserve rates may change if we change manufacturing process or change our third party manufacturing contractor 
should actual costs differ from historical experience  increases in warranty expense may be required 
warranty reserves as of december  and were approximately million and million  respectively 
impairment of long lived assets we account for the impairment of long lived assets in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
we evaluate the carrying value of our long lived assets  consisting primarily of our property and equipment  the essure license acquired from a patent litigation settlement in and intangible assets acquired in connection with our acquisition of conceptus sas in  whenever certain events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable 
such events or circumstances include a prolonged industry downturn  a significant decline in our market value or significant reductions in projected future cash flows 
significant judgments and assumptions are required in the forecast of future operating results used in the preparation of the estimated future cash flows  including profit margins  long term forecasts of the amounts and timing of overall market growth and our percentage of that market  groupings of assets  discount rates and terminal growth rates 
in addition  significant estimates and assumptions are required in the determination of the fair value of our tangible long lived assets  including replacement cost  economic obsolescence  and the value that could be realized in orderly liquidation 
changes in these estimates could have a material adverse effect on the assessment of our long lived assets  thereby requiring us to write down the assets 
our net long lived assets as of december  and included property and equipment of million and million  respectively  and other identifiable intangible assets of million and million  respectively 
goodwill goodwill is the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the other net assets  including customer relationship and covenant not to compete  of acquired businesses in connection with our acquisition of conceptus sas in under sfas  goodwill and other intangible assets  goodwill is not amortized  but is assigned to reporting units and tested for impairment annually during the fourth quarter  or whenever there is an impairment indicator 
we assess goodwill impairment indicators 
table of contents quarterly  or more frequently  if a change in circumstances or the occurrence of events suggests the remaining value may not be recoverable 
the first step of the impairment test for goodwill compares the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount  including goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets 
if the fair value is less than the carrying amount  the second step determines the amount of the impairment by comparing the implied fair value of the goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill 
an impairment charge is recognized only when the calculated fair value of a reporting unit  including goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets  is less than its carrying amount 
we performed an annual assessment during the fourth quarter of of our goodwill at the reporting unit level 
no impairment charges have been recorded through december  debt we account for our convertible senior notes in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
in this regard  our convertible debt and net share settlement feature does not fall under the category of a derivative  and consequently  we classify our long term debt as a liability in our consolidated balance sheet 
our convertible hedge and our outstanding warrants are accounted as set forth by emerging issues task force  accounting for derivative financial instruments indexed to  and potentially settled in  a company s own stock  through which we record the convertible hedge transaction and the warrants in additional paid in capital 
subsequent changes in fair value of the agreement are not recognized 
in addition  we account for the cost issuance of debt in accordance with accounting principles board  interest on receivables and payables  or apb consequently  these costs were recognized as an asset and are amortized by periodic charges to income 
we apply the straight line method  which is not materially different to the effective interest method set forth by apb contingent liabilities we account for contingencies in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies  which requires that an estimated loss from a loss contingency shall be accrued when information available prior to issuance of the financial statements indicates that it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred at the date of the financial statements and when the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated 
accounting for contingencies such as legal and income tax matters requires us to use our judgment 
we believe that our accruals for these matters are adequate 
nevertheless  the actual loss from a loss contingency might differ from our estimates 
income taxes we account for income taxes in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
under this method  deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the difference between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities using the enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to affect taxable income 
on january   we adopted the provisions of financial interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes fin which is an interpretation of sfas no 
fin prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
the adoption of the provisions of fin did not have a material effect on our financial position and results of operations 
as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements  we are required to estimate our income taxes 
this process involves estimating our actual current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences that may result in deferred tax assets 
valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amounts expected to be realized 
we must assess whether it is more likely than not that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and to the extent 
table of contents we believe that recovery is not likely  we must establish a valuation allowance 
we evaluate the need for a valuation allowance for our deferred tax assets 
due to our cumulative pre tax us losses and the current uncertainty of our ability to realize our us deferred tax assets  a valuation allowance in an amount equal to our us deferred tax assets has been recorded

net sales the following table summarizes net sales by geographic region years ended december  net sales in thousands united states of america france europe other than france other net sales are attributed to region based on the shipping location of our customers 
the increase in net sales of million or is the result of continued commercialization and marketing of the essure system worldwide  and reflects the increasing numbers of physicians entering and completing training in the use of the procedure 
international sales comprised of our total sales in  which is an increase of compared to  reflecting revenues realized from our acquisition of conceptus sas and the recognition of sales at higher end user pricing 
the net sales increase also reflects a domestic revenue increase of in as compared to we expect our net sales for to be in the range of approximately million to million  which would represent to growth from net sales in as we continue to increase the number of physicians performing the essure procedure 
we will also continue our programs aimed at raising patient awareness of the essure procedure  such as radio  print and television advertising 
we believe our revenue growth in and beyond will be significantly influenced by how successful we are in achieving our objectives 
however  as we have noted elsewhere and in the risk factors in this report  our expected revenue growth involves many risks  many of which are not entirely within our control 

table of contents gross profit cost of goods sold increased by million to million in as compared to million in this increase was caused by higher volumes of sales 
gross profit margin was for and for the year over year increase in gross margin is related to higher average selling prices into the european market that were achieved through the acquisition of conceptus sas  lower manufacturing costs associated with higher unit volume  the introduction of our third generation device and a domestic price increase implemented during the first quarter of our gross profit margin will vary as our sales mix changes 
increases in sales of our devices through distributors in international markets will tend to decrease our overall gross profit margin 
research and development research and development expenses increased by million to million in as compared to million in as a percentage of revenues  research and development expenses for and represented and  respectively 
research and development expenses reflect clinical expenditures and product development  which are substantially related to the ongoing development and associated regulatory approvals of our technology 
our goal is to continue our product developments over the coming years  which is intended to result in improved ease of use and clinical performance 
we expect to identify and hire additional product development and regulatory personnel in the future to staff our planned product development and clinical activities  and we expect that these costs will increase as we seek to maintain our leading position in the market for permanent female birth control 
to support these initiatives during we increased payroll and payroll related expenditures by million  consulting and outside service expenses by million  project material prototypes by million  offset by a reduction in stock compensation of million and supplier charges of million 
selling  general and administrative selling  general and administrative expenses increased by million to million in as compared to million in as a percentage of revenues  selling  general and administrative expenses for and represented and  respectively 
the increases were primarily the result of the operating expenses of conceptus sas of million  an increase of million due to expansion of our us field sales force  and increased domestic advertising expenditures of million  primarily for our direct to consumer advertising campaign 
this campaign involves television  radio and print media and is intended to drive patient awareness of the essure procedure 
in addition  fees related to audit and tax  depreciation  bank related fees  and general building maintenance increased by million  offset by decrease in fees related to legal fees  stock compensation  professional education and bad debt by million 
we expect selling  general and administrative expenses to increase in the future as we expect to hire additional sales professionals and to increase patient awareness through our direct to consumer campaign in targeted markets 
interest income and expense and other expenses  net total interest income and expense and other expenses  net for was a net expense of million as compared to net income of million for interest income decreased by million primarily due to lower interest rates on the company s investment portfolio  which consists of auction rate securities and money market accounts that are currently earning lower interest rates compared to in addition  other expenses decreased by million primarily due to foreign exchange losses 
additionally  in we recorded approximately million as the fair value of the auction rate security rights associated with a corresponding credit to other expenses  net in connection with the

income taxes we have recorded a net tax benefit of  primarily related to our foreign operations in we did not record any income tax expense in we adopted the provisions of fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes  or fin  on january  we have not been audited by the internal revenue service or any state income or franchise tax agency 
as of december   our federal returns for the years ended through the current period and most state returns for the years ended through the current period are still open to examination 
in addition  all of the net operating losses and research and development credit carry forwards that may be used in future years are still subject to inquiry given that the statute of limitation for these items would be from the year of the utilization 
the tax returns for conceptus sas for the years ended to were examined and closed by the french tax authorities 
as of december   we also recorded approximately million of income tax expense attributable to conceptus sas 
the amount of unrecognized tax benefits at december   was million  which  if ultimately recognized  will reduce our annual effective tax rate 
we do not expect our unrecognized tax benefits to change significantly over the next months

table of contents liquidity and capital resources we have experienced significant operating losses since inception  however  we experienced our first two profitable quarters in fiscal as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of million 
we have financed our operations since inception primarily through equity and debt financings 
in december  we filed a shelf registration statement on form s  through which we may sell from time to time any combination of debt securities  common stock  preferred stock and warrants  in one or more offerings 
after the sale of our senior convertible notes described below  we had  remaining available for sale under this shelf registration statement 
in february  we issued and sold under the shelf registration statement an aggregate principal amount of  of our convertible senior notes due these notes bear a interest per annum on the principal amount  payable semiannually in arrears on february and august of each year  beginning on august  interest accrual on the notes commenced on february  the notes will mature on february   unless earlier redeemed  repurchased or purchased by us or converted 
the notes will be convertible into cash and  if applicable  shares of our common stock based on an initial conversion rate  subject to adjustment  of shares per  principal amount of notes which represents an initial conversion price of approximately per share  in certain circumstances 
upon conversion  a holder would receive cash up to the principal amount of the note and our common stock in respect of such note s conversion value in excess of such principal amount 
we may repurchase such securities from time to time 
the notes are convertible only in the following circumstances during any calendar quarter after the quarter ended march  if the closing sale price of our common stock for each of or more trading days in a period of consecutive trading days ending on the last trading day of the immediately preceding calendar quarter exceeds of the conversion price  during the five consecutive business days immediately after any five consecutive trading day period if the average trading price per  principal amount of the notes is less than or equal to of the average conversion value of the notes during such five day period  upon the occurrence of specified corporate transactions  if we call the notes for redemption and at anytime on or after december  up to and including february  and anytime on or after february  upon a change in control or termination of trading  holders of the notes may require us to repurchase all or a portion of their notes for cash at a repurchase price equal to of the principal amount  plus any accrued and unpaid interest 
in addition  in connection with the issuance of the notes  we entered into separate convertible note hedge transactions and separate warrant transactions to reduce the potential dilution upon conversion of the notes call spread transactions 
as a result of the call spread transactions  we do not anticipate experiencing an increase in the total shares outstanding from the conversion of the notes unless the price of our common stock appreciates above per share  effectively increasing the conversion premium to us to 
we purchased call options to cover approximately million shares of our common stock  which is the number of shares underlying the notes 
in addition  we sold warrants permitting the purchasers to acquire up to approximately million shares of our common stock 
as of december   we held million par value in auction rate securities ars backed by federal and state student loans which are variable rate debt instruments and bear interest rates that reset approximately every days 
these ars have a contractual maturity ranging from through 
table of contents our ars are long term debt instruments backed by student loans  a substantial portion of which are guaranteed by the united states government 
prior to  our ars were highly liquid  using a dutch auction process that resets the applicable interest rate at predetermined intervals  typically every days  to provide liquidity at par 
we have experienced failed auction in on all of our ars 
the failures of these auctions do not affect the value of the collateral underlying the ars  and we continue to earn and receive interest on our ars at a pre determined formula with spreads tied to particular interest rate indexes 
in november  we accepted an offer from ubs ag ubs  providing us with rights related to our auction rate security rights the rights 
the rights permit us to require ubs to purchase our ars at par value  which is defined as the price equal to the liquidation preference of the ars plus accrued but unpaid dividends or interest  at any time during the period of june  through july  conversely  ubs has the right  in its discretion  to purchase or sell our ars at any time until july   so long as we receive payment at par value upon any sale or disposition 
we expect to sell our ars under the rights at par value 
however  if the rights are not exercised before july  they will expire and ubs will have no further rights or obligation to buy our ars 
so long as we hold our ars  they will continue to accrue interest as determined by the auction process or the terms of the ars if the auction process fails 
ubs s obligations under the rights are not secured by its assets and do not require ubs to obtain any financing to support its performance obligations under the rights 
ubs has disclaimed any assurance that it will have sufficient financial resources to satisfy its obligations under the rights 
in november we entered into a demand revolving credit line agreement with ubs  payable on demand  in an amount equal to a specified percentage of fair value of our auction rate securities at a net no cost  meaning that the interest we pay on the credit line will not exceed the interest that we receive on the auction rate securities that we have pledged as security for the credit line 
additionally  under the terms of the settlement agreement  if ubs is able to sell our auction rate securities at par  proceeds would be utilized to first repay any outstanding balance under the demand revolving credit line 
we are still able to sell the auction rate securities  but in such a circumstance  if we sold at less than par  we would not be entitled to recover the par value support from ubs 
see note credit line  for more information about this line of credit  note long term investment and note fair value measurements of our notes to consolidated financial statements for information about the accounting treatment of our ars 
in the future  depending on a variety of factors  we may need to raise additional funds through bank facilities  debt or equity offerings or other sources of capital 
additional financing may not be available when needed or on terms acceptable to us 
as of december   we had cash  cash equivalents and short term investments of million  compared to million at december  the increase of million is primarily due to cash from operating activities and proceeds from the line of credit offset by our acquisition of conceptus sas in january we believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents will be sufficient to meet our cash requirements for the next twelve months 
operating activities net cash provided by operating activities was million in and cash used in operating activities was million in and million in net cash provided by operating activities in was primarily related to non cash related items of million corresponding primarily to stock based compensation and depreciation and amortization of fixed assets  debt issuance cost and intangible amortization  
table of contents increase in accounts receivable of million as a result of our increase in sales 
we monitor our accounts receivable turnover closely to ensure that receivables are collected timely and have established a credit and collection policy to facilitate our collection process and reduce our credit loss exposure 
we expect to grow our business and increase our revenues and to continue to use cash received from collection of outstanding receivables to fund our operations  net increase of other assets and other current assets of million primarily due to prepayments for our advertising campaigns  an decrease in inventories of million  a decrease in accounts payable in million  an increase in accrued compensation of million  and an increase in other accrued and long term liabilities of million 
we expect cash provided by operating activities in the future to increase as our revenues grow 
investing activities net cash used in investing activities for the twelve months ended december  was million  due to the sales and maturity of short term investments of million  offset by the purchase of conceptus sas  net of cash acquired of million  purchases of investments of million  million for restricted cash related to our lease and capital expenditures of million 
in connection with our renewed lease agreement for our mountain view headquarters we were required to open a long term restricted cd account in the amount of million

the successful achievement of our business objectives may require additional financing and therefore  we may in the future seek to raise additional funds through bank facilities  debt or equity offerings or other sources of capital 
any additional equity financing may be dilutive to stockholders  and debt financing  if available  may involve restrictive covenants 
additional funding may not be available when needed or on terms acceptable to us 
if we are unable to obtain additional capital  we may be required to delay  reduce the scope of or eliminate our sales and marketing activities 
our future liquidity and capital requirements will depend upon many factors  including  among others resources devoted to establish sales  marketing and distribution capabilities  the liquidity of auction rate securities held in our investment portfolio  the rate of product adoption by doctors and patients  our determination to acquire or invest in other products  technologies and businesses  the market price of our common stock as it affects the exercise of stock options and the conversion terms of our convertible debt  and the insurance payer community s acceptance of and reimbursement for the essure procedure

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the following discusses our exposure to market risk related to changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 
these exposures may change over time as business practices evolve and could have a material adverse impact on our financial results 
interest rate risk we have been exposed to interest rate risk through interest earned on holdings of available for sale and trading marketable securities 
we have experienced failed auctions in of all our auction rate securities and there is no assurance that auctions on these auction rate securities in our investment portfolio will succeed in the future 
as a result  our ability to liquidate our investments in the near term may be limited  and our ability to fully recover the carrying value of our investments may be limited or non existent 
an auction failure means that the parties wishing to sell securities could not carry out the transaction 
if the issuers of these securities are unable to successfully close future auctions or their credit ratings deteriorate  we may be required to record further impairment charges on these investments 
it could take until the final maturity of the underlying notes up to years to realize our investments recorded value 
as of december  we held million par value in auction rate securities which are variable rate debt instruments and bear interest rates that are due to reset approximately every days 
all of these auction rate securities were classified as long term investments in our consolidated balance sheet at december  with an expected maturity of greater than one year 
due in part to these factors  our future investment income may fall short of expectations due to changes in interest rates or we may suffer losses in principal if forced to sell securities that have declined in market value due to changes in interest rates 
interest rates that may affect these items in the future will depend on market conditions and may differ from the rates we have experienced in the past 

table of contents foreign currency exchange risk historically  all of our expenses and our revenues were typically denominated in u 
s 
dollars 
on january   we acquired all the outstanding shares of conceptus sas 
as a result of this transaction  conceptus sas became a wholly owned subsidiary and its results of operations have been consolidated with our results of operations for financial reporting purposes as of the acquisition date 
the functional currency of conceptus sas is the euro  therefore  we are now exposed to changes in foreign exchange rates 
we are exposed to foreign exchange rate fluctuations as we translate the financial statements of our foreign subsidiaries into us dollars in consolidation 
if there is a change in foreign currency exchange rates  the translation of the foreign subsidiaries financial statements into us dollars will lead to translation gains or losses which are recorded net as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss 
we will seek to manage our foreign exchange risk through operational means  including managing same currency revenues in relation to same currency expenses  and same currency assets in relation to same currency liabilities 
in connection with the acquisition of conceptus sas  we had assumed a forward exchange contract to hedge us dollar denominated estimated accounts payable in we have recorded the changes of the fair value of the hedge contract in our results of operations for the twelve months ended december  the hedge contract was fully utilized by december  in  we did not enter into forward exchange contracts to hedge exposure denominated in foreign currencies or any other derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
at december   our intercompany receivable balance with foreign subsidiaries is million and the potential loss in fair value resulting from a hypothetical percent strengthening in the value of the us dollar euro currency exchange rate would be approximately million
