item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general the following analysis of the results of operations and financial condition of the company should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
critical accounting policies the discussion and analysis of the company s consolidated financial statements and results of operations are based on consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires the use of estimates and judgments that affect the reported results 
the company uses estimates based on the best information available in recording transactions and balances resulting from business operations 
estimates are used for such items as collectibility of trade accounts receivable  inventory valuation  depreciable lives  self insurance programs  warranty costs and income taxes 
ultimate results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
allowance for doubtful accounts the company establishes an allowance for doubtful accounts through review of open accounts  and historical collection and allowances amounts 
the allowance for doubtful accounts is intended to reduce trade accounts receivable to the amount that reasonably approximates their net realizable fair value due to their short term nature 
the amount ultimately realized from trade accounts receivable may differ from the amount estimated in the consolidated financial statements based on collection experience and actual returns and allowances 
inventories the company values inventory at the lower of cost or market 
a large portion of our finished goods inventory is made to order and many of our raw material parts are interchangeable between products 
management assesses the inventory on hand and if necessary writes down the obsolete or excess inventory to market 
revenue recognition is upon delivery of product to our customer and when collectibility is reasonably assured 
delivery of product to our customer is evidenced through the shipping terms indicating when title and risk of loss is transferred 
our ordering process creates persuasive evidence of the sale arrangement and the sales amount is determined 
the delivery of the goods to our customer completes the earnings process 
net sales consist of product sales and related delivery charge revenue  net of adjustments for returns and allowances 
shipping and handling costs are included in cost of goods sold 
recently issued accounting pronouncements see item note to the company s consolidated financial statements 
results of operations the following table has been prepared as an aid in understanding the company s results of operations on a comparative basis for the fiscal years ended june   and amounts presented are percentages of the company s net sales 
for the years ended june  net sales cost of goods sold gross margin selling  general and administrative facility consolidation and other charges gain on sale of land and building operating loss income other expense  net loss income before income taxes income tax benefit provision net loss income fiscal compared to fiscal net sales for the fiscal year ended june  were million compared to million in the prior fiscal year  a decrease of 
residential net sales were million compared to million in the fiscal year ended june   a decrease of 
commercial net sales were million for the fiscal year ended june   a decrease of from net sales of million for the fiscal year ended june  recreational vehicle net sales were million for the fiscal year ended june   a decrease of from million for the fiscal year ended june  the recreational vehicle industry continues to be the hardest hit product category with the initial impact of high fuel costs compounded by credit tightening and lack of consumer confidence in the economy as a whole 
recreational vehicle industry published data indicates that motor home unit sales  the sector that encompasses the majority of our sales  are down nearly 
the commercial seating product category held up well early in our fiscal year  but fell considerably as the u 
s 
economy contracted and credit tightened 
we believe that our residential product category has performed reasonably well in relation to our competition 
however  residential furniture remains a deferrable purchase item and is adversely impacted by tighter consumer credit  higher unemployment and low levels of consumer confidence 
gross margin for the fiscal years ended june  and was and  respectively 
the decrease in gross margin percentage for the year is primarily due to an approximate million adjustment to realizable value on inventory and to a lesser extent to under utilization of capacity on significantly lower sales volume 
these factors were partially offset by a lifo benefit increase of approximately million 
selling  general and administrative expenses were and of net sales for the fiscal years ended june  and  respectively 
the percentage increase in selling  general and administrative costs is primarily due to under absorption of fixed costs on the lower sales volume and the lag time in reducing advertising and other sales support costs to the lower volume 
the company recorded million in facility consolidation and employee separation costs during fiscal year these costs related to consolidating manufacturing operations and workforce reductions to bring production capacity in line with current and expected demand for the company s products 
interest expense decreased million to million for the fiscal year ended june  due to lower borrowings and interest rates 
although the company s full year tax rate is typically in the range  fiscal year ended june  reflects an effective income tax benefit rate of due to losses or low level of earnings in various tax jurisdictions 
the effective income tax expense rate was for the fiscal year ended june  the above factors resulted in net loss for the fiscal year ended june  of million or per share compared to net income of million or per share for the fiscal year ended june  all earnings per share amounts are on a diluted basis 
fiscal compared to fiscal net sales for the fiscal year ended june  were million compared to million in the prior fiscal year  a decrease of 
residential net sales were million compared to million in the fiscal year ended june   a decrease of 
commercial net sales were million for the fiscal year ended june   a decrease of from the fiscal year ended june  recreational vehicle net sales were million for the fiscal year ended june   a decrease of from the fiscal year ended june  the fiscal year decline in all net sales categories is due to a generally soft market environment 
net income for the fiscal year ended june  was million or per share compared to million or per share in the fiscal year ended june  results for the fiscal year ended june  were favorably impacted by three significant non recurring events 
the company sold a commercial property  which resulted in a pre tax gain of approximately million  or per share after tax 
the company recognized a pre tax gain on the sale of vacant land of approximately million or per share after tax 
these gains are reported as gain on sale of capital assets in the consolidated statements of operations 
the company also realized a non taxable gain on life insurance of million  or per share 
this gain is included in interest and other income in the consolidated statements of operations 
gross margin for the fiscal years ended june  and was and  respectively 
selling  general and administrative expenses were and of net sales for the fiscal years ended june  and  respectively 
the percentage increase in selling  general and administrative costs compared to the prior fiscal year is due primarily to higher marketing and sales support expenses and higher bad debt expense of million on reduced revenues on a year over year basis 
the effective income tax rate for the fiscal year ended june  was  reflecting lower net income compared to the prior year 
the effective income tax rate was for the fiscal year ended june  the rate was reduced by approximately due to the non taxable life insurance gain 
the above factors resulted in net income for the fiscal year ended june  of million or per share compared to million or per share for the fiscal year ended june  all earnings per share amounts are on a diluted basis 
liquidity and capital resources net cash provided by operating activities was million for fiscal year compared to million in fiscal year cash from operating activities was used primarily to reduce borrowings by million and pay dividends of million 
significant changes in working capital from june  to june  included decreased accounts receivable of million  decreased inventory of million and decreased accounts payable of million 
the decrease in receivables is related to lower shipment volume 
lower customer demand for our products reduced production levels and finished product purchases which resulted in an inventory decrease 
the decrease in accounts payable related to lower purchase volume based on current demand 
the company expects that due to the nature of our operations that there will be continuing fluctuations in accounts receivable  inventory  accounts payable  and cash flows from operations due to the following i we purchase selected inventory items from offshore suppliers with long lead times and depending on the timing of the delivery of those orders inventory levels can be greatly impacted  and ii we have various customers that purchase large quantities of inventory periodically and the timing of those purchases can significantly impact inventory levels  accounts receivable  accounts payable and short term borrowings 
as discussed below the company believes it has adequate financing arrangements and access to capital to absorb these fluctuations in operating cash flow 
net cash provided by investing activities was million in fiscal year compared to cash used in investing activities of million in fiscal year proceeds from the sale of investments were million 
proceeds from the sale of capital assets were million 
capital expenditures were million for the fiscal year ended depreciation and amortization expense was million and million for the fiscal years ended june  and  respectively 
the company expects that capital expenditures will be approximately million in fiscal year net cash used in financing activities was million in fiscal year compared to million in fiscal year cash from operating activities was used to reduce borrowings by million and pay dividends of million 
borrowings were reduced by million and dividends paid were million in fiscal year management believes that the company has adequate cash and credit arrangements to meet its operating and capital requirements for fiscal year in the opinion of management  the company s liquidity and credit resources provide it with the ability to react to opportunities as they arise  to pay quarterly dividends to its shareholders  and to purchase productive capital assets that enhance safety and improve operations 
however  should the current economic conditions continue for an extended period of time or deteriorate significantly  we would further evaluate all uses of cash and credit facilities  including the payment of dividends and purchase of capital assets 
at june   the company has no long term debt obligations and therefore  no interest related to long term debt 
the following table summarizes the company s contractual obligations at june  and the effect these obligations are expected to have on the company s liquidity and cash flow in the future in thousands total less than year years years more than years notes payable operating lease obligations total contractual obligations contractual obligations associated with the company s deferred compensation plans were excluded from the table above as the company cannot predict when the events that trigger payment will occur 
total accumulated deferred compensation liabilities were million at june  at june  the company had no capital lease obligations  and no purchase obligations for raw materials or finished goods 
the purchase price on all open purchase orders was fixed and denominated in us dollars 
additionally  the company has excluded the fin reserve from the above table  as the timing of payments  if any  cannot be reasonably estimated 
financing arrangements see note to the consolidated financial statements on page of this annual report on form k 
outlook we believe that the consolidation of manufacturing operations and workforce reductions that the company completed during the fiscal year has brought production capacity and fixed overhead more in line with current and expected demand for our products 
company wide employment has been reduced approximately over the past year through plant closures and workforce reductions related to business conditions 
demand for our products is dependent on factors such as consumer confidence  affordable housing  reasonably attainable financing and an economy with low levels of unemployment and high levels of disposable income 
these factors remain in depressed positions  and indications are that they will remain that way in the near term 
we are not anticipating significant improvements in market conditions at this time  and are managing our business on that basis 
while we expect that current business conditions will persist for the remainder of calendar year  we remain optimistic that our strategy of a wide range of quality product offerings and price points to the residential  recreational vehicle and commercial markets combined with our conservative approach to business will be rewarded when business conditions improve 
we will maintain our focus on a strong balance sheet during these challenging economic times through emphasis on cash flow and improving profitability 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk general market risk represents the risk of changes in the value of a financial instrument  derivative or non derivative  caused by fluctuations in interest rates  foreign exchange rates and equity prices 
as discussed below  management of the company does not believe that changes in these factors could cause material fluctuations in the company s results of operations or cash flows 
the ability to import furniture products can be adversely affected by political issues in the countries where suppliers are located  disruptions associated with shipping distances and negotiations with port employees 
other risks related to furniture product importation include government imposition of regulations and or quotas  duties and taxes on imports  and significant fluctuation in the value of the us dollar against foreign currencies 
any of these factors could interrupt supply  increase costs and decrease earnings 
foreign currency risk during fiscal years  and  the company did not have sales  purchases  or other expenses denominated in foreign currencies 
as such  the company is not exposed to market risk associated with currency exchange rates and prices 
interest rate risk the company s primary market risk exposure with regard to financial instruments is changes in interest rates 
at june   a hypothetical basis point increase in short term interest rates would decrease annual pre tax earnings by approximately  assuming no change in the volume or composition of debt 
as of june   the company has effectively fixed the interest rates at on approximately million of its debt through the use of interest rate swaps  and the above estimated earnings reduction takes these swaps into account 
on july   a million swap matured 
as of the date of this annual report on form k  the company has effectively fixed its interest rate at on approximately million of its debt through the use of interest rate swaps 
as of june  and  the fair value of these swaps is a liability of approximately million and is included in other long term liabilities 
tariffs the company has exposure to actions by governments  including tariffs 
tariffs are a possibility on any imported or exported products 
inflation increased operating costs are reflected in product or services pricing with any limitations on price increases determined by the marketplace 
the impact of inflation on the company has not been significant during the past three years because of the relatively low rates of inflation experienced in the united states 
raw material costs  labor costs and interest rates are important components of costs for the company 
inflation or other pricing pressures could impact any or all of these components  with a possible adverse effect on our profitability  especially where increases in these costs exceed price increases on finished products 
in recent years  the company has faced strong inflationary and other pricing pressures with respect to steel  fuel and health care costs  which have been partially mitigated by pricing adjustments
