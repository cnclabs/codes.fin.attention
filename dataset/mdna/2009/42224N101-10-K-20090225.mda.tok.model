acquisition of leon medical centers health plans on october   we completed the acquisition of all of the outstanding capital stock of leon medical centers health plans  inc lmc health plans pursuant to the terms of a stock purchase agreement  dated as of august  the stock purchase agreement 
the results of lmc health plans are included in our results from the date of acquisition 
lmc health plans is a miami  florida based medicare advantage hmo with approximately  members at december  up from approximately  members at the date of acquisition 
pursuant to the stock purchase agreement  we acquired lmc health plans for million in cash and contingent consideration of  shares of healthspring common stock  which share consideration has been deposited in escrow and will be released to the former stockholders of lmc health plans if leon medical centers  inc lmc completes the construction of two additional medical centers in accordance with the timetable set forth in the purchase agreement 
as part of the transaction  we entered into an exclusive long term provider contract the leon medical services agreement with lmc 
lmc operates five medicare only medical clinics located in miami dade county and has a ten year history of providing medical care and customer service to the hispanic medicare eligible community of south florida 
the leon medical services agreement is for an initial term of approximately ten years with an additional five year renewal term at our option 
payments for medical services under the leon medical services agreement are based on agreed upon rates for each service  multiplied by the number of plan members as of the first day of each month

lmc has agreed that lmc health plans will be  during the term of the agreement  the exclusive health maintenance organization to whom lmc provides medical services as contemplated by the agreement in the four county area 
revenue general 
our revenue consists primarily of i premium revenue we generate from our medicare line of business  ii fee revenue we receive for management and administrative services provided to independent physician associations  health plans  and self insured employers  and for access to our provider networks  and iii investment income 
premium revenue 
our medicare contracts entitle us to premium payments from cms  on behalf of each medicare beneficiary enrolled in our plans  generally on a per member per month  or pmpm  basis 
in our commercial hmos  we receive a monthly payment from or on behalf of each enrolled member 
in both our commercial and medicare plans  we recognize premium revenue during the month in which the company is obligated to provide services to an enrolled member 
premiums we receive in advance of that date are recorded as deferred revenue 

table of contents premiums for our medicare and commercial products are generally fixed by contract in advance of the period during which health care is covered 
each of our medicare plans submits rate proposals to cms  generally by county or service area  in june for each medicare product that will be offered beginning january of the subsequent year 
retroactive rate adjustments are made periodically with respect to each of our medicare plans based on the aggregate health status and risk scores of our plan populations 
for a further explanation of the company s accounting for retroactive risk payments  see results of operations risk adjustment payments below 
as with our traditional medicare advantage plans  we provide written bids to cms for our part d plans  which include the estimated costs of providing prescription drug benefits over the plan year 
premium payments from cms are based on these estimated costs 
the amount of cms payments relating to the part d standard coverage for our ma pd plans and pdp is subject to adjustment  positive or negative  based upon the application of risk corridors that compare our prescription drug costs in our bids to cms to our actual prescription drug costs 
variances exceeding certain thresholds may result in cms making additional payments to us or our refunding to cms a portion of the premium payments we previously received 
we estimate and recognize adjustments to premium revenue related to estimated risk corridor payments as of each quarter end based upon our actual prescription drug costs for each reporting period as if the annual contract were to end at the end of each reporting period 
we account for estimated risk corridor settlements with cms on our balance sheet and as an operating activity in our statement of cash flows 
actual risk corridor payments upon final settlement with cms could differ materially  favorably or unfavorably  from our estimates 
because of the part d product benefit design  the company incurs prescription drug costs unevenly throughout the year  resulting in fluctuations in quarterly ma pd and pdp earnings 
as a result of product features such as co payments and deductibles  the coverage gap  risk corridors  and reinsurance  we generally expect to incur a disproportionate amount of prescription drug costs in the first half of the year 
as a result  our part d related earnings are generally expected to increase in the second half of the year as compared to the first half of the year 
certain part d related payments we receive from cms  primarily relating to low income and reinsurance subsidies for qualifying members of our plans  represent payments for claims that we administer on behalf of cms and for which we assume no risk 
we account for these payments received or owed to us as funds held for or due for the benefit of members on our balance sheet and as a financing activity in our statement of cash flows 
we do not recognize premium revenue or claims expense for these payments as these amounts represent pass through payments from cms to fund deductibles  co payments  and other member benefits 
we recognize prescription drug costs as incurred  net of rebates from drug manufacturers  if any 
fee revenue 
fee revenue primarily includes amounts paid to us for management services provided to independent physician associations and health plans 
our management subsidiaries typically generate fee revenue on one of three bases as a percentage of revenue collected by the relevant health plan  as a fixed pmpm payment or percentage of revenue for members serviced by the relevant independent physician association  or as fees we receive for offering access to our provider networks and for administrative services we offer to self insured employers 
fee revenue is recognized in the month in which services are provided 
in addition  pursuant to certain of our management agreements with independent physician associations  or ipas  we receive fees based on a share of the profits of the independent physician associations 
to the extent these fees relate to members of our hmo subsidiaries  the fees are recognized as a credit to medical expense 
management fees calculated based on profits are recognized  as fee revenue or as a credit to medical expenses  if applicable  when we can readily determine that such fees have been earned  which determination is typically made on a monthly basis 
investment income 
investment income consists of interest income and gross realized gains and losses from sales of available for sale investments and discount amortization and interest on held to maturity securities 
medical expense our largest expense is the cost of medical services we arrange for our members  or medical expense 
medical expense for our medicare and commercial plans primarily consist of payments to physicians  hospitals  pharmacies  and other health care providers for services and products provided to our medicare and commercial 
table of contents members 
we generally pay our providers on one of three bases fee for service contracts based on negotiated fee schedules  capitated arrangements  generally on a fixed pmpm payment basis  whereby the provider generally assumes some or all of the medical expense risk  and risk sharing arrangements  whereby we advance a capitated pmpm amount and share the risk of the medical costs of our members with the provider based on actual experience as measured against pre determined sharing ratios 
pharmacy cost represents payments for members prescription drug benefits  net of rebates from drug manufacturers 
rebates are recognized when earned  according to the contractual arrangements with the respective manufacturers 
one of our primary tools for managing our business and measuring our profitability is our medical loss ratio  or mlr  the ratio of our medical expenses to the premiums we receive 
relatively small changes in the ratio of our medical expenses relative to the premium we receive can result in significant changes in our financial results 
changes in the mlr from period to period result from  among other things  changes in medicare funding or commercial premiums  changes in benefits offered by our plans  our ability to manage medical expense  changes in accounting estimates related to incurred but not reported  or ibnr  claims  and our part d related earnings relative to cms risk corridors 
we use mlrs both to monitor our management of medical expenses and to make various business decisions  including what plans or benefits to offer  what geographic areas to enter or exit  and our selection of healthcare providers 
we analyze and evaluate our medicare advantage  pdp  and commercial mlrs separately

december  medicare advantage membership tennessee texas alabama florida illinois mississippi total medicare stand alone pdp membership commercial membership tennessee alabama total includes approximately  members in the valley baptist health plans the valley plans  whose medicare advantage plan contract was acquired by the company s texas plan effective october  the company acquired lmc health plans on october  as of the acquisition date the health plan had approximately  medicare advantage members and no pdp or commercial members 
medicare advantage 
our medicare advantage membership increased by to  members at december  as compared to  members at december  as anticipated  our alabama membership decreased slightly as of december  compared to membership at december  as a result of the company exiting certain counties 
similarly  the tennessee market experienced slight and anticipated decreases in membership as of december  compared to december  as a result of discontinuing and changing certain products 
medicare advantage including ma pd membership as of january  was  reflecting increases in each of our markets except alabama whose membership decreased approximately members 
effective october   the company acquired medicare advantage contracts from the valley plans operating in the texas rio grande valley counties of hidalgo  willacy  and cameron  for approximately million in cash 
the valley plans currently include approximately  members 
additional cash consideration of up to million is potentially payable to the seller based upon membership levels retained as of april  and april  as part of the transaction  the company entered into a provider contract with valley baptist 
table of contents health system 
the contract  with an initial term of five years  includes two hospitals and twelve outpatient facilities 
pdp 
pdp membership increased by to  members at december  as compared to  at december   primarily as a result of the auto assignment of members in the california and new york regions at the beginning of the year 
we do not actively market our pdps and have relied on cms auto assignments of dual eligible beneficiaries for membership 
we retained auto assigned dual eligible pdp membership in of the cms pdp regions for this compares to regions in which healthspring received auto assigned membership in pdp membership as of january  was approximately  commercial 
our commercial hmo membership declined from  members at december  to members at december   primarily as a result of the non renewal of coverage by employer groups in tennessee  which was expected 
risk adjustment payments the company s medicare premium revenue is subject to adjustment based on the health risk of its members 
we refer to this process for adjusting premiums as the cms risk adjustment payment methodology 
under the risk adjustment payment methodology  managed care plans must capture  collect  and report diagnosis code information to cms 
after reviewing the respective submissions  cms establishes the payments to medicare plans generally at the beginning of the calendar year and then adjusts premiums on two separate occasions on a retroactive basis 
the first retroactive risk premium adjustment for a given year generally occurs during the third quarter of such year 
this initial settlement the initial cms settlement represents the updating of risk scores for the current year based on updated diagnoses from the prior year 
cms then issues a final retroactive risk premium adjustment settlement for that year in the following calendar year the final cms settlement 
prior to  the company was unable to estimate the impact of either of these risk adjustment settlements primarily because of the lack of historical risk based diagnosis code data and insufficient historical experience regarding risk premium settlement adjustments on which to base a reasonable estimate of future risk premium adjustments and  as such  recorded them upon notification from cms of such amounts 
in the first quarter of  the company began estimating and recording on a monthly basis the initial cms settlement  as the company concluded it had sufficient historical experience and available risk based data to reasonably estimate such amounts 
in the fourth quarter of  the company began estimating and recording the final cms settlement  in that case for based on risk score data available at that time  as the company concluded such amounts were reasonably estimable 
during the first quarter  the company updated its estimated final cms settlement payment amounts for based on its evaluation of additional diagnosis code information reported to cms in and updated its estimate again in the second quarter as a result of receiving notification in july from cms of the final cms settlement for these changes in estimate related to the plan year resulted in an additional million of premium revenue in the resulting impact on net income for the year ended december   after expense relating to risk sharing payments to providers and income tax expense  was million or per diluted share 
for the year ended december   the comparable impact on premium revenue and net income from the recording of the final cms settlement was million and million or per diluted share  respectively 
total final cms settlement for the plan year was million and represented of total medicare advantage premiums  as adjusted for risk payments  for the plan year 
total final cms settlement for the plan year was million and represented of total medicare advantage premiums  as adjusted for risk payments  received for the plan year

stand alone prescription drug plan pdp consists of medicare eligible beneficiaries receiving prescription drug benefits on a stand alone basis in accordance with medicare part d 
commercial consists of our commercial health plan business 
the commercial segment was insignificant as of december  as a result of the non renewal of coverage during and by employer groups in tennessee  which was expected 
the other segment consists primarily of corporate expenses not allocated to the other reportable segments 
these segment groupings are also consistent with information used by our chief executive officer in making operating decisions 
the results of each segment are measured and evaluated by earnings before interest expense  depreciation and amortization expense  and income taxes or ebitda 
we have not historically allocated certain corporate overhead amounts classified as selling  general and administrative expenses or interest expense to our segments 
we evaluate interest expense  income taxes  and asset and liability details on a consolidated basis as these items are managed in a corporate shared service environment and are not the responsibility of segment operating management 
revenue includes premium revenue  management and other fee income  and investment income 
financial data by reportable segment for the last three years ended december is as follows in thousands ma pd pdp commercial other total year ended december  revenue ebitda depreciation and amortization expense year ended december  revenue ebitda depreciation and amortization expense year ended december  revenue ebitda depreciation and amortization expense a reconciliation of reportable segment ebitda to net income included in the consolidated statements of income for the last three years ended december is as follows in thousands ebitda income tax expense interest expense depreciation and amortization impairment of intangible assets net income liquidity and capital resources we finance our operations primarily through internally generated funds 
all of our outstanding funded indebtedness was incurred in connection with the acquisition of the lmc health plans in october see indebtedness below 
we generate cash primarily from premium revenue and our primary use of cash is the payment of medical and sg a expenses and principle and interest on indebtedness 
we anticipate that our current level of cash on hand  internally generated cash flows  and borrowings available under our revolving credit facility will be sufficient to fund our anticipated working capital needs  our debt service  and capital expenditures over at least the next twelve months 
the current volatility in the securities and credit markets has not had a material adverse effect on the company s financial condition or results of operations and  at least as currently foreseeable by management of the company  such crises are not expected to materially adversely affect the company s liquidity or operations 
substantially all of the company s liquidity is in the form of cash and cash equivalents million at december   the majority of which million at december  is held by the company s regulated insurance subsidiaries  which amounts are required by law and by our credit agreement to be invested in low risk  short term  highly liquid investments such as government securities  money market funds  deposit accounts  and overnight repurchase agreements 
the company also invests in securities million at december   primarily corporate and government debt securities  that it generally intends  and has the ability  to hold to maturity 
because the company is not relying on these debt instruments for liquidity  short term fluctuations in market pricing do not generally affect the company s ability to meet its liquidity needs 
to date  the company has not experienced any material issuer defaults on its debt investments 
as of december   the company had approximately million of investments that are collateralized by mortgages  no material amount of which are collateralized by subprime mortgages 
the reported changes in cash and cash equivalents for the years ended december   and were as follows year ended december  in thousands net cash provided by operating activities net cash used in investing activities net cash used in provided by financing activities net decrease increase in cash and cash equivalents cash flows related to investing and financing activities were significantly affected by the acquisition of the lmc health plans 
cash flows from operating activities our primary sources of liquidity are cash flow provided by our operations  available cash on hand  and our revolving credit facility  which to date remains undrawn 
we generated cash from operating activities of million during the year ended december   compared to million during the year ended december  
table of contents compared with the increase in cash flow provided by operating activities to million for as compared with million is primarily attributable to increases in earnings  increases in non cash amortization expense in  the timing of cash receipts for risk settlement premiums and risk corridor settlements with cms and other receivables  the increase in medical claims liability in  and the timing of incentive compensation payments 
compared with for  cash flow provided by operating activities was million compared with million for operating cash flows in included favorable amounts due to our entry into the part d business 
the main drivers of the decrease in cash provided from operations for compared to were a million use of cash related to the timing of settlements and receipts of part d funds with cms  a million negative variance in the timing of pharmacy claims payments and the run out in commercial claims on commercial plans that terminated during  and a negative variance in the timing of income tax payments 
cash flows from investing and financing activities for the year ended december   the primary investing activities consisted of million in property and equipment additions  expenditures of million to purchase investment securities  million in proceeds from the maturity of investment securities  and the expenditure of million for the valley plans acquisition 
our ongoing capital expenditures are primarily related to our technology initiatives and the development of medical clinics as part of our advanced medical home initiatives 
the company expects capital expenditures in to equal less than of total revenues 
during the year ended december   the company s financing activities consisted primarily of million of funds withdrawn in excess of funds received from cms for the benefit of members  million expended for the repurchase of company stock  and million for the repayment of long term debt 
funds due from cms for the benefit of members are recorded as an asset at december  and as a liability on our balance sheet at december  we anticipate settling approximately million of such part d related amounts relating to with cms during the second half of as part of the final settlement of part d payments for the plan year 
we expect such settlement amounts from cms to be less significant in and future periods 
such excess subsidies related to the plan year resulted in the million settlement with cms in the fourth quarter of we expect cash flows in to include inflow for similar subsidies or funds from cms related to the medicare year 
for the year ended december   our primary investing activity consisted of net expenditures of million used to acquire the lmc health plans on october  other investing activities consisted of million in property and equipment additions  approximately million used to purchase investments  and million in proceeds from the maturity of investment securities 
during the year ending december   our financing activities consisted of proceeds received from the issuance of long term debt in october of million  which was used in our acquisition of the lmc health plans  payments of million for financing costs associated with the issuance of this debt  and million of funds received from cms in excess of the funds withdrawn for the benefit of members with part d drug coverage 
for the year ended december   our primary investing activities consisted of million in property and equipment additions  approximately million used to purchase investments  and million in proceeds from the maturity of investment securities 
during the year ending december   our financing activities consisted of proceeds received from our ipo in february of million  which was used in its entirety to pay off all outstanding indebtedness  and million of funds received from cms in excess of the funds withdrawn for the benefit of members with part d drug coverage 

table of contents statutory capital requirements our hmo subsidiaries are required to maintain satisfactory minimum net worth requirements established by their respective state departments of insurance 
at december   our texas of authorized control level was million  actual million  tennessee minimum million  actual million  florida minimum million  actual million and alabama minimum million  actual million hmo subsidiaries as well as our accident and health subsidiary minimum million  actual million were in compliance with statutory minimum net worth requirements at december  notwithstanding the foregoing  the state departments of insurance can require our hmo subsidiaries to maintain minimum levels of statutory capital in excess of amounts required under the applicable state law if they determine that maintaining additional statutory capital is in the best interest of our members 
in addition  as a condition to its approval of the lmc health plans acquisition  the florida office of insurance regulation has required the florida plan to maintain of the statutory surplus otherwise required by florida law until september the hmos are restricted from making distributions without appropriate regulatory notifications and approvals or to the extent such distributions would put them out of compliance with statutory net worth requirements 
at december   million of our million of cash  cash equivalents  investment securities and restricted investments were held by our hmo subsidiaries and subject to these dividend restrictions 
during the year ended december   our alabama and texas hmo subsidiaries distributed million and million in cash  respectively  to the parent company 
similarly  our alabama and texas hmo subsidiaries distributed million and million in cash  respectively  to the parent company in our texas hmo subsidiary expended million in in connection with the acquisition of the valley plans 
indebtedness long term debt at december  and consisted of the following in thousands senior secured term loan less current portion of long term debt long term debt less current portion in connection with funding the acquisition of lmc health plans  on october   we entered into agreements with respect to a million  five year credit facility the credit agreement which  subject to the terms and conditions set forth thersein  provides for million in term loans and a million revolving credit facility 
the million revolving credit facility  which is available for working capital and general corporate purposes including capital expenditures and permitted acquisitions  is undrawn as of the date of this report 
as a result of covenant restrictions  available borrowings under the revolving credit facility at december   were limited to million 
borrowings under the credit agreement accrue interest on the basis of either a base rate or a libor rate plus  in each case  an applicable margin initially basis points for libor advances depending on our debt to ebitda leverage ratio 
the weighted average interest rates incurred on borrowings under the credit agreement during the years ended december   and were and  respectively and  respectively  exclusive of amortization of deferred financing costs 
we also pay commitment fees on the unfunded portion of the lenders commitments under the revolving credit facility  the amounts of which will also depend on our leverage ratio 
the credit agreement matures  the commitments thereunder terminate  and all amounts then outstanding thereunder are payable on october  during the second quarter  the company made an early principal payment of million 
the net proceeds from certain asset sales  casualty condemnation events  and incurrences of indebtedness subject  in the cases of asset sales and casualty condemnation events  to certain reinvestment rights  and a portion of the net proceeds from equity issuances and our excess cash flow  are required to be used to make prepayments in respect of loans outstanding under the credit agreement 
we expect to make a prepayment in the amount of million on or before april  under such excess cash flow provisions 
such prepayment amount is included in the current portion of long term debt outstanding at december  in october  the company entered into two interest rate swap agreements relating to the floating interest rate component of the term loan agreement under its credit agreement 
the total notional amount covered by the agreements is million of the currently million outstanding under the term loan agreement 

table of contents under the swap agreements  the company is required to pay a fixed interest rate of and is entitled to receive libor every month until october  the actual interest rate payable under the credit agreement in each case contains an applicable margin which is not affected by the swap agreements 
the interest rate swap agreements are classified as cash flow hedges  as defined by sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
the term loans are payable in quarterly principal installments 
maturities of long term debt as of december  under the credit agreement are as follows in thousands amounts borrowed under the revolving credit facility also must be repaid no later than october  loans under the credit agreement are secured by a first priority lien on substantially all assets of the company and its non hmo subsidiaries  including a pledge by the company and its non hmo subsidiaries of all of the equity interests in each of their domestic subsidiaries 
the credit agreement contains conditions precedent to extensions of credit and representations  warranties  and covenants  including financial covenants  customary for transactions of this type 
financial covenants include i a maximum leverage ratio comparing total indebtedness to consolidated adjusted ebitda  ii minimum net worth requirements for each hmo subsidiary calculated with reference to applicable regulatory requirements  and iii maximum capital expenditures  in each case as more specifically provided in the credit agreement 
the credit agreement also contains customary events of default as well as restrictions on undertaking certain specified corporate actions including  among others  asset dispositions  acquisitions and other investments  dividends and stock repurchases  changes in control  issuance of capital stock  fundamental corporate changes such as mergers and consolidations  incurrence of additional indebtedness  creation of liens  transactions with affiliates  and certain subsidiary regulatory restrictions 
if an event of default occurs that is not otherwise waived or cured  the lenders may terminate their obligations to make loans and other extensions of credit under the credit agreement and the obligations of the issuing banks to issue letters of credit and may declare the loans outstanding under the credit agreement to be due and payable 
the company believes it is currently in compliance with its financial and other covenants under the credit agreement 
in connection with entering into the credit agreement  the company incurred deferred financing costs of approximately million in off balance sheet arrangements at december  did not have any off balance sheet arrangement requiring disclosure

critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires our management to make a number of estimates and assumptions relating to the reported amount of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the period 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances 
changes in estimates are recorded if and when better information becomes available 
actual results could significantly differ from those estimates under different assumptions and conditions 
we believe that the accounting policies discussed below are those that are most important to the presentation of our financial condition and results of operations and that require our management s most difficult  subjective  and complex judgments 
medical expense and medical claims liability medical expense is recognized in the period in which services are provided and includes an estimate of the cost of medical expense that has been incurred but not yet reported  or ibnr 
medical expense includes claim payments  capitation payments  risk sharing payments and pharmacy costs  net of rebates  as well as estimates of future payments of claims incurred  net of reinsurance 
capitation payments represent monthly contractual fees disbursed to physicians and other providers who are responsible for providing medical care to members 
pharmacy costs represent payments for members prescription drug benefits  net of rebates from drug manufacturers 
rebates are recognized when earned  according to the contractual arrangements with the respective vendors 
premiums we pay to reinsurers are reported as medical expenses and related reinsurance recoveries are reported as deductions from medical expenses 
medical claims liability includes medical claims reported to the plans but not yet paid as well as an actuarially determined estimate of claims that have been incurred but not yet reported to the plans 

table of contents the following table presents the components of our medical claims liability as of the dates indicated december  in thousands incurred but not reported ibnr reported claims total medical claims liability the ibnr component of total medical claims liability is based on our historical claims data  current enrollment  health service utilization statistics  and other related information 
estimating ibnr is complex and involves a significant amount of judgment 
accordingly  it represents our most critical accounting estimate 
the development of the ibnr uses standard actuarial developmental methodologies  including completion factors and claims trends  which take into account the potential for adverse claims developments  and considers favorable and unfavorable prior period developments 
actual claims payments will differ  however  from our estimates 
a worsening or improvement of our claims trend or changes in completion factors from those that we assumed in estimating medical claims liabilities at december  would cause these estimates to change in the near term and such a change could be material 
as discussed above  actual claim payments will differ from our estimates 
the period between incurrence of the expense and payment is  as with most health insurance companies  relatively short  however  with over of claims typically paid within days of the month in which the claim is incurred 
although there is a risk of material variances in the amounts of estimated and actual claims  the variance is known quickly 
accordingly  we expect that substantially all of the estimated medical claims payable as of the end of any fiscal period whether a quarter or year end will be known and paid during the next fiscal period 
our policy is to record each plan s best estimate of medical expense ibnr 
using actuarial models  we calculate a minimum amount and maximum amount of the ibnr component 
to most accurately determine the best estimate  our actuaries determine the point estimate within their minimum and maximum range by similar medical expense categories within lines of business 
the medical expense categories we use are in patient facility  outpatient facility  all professional expense  and pharmacy 
the lines of business are medicare and commercial 
completion factors estimate liabilities for claims based upon the historical lag between the month when services are rendered and the month claims are paid and takes into consideration factors such as expected medical cost inflation  seasonality patterns  product mix  and membership changes 
the completion factor is a measure of how complete the claims paid to date are relative to the estimate of the total claims for services rendered for a given reporting period 
although the completion factor is generally reliable for older service periods  it is more volatile  and hence less reliable  for more recent periods given that the typical billing lag for services can range from a week to as much as days from the date of service 
our use of claims trend factors considers many aspects of the managed care business 
these considerations are aggregated in the medical expense trend and include the incidences of illness or disease state 
accordingly  we rely upon our historical experience  as continually monitored  to reflect the ever changing mix  needs  and growth of our members by type in our trend assumptions 
among the factors considered by management are changes in the level of benefits provided to members  seasonal variations in utilization  identified industry trends  and changes in provider reimbursement arrangements  including changes in the percentage of reimbursements made on a capitated as opposed to a fee for service basis 
other external factors such as government mandated benefits or other regulatory changes  catastrophes  and epidemics may impact medical expense trends 
other internal factors  such as system conversions and claims processing interruptions may impact our ability to accurately predict estimates of historical completion factors or medical expense trends 
medical expense trends potentially are more volatile than other segments of the economy 
we apply different estimation methods depending on the month of service for which incurred claims are being estimated 
for the more recent months  which constitute the majority of the amount of ibnr  we estimate our 
table of contents claims incurred by applying the observed trend factors to the trailing twelve month pmpm costs 
for prior months  costs have been estimated using completion factors 
in order to estimate the pmpms for the most recent months  we validate our estimates of the most recent months utilization levels to the utilization levels in older months using actuarial techniques that incorporate a historical analysis of claim payments  including trends in cost of care provided  and timeliness of submission and processing of claims 
actuarial standards of practice generally require the actuarially developed medical claims liability estimates to be sufficient  taking into account an assumption of moderately adverse conditions 
as such  we previously recognized in our medical claims liability a separate provision for adverse claims development  which was intended to account for moderately adverse conditions in claims payment patterns  historical trends  and environmental factors 
in periods prior to the fourth quarter of  we believed that a separate provision for adverse claims development was appropriate to cover additional unknown adverse claims not anticipated by the standard assumptions used to produce the ibnr estimates that were incurred prior to  but paid after  a period end 
when determining our estimate of ibnr at december  we determined that a separate provision for adverse claims development was no longer necessary  primarily as a result of the growth and stabilizing trends experienced in our medicare business  continued favorable development of prior period ibnr estimates  and the insignificance of our commercial line of business 
moreover  for the past two years a separate provision had become a less significant component of medical claims liability 
the elimination of the separate provision for adverse claims development reduced our medicare medical claims expense by million for the year ended december  the completion and claims trend factors are the most significant factors impacting the ibnr estimate 
the following table illustrates the sensitivity of these factors and the impact on our operating results caused by changes in these factors that management believes are reasonably likely based on our historical experience and december  data completion factor a claims trend factor b increase increase decrease decrease increase in medical increase in medical decrease claims decrease claims in factor liability in factor liability dollars in thousands a impact due to change in completion factor for the most recent three months 
completion factors indicate how complete claims paid to date are in relation to estimates for a given reporting period 
accordingly  an increase in completion factor results in a decrease in the remaining estimated liability for medical claims 
b impact due to change in annualized medical cost trends used to estimate pmpm costs for the most recent three months 
each month  we re examine the previously established medical claims liability estimates based on actual claim submissions and other relevant changes in facts and circumstances 
as the liability estimates recorded in prior periods become more exact  we increase or decrease the amount of the estimates  and include the changes in medical expenses in the period in which the change is identified 
in every reporting period  our operating results include the effects of more completely developed medical claims liability estimates associated with prior periods 
adjustments of prior period estimates will result in additional medical costs or  as we have experienced during the last several years  a reduction in medical costs in the period an adjustment was made 
as reflected in the table below our reserve models developed favorably in and  and the accrued liabilities calculated from the models for each of the periods were more than our ultimate liabilities for unpaid claims 

table of contents the following table provides a reconciliation of changes in medical claims liability for the years ended december  and year ended december  in thousands balance at beginning of period acquisition of lmc health plans incurred related to current period prior period total incurred paid related to current period prior period total paid balance at the end of the period approximately million paid to providers under risk sharing and capitation arrangements related to premiums is excluded from the amount in the incurred related to prior period amount below because it does not relate to fee for service medical claims estimates and is included in the incurred related to current period amounts 
most of this amount is the result of approximately million of additional retroactive risk adjustment premium payments recorded in that relate to premiums see risk adjustment payments 
similar type amounts in prior periods are presented in a manner consistent with and were not significant 
negative amounts reported for incurred related to prior periods result from fee for service medical claims estimates being ultimately settled for amounts less than originally anticipated a favorable development 
amounts incurred related to prior years vary from previously estimated claims liabilities as the claims ultimately are settled 
as discussed previously  medical claims liabilities are generally settled and paid within several months of the member receiving service from the provider 
accordingly  the prior year favorable development relates almost entirely to fee for service claims incurred in calendar year the negative amounts reported in the table above for incurred related to prior periods result from fee for service claims estimates being ultimately settled for amounts less than originally anticipated a favorable development 
a positive amount reported for incurred related to prior periods would result from claims estimates being ultimately settled for amounts greater than originally anticipated an unfavorable development 
as reflected in the immediately preceding table  claims estimates at december  ultimately settled during for million or of total medical expense less than the amounts originally estimated 
this favorable prior period reserve development was primarily as a result of the following factors actual claims trends ultimately being lower than original estimates resulting in million of favorable development  primarily attributable to lower than anticipated cost increases and utilization in both our medicare and commercial lines of business  actual completion factors ultimately being higher than completion factors used to estimate ibnr at december  based on historical patterns resulting in million of favorable development  which increase was primarily attributable to a shortening of the time between when claims are submitted by providers and paid by our plans 

table of contents as reflected in the immediately preceding table  claims estimates at december  ultimately settled during for million or of total medical expense less than the amounts originally estimated

the favorable overall claims development experienced in and includes favorable commercial claims liability development of and million  respectively 
our commercial hmo membership declined from  members at december  to  members at december   and again to members at december   primarily as a result of the expected non renewal by employers in tennessee and alabama 
commercial medical claims payable was million  million and at december   and  respectively 
our medical claims liability also considers premium deficiency situations and evaluates the necessity for additional related liabilities 
there were no required premium deficiency accruals at december  or december  premium revenue recognition we generate revenues primarily from premiums we receive from cms  and to a lesser extent our commercial customers  to provide healthcare benefits to our members 
we receive premium payments on a pmpm basis from cms to provide healthcare benefits to our medicare members  which premiums are fixed subject to retroactive risk adjustment on an annual basis by contracts with cms 
although the amount we receive from cms for each member is fixed  the amount varies among medicare plans according to  among other things  plan benefits  demographics  geographic location  age  gender  and the relative risk score of the plan s membership 
we generally receive premiums on a monthly basis in advance of providing services 
premiums collected in advance are deferred and reported as deferred revenue 
we recognize premium revenue during the period in which we are obligated to provide services to our members 
any amounts that have not been received are recorded on the balance sheet as accounts receivable 
our medicare premium revenue is subject to periodic adjustment under what is referred to as cms s risk adjustment payment methodology based on the health risk of our members 
risk adjustment uses health status indicators to correlate the payments to the health acuity of the member  and consequently establishes incentives for plans to enroll and treat less healthy medicare beneficiaries 
cms adopted this payment methodology in  at which time the risk adjustment payment methodology accounted for of the premium payment to medicare health plans  with the remaining based on demographic factors 
with the full phase in of risk adjustment payments in  they now account for of the premium payment 
under the risk adjustment payment methodology  managed care plans must capture  collect  and report diagnosis code information to cms 
after reviewing the respective submissions  cms establishes the payments to medicare plans generally at the beginning of the calendar year  and then adjusts premium levels on two separate occasions on a retroactive basis 
the first retroactive risk premium adjustment for a given fiscal year generally 
table of contents occurs during the third quarter of such fiscal year 
this initial settlement the initial cms settlement represents the updating of risk scores for the current year based on the prior year s dates of service 
cms then issues a final retroactive risk premium adjustment settlement for that fiscal year in the following year the final cms settlement 
as previously discussed  the risk adjustment payment system for determining premiums is relatively new for cms and the company 
prior to  we were unable to estimate the impact of either of these risk adjustment settlements primarily because of the lack of historical risk based diagnosis code data and insufficient historical experience regarding risk premium settlement adjustments on which to base a reasonable estimate of future risk premium adjustments  and as such recorded them upon notification from cms of such amounts 
in the first quarter of  we began estimating and recording on a monthly basis the initial cms settlement  as we concluded we had sufficient historical experience and available risk based data to reasonably estimate such amounts 
similarly  in the fourth quarter of  we estimated and recorded the final cms settlement for based on risk score data available at that time  as we concluded such amounts were estimable 
as of january  we estimate and record on a monthly basis both the initial cms settlement and the final cms settlement for the cms plan year 
we develop our estimates for risk premium adjustment settlement utilizing historical experience and predictive actuarial models as sufficient member risk score data becomes available over the course of each cms plan year 
our actuarial models are populated with available risk score data on our members 
risk premium adjustments are based on member risk score data from the previous year 
risk score data for members who entered our plans during the current plan year  however  is not available for use in our models  therefore  we make assumptions regarding the risk scores of this relatively small subset of our member population 
all such estimated amounts are periodically updated as necessary as additional diagnosis code information is reported to cms and adjusted to actual amounts when the ultimate adjustment settlements are either received from cms or the company receives notification from cms of such settlement amounts 
additionally  in connection with the determination of actual settlement amounts as of june   we updated the assumptions and methods used in our actuarial models used for estimating risk settlements 
we also refined our process of estimating risk settlements going forward by increasing the frequency of risk data submissions to cms which results in a more timely and complete data set used to populate our actuarial models 
as a result of the variability of factors  including plan risk scores  that determine such estimations  the actual amount of cms s retroactive risk premium settlement adjustments could be materially more or less than our estimates 
consequently  our estimate of our plans risk scores for any period and our accrual of settlement premiums related thereto  may result in favorable or unfavorable adjustments to our medicare premium revenue and  accordingly  our profitability 
we expect that differences as a percent of total revenue between estimated final settlement amounts and actual final settlement amounts in future periods will become less significant 
there can be no assurances  however  that any such differences will not have a material effect on any future quarterly or annual results of operations 
the following table illustrates the sensitivity of the final cms settlement and the impact on premium revenue caused by differences between actual and estimated settlement amounts that management believes are reasonably likely  based on our historical experience and december  data increase increase decrease decrease in settlement in estimate receivable payable dollars in thousands 
table of contents long lived assets long lived assets  such as property and equipment and purchased intangibles subject to amortization  are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to estimated future undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the asset 
if the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its estimated fair value  an impairment charge is recognized by the amount of the excess 
assets to be disposed of would be separately presented in the balance sheet and reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell  and no longer depreciated 
intangible assets with estimable useful lives are amortized over their respective estimated useful lives 
we determine the useful life and amortization method for definite life intangible assets based on the guidance in fasb statement no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
for all periods through the quarter ended september   the straight line method of amortization was applied for medicare member network intangible asset associated with our recapitalization the recapitalization asset  as a better pattern could not be reliably determined based on available information 
effective october   we began applying a year accelerated method of amortization for this asset 
since the date of acquiring the member network asset in  we have tracked actual attrition rates experienced within the member network and believe that there is adequate historical data to make reliable estimates regarding future attrition rates for amortization purposes 
based on our review of historical attrition rates  we believe the accelerated method of amortization over the revised estimated life better approximates the distribution of economic benefits realized from the recapitalization asset 
the use of an accelerated method prior to september  would have resulted in the recognition of amortization expense that is not materially different from the amounts recognized under the straight line method used by us during the same periods 
we monitor our actual attrition rates and adjust amortization schedules accordingly 
our accounting for this change related to the recapitalization asset resulted in incremental amortization expense of million during the quarter ended december  over the amount of expense recognized using the straight line method in prior quarters of and did not have a material effect on our reported income before income taxes  net income  or net income per share for the quarter and year ended december  as a result of the change related to the recapitalization asset  amortization expense for the year ended december  increased approximately million over the amount recognized in the year ended december  similarly  we are using a year accelerated method of amortization for the medicare member network intangible acquired as part of the acquisition of leon medical centers health plans  inc on october  goodwill and indefinite life intangible assets goodwill represents the excess of cost over fair value of assets of businesses acquired 
goodwill and intangible assets acquired in a purchase business combination and determined to have an indefinite useful life are not amortized  but instead are tested for impairment at least annually 
an impairment loss is recognized to the extent that the carrying amount exceeds the asset s fair value 
this determination is made at the reporting unit level and consists of two steps 
first  the company determines the fair value of the reporting unit and compares it to its carrying amount 
second  if the carrying amount of the reporting unit exceeds its fair value  an impairment loss is recognized for any excess of the carrying amount of the unit s goodwill over the implied fair value of that goodwill 
the implied fair value of goodwill is determined by allocating the fair value of the reporting units in a manner similar to a purchase price allocation  in accordance with sfas no 
 business combinations 
the residual fair value after this allocation is the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill 
we have four reporting units in alabama  florida  tennessee and texas 
during the current year  we changed the timing of our annual goodwill impairment testing from december to october this change in accounting principle is preferable because it allows us to complete our annual goodwill impairment testing prior to our year end closing activities 
this change did not delay  accelerate  or avoid an impairment charge 
we conducted an annual impairment test as of october  and concluded that the carrying value of the reporting units did not exceed their fair value 
in addition  no events have occurred subsequent to the testing date which would indicate any impairment may have occurred 

table of contents accounting for income taxes we use the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes 
under this method  deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes and net operating loss and tax credit carry forwards 
the amount of deferred taxes on these temporary differences is determined using the tax rates that are expected to apply to the period when the asset is realized or the liability is settled  as applicable  based on tax rates and laws in the respective tax jurisdiction enacted as of the balance sheet date 
we review our deferred tax assets for recoverability and establish a valuation allowance based on historical taxable income  projected future taxable income  applicable tax strategies  and the expected timing of the reversals of existing temporary differences 
a valuation allowance is provided when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
we account for uncertain tax positions in accordance with fin accordingly  we report a liability for unrecognized tax benefits resulting from uncertain tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
we recognize interest and penalties  if any  related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense 
we also have accruals for taxes and associated interest that may become payable in future years as a result of audits by tax authorities 
we accrue for tax contingencies when it is more likely than not that a liability to a taxing authority has been incurred and the amount of the contingency can be reasonably estimated

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk as of december  and  we had the following assets that may be sensitive to changes in interest rates december  asset class in thousands investment securities  available for sale current portion non current portion investment securities  held to maturity current portion non current portion restricted investments we have not purchased any of our investments for trading purposes 
our investment securities classified as available for sale consist primarily of highly liquid government and corporate debt securities 
for all other investment securities  we intend to hold them to their maturity and classify them as current on our balance sheet if they mature on a date which is less than months from the balance sheet date and as long term if their maturity is more than one year from the balance sheet date 
these investment securities  both current and long term  consist of highly liquid government and corporate debt obligations  the majority of which mature in five years or less 
the investments are subject to interest rate risk and will decrease in value if market rates increase 
because of the relatively short term nature of our investments and our portfolio mix of variable and fixed rate investments  however  we would not expect the value of these investments to decline significantly as a result of a sudden change 
table of contents in market interest rates 
moreover  because of our ability and intent to hold these investments until maturity  we would not expect foreseeable changes in interest rates to materially impair their carrying value 
restricted investments consist of certificates of deposit  money market fund investment and government securities deposited or pledged to state departments of insurance in accordance with state rules and regulations 
at december  and december   these restricted assets are recorded at amortized cost and classified as long term regardless of the contractual maturity date because of the restrictive nature of the states requirements 
assuming a hypothetical and immediate increase in market interest rates at december   the fair value of our fixed income investments would decrease by approximately  similarly  a decrease in market interest rates at december  would result in an increase of the fair value of our investments of approximately  unless we determined  however  that the increase in interest rates caused more than a temporary impairment in our investments  or unless we were compelled by a currently unforeseen reason to sell securities  such a change should not affect our future earnings or cash flows 
we are subject to market risk from exposure to changes in interest rates based on our financing  investing  and cash management activities 
we have in place million of senior secured credit facilities bearing interest at variable rates at specified margins above either the agent bank s alternate base rate or its libor rate 
the senior secured credit facilities consist of the term facility  which is a million  five year term loan  and the revolving facility  which is a million  five year revolving credit facility 
although changes in the alternate base rate or the libor rate would affect the costs of funds borrowed in the future  we believe the effect  if any  of reasonably possible near term changes in interest rates on our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flow would not be material 
we have interest rate swap agreements to manage a portion of our exposure to these fluctuations 
the interest rate swaps convert a portion of our indebtedness to a fixed rate with a notional amount of million at december  and at an annual fixed rate of 
the notional amount of the swap agreements represent a balance used to calculate the exchange of cash flows and are not an asset or liability 
the fair value of the company s interest rate swap agreements are derived from a discounted cash flow analysis based on the terms of the contract and the interest rate curve 
the company has designated its interest rate swaps as cash flow hedges which are recorded in the company s consolidated balance sheet at their fair value 
the fair value of the company s interest rate swaps at december  are reflected as a liability of approximately million and are included in other long term liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet 
any market risk or opportunity associated with the swap agreements is offset by the opposite market impact on the related debt 
we believe our credit risk related to these agreements is low because the swap agreements are with creditworthy financial institutions 
as of december   we had variable rate debt of approximately million not subject to the interest rate swap agreements 
holding other variables constant  including levels of indebtedness  a increase in interest rates would have an estimated impact on pre tax earning and cash flows for the next twelve month period of  except for the aforementioned swap agreements  we have not taken any other action to cover interest rate risk and are not a party to any interest rate market risk management activities
