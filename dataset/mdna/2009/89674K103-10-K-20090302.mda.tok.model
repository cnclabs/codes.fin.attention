item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements  the related notes and the important notice to investors that appear elsewhere in this report 
overview we are a supplier of high performance modules  components and foundry services for communications applications 
our focus is on the specialized expertise  materials and know how of rf and other high and intermediate frequency applications 
we enjoy diversity in our markets  applications  products  technology and customer base 
our products are designed on various wafer substrates  including compound semiconductor materials such as gaas  gan  and piezoelectric crystals such as litao we use a variety of process technologies using gaas substrates including hbt and phemt 
using various other substrates we also manufacture saw and baw products 
using these materials and our proprietary technology  we believe our products can offer key advantages such as steeper selectivity  lower distortion  higher power and power added efficiency  reduced size and weight and more precise frequency control 
for example  gaas has inherent physical properties that allow its electrons to move up to five times faster than those of silicon 
this higher electron mobility permits the manufacture of gaas integrated circuits that operate at higher levels of performance than silicon devices 
we believe that these advantages are a tremendous benefit to our customers  which include major communication companies worldwide 
strategy and industry considerations our business strategy is to provide our customers with high performance  low cost solutions to applications in the handset  networks and military markets 
our mission is  connecting the digital world to the global network  and we accomplish this through a diversified product portfolio within the communications and military industries 
in the handset market  we primarily provide transmit and power amplifier modules 
in the networks markets  we are a supplier of both active gaas and passive saw components 
we provide the military market with phased array radar antenna components and in were chosen to be the prime contractor on a darpa contract to develop high power wide band amplifiers in gan  a next generation gaas derived technology 
subsequently  we have obtained additional funding from the office of naval research to improve manufacturing methods of producing high power  high voltage s band gaas amplifiers 
wafer and semiconductor manufacturing facilities require a significant level of fixed cost due to investments in plant and equipment  labor costs  and repair and maintenance costs 
during periods of low demand  selling prices also tend to decrease which  when combined with high fixed manufacturing costs  can create an adverse impact on operating results 
however  strong demand in increased equipment utilization in our oregon factory to the extent that we decided to increase capital expenditures for equipment and increase the capacity of this factory in we raised capacity through these capital investments adding gaas fabrication capacity in our oregon factory as well as filter capacity in florida in during the fourth quarter of  demand slowed abruptly and as a result  we experienced a corresponding decrease in factory utilization 
the lower factory utilization level created downward pressure on gross margins 
we experienced revenue growth in compared to however the fourth quarter of brought a sudden decrease in demand 
the market for handset rf components was strong in despite the fourth quarter slowdown 
even though handset revenue for the fourth quarter of declined compared to the third quarter of  handset revenue grew in compared with this growth is primarily attributable to strong growth in g product revenues with an increase of for compared to we believe the fundamental drivers of continued long term growth in the handset market remain solid as the number of new users in developed countries grows and existing users are adopting g enabled handset that offer additional features and functionality as compared to a traditional g handset 
these more sophisticated handsets  sometimes called smartphones  which incorporate a variety of features  and offer wireless broadband access enabled by g technologies  represent one of the fastest growing portions of our market 
this transition to more sophisticated handsets increases the rf content in each device  increasing our addressable market 
further  
table of contents china  india and other emerging countries with improving economies are growing the traditional g market by introducing a new customer base 
in the past  however  during times of growing demand we have also experienced significant selling price pressure on some of our highest volume products 
the current demand for increased rf content required for the higher data rates and increased functionality of g handset devices has allowed average selling prices to stabilize 
our opportunity in a g phone  which is quad band capable in the gprs gsm edge mode and supports bands in the wideband code division multiple access wcdma mode  is over of content per unit 
by comparison  our content for a low cost dual band gsm gprs phone is approximately per unit 
typical functional price erosion is per year  offset by increasing content 
in our networks business  wlan product revenues increased for compared to despite decreased demand in the fourth quarter of rf content for wlan has increased as a result of requirements for greater data rates and faster access 
the market is also developing mobile devices that are taking on new forms  such as small laptop notebooks also referred to as netbooks and mobile internet devices mids 
these new forms  combined with traditional laptops and wlan attachment to handsets  have created a significant growth opportunity 
additionally  the continued deployment of cellular systems in emerging markets such as india  africa and in the rest of asia has driven gsm gprs base station transceiver volumes to new record levels 
we expect continued benefit in sales of our point to point radio products which have increased in compared to  largely resulting from build outs in developing countries and data demand increases in those areas of the world where wireless backhaul systems are prevalent 
our networks market includes products that support the transfer of data at high rates across wireless or wired networks 
our products for this market include those related to base station  wlans  worldwide interoperability for microwaved access wimax  gps  cable television  microwave radio  satellite  groundstation  and optical communications 
we also support emerging wireless markets such as automotive and radio frequency identification rfid 
we include our multi market standard products in the networks category 
revenues from the military market are generally for products in large scale programs with long lead times 
once a component has been designed into an end use product for a military application  the same component is generally used during the entire production life of the end use product and  as a result  we tend to produce large volumes of these components 
currently  we are actively engaged with multiple military industry contractors in the development of next generation phased array systems and have key design wins in major projects such as the jsf  htm airborne radar and cobra judy shipboard radar for detecting missile launches 
in addition  in we entered into a multi year contract with darpa to develop high power  wide band amplifiers in gan 
we are currently executing phase iii of our darpa gan contract which represents approximately million of r d investment over years 
from the office of naval research  we were awarded a million  year contract to advance manufacturing methods in the production of gaas technologies 
we expect to continue to win government funding for advanced technologies in the future and we expect to participate in other large projects such as the b radar upgrade  and hope to expand other programs in the future 
in  we launched a new family of gan power amplifier products for the defense market and powerband  a disruptive new technology enabling wide bandwidth with output power and efficiency performance previously restricted to narrow band amplifiers 
these products also have cross over application in our aerospace and networks markets 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap requires us to make certain estimates  judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements  and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
some of our accounting policies require us to make difficult and subjective judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates of matters that are inherently uncertain 
the following accounting policies involve critical accounting estimates because they are particularly dependent on estimates and assumptions made by management about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the accounting estimates are made 
while we have used our best estimates based on facts and circumstances available to us at the time  different estimates 
table of contents reasonably could have been used 
changes in the accounting estimates we use are reasonably likely to occur from time to time  which may have a material impact on the presentation of our financial condition and results of operations 
our most critical accounting estimates include revenue recognition  the valuation of inventory  which impacts gross margin  assessment of recoverability of long lived assets  which primarily impacts operating expense when we impair assets or accelerate depreciation  valuation of investments and debt in privately held companies  which impacts net income when we record impairments  valuation of deferred income tax assets and liabilities  which impacts our tax provision  and stock based compensation  which impacts cost of goods sold and operating expenses 
we also have other policies that we consider to be key accounting policies  such as our policies for the valuation of accounts receivable  reserves for sales returns and allowances  reserves for warranty costs and our reserves for commitments and contingencies  however  these policies either do not meet the definition of critical accounting estimates described above or are not currently material items in our financial statements 
we review our estimates  judgments  and assumptions periodically and reflect the effects of revisions in the period in which they are deemed to be necessary 
we believe that these estimates are reasonable  however  actual results could differ from these estimates 
revenue recognition we derive revenues primarily from the sale of standard and customer specific products and foundry services in the handset  networks and military markets 
we also receive revenues from non recurring engineering fees and cost plus contracts for research and development work  which collectively have been less than of consolidated revenues for any period 
our distribution channels include our direct sales staff  manufacturers representatives and independent distributors 
the majority of our shipments are made directly to our customers 
revenues from the sale of standard and customer specific products are recognized when title passes to the buyer 
we receive periodic reports from customers who utilize inventory hubs and recognize revenues when the customers acknowledge they have pulled inventory from our hub  the point at which title to the product passes to the customer 
revenues from foundry services and non recurring engineering fees are recorded when the service is completed 
revenues from cost plus contracts are recognized as costs are incurred 
revenues from our distributors are recognized when the product is sold to the distributors 
our distributor agreements provide selling prices that are fixed at the date of sale  although we offer price protections  which are specific  of a fixed duration and for which we reserve 
further  the distributor s payment obligation is not contingent on reselling the product 
the distributors take title to the product and bear the risks of ownership  have economic substance and we have no significant obligations for future performance to bring about resale 
we can reasonably estimate the amount of future returns 
sales to our distributors were approximately to of our total revenues for  and we allow our distributors to return products for warranty reasons and stock rotation rights  within certain limitations  and reserve for such instances 
customers that are not distributors can only return products for warranty reasons 
if we are unable to repair or replace products returned under warranty  we will issue a credit for a warranty return 
inventories we state our inventories at the lower of cost or market 
we use a combination of standard cost and moving average cost methodologies to determine our cost basis for our inventories 
this methodology approximates actual cost on a first in  first out basis 
in addition to stating our inventory at the lower of cost or market  we also evaluate it each period for excess quantities and obsolescence 
we analyze forecasted demand versus quantities on hand and reserve for the excess 

table of contents long lived assets we evaluate long lived assets for impairment of their carrying value when events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
factors we consider in deciding when to perform an impairment review include significant negative industry or economic trends  significant changes or planned changes in our use of the assets  plant closure or production line discontinuance  technological obsolescence  or other changes in circumstances which indicate the carrying value of the assets may not be recoverable 
if such an event occurs  we evaluate whether the sum of the estimated undiscounted cash flows attributable to the assets in question is less than their carrying value 
if this is the case  we recognize an impairment loss to the extent that carrying value exceeds fair value 
fair value is determined based on market prices or discounted cash flow analysis  depending on the nature of the asset and the availability of market data 
any estimate of future cash flows is inherently uncertain 
the factors we take into consideration in making estimates of future cash flows include product life cycles  pricing trends  future capital needs  cost trends  product development costs  competitive factors and technology trends as they each affect cash inflows and outflows 
if an asset is written down to fair value  that value becomes the asset s new carrying value and is depreciated over the remaining useful life of the asset 
investments in privately held companies in previous years  we made a number of investments in small  privately held technology companies in which we held less than of the capital stock or held notes receivable 
we account for all of these investments at cost unless their value has been determined to be other than temporarily impaired  in which case we write the investment down to its impaired value 
we review these investments periodically for impairment and make appropriate reductions in carrying value when an other than temporary decline is evident  however  for non marketable equity securities  the impairment analysis requires significant judgment 
during our review  we evaluate the financial condition of the issuer  market conditions  and other factors providing an indication of the fair value of the investments 
adverse changes in market conditions or operating results of the issuer that differ from expectation  could result in additional other than temporary losses in future periods 
in addition  as a result of the sale of our former optoelectronics operations  we received as partial consideration million of preferred stock in cyoptics  inc cyoptics and an unsecured promissory note from cyoptics for million  that was discounted by million to reflect the current market rate for similar debt of comparable companies 
cyoptics paid million towards the promissory note in and million in on october   we participated in an additional bridge financing where we purchased million of a subordinated convertible promissory note from cyoptics which converted into preferred stock on july  in december  we received a letter of intent from millennium partners millennium and signed a definitive agreement to sell the preferred stock and debt to millennium for approximately million  inclusive of certain purchase adjustments 
on february   we received notice from millennium indicating that it no longer wished to pursue completion of the purchase of our preferred stock and that it believed it had the right to purchase the note for million 
we dispute millennium s interpretation of the agreement and do not believe this outcome to be probable 
we continue to pursue closure of the transaction in accordance with the agreement  however the ultimate outcome is uncertain 
based on the developments above  the review of cyoptics financial condition and operating results and other best available market information  we have written this investment down to million resulting in a non operating charge to earnings in of million 
during  a previously impaired investment was purchased by another company and our holdings in the investment were liquidated 
as a result  we recorded a recovery on the impairment of this investment of million 
no impairment was recorded in income taxes we are subject to taxation from federal  state and international jurisdictions in which we operate and account for income taxes using the asset and liability method 
a significant amount of management judgment is involved in preparing our annual provision for income taxes and the calculation of resulting deferred tax assets and liabilities 

table of contents our provision for income taxes as of and for the years ended december   and were as follows in millions years ended december  provision for income taxes the provision for income taxes for and primarily consisted of domestic and foreign tax liabilities in us and costa rica of million and million  respectively 
in january a million dividend was paid from the costa rican subsidiary 
of the million dividend  the majority was from previously taxed income and the remainder was taxable in no provision has been made for the u 
s  state or additional foreign income taxes related to approximately million of undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries which have been  or are  intended to be permanently reinvested 
it is not practicable to determine the us federal income tax liability  if any  which would be payable if such earnings were not permanently reinvested 
in the event the costa rican or german subsidiaries remit these earnings to the us parent  the earnings may be subject to us federal and state income taxes 
in  we determined that a valuation allowance should be recorded against all of our deferred tax assets based on the criteria of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
we record the valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that some portion  or all of the deferred tax assets may not be realized 
wj recorded  and we maintained  a valuation allowance against its deferred tax assets 
we consider future taxable income and prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in determining the need for a valuation allowance and evaluate the need for a valuation allowance on a regular basis 
at december   we determined that it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
in assessing the realizability of our deferred tax assets  we considered the four sources of taxable income 
because we have no carryback ability and have not identified any viable tax planning strategies  two of the sources are not available 
reversing taxable temporary differences have been properly considered as the deferred tax liabilities reverse in the same period as existing deferred tax assets 
however  reversing the deferred tax liabilities is insufficient to fully recover existing deferred tax assets 
therefore  future taxable income  the most subjective of the four sources  is the remaining source available for realization of our net deferred tax assets 
significant operating losses in  and prior years  modest earnings levels in recent years that are highly sensitive to changes in the business environment  instances of missed projections  the cyclical nature of our industry and the recent significant economic uncertainties in the market have been important in concluding that future taxable income would not be used as justification for the realization of deferred tax assets 
for example  in we recorded a pre tax loss that was below the original projected guidance 
subsequently  a number of events have made forecasting taxable income even more difficult 
the acquisition of wj  with a prior history of pre tax losses  created a risk that we would not be able to improve this performance or would fail to integrate it successfully into our operations 
the substantial slow down in the world economy has also heightened the risk of a material reduction in business levels 
our customers and competitors have noted similar uncertainties regarding the performance of our industry 
in addition  during the second and third quarters of  we added significant capacity and fixed costs to respond to growths in demand  adding more risk to taxable income should sales decline 
during the fourth quarter of  we completed the integration of wj into our operations 
we also completed our operating budget in the first quarter of completion of these two activities assisted our short term understanding of future profitability 
however  we are unable to predict the timing of improvements in the world economy which makes it difficult to accurately forecast taxable income 
these factors indicate continued need for a valuation allowance 
we adopted the provisions of fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes fin  on january  we recognized no adjustment in the liability for unrecognized tax benefits upon 
table of contents the adoption of fin the and unrecognized tax benefits totaled million and million including interest and penalty of million and million  respectively 
the amount of the unrecognized tax benefits  if recognized  that would result in a favorable impact on the effective tax rate is million 
the fin amounts are based upon significant management estimates 
stock based compensation on january  we adopted sfas no 
r  share based payment  and included stock based compensation costs in our financial statements 
we have elected to use the black scholes option valuation model to value our options and employee stock purchase plan issuances 
the table below summarizes the stock based compensation expense for  and  included in our consolidated statements of operations in millions year ended december  cost of goods sold stock based compensation expense included in cost of goods sold research  development and engineering selling  general and administrative stock based compensation expense included in operating expenses total stock based compensation expense included in income from operations acquisition of wj communications  inc on may   we completed the acquisition of wj communications  inc wj  rf semiconductor company that provides rf product solutions worldwide to communications equipment companies 
the acquisition will enable us to combine rf power  switching and filtering in cost effective module solutions for base station and other infrastructure applications 
we paid million in cash on the closing date  and paid million of direct acquisition costs for of the shares of wj 
we accounted for the wj acquisition as a purchase in accordance with sfas no 
 business combinations 
details of the purchase price are as follows in millions cash paid at closing acquisition costs total the total purchase price was allocated to wj s assets and liabilities based upon fair values as determined by us 
cash accounts receivables and other assets inventory property  plant and equipment intangible assets note in process research and development goodwill note payables and other liabilities total 
table of contents we recognized goodwill of million which represents payment in excess of the fair values of wj s assets and liabilities 
this acquisition provided a significant revenue stream and will enable us to combine rf power  switching and filtering in cost effective module solutions for base station and other infrastructure applications 
the acquisition leverages wj s radio frequency microwave design expertise with our technologies to expand our presence in the communications infrastructure market 
the acquisition completes our rf front end portfolio for cellular base stations  adds products which complement our current base station line up  and provides us with a silicon valley based design center 
the results of operations for the wj business are included in our consolidated statements of operations for the period from may  through december  the following unaudited pro forma consolidated information gives effect to the acquisition of wj as if it had occurred on january  and by consolidating the results of operations of wj with our results of operations for the twelve months ended december  and in millions  except per share information 
twelve months ended december  proforma results of operations unaudited revenue net income basic eps diluted eps the acquisition also resulted in the recognition of million of in process research and development costs which we have written off in operating expenses in the quarter ended june  in process research and development ipr d represented projects from the wj acquisition that had not reached technological feasibility and had no alternative future use when acquired but had been developed to a point where there was value associated with them in relation to potential future revenue 
using the income approach to value the ipr d  we determined that million of the purchase price represented purchased in process technology 
because technological feasibility was not yet proven and no alternative future uses were believed to exist for the in process technologies  the assigned value was expensed immediately into operating expenses upon the closing date of the acquisition 
the fair value underlying the million assigned to acquire ipr d from the wj acquisition was determined by identifying research projects in areas for which technological feasibility had not been established and there were no alternative future uses 
the acquired ipr d consisted of small  signal  and power products and was approximately complete as of december  this technology is being integrated into products some of which were completed in and the remainder is expected to be completed in there has been no material change in the estimated cost of these projects 
the fair value of ipr d was determined by an income approach where fair value is the present value of projected net free cash flows that will be generated by the products incorporating the acquired technologies under development  assuming they are successfully completed 
the estimated net free cash flows generated by the products over a year period was discounted by a rate of  which reflected the stage of completion and the technical risks associated with achieving technological feasibility 
other factors considered were the inherent uncertainties in future revenue estimates from technology investments  including the uncertainty surrounding the successful development of the ipr d  the useful life of the technology and the profitability levels of the technology 
the estimated net cash flows from these products were based on estimates of related revenues  cost of sales  r d costs  sg a costs  asset requirements and income taxes 
the stage of completion of the products at the date of the acquisition was estimated based on the tasks required to develop the technology into a commercially viable product and the costs remaining to completion 
the nature of the efforts to develop the in process technology into commercially viable products principally related to the completion of all planning  designing  prototyping  verification and testing activities that are necessary to establish that the product can be produced to meet its design specification  including function  features and technical performance requirements 

table of contents these estimates are subject to change  given the uncertainties of the development process  and no assurance is given that deviations from these estimates will not occur or that we will realize any anticipated benefits of the acquisition 
the risks associated with ipr d are considered high and no assurance is made that these products will generate any benefit or meet market expectations 
to the extent that estimated completion dates are not met  the risk of competitive product introduction is greater and revenue opportunity may be permanently lost 
in accordance with eitf recognition of liabilities in connection with a purchase business combination we committed to a restructuring plan to consolidate facilities in san jose and china and to reduce certain redundant positions in the wj operations as a result of the acquisition 
the consolidation of the facilities and the reduction of personnel are expected to be completed in the plan to consolidate facilities includes partial abandonment of the san jose facility and full abandonment of the china leases 
the china and san jose leases expire in and  respectively 
payments related to this restructuring are expected to be complete by the following table summarizes the charges taken as part of the restructuring plan in millions personnel lease abandonment costs total balance at may  payments accretion balance at december  we have estimated the fair value of the acquired identifiable intangible assets  which are subject to amortization  using the income approach 
the following table sets forth the components of these intangible assets and their estimated useful lives

revenues from our g products increased approximately  in compared to these products collectively accounted for of handset revenues in and the increases in g product revenues were offset by decreases in revenues from sales of our cdma and gsm gprs products of approximately and  respectively  in compared to the revenues from our cdma and gsm gprs products comprised approximately of total handset revenues in compared to of total handset revenues in networks revenues from the networks market products increased approximately in compared to primarily as a result of increases from sales of our wireless client products and transport products 
revenue from wireless client products such as wlan and broadband wireless access bwa products increased and  respectively  in compared to revenue from transport products such as cable and optical broadband products increases and  respectively  in  compared to revenues from our basestation products such as wcdma products increased in compared to these increases were partially offset by decreases in revenues from groundstation and gps products of and  respectively 

table of contents military revenues from our military related market products increased approximately in compared to as a percentage of our total revenues  military related products remained relatively flat at in both and the increase in revenue in compared to was primarily the result of a increase in radar products revenue 
the increases were partially offset by a decrease in revenues from non recurring engineering of approximately in compared to domestic and international revenues revenues from domestic customers were approximately million in  compared to approximately million in revenues from international customers were approximately million in  compared to approximately million in as a percentage of total revenues  revenues from international customers were of revenues in  compared to of revenues in revenues from international customers continued to grow as a result of the increasing demand for wireless handsets and infrastructure products in developing regions  where wireless subscriber penetration rates are significantly lower than penetration rates in the us and western europe 
gross profit our gross profit margin as a percentage of revenues increased to in  compared to in the gross profit margin in included an excess inventory charge of million for a single customer 
gross profit margin in increased by a small percentage due to higher efficiency and utilization rates offset by the unfavorable effect of elevated precious metals prices 
research  development and engineering expenses our research  development and engineering expenses in increased million  or  to million  from million in research  development and engineering expenses increased primarily as a result of an increase in labor costs as a result of increased headcount  the acquisition of wj communications and purchases of technical supplies 
as a percentage of total revenues  research  development and engineering expenses were of revenues in and of revenues in selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses in increased million  or  to million from million in our selling  general and administrative expenses increased in primarily a result of the acquisition of wj communications  increased commissions  labor costs  and insurance costs 
as a percentage of revenues  selling  general and administrative expenses were in and in impairment of goodwill in  we recorded a million goodwill impairment charge 
during our annual impairment test  because we are one reporting unit  we determined that the trading price of our stock  adjusted for a control premium which is the implied fair value  was lower than the book value 
we then performed a goodwill impairment test by comparing the implied fair value of our goodwill to the carrying amount similar to a purchase price allocation 
the carrying value of the goodwill exceeded the implied fair value and we recorded an impairment charge for the entire balance of goodwill 
no goodwill impairment charges were incurred in in process research and development in process research and development costs totaling million and million in and  respectively  resulted from the acquisition of peak devices  inc  which was completed on august  and from the acquisition of wj communications  which was completed on may  
table of contents gain on disposal of equipment gains and losses on disposals of equipment are recorded based upon the disposal price  less the book value of the equipment 
we recorded a gain of million and a loss of million on the disposal of equipment in and  respectively 
impairment of investment in  we recorded a million investment impairment charge related to our investment in cyoptics offset by a million recovery in a previously impaired investment 
no investment impairment charges were incurred in interest income  net interest income  net decreased million in to million  compared to interest income  net of million in the decrease was primarily a result of a decrease in interest income of million as a result of lower interest rates and cash balances 
income tax expense in  we recorded income tax expense of million  compared to income tax expense of million in the increase was a result of an increased amount of taxes paid in costa rica 
years ended december  and our revenues increased million or to million in  compared to million in all of our markets grew although the most significant increase came in our handset markets due to growth in revenues of transmit modules 
our revenues by end market for and are detailed below year ended december  revenues handsets networks military handsets our revenues from products for the handset market increased approximately in  compared to the growth was from increases in revenues from all wireless air interface standards  which we believe reflects an increase in our market share 
our gsm gprs products had the largest revenue dollar increase in as compared to  increasing  while we began to see revenue from our wlan products of million in our wcdma edge products also had strong gains during  as revenues increased as compared to as a percentage of our overall handset revenues in  our gsm gprs revenues continued to be the largest contributor  accounting for of our revenues  as compared to in cdma revenues accounted for of our revenues in  down from in the largest revenue drivers across all standard products for the handset market were our transmit and power amplifier modules  which experienced revenue increases of approximately and  respectively  in 
table of contents as compared to revenues for these products increased as manufacturers sought more integration in the products they purchased 
overall  transmit and power amplifier modules accounted for nearly of our handset revenue in due to our strategic product transition from discrete components to integrated passive and active modules we were able to increase average selling prices by approximately in as compared to networks revenues from the networks products increased approximately in as compared to this increase was primarily due to increases in revenues from wlan  point to point radios  and gps products 
these increases were partially offset by decreased revenues for our gsm gprs  wcdma  and cdma x products 
revenues from wlan products increased approximately in as compared to as a percentage of total network revenues  wlan products represented approximately for compared to approximately for military revenues from our military related products increased approximately in as compared to this increase was primarily due to increases in revenues from our satellite products  which increased over in as compared to as a percentage of our total revenues  military related products decreased to in  from in however  we believe our darpa and office of naval research and future government contracts will help drive our investment in research and development for fundamental technology leadership 
domestic and international revenues revenues from domestic customers were million in compared to million in revenues from international customers were million in compared to million in our revenues from international customers continued to grow due to the increasing demand for wireless phones and infrastructure products from asia  india and other developing countries where wireless subscriber penetration rates are significantly lower than penetration rates in the us revenues from sales to end user customers in china and korea represented greater than or more of total revenues in  and totaled approximately million and million  respectively 
in  sales to end user customers in china and korea represented or more of revenues and totaled approximately million and million  respectively 
gross profit gross profit is defined as revenue less cost of goods sold 
cost of goods sold includes direct material  labor  stock based compensation  and overhead expenses and certain production costs related to non recurring engineering revenues 
in general  we derive a higher gross profit margin on lower volume products for the networks and military markets  such as point to point radios and satellite systems  whereas our handsets products are typically higher volume  more price sensitive and generally have lower margins 
in  our gross profit margin as a percentage of revenues was as compared to in the increase in gross margin in was primarily the result of improved capacity utilization and shorter lead times  which produced a higher absorption of fixed overhead costs 
research  development and engineering expenses research  development and engineering expenses include the costs incurred in the design of new products  as well as ongoing product research and development expenses 
our research  development and engineering 
table of contents expenses in increased million or  to million  as compared to million in the increase was due to increases in material and supplies  outside services and compensation expense 
as a percentage of revenues our research  development and engineering expenses in were  compared to in selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses include commissions  labor expenses for sales  marketing and administrative personnel  and other corporate administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased million or in to million  as compared to million in our selling  general and administrative expenses increased primarily due to increased sales commissions as a result of our increased revenues  as well as increased marketing expenses  labor costs  and depreciation 
as a percentage of revenues our selling  general and administrative expenses in decreased to of revenues from in in process research and development in process research and development costs of million resulted from the acquisition of peak devices  which was completed on august  no similar charges were incurred in gain on disposal of equipment gains and losses are recorded based upon the disposal price  less the book value of the equipment 
we recorded a loss of million and a gain of million on the disposal of equipment in and  respectively from the sale of equipment at our oregon facility 
acquisition related charges in  we recorded million of charges related to the anticipated tfr earn out payment and retention bonuses  payable in no charges were incurred in interest income expense  net interest income expense  net increased million in to million  compared to interest income expense  net of million in the increase is primarily attributable to the pay off of our convertible subordinated notes in the first quarter of  which have historically accounted for the majority of our interest expense 
while we utilized a large portion of our cash reserves to retire million of subordinated notes  we expect a reduced periodic interest expense which will positively impact our net interest income going forward 
recovery of impairment investment in other companies in  a previously impaired investment was purchased by another company and our holding in the investment was liquidated 
as a result  we recorded a recovery on the impairment of the investment of million 
no impairment or recovery charge was recorded in income tax expense in  we recorded income tax expense of million as compared to income tax expense of million in the and tax expense was primarily due to income taxes  penalties and interest from our us and costa rica operations 
liquidity and capital resources as of december   our cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities decreased million  or  to million  from million as of december  this decrease in cash  cash equivalents
