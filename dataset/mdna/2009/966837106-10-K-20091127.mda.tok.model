we have one operating segment  natural and organic foods supermarkets 
our results of operations have been and may continue to be materially affected by the timing and number of new store openings 
stores typically open within months after entering the store development pipeline 
new stores generally become profitable during their first year of operation  although some new stores may incur operating losses for the first several years of operation 
the company historically has experienced lower average weekly sales in the fourth quarter  which typically results in lower gross profit and higher direct store expenses as a percentage of sales 
sales of a store are deemed to be comparable commencing in the fifty third full week after the store was opened or acquired 
stores acquired in purchase acquisitions entered the comparable store sales base effective the fifty third full week following the date of the merger 
identical store sales exclude sales from relocated stores and remodeled stores with expansions of square footage greater than from the comparable calculation to reduce the impact of square footage growth on the comparison 
stores closed for eight or more days are excluded from the comparable and identical store base from the first fiscal week of closure until re opened for a full fiscal week

economic and industry factors food retailing is a large  intensely competitive industry 
our competition varies across the company and includes but is not limited to local  regional  national and international conventional and specialty supermarkets  natural foods stores  warehouse membership clubs  smaller specialty stores  farmers markets  and restaurants  each of which competes with us on the basis of product selection  quality  customer service  price or a combination of these factors 
while growth has slowed from historical levels  natural and organic food is still one of the fastest growing segments of food retailing today 
whole foods market experienced a challenging retail environment beginning in the second half of fiscal year and continuing in fiscal year caused primarily by the general economic environment in the united states and decreased consumer confidence 
the company experienced negative comparable and identical store sales for the fiscal year for the first 
table of contents time in the company s history 
however  in the fourth quarter of fiscal year  our comparable store and identical store sales trends improved for the second quarter in a row and  after five quarters of year over year declines  during the first quarter of fiscal year through november   comparable store and identical store sales were up and  respectively 
food cost inflation  which we began to experience at increasing levels in fiscal year  began to moderate in the fourth quarter of fiscal year  likely having a negative impact on our sales  basket size and price per item 
outlook for fiscal year the company is pleased with its sales trends for the first quarter of fiscal year through november   however  increased price investments could negatively impact our sales going forward  and with no anticipated positive change in the economy over the short term  the company believes it is reasonable to expect sales results for the fiscal year in line with or slightly better than these quarter to date results 
for the fiscal year  the company expects sales growth of to  comparable store sales growth of to  and identical store sales growth of to 
the company expects to open new stores  of which are planned to open in the first half of the fiscal year
