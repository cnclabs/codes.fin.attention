item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
overview the company is a worldwide leader in the manufacturing and distribution of a wide range of display devices  encompassing  among others  entertainment  military  medical and simulation display solutions 
the company is comprised of two segments the manufacturing and distribution of displays and display components display segment and the wholesale distribution of consumer electronic parts from foreign and domestic manufacturers wholesale distribution segment 
the display segment is organized into four interrelated operations aggregated into one reportable segment pursuant to the aggregation criteria of financial accounting standards board statement sfas no 
 disclosures about segments of an enterprise and related information 
monitor offers a wide range of crt  flat panel and projection display systems for use in training and simulation  military  medical  and industrial applications 
data display crts offers a wide range of crts for use in data display screens  including computer terminal monitors and medical monitoring equipment 
entertainment crts offers a wide range of crts and projection tubes for television and home theater equipment 
component parts provides replacement electron guns and other components for crts primarily for servicing the company s internal needs 
during fiscal  management of the company focused key resources on strategic efforts to improve the profitability of operations while seeking acquisition opportunities that enhance the profitability and sales growth of the company s more profitable product lines 
in addition  the company continues to seek new products through acquisitions and internal development that complement existing profitable product lines 
challenges facing the company during these efforts include inventory management the company continually monitors historical sales trends as well as projected needs to ensure adequate on hand supplies of inventory and to ensure against overstocking of slower moving  obsolete items 
certain of the company s divisions maintain significant inventories of crts and component parts in an effort to ensure its customers a reliable source of supply 
the company s inventory turnover averages over days  although in many cases the company would anticipate holding to days of inventory in the normal course of operations 
this level of inventory is higher than some of the company s competitors because it sells a number of products representing older  or trailing edge  technology that may not be available from other sources 
the market for these trailing edge technology products is declining and  as manufacturers for these products discontinue production or exit the business  the company may make last time buys 
in the monitor operations of the company s business  the market for its products is characterized by fairly rapid change as a result of the development of new technologies  particularly in the flat panel display area 
if the company fails to anticipate the changing needs of its customers or accurately forecast their requirements  it may accumulate inventories of products which its customers no longer need and which the company will be unable to sell or return to its vendors 
the company s management monitors the adequacy of its inventory reserves regularly  and at february   believes its reserves to be adequate 
interest rate exposure the company had outstanding debt of approximately million as of february   which is subject to interest rate fluctuations by the company s lenders 
variable interest rates on the company s loans and the potential for rate hikes could negatively affect the company s future earnings 
it is the intent of the company to continually monitor interest rates and consider converting portions of the company s debt from floating rates to fixed rates should conditions be favorable for such interest rate swaps or hedges

table of contents fiscal compared to fiscal net sales consolidated net sales decreased million or to million for fiscal  compared to million for fiscal display segment sales decreased or million to million for fiscal  compared to million for fiscal wholesale distribution segment sales decreased or million from million for fiscal to million for fiscal the net decrease in display segment sales for fiscal is attributed to a general weakening in the market  a down cycle in the fulfillment of long term contracts and the closing of the uk facility 
the monitor revenues declined million primarily due to the reduced demand for new flight training systems for commercial and military flight training 
data display crt sales in fiscal declined due to the transition of the uk business to the data display crts division in the us and the general slowing of the us economy in the company s third and fourth quarters 
entertainment crt net sales declined million in fiscal compared to fiscal a significant portion of the entertainment division s sales are to major television retailers as replacements for products sold under manufacturer and extended warranties 
due to continued lower retail sales prices for mid size television sets  fewer extended warranties were sold by retailers  a trend consistent with recent prior fiscal years 
the company remains the primary supplier of product to meet manufacturers standard warranties 
future sales trends in this division will be negatively impacted by the decreasing number of extended warranties sold for larger  more expensive sets 
because the company is in the replacement market  it has the ability to track retail sales trends and  accordingly  can attempt to adjust quantities of certain size crts carried in stock and reduce exposure to obsolescence 
components parts sales decreased million from fiscal to fiscal component parts sales have generally declined in recent years due to weaker demand for electron gun and stem sales 
component parts sales have historically been dependent upon the demand by domestic and foreign television crt remanufacturers 
these sales have declined over the past few years as consumers move towards purchasing new technology as opposed to repairing existing sets 
the division primarily supplies the other divisions with parts they need to complete the assembly of their products 
wholesale distribution segment net sales decline is attributed to a decline in the overall economy  particularly the consumer market 
the call center s sales declined about million due to less calls taken and therefore less billable time 
the call center acts as a consumer and dealer support center for in warranty and out of warranty household products  appliances  parts and accessories for black decker  delonghi  norelco  coby and various other manufacturers 
this call center also acts as a technical support center for these same manufacturers 
the remainder of the decline was in the segment s dealer base which suffered due to reduced consumer demand 
gross margins consolidated gross margins increased to for fiscal from for fiscal display segment margins increased to for fiscal from for fiscal gross margins within the monitor operation increased to for fiscal compared to for fiscal this increase is primarily attributable to decreased costs on several contracts in fiscal at the aydin division and the increases generated at the z axis division form both internal growth and acquisitions

gross margins in entertainment crts decreased to for fiscal from for fiscal due to the decrease in sales volume of high margin products at the company s louisiana facility and the decreased production at the chroma division 
gross margins from component parts increased to for fiscal from for fiscal for its customers outside the company  primarily reflecting the specialization of its products 

table of contents the wholesale distribution segment gross margins increased to for fiscal from for fiscal  primarily due to customer and product mix 
lower sales volumes translate into fewer price breaks for high volume dealers 
operating expenses operating expenses as a percentage of sales increased to for fiscal from for fiscal primarily reflecting increases in research and development  legal fees  professional services and bad debts 
display segment operating expenses increased million or to million for fiscal compared to million in fiscal this increase is primarily due to the expenses mentioned above as all those expenses occurred in the display segment of the business 
wholesale distribution segment operating expenses decreased million or to million for fiscal compared to million in fiscal  primarily due to a decrease in salaries 
these expenses primarily payroll are classified in general and administrative expense in the consolidated financial statements 
interest expense interest expense decreased million or to million for fiscal compared to million in fiscal the company maintains various debt agreements with different interest rates  most of which are based on the prime rate or libor 
these decreases in interest expense primarily reflect lower market interest rates in effect during fiscal compared to fiscal income taxes the effective tax rate for fiscal was compared to for fiscal the lower effective rate in was primarily due to research and experimentation credits and various other permanent items 
foreign currency translation gains or losses resulting from the transactions with the company s uk subsidiary are reported in current operations while currency translation adjustments are recognized in a separate component of shareholders equity 
there were no significant gains or losses recognized in either period related to the uk subsidiary

critical accounting policies management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon the company s consolidated financial statements 
these consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
these principles require the use of estimates and assumptions that affect amounts reported and disclosed in the consolidated financial statements and related notes 
the accounting policies that may involve a higher degree of judgments  estimates  and complexity include reserves on inventories  the allowance for bad debts  contract revenue recognition as well as profitability or loss recognition estimates and warranty reserves 
the company uses the following methods and assumptions in determining its estimates reserves on inventories reserves on inventories result in a charge to operations when the estimated net realizable value declines below cost 
management regularly reviews the company s investment in inventories for declines in value and establishes reserves when it is apparent that the expected net realizable value of the inventory falls below its carrying amount 
management attempts to determine by historical usage analysis and interchangeability of crt types along with repair contracts currently maintained by its customers  as well as numerous other market factors  the projected demand for crts in this estimate of net realizable value 
management is able to identify consumer buying trends  such as size and application  well in advance of supplying replacement crts 
thus  the company is able to adjust inventory stocking levels according to the projected demand 
the average life of a crt is five to seven years  at which time the company s replacement market develops 
management reviews inventory levels on a quarterly basis 
such reviews include observations of product development trends of the oem s  new products being marketed and technological advances relative to the product capabilities of the company s existing inventories 
there have been no significant changes in management s estimates in fiscal and  however  the company cannot guarantee the accuracy of future forecasts since these estimates are subject to change based on market conditions 
during fiscal and fiscal  the company deducted inventory against the reserve for obsolescence in the amount of million and million respectively 
the reserve for inventory 
table of contents obsolescence was approximately million and million at february  and february   respectively 
during fiscal  the company wrote down inventories of million to market which had previously been reserved and disposed of million of inventory at its aydin subsidiary which had previously been reserved 
revenue and profit or loss recognition revenues are recognized when there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement  delivery has occurred  the price has been fixed or is determinable and collect ability can be reasonably assured 
the company s delivery term typically is fob shipping point 
in accordance with emerging issues task force eitf issue  accounting for shipping and handling fees and costs shipping and handling fees billed to customers are classified in net sales in the consolidated statements of operations 
shipping and handling costs incurred for the delivery of product to customers are classified in selling and delivery in the consolidated statements of operations 
a portion of the company s revenue is derived from contracts to manufacture crts to a buyer s specification 
these contracts are accounted for under the provisions of the american institute of certified public accountants statement of position no 
 accounting for performance of construction type and certain production type contracts 
these contracts are fixed price and cost plus contracts and are recorded on the percentage of completion basis using the ratio of costs incurred to estimated total costs at completion as the measurement basis for progress toward completion and revenue recognition 
any losses identified on contracts are recognized immediately 
contract accounting requires significant judgment relative to assessing risks  estimating contract costs and making related assumptions for schedule and technical issues 
with respect to contract change orders  claims  or similar items  judgment must be used in estimating related amounts and assessing the potential for realization 
these amounts are only included in contract value when they can be reliably estimated and realization is probable 
the wholesale distribution segment has several distribution agreements that it accounts for using the gross revenue basis and one agreement which uses the net revenue basis as prescribed by eitf reporting revenue gross as a principal versus net as an agent 
the company uses the gross method because the company has general inventory risk  physical loss inventory risk and credit risk on the majority of its agreements but uses the net method on the one agreement because it does not have those same risks for that agreement 
the call center service revenue is recognized based on written pricing agreements with each manufacturer  on a per call  per email  or per standard mail basis 
allowance for bad debts the allowance for bad debts is determined by reviewing all accounts receivable and applying historical credit loss experience to the current receivable portfolio with consideration given to the current condition of the economy  assessment of the financial position of the creditors as well as payment history and overall trends in past due accounts compared to established thresholds 
the company monitors credit exposure and assesses the adequacy of the allowance for bad debts on a regular basis 
historically  the company s allowance has been sufficient for any customer write offs 
although the company cannot guarantee future results  management believes its policies and procedures relating to customer exposure are adequate 

table of contents warranty reserves the warranty reserve is determined by recording a specific reserve for known warranty issues and a reserve based on claims experience 
the company considers actual warranty claims compared to net sales  then adjusts its reserve liability accordingly 
actual claims incurred could differ from the original estimates  requiring adjustments to the reserve 
management feels that historically its procedures have been adequate and does not anticipate that its assumptions are reasonably likely to change in the future 
other loss contingencies other loss contingencies are recorded as liabilities when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can reasonably be estimated 
disclosure is required when there is a reasonable possibility that the ultimate loss will exceed the recorded provision 
contingent liabilities are often resolved over long time periods 
estimating probable losses requires analysis of multiple factors that often depend on judgments about potential actions by third parties 
reclassified revenues in the current year  the company classified certain revenues previously reported on a gross basis to the net basis in the statement of operations 
for comparative purposes  amounts in the prior years have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation 
these reclassifications had no effect on previously reported results of operations or retained earnings

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company s primary market risks include fluctuations in interest rates and variability in interest rate spread relationships  such as prime to libor spreads 
approximately million of outstanding debt at february  related to long term indebtedness under variable rate debt 
interest 
table of contents on the outstanding balance of this debt will be charged based on a variable rate related to the prime rate or the libor rate 
both rate bases are incremented for margins specified in their agreements 
thus  the company s interest rate is subject to market risk in the form of fluctuations in interest rates 
the effect of a hypothetical one percentage point increase across all maturities of variable rate debt would result in a increase of approximately  in pre tax loss assuming no further changes in the amount of borrowings subject to variable rate interest from amounts outstanding at february  the company has a new financing agreement pending with rbc bank which will increase the interest rate one and a half percentage points 
the company does not trade in derivative financial instruments
