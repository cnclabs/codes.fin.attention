in addition  we operated stores under the western auto and advance auto parts trade names  located outside the united states  or offshore 
aap stores store overview 
our stores generally are located in freestanding buildings in areas with high vehicle traffic counts  good visibility and easy access to major roadways 
we believe that our stores exhibit a customer friendly format with the majority of our stores featuring an updated exterior and interior  bright lighting  and a well designed and easily navigated floor plan 
the average size of our stores is  square feet with the size of our typical new stores approximating  to  square feet 
our stores generally are open from am to pm six days a week and pm to pm on sundays and most holidays to meet the needs of our diy and commercial customers 
we offer extended hours in a limited number of our stores  including hours per day in certain stores 
our stores carry a standard product offering of approximately  stock keeping units  or skus 
certain stores carry slightly more skus within centralized market locations where there is demand for a more customized assortment of merchandise 
additionally  some of our stores carry an additional customized assortment of  skus for same day or next day delivery to other select stores within the respective service area 
the standard sku offering within each of our stores is replenished from one of our eight distribution centers once per week on average 
we also utilize a network of parts delivered quickly  or pdq  facilities and one master pdq facility to ensure our stores have the right product at the right time for our customers needs 
our pdq and master pdq network of facilities provide our customers with an additional assortment of approximately  less common skus on a same day or overnight basis 
lastly  our customers have access to over  skus by ordering directly from one of our vendors for delivery to a particular store or other destination as chosen by the customer 
store team members utilize our proprietary point of sale  or pos  system  including a fully integrated electronic parts catalog to identify and suggest the appropriate quality and price options for the skus we carry  as well as the related products  tools or additional information that is required by our customers to complete their automotive repair projects properly and safely 
we strive to be the leader in the automotive aftermarket industry in serving our customers by providing quality products at the right price and backed by a solid warranty and outstanding customer service

district managers report to the regional vice presidents and have direct responsibility for store operations in a specific district  which typically consists on average of stores 
depending on store size and sales volume  each store is staffed by to team members under the leadership of a general manager 
we offer training to our employees  who we refer to as team members 
team member training includes formal classroom workshops  online seminars and certification by the national institute for automotive service excellence  or ase  which is broadly recognized for training certification in the automotive industry 
we also continue to increase the number of bilingual team members in our stores to better serve an increasingly diverse customer base 
commercial sales 
our commercial sales consist of sales to both our walk in and delivery commercial customers  which represented approximately of our aap sales in fiscal since  we have aggressively expanded our sales to commercial customers through our commercial delivery program 
for delivered sales  we utilize our commercial delivery fleet to deliver product from our store locations to our commercial customers place of business  including independent garages  service stations and auto dealers 
our stores are supported by a commercial sales team who are dedicated to the development of our commercial customers  which include national and regional accounts 
under our commercial acceleration strategy  we are focused on increasing our commercial sales at a faster pace in light of the favorable market dynamics 
the commercial team is led by a senior vice president who is building a sales force whose sole focus is on the commercial customer 
initiatives include the addition of key product brands in our stores that are well recognized by our commercial customers  as well as increasing the parts knowledge of our store team members 
we believe these initiatives will enable us to gain more commercial customers as well as increase our sales from existing customers who will use us as their first call supplier 
at january   we had  aap stores  or of total aap stores  with commercial delivery programs  which was up slightly from at december  store development 
our store development program has historically focused on adding new stores within existing markets  remodeling or relocating existing stores and entering new markets 
the addition of new stores  along with strategic acquisitions  has played a significant role in our growth and success 
we believe the opening of new stores  and their strategic location in relation to our diy and commercial customers  will continue to play a significant role in our future growth and success 
additionally  we will continue to monitor existing stores based on cash flow  market importance and occupancy cost rates 
our  aap stores were located in the following states and territories at january  number of number of number of location stores location stores location stores alabama maryland oklahoma arkansas massachusetts pennsylvania colorado michigan puerto rico connecticut minnesota rhode island delaware mississippi south carolina florida missouri south dakota georgia nebraska tennessee illinois new hampshire texas iowa new mexico vermont indiana new jersey virgin islands kansas new york virginia kentucky north carolina west virginia louisiana north dakota wisconsin maine ohio wyoming the following table sets forth information concerning increases in the total number of our aap stores during the past five years beginning stores new stores stores closed ending stores does not include stores that opened as relocations of previously existing stores within the same general market area or substantial renovations of stores 
includes and stores not operating at december  and december   respectively  primarily due to hurricane damage 
store technology 
our store based information systems  which are designed to improve the efficiency of our operations and enhance customer service  are comprised of a proprietary pos system and electronic parts catalog  or epc  system 
information maintained by our pos system is used to formulate pricing  marketing and merchandising strategies and to replenish inventory accurately and rapidly 
our pos system is fully integrated with our epc system and enables our store team members to assist our customers in their parts selection and ordering based on year  make  model and engine type of their vehicles 
our centrally based epc data management system enables us to reduce the time needed to i exchange data with our vendors and ii catalog and deliver updated  accurate parts information 
our epc system also contains enhanced search engines and user friendly navigation tools that enhance our team members ability to look up any needed parts as well as additional products the customer needs to complete their automotive repair project 
if a hard to find part or accessory is not available at one of our stores  the epc system can determine whether the part is carried and in stock through our pdq system 
available parts and accessories are then ordered electronically from another store  pdq or master pdq with immediate confirmation of price  availability and estimated delivery time 
we also support our store operations with additional proprietary systems 
our store level inventory management system provides real time inventory tracking at the store level 
with the store level system  store team members can check the quantity of on hand inventory for any sku  adjust stock levels for select items for store specific events  automatically process returns and defective merchandise  designate skus for cycle counts and track merchandise transfers 
our stores use radio frequency hand held devices to help ensure the accuracy of our inventory 
our standard operating procedure  or sop  system is a web based  electronic data management system that provides our team members with instant and quick access to any of our standard operating procedures through a comprehensive on line search function 
additionally  we utilize a labor scheduling system known as management planning and training  or mpt 
all of these systems are tightly integrated and provide real time  comprehensive information to store personnel  resulting in improved customer service levels  team member productivity and in stock availability 
store support center merchandising 
purchasing for virtually all of the merchandise for our stores is handled by our merchandise teams located in our store support center in roanoke  virginia and in our regional office in minneapolis  minnesota 
in fiscal  we purchased merchandise from over vendors  with no single vendor accounting for more than of purchases 
our purchasing strategy involves negotiating agreements with certain vendors to purchase merchandise over a specified period of time along with other terms  including pricing  payment terms and volume 
our merchandising team is skilled in sourcing high quality products globally and maintaining consistent inventory levels 
the merchandising team has developed strong vendor relationships in the industry and  in a collaborative effort with our vendor partners  utilizes a category management process 
we believe this process  which develops a customer focused business plan for each merchandise category  has been highly effective and is critical to improving comparable store sales  gross margin and inventory turns 
our merchandising strategy is to carry a broad selection of high quality brand name automotive parts and accessories such as bosch  castrol  sylvania  prestone  monroe  wagner  purolator  dayco  trico and federal mogul moog  or moog  which generates diy customer traffic and also appeals to commercial customers 
in addition to these branded products  we stock a wide selection of high quality proprietary products that appeal to value conscious customers 
these lines of merchandise include everything from chemical and wash and wax products to tools  batteries  parts and interior automotive accessories under various private label names 
supply chain 
our supply chain consists of centralized inventory management and transportation functions which support a logistics network of distribution centers  pdq warehouses and stores 
our inventory management team utilizes a replenishment system to monitor the distribution center  pdq warehouse and store inventory levels and orders additional product when appropriate while streamlining handling costs 
our replenishment system utilizes the most up to date information from our pos system as well as inventory movement forecasting based upon sales history  sales trends by sku  seasonality and demographic shifts in demand 
our replenishment system combines these factors with service level goals  vendor lead times and cost of inventory assumptions to determine the timing and size of purchase orders 
a significant portion of our purchase orders are sent via electronic data interchange  with the remainder being sent by computer generated e mail or facsimile 
our transportation team utilizes a transportation management system to efficiently manage incoming shipments to our distribution centers and stores 
benefits from this system include i reduced vendor to distribution center freight costs  ii visibility of purchase orders and shipments for the entire supply chain  iii a reduction in distribution center inventory  or safety stock  due to consistent transit times  iv decreased third party freight and billing service costs  v decreased distribution center to store freight costs and vi higher store in stock position 
we recently announced our plan to outsource our private fleet operations to two reputable dedicated carriers 
we believe outsourcing our private fleet operations will allow us to focus resources on achieving our key strategies  improve our ability to manage transportation as we continue to grow and reduce costs 
we currently operate eight distribution centers 
all of these distribution centers are equipped with our distribution center management system  or dcms 
our dcms provides real time inventory tracking through the processes of receiving  picking  shipping and replenishing inventory at our distribution centers 
the dcms  integrated with technologically advanced material handling equipment  significantly reduces warehouse and distribution costs  while improving efficiency 
this equipment includes carousels  pick to light systems  radio frequency technology  voice technology and automated sorting systems 
through the continued implementation of our supply chain initiatives we expect to further increase the efficient utilization of our distribution capacity 
we believe our current capacity will allow us to support in excess of  aap stores 
we plan to open a new distribution center in indiana in we currently offer approximately  skus to support all of our retail stores via our stand alone pdq warehouses and or our eight distribution centers all of which stock pdq items 
stores have system visibility to inventory in their respective pdq warehouses and distribution centers and can place orders to these facilities  or as an alternative  through an online ordering system to virtually any of the other facilities 
ordered parts are delivered to substantially all stores on a same day or next day basis through our dedicated pdq trucking fleet and third party carriers 
store inventories are replenished from our eight distribution centers 
in addition  we operate a master pdq warehouse that stocks approximately  incremental skus of harder to find automotive parts and accessories and utilizes our existing pdq distribution infrastructure and or third party arrangements to provide next day service to substantially all of our stores 
marketing advertising 
we have an extensive marketing and advertising program designed to communicate our ability to meet consumers needs through our merchandise offerings  parts assortment and availability  competitive prices  free services and commitment to customer service 
our marketing and advertising program is focused on establishing advance auto parts as the primary resource for a customer s automotive needs 
we reinforce our brand image through a mix of media that includes television  radio  promotional signage  outdoor media  print and our internet site 
our marketing and advertising plan is a brand building program primarily built around television and radio advertising 
the plan is supported by in store signage  online advertising and print 
our television advertising is a combination of national and regional media in both sports and entertainment programming 
radio advertising generally airs during peak drive times 
we use spanish language radio and television advertising to market to our hispanic customers 
our advertising program is also supported through sponsorships of sporting events  racing teams and other grass root level events intended to positively impact individual communities  including hispanic and other ethnic communities  to create awareness and drive traffic for our stores 
since  we have used an integrated consumer education program to build our image as not only the best source for parts  but also the best resource for vehicle information 
our goal with our consumer education initiative is to continue our long term brand building success  increase customer loyalty and expand our customer base 
in february  we launched a new branding campaign  keep the wheels turning 
this campaign was developed based on a strategic review of our business as well as extensive research conducted with our customers and team members 
we believe this campaign  which targets core diy and commercial customers  is differentiating advance auto parts in our industry by positioning us as i the brand that best understands customers needs  ii the source for brand name parts and products and iii the resource for expert advice and knowledge to help customers keep their vehicles running 
the campaign includes creative and compelling television and radio commercials designed to drive sales and build an enduring  positive image of advance auto parts with our targeted customers 
ai segment we acquired ai in september the acquisition included stores throughout new england and new york  a distribution center and ai s wholesale distribution business 
ai complements our growing presence in the commercial market in the northeast 
ai s business primarily serves the commercial market  with an emphasis on import parts  from its store locations 
in addition  its north american sales division serves warehouse distributors and jobbers throughout north america 
we believe ai provides a high level of service to its commercial customers by providing quality parts  unsurpassed customer service and efficient parts delivery 
as a result of its extensive sourcing network  ai is able to serve its customers in search of replacement parts for both domestic and imported cars and light trucks with a greater focus on imported parts 
the vast majority of ai s product is sold under its own proprietary brand 
the ai stores offer approximately  skus with access to an additional  unique skus through its logistics network 
at january   we operated stores under the autopart international trade name in the following states throughout the northeast number of number of number of location stores location stores location stores connecticut new hampshire pennsylvania delaware new jersey rhode island maine new york vermont massachusetts the following table sets forth information concerning increases in the total number of our ai stores beginning stores new stores stores closed ending stores of the new stores in  stores were acquired in september as a result of our ai acquisition 
seasonality our business is somewhat seasonal in nature  with the highest sales occurring in the spring and summer months 
in addition  our business can be affected by weather conditions 
while unusually heavy precipitation tends to soften sales as elective maintenance is deferred during such periods  extremely hot or cold weather tends to enhance sales by causing automotive parts to fail at an accelerated rate 
team members at march   we employed  full time team members and  part time team members 
our workforce consisted of of our team members employed in store level operations  employed in distribution and employed in our corporate offices 
we have never experienced any labor disruption and are not party to any collective bargaining agreements 
we believe that our team member relations are good 
intellectual property we own a number of trade names and own and have federally registered several service marks and trademarks  including advance auto parts  western auto  parts america  autopart international and pdq for use in connection with the automotive parts retailing business 
in addition  we own and have registered a number of trademarks for our proprietary products 
we believe that these trade names  service marks and trademarks are important to our merchandising strategy 
we do not know of any infringing uses that would materially affect the use of these trade names and marks  and we actively defend and enforce them 
competition we operate in both the diy and commercial markets of the automotive aftermarket industry 
our primary competitors are i both national and regional retail chains of automotive parts stores  including autozone  inc  o reilly automotive  inc 
and the pep boys manny  moe jack  ii discount stores and mass merchandisers that carry automotive products  iii wholesalers or jobber stores  including those associated with national parts distributors or associations  such as napa and carquest  iv independent operators and v automobile dealers that supply parts 
we believe that chains of automotive parts stores that  like us  have multiple locations in one or more markets  have competitive advantages in customer service  marketing  inventory selection  purchasing and distribution as compared to independent retailers and jobbers that are not part of a chain or associated with other retailers or jobbers 
the principal methods of competition in our business include store location  product offerings  availability  quality  price and customer service 
environmental matters we are subject to various federal  state and local laws and governmental regulations relating to the operation of our business  including those governing recycling of automotive lead acid batteries and used automotive oil  and ownership and operation of real property 
we sell consumer products containing hazardous materials as part of our business 
in addition  our customers may bring automotive lead acid batteries or used automotive oil onto our properties 
we currently provide collection and recycling programs for used lead acid batteries and used oil at all of our stores as a service to our customers 
pursuant to agreements with third party vendors  lead acid batteries and used oil are collected by our team members  deposited onto pallets or into vendor supplied containers and stored by us until collected by the third party vendors for recycling or proper disposal 
the terms of our contracts with third party vendors provide that they are in compliance with all applicable laws and regulations 
persons who arrange for the removal  disposal  treatment or other handling of hazardous or toxic substances may be liable for the costs of removal or remediation at any affected disposal  treatment or other site affected by such substances 
based on our experience  we do not believe that there are any material environmental costs associated with the current business practice of accepting lead acid batteries and used oil as these costs are borne by the respective third parties 
we own and lease real property 
under various environmental laws and regulations  a current or previous owner or operator of real property may be liable for the cost of removal or remediation of hazardous or toxic substances on  under or in such property 
these laws often impose joint and several liability and may be imposed without regard to whether the owner or operator knew of  or was responsible for  the release of such hazardous or toxic substances 
other environmental laws and common law principles also could be used to impose liability for releases of hazardous materials into the environment or work place  and third parties may seek recovery from owners or operators of real properties for personal injury or property damage associated with exposure to released hazardous substances 
from time to time  we receive notices from the environmental protection agency and state environmental authorities indicating that there may be contamination on properties we own  lease or operate or may have owned  leased or operated in the past or on adjacent properties for which we may be responsible 
compliance with these laws and regulations has not had a material impact on our operations to date 
item a 
risk factors 
risks relating to our business if overall demand for products sold by our stores slows or declines  our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows will suffer 
decreased demand could also negatively impact our stock price 
overall demand for products sold by our stores depends on many factors and may slow or decrease due to any number of reasons  including the economy  because during periods of declining economic conditions including higher unemployment  lower wages  higher credit costs or unavailability of credit  and higher fuel or energy prices  both diy and commercial customers may defer vehicle maintenance or repair  conversely  during periods of favorable economic conditions  more of our diy customers may pay others to repair and maintain their cars or they may purchase new cars  the weather  as vehicle maintenance may be deferred during periods of unfavorable weather  the average duration of manufacturer warranties and the decrease in the number of annual miles driven  because newer cars typically require fewer repairs and will be repaired by the manufacturer s dealer network using dealer parts  and lower vehicle mileage decreases the need for maintenance and repair while higher miles driven increases the need  the quality of vehicles manufactured  because vehicles that have high part failure rates will require more frequent repairs using aftermarket parts  and the refusal of vehicle manufacturers to make available diagnostic  repair and maintenance information to the automotive aftermarket industry that our diy and commercial customers require to diagnose  repair and maintain their vehicles may force consumers to have all diagnostic work  repairs and maintenance performed by the vehicle manufacturers dealer network 
if any of these factors cause overall demand for the products we sell to decline  our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows will suffer 
deterioration in general economic conditions  including unemployment  inflation or deflation  consumer debt levels or unavailability of credit and high energy costs will likely have a negative impact on our customers ability to purchase our products and our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows will suffer 
the deterioration in general macro economic conditions that occurred during the fourth quarter of led many us companies to announce plant closings and employee layoffs  which resulted in higher unemployment that may continue for a prolonged period of time 
unemployment of our customers or any decrease in the market value of their homes would have a negative impact on our customers net worth and financial resources  and could reduce their willingness or ability to pay for accessories  maintenance or repair of their vehicles 
although the price of gasoline decreased substantially in november and december of  the price of fuel or other energy resources may increase substantially in the future 
higher fuel and energy costs may reduce the amount of customers disposable income available to purchase our products  as well as reduce the number of miles driven 
rising energy prices may impact demand for the products we sell  overall transaction count and our profitability 
in addition  higher energy prices impact our merchandise distribution  commercial delivery  utility and product costs  and inflation or deflation could also result in a potentially material negative impact on our business  financial condition  profitability and cash flows 
if we are unable to compete successfully against other companies in the automotive aftermarket industry we may lose customers  our revenues may decline  and we may be less profitable or potentially unprofitable 
the sale of automotive parts  accessories and maintenance items is highly competitive in many ways  including name recognition  location  price  quality  product availability and customer service 
we compete in both the diy and commercial categories of the automotive aftermarket industry  primarily with i national and regional retail automotive parts chains  ii discount stores and mass merchandisers that carry automotive products  iii wholesalers or jobber stores  iv independent operators and v automobile dealers that supply parts 
these competitors and the level of competition vary by market 
some of our competitors may possess advantages over us in certain markets we share  including a greater amount of marketing activities  a larger number of stores  store locations  store layouts  longer operating histories  greater name recognition  larger and more established customer bases  lower prices  and better product warranties 
our response to these competitive disadvantages may require us to reduce our prices below our normal selling prices or increase our promotional spending  which would lower revenue and profitability 
competitive disadvantages may also prevent us from introducing new product lines  require us to discontinue current product offerings  or change some of our current operating strategies 
if we do not have the resources or expertise  or otherwise fail to develop successful strategies to address these competitive disadvantages  we may lose customers  our revenues and profit margins may decline and we may be less profitable or potentially unprofitable 
disruptions in our relationships with vendors  or disruptions in or changes in our vendors operations  could increase our cost of goods sold and or affect the supply of automotive parts and supplies we sell 
our business depends on developing and maintaining close relationships with our vendors and on our vendors ability or willingness to sell quality products to us at favorable prices and terms 
many factors outside of our control may harm these relationships and the ability or willingness of these vendors to sell us products on favorable terms 
for example  financial or operational difficulties that some of our vendors may face could increase the cost of the products we purchase from them or our ability to source product from them 
in addition  the trend towards consolidation among automotive parts suppliers as well as the off shoring of manufacturing capacity to foreign countries may disrupt or end our relationship with some vendors  and could lead to less competition and result in higher prices 
we could also be negatively impacted by suppliers who might experience work stoppages  labor strikes or other interruptions to or difficulties in the manufacture or supply of the products we purchase from them 
deteriorating and uncertain credit markets could negatively impact our vendors  as well as our liquidity and ability to secure additional capital at favorable cost effective terms in the future 
impact on the company s suppliers during the fourth quarter of  the company  our suppliers also referred to as vendors and our customers were exposed to deteriorating and uncertain credit markets 
the general decline in the economy and economic conditions could negatively affect our suppliers by making it difficult for them to obtain the credit lines or loans necessary to finance their operations in the short term  or long term 
additionally  if any of the major u 
s 
automobile manufacturers files a petition in bankruptcy  or if other factors result in a substantial reduction in the number of new cars manufactured  or in a company wide shut down  it would likely have a material negative short term as well as potentially long term impact on the operations and cash flows of some of our suppliers 
any such negative impacts to our suppliers will likely result in the loss of certain suppliers and or in higher product costs 
impact on the company supplier bankruptcies would likely decrease the production output and supply of domestic and possibly foreign automobile parts and accessories  thereby decreasing the availability and increasing the cost of our parts and accessories 
we might not be able to pass our increased costs onto our customers 
any increased per unit costs of our suppliers  would likely result in the company paying a higher per unit price for parts and accessories  potentially resulting in higher cost of goods sold  lower gross profit margins and reduced operating profits if such increased costs could not be passed onto our customers 
our overall credit rating may be negatively impacted by the deteriorating and uncertain credit markets 
see item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations credit ratings 
the interest rates on our credit facilities are linked directly to our credit ratings 
accordingly  any negative impact on our credit rating would likely result in higher interest rates and interest expense we pay on borrowed funds 
additionally  we may be limited in our ability to borrow additional funds to finance our operations 
in light of the uncertainty in the credit markets  it is possible that one or more of the banks that provides us with financing under our credit facilities may fail to honor the terms of our existing credit facilities or be financially unable to provide the unused credit 
an inability to obtain sufficient financing at cost effective rates could have a materially adverse affect on our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
we depend on the services of many qualified team members  whom we may not be able to attract and retain 
our success depends to a significant extent on the continued services and experience of our team members 
at march   we employed  team members 
we may not be able to retain our current qualified team members  or attract and retain additional qualified team members that may be needed in the future 
our ability to maintain an adequate number of qualified team members is highly dependent on an attractive and competitive compensation and benefits package 
if we fail or are unable to maintain such a package  our customer service and execution levels could suffer by reason of a declining quality of our workforce  which could adversely affect our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
we may not be able to successfully implement our business strategy  including increasing comparable store sales  enhancing our margins and increasing our return on invested capital  which could adversely affect our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
we have implemented numerous initiatives as part of our business strategy  including four key turnaround strategies introduced in  to increase comparable store sales  enhance our margins and increase our return on invested capital in order to increase our earnings and cash flow 
if we are unable to implement these initiatives efficiently and effectively  or if these initiatives are unsuccessful  our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows could be adversely affected 
successful implementation of our business strategy also depends on factors specific to the retail automotive parts industry and numerous other factors that may be beyond our control 
adverse changes in the following factors could undermine our business strategy and have a material adverse affect on our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flow general economic conditions  including the current us recession which could continue into the future  and unfavorable conditions in our local markets  which could reduce our sales  the competitive environment in the automotive aftermarket parts and accessories retail sector that may force us to reduce prices below our desired pricing level or increase promotional spending  changes in the automotive aftermarket parts manufacturing industry  such as manufacturer consolidation or closures  which may disrupt or sever one or more of our supplier relationships and increase the cost of the parts and accessories we sell  our ability to anticipate changes in consumer preferences and to meet customers needs for automotive products particularly parts availability in a timely manner  our ability to stimulate diy customer traffic as well as grow our commercial business  and our continued ability to hire and retain qualified personnel  which depends in part on the types of recruiting  training  compensation and benefit programs we adopt or maintain 
we will not be able to expand our business if our growth strategy is not successful  including the availability of suitable locations for new store openings or the successful integration of any acquired businesses  which could adversely affect our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
new store openings we have increased our store count significantly from stores at the end of fiscal to  stores at january  we intend to continue to increase the number of our stores and expand the markets we serve as part of our growth strategy  primarily by opening new stores 
we may also grow our business through strategic acquisitions 
we do not know whether the implementation of our growth strategy will be successful 
the actual number of new stores to be opened and their success will depend on a number of factors  including  among other things the availability of potential store locations  the negotiation of acceptable lease or purchase terms for new locations  the availability of financial resources  including access to capital at cost effective interest rates  and our ability to manage the expansion and hire  train and retain qualified sales associates 
we are unsure whether we will be able to open and operate new stores on a timely or sufficiently profitable basis  or that opening new stores in markets we already serve will not harm existing store profitability or comparable store sales 
the newly opened and existing stores profitability will depend on the competition we face as well as our ability to properly merchandise  market and price the products desired by customers in these markets 
acquisitions  investments or strategic alliances we may acquire stores or businesses from  make investments in  or enter into strategic alliances with companies that have stores or distribution networks in our current markets or in areas into which we intend to expand our presence 
any future acquisitions  investments  strategic alliances or related efforts will be accompanied by risks  including but not limited to the difficulty of identifying appropriate strategic partners or acquisition candidates  securing adequate financing on cost effective terms for acquisition or post acquisition expenditures  the potential disruption to our ongoing business and diversion of our management s attention  inability or failure to discover liabilities prior to completion of an acquisition  including the assumption of legal liabilities  the difficulty of assimilating and integrating the operations of the respective entities to realize anticipated economic  operational or other favorable benefits  the inability to maintain uniform standards  controls  procedures and policies  inability or failure to retain key personnel from the acquired business  and the impairment of relationships with team members and customers as a result of changes in management 
we are unsure whether we will be successful in overcoming these risks or any other problems encountered with any acquisitions  investments  strategic alliances or related efforts 
if we fail to successfully open and operate new stores or make strategic acquisitions or alliances  then our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows may be negatively impacted 
because we are involved in litigation from time to time  and are subject to numerous laws and governmental regulations  we could incur substantial judgments  fines  legal fees and other costs 
we are sometimes the subject of complaints or litigation from customers  employees or other third parties for various actions 
from time to time  we are involved in litigation involving claims related to  among other things  breach of contract  tortious conduct  employment discrimination  payment of wages  asbestos exposure  real estate  and product defects 
the damages sought against us in some of these litigation proceedings are substantial 
although we maintain liability insurance for some litigation claims  if one or more of the claims were to greatly exceed our insurance coverage limits or if our insurance policies do not cover a claim  this could have a material adverse affect on our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
additionally  we are subject to numerous federal  state and local laws and governmental regulations relating to environmental protection  product quality standards  building and zoning requirements  as well as employment law matters 
if we fail to comply with existing or future laws or regulations  we may be subject to governmental or judicial fines or sanctions  while incurring substantial legal fees and costs 
in addition  our capital expenses could increase due to remediation measures that may be required if we are found to be noncompliant with any existing or future laws or regulations 
war or acts of terrorism  or the threat of either  may negatively impact the availability and cost of merchandise and our customers and adversely impact our sales and profitability 
war or acts of terrorism  or the threat of either  may have a negative impact on our ability to obtain merchandise available for sale in our stores 
some of our merchandise is imported from other countries 
if imported goods become difficult or impossible to import into the united states  and if we cannot obtain such merchandise from other sources at similar costs  our sales and profit margins may be negatively affected 
in the event that commercial transportation is curtailed or substantially delayed  our business may be adversely impacted  as we may have difficulty shipping merchandise to our distribution centers and stores 
furthermore  terrorist attacks  war in the middle east  or war within or between any oil producing country would likely result in an abrupt increase in the price of crude oil  gasoline  diesel fuel and energy costs 
such price increases would increase the cost of doing business for us and our suppliers  and also would negatively impact our customers disposable income and have an adverse impact on our business  sales  profit margins and results of operations 
risks relating to our financial condition the covenants governing our revolving and term loan facilities impose restrictions on us 
the terms of our revolving and term loan facilities include covenants that impose operating and financial restrictions on us and our subsidiaries and require us to meet certain financial ratios and conditions 
these restrictions may also have a negative impact on our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows by significantly limiting or prohibiting us from engaging in certain transactions  including incurring or guaranteeing additional indebtedness  making capital expenditures and other investments  incurring liens on our assets and engaging in sale leaseback transactions  issuing or selling capital stock of our subsidiaries  transferring or selling assets currently held by us  and engaging in mergers or acquisitions 
the failure to comply with any of these covenants would cause a default under our credit facilities

actual results and the timing of events could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of a number of factors  including those set forth under forward looking statements and risk factors elsewhere in this report 
our fiscal year ends on the saturday nearest december st of each year  which results in an extra week every several years fiscal contained weeks 
our first quarter consists of weeks  and the other three quarters consist of weeks  with the exception of the fourth quarter fiscal which contained weeks due to our week fiscal year in introduction we operate primarily within the united states automotive aftermarket industry  which includes replacement parts excluding tires  accessories  maintenance items  batteries and automotive chemicals for cars and light trucks pickup trucks  vans  minivans and sport utility vehicles

management overview during fiscal  in a challenging year of deteriorating macroeconomic conditions  we accelerated top line sales growth by and recorded earnings per diluted share of compared to in fiscal our fiscal financial results included an extra week of operations rd week as well as a non cash obsolete inventory write down of million due to a change in inventory management approach for slow moving inventory 
we continued to generate significant operating cash flow that allowed us to invest in business initiatives and return capital to shareholders through cash dividends and share repurchases 
fiscal was a transitional year for advance  which included several executive management changes and the introduction of key strategies and initiatives  as we embarked on a concentrated effort to drive changes in response to diminished sales and earnings growth during fiscal and in january  darren jackson was appointed to the position of president and chief executive officer 
mr 
jackson  who had previously served on our board of directors  audit committee and finance committee  had already been involved with management on the completion of certain strategic business assessments during fiscal and the formulation of key initiatives discussed below 
in addition to our ceo  other new management leaders joined advance in fiscal to work with existing leaders on developing and executing a turnaround plan 
fiscal highlights highlights from our fiscal include financial we recorded earnings per diluted share of compared to for fiscal these results included approximately of diluted earnings per share from the rd week as well as a reduction in diluted earnings per share of from the non cash obsolete inventory write down 
in addition to these items  our increase in earnings per share was driven by increased operating income  reduced interest expense and a lower outstanding share count as a result of million shares having been repurchased during fiscal total sales for fiscal increased over fiscal to billion  primarily driven by new store growth  the impact of the rd week s sales million on total sales and a comparable store sales increase of 
our fourth quarter comparable sales increase of was the highest in quarters 
we generated operating cash flow of million for the year  an increase of million over the comparable period in fiscal  which was primarily driven by higher earnings and the impact of the rd week 
during fiscal  we repurchased million shares of common stock for million at an average price of per share  of which million shares were repurchased under our previous million stock repurchase program 
operational executive management introduced four key turnaround strategies as the primary catalyst for our transformation and turnaround 
these four strategies are commercial acceleration diy transformation availability excellence superior experience a majority of the initiatives we began and or completed during fiscal are centered around these four strategies  some of which are discussed in the following section 
we retired the store format and related remodel program 
in early fiscal  we began an assessment of our store occupancy costs and a potential divestiture of approximately to stores in addition to our normal annual store closings that are strategically or financially delivering unacceptable results 
these stores were assessed for impairment as of january  and no impairment was considered necessary at that time 
update on turnaround strategies our favorable results during fiscal were in part being driven by progress on our key turnaround strategies 
each of the four strategies is at a different stage of implementation 
commercial acceleration the effectiveness of our commercial acceleration strategy is evident as we experienced double digit comparable sales increases over the last four quarters in commercial sales 
for fiscal  we experienced a commercial comparable store sales increase 
we continue to gain market share in a business that is very fragmented and still growing overall 
we have added more parts to our stores with commercial programs  including key brands which are highly respected and preferred by our commercial customers 
we are developing a sales force to drive our commercial business  another key component of the commercial acceleration strategy 
we are increasing the number of commercial account managers and equipping them with tools to acquire new customers and increase the volume of existing customers purchases 
we are also testing other initiatives to roll out on a larger scale that meet the needs of our commercial customers and drive shareholder value 
diy transformation the initial focus of the diy transformation strategy is to turnaround our current diy sales trends utilizing targeted initiatives 
our diy comparable store sales decrease was in fiscal with our fourth quarter improving to a decrease of 
during fiscal  we completed a day assessment of our diy business where a representative group of management and field team members worked together and concluded that we must continue to focus on initiatives such as parts availability  attachment selling  superior customer service  and the proper scheduling of team members 
additionally  we have identified certain operating areas where we are experiencing positive diy sales results which provide us with an opportunity to utilize those best practices across the entire diy business 
our ability to achieve successful results in our commercial acceleration and diy transformation strategies is dependent on our availability excellence and superior experience strategies 
availability excellence the availability excellence strategy represents our commitment to enhance the breadth and depth of our parts availability in our stores  and the speed of our parts delivery  to better serve both our commercial and diy customers 
this strategy incorporates our supply chain and logistics network capabilities  space management and merchandising initiatives 
we are making progress on the parts availability initiative as the merchandising and inventory management teams partner with the commercial and diy teams to accelerate sales growth 
as discussed in commercial acceleration  key brands of parts such as moog and wagner were added during fiscal we began the rollout of a custom mix inventory process chain wide 
in addition  we reviewed our inventory productivity and changed our inventory management approach for slow moving inventory 
we intend to increase our inventory productivity by reducing the amount of slow moving inventory and utilizing vendor return privileges earlier in the life cycle of our inventory which will allow us to add faster moving custom mix inventory 
we believe this change in inventory management approach will accelerate sales  improve margins and increase inventory turnover 
progress in other initiatives included the restructuring of our merchandising department into an integrated operating model  the completion of an initial phase of a new category management process and the roll out of a new price optimization tool 
as previously announced  we are also implementing an oracle merchandising system over a multi year period which will serve as a key upgrade to our current merchandising systems 
we recently launched the company s global sourcing capability and private brand strategy 
in february  we announced the outsourcing of our private vehicle fleet  which will allow more scheduling flexibility and reduce costs to help fund the expansion of our pdq network 
we will continue to measure progress in our availability excellence strategy  using productivity metrics such as sales per square foot and gross margin return on inventory 
see item  selected consolidated financial data  for a presentation of these and other key metrics 
superior experience superior experience is centered around our store operations and providing superior customer service 
we have begun to evaluate our customer service through the measurement of team member engagement and customer satisfaction 
we believe we will gain valuable information from these results which will drive improvement in our results in future quarters 
in the fourth quarter  we tested a new integrated operating model that demonstrated efficiencies in our commercial delivery business and related acceleration in commercial sales 
this new staffing model will begin a phased in rollout in the first quarter of the leaders of superior experience will be re engineering the store experience and store operations as well as gaining a better understanding of what the customer ultimately wants 
industry the steep decline in consumer confidence  rapidly rising unemployment  the credit crisis and the single largest decline in annual miles driven presented challenges to retailers throughout fiscal more recently  retail industry comparable store sales represented the worst retail environment in years 
however  the automotive aftermarket industry will likely have an opportunity to benefit from the economic downturn because consumers are keeping their vehicles longer which increases the average age of vehicles and the need to repair and complete routine maintenance on those vehicles 
although our fiscal results were positive  our outlook is cautious for fiscal given the current economic environment 
we are still in the early stages of implementing our four key turnaround strategies 
we are committed to making the necessary investments to help ensure our long term success 
store development by segment the following table sets forth the total number of new  closed and relocated stores and stores with commercial delivery programs during fiscal  and we lease approximately of our stores 
aap fiscal year number of stores at beginning of year new stores closed stores number of stores  end of period a relocated stores stores with commercial delivery programs ai fiscal year number of stores at beginning of year new stores closed stores number of stores  end of period stores with commercial delivery programs a includes stores not operating at december   primarily due to hurricane damage 
during fiscal  we anticipate adding approximately aap and ai stores and closing to stores  excluding the stores that may be closed in connection with our store divestiture plan 
critical accounting policies our financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting policies generally accepted in the united states of america 
our discussion and analysis of the financial condition and results of operations are based on these financial statements 
the preparation of these financial statements requires the application of accounting policies in addition to certain estimates and judgments by our management 
our estimates and judgments are based on currently available information  historical results and other assumptions we believe are reasonable 
actual results could differ materially from these estimates 
the preparation of our financial statements included the following significant estimates and exercise of judgment 
vendor incentives we receive incentives from vendors as a result of purchasing and promoting their products through a variety of programs  including cooperative advertising allowances  volume rebates and other promotional incentives 
we account for vendor incentives in accordance with emerging issues task force  or eitf  no 
 accounting by a customer including a reseller for certain consideration received from a vendor 
many of the incentives are under long term agreements terms in excess of one year  while others are negotiated on an annual basis 
cooperative advertising allowances and volume rebates are earned based on inventory purchases and are initially recorded as a reduction to inventory 
the deferred amounts are included as a reduction to cost of sales as the inventory is sold 
we recognize other promotional incentives earned under long term agreements as a reduction to cost of sales 
these incentives are recognized based on the cumulative net purchases as a percentage of total estimated net purchases over the life of the agreement 
our margins could be impacted positively or negatively if actual purchases or results from any one year differ from our estimates  however  the impact over the life of the agreement would be the same 
short term incentives terms less than one year are generally recognized as a reduction to cost of sales over the course of the agreements 
amounts received or receivable from vendors that are not yet earned are reflected as deferred revenue 
management s estimate of the portion of deferred revenue that will be realized within one year of the balance sheet date is included in other current liabilities 
earned amounts that are receivable from vendors are included in receivables except for that portion expected to be received after one year  which is included in other assets  net 
inventory reserves we establish reserves for inventory shrink for our distribution centers based on historical results from our cycle counting program and actual results from our most recent cycle counts 
for our store locations  we establish reserves for estimated shrink based on historical results from our cycle counting program and results of physical inventories  as adjusted for current economic conditions if necessary 
beginning in the third quarter of fiscal  we began transitioning to a physical inventory process and had completed physical inventories in approximately one third of our retail stores as of january  an increase or decrease to our inventory reserves is recorded as an increase or decrease to our cost of sales 
our estimates of these shrink reserves depend on the results of the independent physical inventory counts and the accuracy of the cycle count program  which is dependent on compliance rates of our facilities and the execution of the required procedures 
we evaluate the accuracy of our cycle program on an ongoing basis and believe it provides reasonable assurance for the established inventory shrink reserves 
if estimates of our shrink reserves are inaccurate based on the inventory counts  we may be exposed to losses or gains that could be material 
we also have recorded reserves for potentially excess and obsolete inventories based on i current inventory levels  ii historical analysis of product sales and iii current market conditions 
we provide reserves where less than full credit is expected from a vendor or where we anticipate that items will be sold at retail prices that are less than recorded cost 
we have historically developed these estimates based on the determination of return privileges with vendors  the level of credit provided by the vendor and management s estimate of the discounts to be recorded  if any  required by market conditions 
at the end of fiscal  we reviewed our inventory productivity and changed our inventory management approach for slow moving inventory 
as a result  we increased our reserve for excess and obsolete inventories by million  excluding a lifo and warehousing cost impact of million 
our total inventory reserves increased by million in fiscal compared to fiscal primarily as a result of the increase to our excess and obsolete inventory reserve 
future changes by vendors in their policies or willingness to accept returns of excess inventory or changes in our inventory management approach for excess and obsolete inventory could require us to revise our estimates of required reserves and result in a negative impact on our consolidated statement of operations 
a difference in actual inventory reserves at january  would have affected net income by approximately million for the fiscal year ended january  warranty reserves we offer limited warranties on certain products that range from days to lifetime warranties  the warranty obligation on the majority of merchandise sold by us with a manufacturer s warranty is borne by our vendors 
however  we have an obligation to provide customers free replacement of merchandise or merchandise at a prorated cost if under a warranty and not covered by the manufacturer 
merchandise sold with warranty coverage by us primarily includes batteries but may also include other parts such as brakes and shocks 
we estimate and record a reserve for future warranty claims based on the historical return experience of the products sold and record any change as income or expense in the period the product is sold 
if claims experience differs from historical levels  revisions in our estimates may be required  which could have an impact on our consolidated statement of operations 
our warranty reserves increased by million in fiscal compared to fiscal a portion of this obligation is funded by incentives from our vendors 
the overall increase in our warranty reserves was primarily attributable to an increase in the quantity and cost of batteries sold during fiscal as well as an increase in related warranty claims 
effective december   the company also began including in its warranty reserves the warranty obligation on certain other products sold in addition to batteries 
a change in the warranty reserves at january  would have affected net income by approximately million for the fiscal year ended january  self insurance reserves we are self insured for general and automobile liability  workers compensation and the health care claims of our team members  although we maintain stop loss coverage with third party insurers to limit our total liability exposure 
our self insurance program  started in  has not reached full maturity 
a reserve for liabilities associated with these losses is established for claims filed  claims incurred but not yet reported  projected future claims using actuarial methods followed in the insurance industry and our historical claims experience 
each year  our reserve for self insurance increases over the prior year because each year adds an additional layer of reserves without an equal amount of prior year reserves being fully relieved 
generally  claims have historically taken several years to settle and thus are not relieved at the same rate as additional reserves are added each year 
our self insurance reserves increased by million in fiscal compared to fiscal this increase was primarily the result of the increase in the number of workers compensation claims and automobile accident claims as well as an increase in the total cost to settle workers compensation claims as compared to the prior year 
although the increase in self insured reserves in fiscal is less than in fiscal  the increase in the number of claims continues to be driven by overall growth  including an increase in total number of stores  employees and commercial delivery vehicles 
while we do not expect the amounts ultimately paid to differ significantly from our estimates  our self insurance reserves and corresponding selling  general and administrative expenses could be affected if future claim experience differs significantly from historical trends and actuarial assumptions 
a change in our self insurance liabilities at january  would have affected net income by approximately million for the fiscal year ended january tax reserves the determination of our income tax liabilities is based upon the tax codes  regulations and pronouncements of the taxing jurisdictions in which we do business 
our income tax returns are periodically examined by those jurisdictions 
these examinations include  among other things  auditing our filing positions  the timing of deductions and allocation of income among the various jurisdictions 
at any particular time  multiple years are subject to examination by various taxing authorities 
in evaluating our income tax positions  we record reserves for potential exposures 
these tax reserves are adjusted in the period actual developments give rise to such change 
those developments could be  but are not limited to settlement of tax audits  expiration of the statute of limitations  the evolution of tax codes and regulations  along with varying applications of tax policy and administration within those jurisdictions 
these tax reserves contain uncertainties because management is required to make assumptions and apply judgment to estimate exposures associated with our various filing positions 
although management believes that the judgments and estimates are reasonable  actual results could differ and the company may be exposed to gains or losses that could be material 
to the extent that actual results differ from our estimates  the effective tax rate in any particular period could be materially affected 
favorable tax developments would be recognized as a reduction in our effective tax rate in the period of resolution 
unfavorable tax developments would require an increase in our effective tax rate and a possible use of cash in the period of resolution 
a change in the tax reserves at january  would have affected net income by approximately million for the fiscal year ended january  components of statement of operations net sales net sales consist primarily of merchandise sales from our retail store locations to both our diy and commercial customers 
our total sales growth is comprised of both comparable store sales and new store sales 
we calculate comparable store sales based on the change in store sales starting once a store has been opened for complete accounting periods approximately one year 
we include sales from relocated stores in comparable store sales from the original date of opening 
beginning in fiscal  we also include in comparable store sales the net sales from the offshore and ai stores 
the comparable periods have been adjusted accordingly 
fiscal comparable store sales exclude the effect of the rd week 
cost of sales our cost of sales consists of merchandise costs  net of incentives under vendor programs  inventory shrinkage  defective merchandise and warranty costs  and warehouse and distribution expenses 
gross profit as a percentage of net sales may be affected by i variations in our product mix  ii price changes in response to competitive factors and fluctuations in merchandise costs  iii vendor programs  iv inventory shrinkage  v defective merchandise and warranty costs and v warehouse and distribution costs 
we seek to minimize fluctuations in merchandise costs and instability of supply by entering into long term purchasing agreements  without minimum purchase volume requirements  when we believe it is advantageous 
our gross profit may not be comparable to those of our competitors due to differences in industry practice regarding the classification of certain costs 
see note to our consolidated financial statements elsewhere in this report for additional discussion of these costs 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative sg a expenses consist of store payroll  store occupancy including rent and depreciation  advertising expenses  commercial delivery expenses  other store expenses and general and administrative expenses  including salaries and related benefits of store support center team members  share based compensation expense  store support center administrative office expenses  data processing  professional expenses  self insurance costs and other related expenses 
see note to our consolidated financial statements for additional discussion of these costs 
consolidated results of operations the following table sets forth certain of our operating data expressed as a percentage of net sales for the periods indicated 
fiscal year ended january  december  december  net sales cost of sales gross profit selling  general and administrative expenses operating income interest expense loss on extinguishment of debt other income  net income tax expense net income fiscal compared to fiscal net sales net sales for fiscal were  million  an increase of million  or  over net sales for fiscal the net sales increase was due to contributions from the net new aap and ai stores opened within the last year  million in sales from the rd week and an increase in comparable store sales of 
aap produced sales of  million  an increase of million  or 
aap s sales increase was primarily driven by a comparable store sales increase  million in sales from the rd week and sales from the net new stores opened within the last year 
the aap comparable store sales increase was driven by i an increase in average ticket sales and customer traffic in our commercial business and ii an increase in average ticket sales by our diy customers offset by a decrease in diy customer count 
ai produced sales of million  an increase of million  or 
ai s sales increase was primarily driven by a comparable store sales increase  million in sales from the rd week and sales from net new stores opened within the last year 
we expect to experience similar trends during fiscal as we continue to realize benefits from our turnaround strategies partially offset by the continuation of a challenging macroeconomic environment 
gross profit gross profit for fiscal was  million  or of net sales  as compared to  million  or of net sales  in fiscal  remaining flat 
gross profit reflects a reduction of million  or basis points  or bps  resulting from a non cash obsolete inventory write down due to a change in our inventory management approach for slow moving inventory 
offsetting this reduction in gross profit as a percentage of net sales were improvements in gross profit from more effective pricing  decreased inventory shrink  and higher sales from ai  which generated a higher gross profit rate 
the impact on gross profit from the rd week was approximately million and did not materially affect our gross profit rate 
sg a sg a expenses for fiscal were  million  or of net sales  as compared to  million  or of net sales  for fiscal  or an increase of basis points 
the increase in sg a expenses as a percentage of sales was driven primarily by investments in strategic initiatives  increased incentive compensation and legal settlement costs partially offset by favorable medical costs 
our sg a rate for fiscal was favorably impacted by approximately bps from the rd week as a result of not including an additional week of fixed expenses that are typically expensed in a week year 
operating income operating income for fiscal was million  or of net sales  as compared to million  or of net sales  in fiscal  or a decrease of basis points 
aap produced operating income of million  or of net sales  for fiscal as compared to million  or of net sales  in fiscal ai generated operating income for fiscal of million as compared to an operating loss of million in fiscal operating income increased primarily due to ai s positive sales results for the year and a decrease in payroll expense as a percentage of sales

in addition  we have used available funds to repurchase shares of common stock under our stock repurchase program and to repay borrowings under our credit facility 
we have funded these requirements primarily through cash generated from operations  supplemented by borrowings under our credit facilities as needed 
we believe funds generated from our expected results of operations  available cash and cash equivalents  and available borrowings under our revolving credit facility will be sufficient to fund our primary obligations for the next fiscal year 
at january   our cash and cash equivalents balance was million  an increase of million compared to fiscal year end this increase resulted from additional cash flows from operating activities including higher comparable store sales and lower capital expenditures  partially offset by an increase in expenditures for financing activities including the return of capital to our shareholders through the payment of dividends and the repurchase of common stock during fiscal 
additional discussion of our cash flow results is set forth in the analysis of cash flows section 
at january   our outstanding indebtedness was million lower when compared to december  and consisted of borrowings of million under our revolving credit facility  million under our term loan  million outstanding on an economic development note and outstanding under other financing arrangements 
additionally  we had million in letters of credit outstanding  which reduced our total availability under the revolving credit facility to million 
in light of the uncertainty in the credit markets  it is possible that one or more of the banks in our revolving credit facility syndicate may be unable to provide our remaining available credit 
we have lenders participating in our revolving credit facility  each with a commitment of not more than of the total million commitment 
furthermore  all of these lenders have met their contractual funding commitments to us through january  an inability to obtain sufficient financing at cost effective rates could have a materially adverse impact on our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
capital expenditures our primary capital requirements have been the funding of our continued store expansion program  including new store openings and store acquisitions  store relocations  store remodels prior to fiscal  maintenance of existing stores  the construction and upgrading of distribution centers  and the development of proprietary information systems and purchased information systems 
our capital expenditures were million in fiscal  or million less than fiscal  primarily due to a reduction in store development 
during fiscal  we opened aap and ai stores  remodeled five aap stores and relocated aap stores 
our future capital requirements will depend in large part on the number of and timing for new stores we open or acquire within a given year and the investments we make in information technology and logistics networks 
during fiscal  we anticipate adding new aap and new ai stores 
we will relocate and remodel only in the normal course of business 
we retired the store format and related remodel program during fiscal we also plan to make continued investments in the maintenance of our existing stores and logistics network as well as investing in new information systems to support our turnaround strategies  including the implementation of an oracle merchandising system over a multi year timeframe 
in  we anticipate that our capital expenditures will be approximately million to million 
vendor financing program historically  we have negotiated extended payment terms from suppliers that help finance inventory growth  and we believe that we will be able to continue financing much of our inventory growth through such extended payment terms 
we have a short term financing program with a bank for certain merchandise purchases 
in substance  the program allows us to borrow money from the bank to finance purchases from our vendors 
this program allows us to further reduce our working capital invested in current inventory levels and finance future inventory growth 
at january  and december   million and million  respectively  was payable to the bank by us under this program 
we are anticipating the balance in financed vendor accounts payable to diminish as we transition our merchandise vendors to a customer managed services arrangement  or vendor program  entered into during the fourth quarter of fiscal under this vendor program  a third party provides an accounts payable tracking system which facilitates participating suppliers ability to finance our payment obligations with designated third party financial institutions 
participating suppliers may  at their sole discretion  make offers to participating financial institutions to finance one or more of our payment obligations prior to their scheduled due dates at a discounted price 
our obligations to suppliers  including amounts due and scheduled payment dates  are not impacted by suppliers decisions to finance our accounts payable due to them under this arrangement 
our goal in entering into this arrangement is to capture overall supply chain savings in the form of pricing  payment terms or vendor funding  created by facilitating our suppliers ability to finance payment obligations at more favorable discount rates  while providing them with greater working capital flexibility 
as of january   we had million in outstanding payables under our vendor program and had remaining availability of approximately million 
it is possible any ongoing or worsening deterioration in the credit markets could adversely impact our ability to secure funding for any of these programs  which would reduce our anticipated savings  including but not limited to  causing us to increase our borrowings under our revolving credit facility 
stock repurchase program on may   our board of directors authorized a new million stock repurchase program 
the new program cancelled and replaced the remaining portion of our previous million stock repurchase program authorized on august  
this program allows us to repurchase our common stock on the open market or in privately negotiated transactions from time to time in accordance with the requirements of the securities and exchange commission 
during fiscal  we repurchased million shares of common stock at an aggregate cost of million  or an average price of per share  of which million shares of common stock were repurchased under the previous million stock repurchase program during the first quarter of fiscal after may   we repurchased million shares of common stock for million  leaving million remaining under our current million stock repurchase program  excluding related expenses 
additionally  during fiscal we settled million on shares repurchased prior to the end of fiscal cash dividend on february   our board of directors declared a quarterly cash dividend  the first in our history 
we have paid quarterly dividends of per share to stockholders of record for each of our subsequent quarters 
subsequent to january   our board of directors declared a quarterly dividend of per share to be paid on april  to all common stockholders of record as of march  analysis of cash flows a summary and analysis of our cash flows for fiscal  and is reflected in the table and following discussion 
fiscal year in millions cash flows from operating activities cash flows from investing activities cash flows from financing activities net increase decrease in cash and cash equivalents operating activities for fiscal  net cash provided by operating activities increased million to million 
this net increase in operating cash was driven primarily by million increase in earnings exclusive of a million non cash obsolete inventory write down net of tax as a result of our favorable operating income during fiscal inclusive of the approximate million impact of the rd week  and a million increase in cash flows resulting from the timing of the payment of accrued operating expenses 
for fiscal  net cash provided by operating activities increased million to million 
net income increased by million during fiscal significant changes in fiscal working capital resulted in the following sources of cash a million increase in cash flows from inventory  net of accounts payable  reflective of our slow down of inventory growth in line with our current sales trend  while maintaining adequate levels of inventory to support our parts availability initiative  and a million increase in cash flows comprised of other movements in working capital  including the timing in payment of certain operating expenses 
investing activities for fiscal  net cash used in investing activities decreased by million to million 
the decrease in cash used was primarily due to a million decrease in capital expenditures reflective of a reduction in store development  and the absence of million in insurance proceeds  received in fiscal for fiscal  net cash used in investing activities decreased by million to million 
significant components of this decrease consisted of a decrease in capital expenditures of million resulting primarily from less spending on capital assets in our store locations  the impact of the reduced scope in remodels and fewer relocations as compared to  and the absence of a million business acquisition payment made in fiscal financing activities for fiscal  net cash used in financing activities increased by million to million 
cash flows from financing activities increased as a result of a million decrease in the repurchase of common stock under our stock repurchase program 
cash flows from financing activities decreased as result of a million cash outflow resulting from the timing of bank overdrafts  a million decrease in financed vendor accounts payable driven by the transition of our vendors from our vendor financing program to our customer managed services arrangement  a reduction of million in net borrowings primarily under our credit facilities  and a million decrease in additional tax benefits associated with from the decreased number of stock options exercised 
for fiscal  net cash used in financing activities increased by million to million 
cash flows from financing activities increased as result of an million cash inflow resulting from the timing of bank overdrafts  a million increase in financed vendor accounts payable  which reflected the growth in our vendor financing program  a million increase from the issuance of common stock  resulting from an increase in the exercise of stock options mainly associated with the departure of our former ceo and another executive officer during fiscal  and a million cash inflow from additional tax benefits realized from the increased level of stock options exercised 
cash flows from financing activities decreased as a result of a reduction of million in net borrowings primarily under our credit facilities  million of additional cash dividends paid due primarily to the timing in payments  and an additional million of common stock repurchased under our stock repurchase program 
off balance sheet arrangements as of january   we had no off balance sheet arrangements as defined in regulation s k item of the sec regulations 
we include other off balance sheet arrangements in our contractual obligation table including operating lease payments  interest payments on our credit facility and letters of credit outstanding 
contractual obligations in addition to our revolving credit facility  we utilize operating leases as another source of financing 
the amounts payable under these operating leases are included in our schedule of contractual obligations 
our future contractual obligations related to long term debt  operating leases and other contractual obligations at january  were as follows contractual obligations total fiscal fiscal fiscal fiscal fiscal thereafter in thousands long term debt interest payments operating leases purchase obligations other long term liabilities long term debt represents primarily the principal amounts due under our term loan and revolving credit facility  which become due in october we lease certain store locations  distribution centers  office space  equipment and vehicles

our open purchase orders are based on current inventory or operational needs and are fulfilled by our vendors within short periods of time 
we currently do not have minimum purchase commitments under our vendor supply agreements nor are our open purchase orders for goods and services binding agreements

the purchase obligations consist of the amount of diesel fuel required to be purchased by us under certain fixed price fuel supply agreements 
all of these agreements expire in primarily includes employee benefits accruals  restructuring and closed store liabilities and deferred income taxes for which no contractual payment schedule exists and we expect the payments to occur beyond months from january  additionally  other long term liabilities include million of unrecognized income tax benefits 
during the next months  it is possible that we could conclude on approximately to million of the contingencies associated with these tax uncertainties  a portion of which may be settled in cash 
we do not anticipate any significant impact on our liquidity and capital resources due to the conclusion of these tax matters

 accounting by lessees for nonrefundable maintenance deposits 
eitf requires that nonrefundable maintenance deposits paid by a lessee under an arrangement accounted for as a lease be accounted for as a deposit asset until the underlying maintenance is performed 
when the underlying maintenance is performed  the deposit may be expensed or capitalized in accordance with the lessee s maintenance accounting policy

the fsp requires an entity to consider its own assumptions about renewal or extension of the term of the arrangement  consistent with its expected use of the asset  and is an attempt to improve consistency between the useful life of a recognized intangible asset under sfas and the period of expected cash flows used to measure the fair value of the asset under sfas  business combinations 
the fsp is effective for fiscal years beginning after december   and the guidance for determining the useful life of a recognized intangible asset must be applied prospectively to intangible assets acquired after the effective date

the deferral provided by fsp no 
applies to such items as i nonfinancial assets and liabilities initially measured at fair value in a business combination but not measured at fair value in subsequent periods and ii nonfinancial long lived asset groups measured at fair value for an impairment assessment
