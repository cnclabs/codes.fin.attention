b management considers funds from operations ffo to be an appropriate measure of the financial performance of an equity reit 
the national association of real estate investment trusts nareit currently defines ffo as net income computed in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap  excluding gains or losses associated with the sale of previously depreciated operating properties  real estate depreciation and amortization  and adjustments for unconsolidated joint ventures 
our calculation of diluted ffo also assumes conversion of all potentially dilutive securities  including minority interests  which are convertible into common shares 
we consider ffo to be an appropriate supplemental measure of operating performance because  by excluding gains or losses on dispositions of operating properties and excluding depreciation  ffo can assist in the comparison of the operating performance of a company s real estate between periods or as compared to different companies 
c includes discontinued operations 
d excludes apartment homes owned in joint ventures

executive summary our fiscal year results reflect the challenges the multifamily industry faced during the year 
during fiscal year  the factors adversely affecting demand for and rents received in our multifamily communities became more intense and pervasive across the united states 
as a result  the already difficult conditions within the industry became progressively more challenging 
high inventory levels of single family homes and condominiums in the markets in which we operate  overall weak consumer confidence  and fears of a prolonged recession  among other factors  have persisted throughout fiscal year the effects of these factors have been further magnified by credit tightening in the financial markets  increasing home foreclosures  and severe shortages of liquidity in the financial markets 
based on our results for fiscal year  the deteriorating market conditions discussed above  and our belief these conditions may not improve quickly  we expect negative growth in property revenues during fiscal year current factors which may negatively affect our future performance include recent and expected future job losses  liquidity disruptions in the capital markets  recessionary concerns  uncertainty in the financial markets  and a continued oversupply of single family homes and condominiums in many of the markets in which we operate 
however  positive impacts on our performance may result from reductions in the us home ownership rate  more stringent lending criteria for prospective home buyers  and long term growth prospects for population  employment  and household formations in our markets  although there can be no assurance any of these factors will continue or will positively impact our operating results 
due to the instability experienced during the current economic downturn  we believe the timing of an economic recovery is unclear and these conditions may not improve quickly 
our near term primary focus is to strengthen our capital and liquidity position by selectively disposing of properties  controlling and reducing construction and overhead costs  generating positive cash flows from operations  and reducing outstanding debt and leverage ratios 
we intend to continue to look for opportunities to acquire existing communities through our investment in and management of discretionary investment funds 
until the earlier of i december  or ii such time as of its committed capital is invested  subject to two one year extensions  the fund and the co investment vehicle will be our exclusive investment vehicles for acquiring fully developed multifamily properties  subject to certain exceptions 
our portfolio of apartment communities is geographically diverse  which we believe mitigates risks such as changes in demographics or job growth which may occur within individual markets  although may not mitigate such risks with respect to more wide spread economic declines 
in the long term  we also intend to continue focusing on our development pipeline which currently contains twelve properties in various stages of construction  lease up  and pre development 
the commencement of future developments has and may continue to be impacted by macroeconomic issues  increasing construction costs  and other factors 
we expect decreasing levels of development activity in as compared to prior years 
we review our assets for impairment on an annual basis or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
our impairment evaluations reflected our expectation of continued and increased challenges in the development of future multifamily communities  our belief these challenges will persist for some time  and our decision to not continue with five future development projects 
based on our evaluations  we recorded significant impairment charges in the fourth quarter to our land valuations  which materially affected our operating results during fiscal year land valuations may continue to have significant fluctuations due to  among other things  the current economic environment and  as a result  there can be no assurance we will not have further impairments in the future 
the continuation of the current economic environment and capital market disruptions have and could continue to have a negative impact on us and adversely affect our future results of operations

average total occupancy at our same store properties declined in as we experienced decreases in occupancy in a majority of our markets 
we believe our operating performance during the current market environment benefited from the continued operational and technological enhancements we are making at many of our communities  which have created opportunities to take advantage of additional revenue sources

these revenue increases were driven by other property income which increased due to the implementation of perfect connection  and other utility rebilling programs

there was no gain on sale of properties  including land  for the year ended december  gain on sale of properties  including land  for the year ended december  included gains of approximately million from the partial sale of nine operating properties to an affiliated joint venture and approximately million from the partial sales of land to affiliated joint ventures  also included in gain on sale of properties for the year ended december  was approximately million from the sale of undeveloped land to an unaffiliated third party 
see further discussion of gains associated with property dispositions in property portfolio 
gain on early retirement of debt was approximately million for the year ended december  these gains were the result of various repurchases and retirements of debt  and included a tender offer for certain series of outstanding debt  which resulted in the repurchase and retirement of approximately million of debt from unrelated third parties for approximately million 
in addition to the tender offer  we repurchased and retired approximately million of various series of other outstanding debt from unrelated third parties for approximately million during the year ended december  these gains were partially offset by the proportionate share of unamortized loan costs and other costs associated with the retirement of the debt 
the impairment loss on land for the year ended december  of approximately million reflects impairments in the value of land holdings for several potential development projects we no longer plan to pursue  including approximately million related to land holdings for five projects we no longer plan to develop  approximately million in the value of a land parcel held for future development  and approximately million for costs capitalized for a potential joint venture development we no longer plan to pursue 
the impairment loss on land for the year ended december  of approximately million reflects impairment in the value of one potential development project we no longer plan to pursue 
these impairment charges are the difference between each parcel s estimated fair value and the carrying value  which includes pursuit and other costs 
equity in income loss of joint ventures decreased approximately million for the year ended december  as compared to  and decreased approximately million for the year ended december  as compared to changes from period to period were due to changes in the number of properties held through joint ventures  and the development dilution we are experiencing on the completion of units in our joint venture development pipeline  which resulted in depreciation and interest expense recorded exceeding income recognized as these properties have not reached stabilization 
we recognized approximately million of gains for our proportionate share of the sale of three properties held through a joint venture during the year ended december  income allocated to common units and other minority interests decreased approximately million during the year ended december  as compared to and decreased approximately million during the year ended december  as compared to income allocated to common units in included the impact of gains recognized on the partial sale of eight properties to an affiliated joint venture during the year ended december  a portion of the gains recognized were allocated to minority interest holders in camden operating  lp for the tax year ended december   we had current income tax expense of approximately million 
income tax expense decreased million for the year ended december  as compared to the same period in  primarily attributable to less gains on property dispositions in states with high income tax rates and changes in state tax laws affecting one of our operating partnerships 
funds from operations ffo management considers ffo to be an appropriate measure of the financial performance of an equity reit 
the national association of real estate investment trusts nareit currently defines ffo as net income computed in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap  excluding gains or losses associated with the sale of previously depreciated operating properties  real estate depreciation and amortization  and adjustments for unconsolidated joint ventures 
our calculation of diluted ffo also assumes conversion of all potentially dilutive securities  including minority interests  which are convertible into common shares 
we consider ffo to be an appropriate supplemental measure of operating performance because  by excluding gains or losses on dispositions of operating properties and excluding depreciation  ffo can help one compare the operating performance of a company s real estate between periods or as compared to different companies 

table of contents we believe in order to facilitate a clear understanding of our consolidated historical operating results  ffo should be examined in conjunction with net income as presented in the consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income and data included elsewhere in this report 
ffo is not defined by gaap and should not be considered as an alternative to net income as an indication of our operating performance 
additionally  ffo as disclosed by other reits may not be comparable to our calculation 
reconciliations of net income to diluted ffo for the years ended december    and are as follows in thousands funds from operations net income real estate depreciation and amortization  including discontinued operations adjustments for unconsolidated joint ventures gain on sale of properties  including land and discontinued operations  net of taxes income allocated to common units  including discontinued operations funds from operations diluted weighted average shares basic incremental shares issuable from assumed conversion of common share options and awards granted common units weighted average shares diluted adjustment for includes approximately million in gains recognized on sales of properties held in joint ventures 
adjustment is net of approximately million in prepayment penalties incurred with the repayment of mortgage notes directly associated with the sold properties 
liquidity and capital resources financial condition and sources of liquidity we intend to maintain a strong balance sheet and preserve our financial flexibility  which we believe should enhance our ability to identify and capitalize on investment opportunities as they become available 
we intend to maintain what management believes is a conservative capital structure by extending and sequencing the maturity dates of our debt where possible  managing interest rate exposure using what management believes to be prudent levels of fixed and floating rate debt  maintaining conservative coverage ratios  and using what management believes to be a prudent combination of debt and common and preferred equity 
our interest expense coverage ratio  net of capitalized interest  was   and times for the years ended december    and  respectively 
our interest expense coverage ratio is calculated by dividing interest expense for the period into the sum of property revenues and expenses  non property income  other expenses  income from discontinued operations  depreciation  amortization  and interest expense 
at december    and    and  respectively  of our properties based on invested capital were unencumbered 
our weighted average maturity of debt  excluding our line of credit  was years at december  due to the instability experienced during the current economic downturn  we believe the timing of an economic recovery is unclear and these conditions may not improve quickly 
our near term primary focus is to strengthen our capital and liquidity position by selectively disposing of properties  controlling and reducing construction and overhead costs  generating positive cash flows from operations  and reducing outstanding debt and leverage ratios 

table of contents our primary source of liquidity is cash flow generated from operations 
other sources include the availability under our unsecured credit facility and other short term borrowings  proceeds from dispositions of properties and other investments  and access to the capital markets 
we believe our liquidity and financial condition are sufficient to meet all of our reasonably anticipated cash flow needs during including normal recurring operating expenses  current debt service requirements  recurring capital expenditures  initial funding of property developments  acquisitions  and notes receivable  and the minimum dividend payments required to maintain our reit qualification under the internal revenue code of factors which could increase or decrease our future liquidity include but are not limited to current volatility in capital and credit markets  sources of financing  completion of planned asset sales  the effect our debt level and decreases in credit ratings could have on our costs of funds and our ability to access capital markets  and changes in operating costs resulting from a weakened economy  which could also impact occupancy and rental rates and ultimately impact our planned growth of capital 
cash flows certain sources and uses of cash  such as the level of discretionary capital expenditures  repurchases of debt and common shares  and distributions paid on our equity securities are within our control and are adjusted as necessary based upon market conditions 
the following is a discussion of our cash flows for the years ended december  and net cash provided by operating activities was approximately million during the year ended december  as compared to approximately million for the same period in the decrease was primarily due to increased interest payments on our levels of outstanding debt  timing of payments of trade payables and receivables  offset by growth in revenues from our same store  non same store  and development communities 
cash flows used in investing activities during the year ended december  totaled approximately million  as compared to approximately million during the year ended december  cash outflows for property development  acquisition  and capital improvements were approximately million during as compared to approximately million during proceeds received from sales of properties  sales of assets to joint ventures  joint venture distributions representing returns of investments  and sale of technology investments totaled approximately million for the year ended december  as compared to approximately million for the year ended december  net cash used in financing activities totaled approximately million for the year ended december   primarily as a result of approximately million in repayment of outstanding notes payable 
the repayment consisted of approximately million of outstanding notes payable related to our december tender offer  repurchase and retirement of approximately million of various series of other outstanding debt  and repayment of approximately million of maturing secured notes payable

net cash used in financing activities was also attributable to distributions paid to shareholders and minority interest holders of approximately million and approximately million of common share repurchases  offset by proceeds from notes payable and increases in our unsecured line of credit of approximately million and million  respectively 
net cash provided by financing activities totaled approximately million for the year ended december   primarily as a result of approximately million in proceeds from notes payable  offset by repayment of balances outstanding on our line of credit of approximately million  payments of approximately million related to the payoff of two senior unsecured notes and one mortgage note  approximately million of common share repurchases  and distributions paid to shareholders and minority interest holders of approximately million 

table of contents financial flexibility we have a million unsecured credit facility which matures in january and can be extended at our option through january the scheduled interest rate is based on spreads over the london interbank offered rate libor or the prime rate 
the scheduled interest rate spreads are subject to change as our credit ratings change 
advances under the line of credit may be priced at the scheduled rates  or we may enter into bid rate loans with participating banks at rates below the scheduled rates 
these bid rate loans have terms of six months or less and may not exceed the lesser of million or the remaining amount available under the line of credit 
the line of credit is subject to customary financial covenants and limitations  all of which we believe we are in compliance 
our line of credit provides us with the ability to issue up to million in letters of credit 
while our issuance of letters of credit does not increase our borrowings outstanding under our line  it does reduce the amount available 
at december   we had outstanding letters of credit totaling approximately million  and had approximately million available under our unsecured line of credit 
as an alternative to our unsecured line of credit  from time to time we borrow using competitively bid unsecured short term notes with lenders who may or may not be a part of the unsecured line of credit bank group 
such borrowings vary in term and pricing and are typically priced at interest rates below those available under the unsecured line of credit 
we have an automatic shelf registration statement on file with the securities and exchange commission which allows us to offer  from time to time  common shares  preferred shares  debt securities  or warrants 
our declaration of trust provides we may issue up to  shares of beneficial interest  consisting of  common shares and  preferred shares 
as of december   we had  common shares and no preferred shares outstanding 
we believe our ability to access capital markets is enhanced by our senior unsecured debt ratings by moody s and standard and poor s  which are currently baa and bbb  respectively  as well as the ability to borrow on a secured basis from fannie mae or freddie mac 
however  we may not be able to maintain our current credit ratings and may not be able to borrow on a secured or unsecured basis in the future 
the capital and credit markets have been experiencing extreme volatility and disruption  which has caused the spreads on prospective debt financings to widen considerably and have made it more difficult to borrow money 
if current levels of market disruption and volatility continue or worsen  we may not be able to obtain new debt financing or refinance our existing debt on favorable terms or at all 
future cash requirements and contractual obligations one of our principal long term liquidity requirements includes the repayment of maturing debt  including borrowings under our unsecured line of credit used to fund development and acquisition activities 
during approximately million of secured mortgage notes and approximately million of unsecured debt  including scheduled principal amortizations  are scheduled to mature 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements  notes payable  for further discussion of scheduled maturities 
additionally  as of december   we had several current development projects in various stages of construction  for which a total estimated cost of approximately million remained to be funded  we anticipate funding approximately million of these costs through our unsecured line of credit and the remaining approximate million from existing joint venture construction loans 
we intend to meet our long term liquidity requirements through the use of cash flows from operations  draws on our unsecured credit facility  property dispositions  secured mortgage notes  and debt and equity offerings under our automatic shelf registration statement 
in order for us to continue to qualify as a reit we are required to distribute annual dividends equal to a minimum of of our reit taxable income  computed without regards to the dividends paid deduction and our net capital gains 
in november  we announced our board of trust managers had declared a dividend distribution of per share to our common shareholders of record as of december  the dividend was subsequently paid on january  we paid equivalent amounts per unit to holders of the common operating partnership units 
this distribution to common shareholders and holders of common operating partnership units equates to an annualized dividend rate of per share or unit 

table of contents the following table summarizes our known contractual cash obligations as of december  in millions total thereafter debt maturities interest payments capital contributions to fund non cancelable lease payments postretirement benefit obligations construction contracts includes our line of credit and scheduled principal amortizations 
includes contractual interest payments for our line of credit  senior unsecured notes  medium term notes  and secured notes 
interest payments on hedged loans were calculated based on the interest rates effectively fixed by the interest rate swap agreements 
the interest payments on certain secured notes with floating interest rates and our line of credit were calculated based on the interest rates in effect as of december  or the most recent practicable date 
contingent on timing of capital calls by the fund  subject to change 
off balance sheet arrangements the joint ventures in which we have an interest have been funded in part with secured  third party debt 
we are committed to additional funding under mezzanine loans provided to joint ventures 
see further discussion of our investments in various joint ventures in note  investments in joint ventures and a discussion of our mezzanine construction financing in note  notes receivable in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
inflation substantially all of our apartment leases are for a term generally ranging from six to fifteen months 
in an inflationary environment  we may realize increased rents at the commencement of new leases or upon the renewal of existing leases 
the short term nature of our leases generally minimizes our risk from the adverse effects of inflation 
critical accounting policies critical accounting policies are those most important to the presentation of a company s financial condition and results  and require management s most difficult  subjective  or complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
we follow financial accounting and reporting policies in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states of america 
general 
a comprehensive enumeration of our significant accounting policies is presented in note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements as of december  and  and for the years ended december    and each of our policies has been chosen based upon current authoritative literature that collectively comprises accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
principles of consolidation 
our consolidated financial statements include our accounts  the accounts of variable interest entities vies in which we are the primary beneficiary  and the accounts of other subsidiaries and joint ventures over which we have control 
all intercompany transactions  balances  and profits have been eliminated in consolidation 
investments acquired or created are evaluated based on financial accounting standards board fasb interpretation fin r  consolidation of variable interest entities as revised  which requires the consolidation of vies in which we are considered to be the primary beneficiary 
if the investment is determined not to be within the scope of fin r  then the investments are evaluated for consolidation using american institute of certified public accountants statement of position  accounting for investments in real estate ventures  and accounting research bulletin  consolidated financial statements 
if we are the general partner in a limited partnership  we also consider the guidance of emerging issues task force issue  determining whether a general partner  or the general partners as a group  controls a limited partnership or similar entity when the limited partners have certain rights  to assess whether any rights held by the limited partners overcome the presumption of control by us 

table of contents use of estimates 
in the application of gaap  management is required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements  results of operations during the reporting periods  and related disclosures 
our more significant estimates relate to estimates supporting our impairment analysis related to the carrying values of our real estate assets  estimates of the useful lives of our assets  reserves related to our general liability and employee benefit programs  estimates related to our investments in joint ventures and mezzanine construction financing  and estimates of expected losses of variable interest entities 
these estimates are based on historical experience and various other assumptions believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
future events rarely develop exactly as forecasted  and the best estimates routinely require adjustment 
income recognition 
our rental and other property revenue is recorded when due from residents and is recognized monthly as it is earned 
other property revenue consists primarily of utility rebillings and administrative  application  and other transactional fees charged to our residents 
our apartment homes are rented to residents on lease terms generally ranging from six to fifteen months  with monthly payments due in advance 
interest  fee and asset management  and all other sources of income are recognized as earned 
two of our properties are subject to rent control or rent stabilization 
operations of apartment properties acquired are recorded from the date of acquisition in accordance with the purchase method of accounting 
in management s opinion  due to the number of residents  the types and diversity of submarkets in which the properties operate  and the collection terms  there is no significant concentration of credit risk 
cost capitalization 
real estate assets are carried at cost plus capitalized carrying charges 
carrying charges are primarily interest and real estate taxes which are capitalized as part of properties under development 
expenditures directly related to the development  acquisition  and improvement of real estate assets  excluding internal costs relating to acquisitions of operating properties  are capitalized at cost as land and buildings and improvements 
indirect development costs  including salaries and benefits and other related costs directly attributable to the development of properties are also capitalized 
all construction and carrying costs are capitalized and reported in the balance sheet as properties under development until the apartment homes are substantially completed 
upon substantial completion of the apartment homes  the total cost for the apartment homes and the associated land is transferred to buildings and improvements and land  respectively 
where possible  we stage our construction to allow leasing and occupancy during the construction period  which we believe minimizes the duration of the lease up period following completion of construction 
our accounting policy related to properties in the development and leasing phase is all operating expenses associated with completed apartment homes are expensed 
we capitalize renovation and improvement costs we believe extend the economic lives of depreciable property 
capital expenditures subsequent to initial construction are capitalized and depreciated over their estimated useful lives  which range from three to twenty years 
depreciation and amortization is computed over the expected useful lives of depreciable property on a straight line basis with lives generally as follows estimated useful life buildings and improvements years furniture  fixtures  equipment and other years intangible assets in place leases and above and below market leases underlying lease term derivative instruments 
we utilize derivative financial instruments to manage interest rate risk  and we designate the derivative instruments as cash flow hedges 
derivative instruments are recorded in the balance sheet as either an asset or a liability measured at fair value 
for cash flow hedge relationships  changes in the fair value of the derivative instrument deemed effective at offsetting the risk being hedged are reported in other comprehensive income or loss and are reclassified into earnings when the hedged item affects earnings 
the ineffective portion is recognized in current period earnings 
derivatives not designated or not qualifying for hedge treatment must be recorded at fair value with gains or losses recognized in earnings in the period of change 
we do not use derivative instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
we use derivative instruments to reduce the potential impact of changes in interest rates on variable rate debt 
we formally document all relationships between hedging instruments and hedged items  as well as our risk management objective and strategy for undertaking the hedge 
this process includes specific identification of the hedging instrument and the hedged transaction  the nature of the risk being hedged  and how the hedging instrument s effectiveness in hedging the exposure to the hedged transaction s variability in cash flows attributable to the hedged risk will be assessed and measured 
both at the inception of the hedge and on an ongoing basis  we assess whether the derivatives used in hedging transactions are highly effective in offsetting changes in cash flows or fair values of hedged items 
we discontinue hedge accounting if a derivative is not determined to be highly effective as a hedge or has ceased to be a highly effective hedge 

table of contents accumulated other comprehensive income or loss on the consolidated balance sheets reflects the effective portions of cumulative changes in the fair value of derivatives in qualifying cash flow hedge relationships 
asset impairment 
long lived assets are reviewed for impairment annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
impairment exists if estimated future undiscounted cash flows associated with long lived assets are not sufficient to recover the carrying value of such assets 
when impairment exists the long lived asset is adjusted to its respective fair value 
we consider projected future undiscounted cash flows  trends  strategic decisions regarding future development plans  and other factors in our assessment of whether impairment conditions exist 
while we believe our estimates of future cash flows are reasonable  different assumptions regarding such factors as market rents  economies  and occupancies could significantly affect these estimates 
in estimating fair value  management uses appraisals  management estimates  or discounted cash flow calculations 
in addition  we continually evaluate our investments in joint ventures and mezzanine construction financing and if we believe there is an other than temporary decline in market value  or if it is probable we will not collect all interest and principal in accordance with the terms of the mezzanine loan  we will record an impairment charge based on these evaluations 
in general  we provide mezzanine loans to affiliated joint ventures constructing or operating multifamily assets 
while we believe it is currently probable we will collect all scheduled principal and interest with respect to these development loans  current market conditions with respect to credit availability and with respect to real estate market fundamentals inject a significant amount of uncertainty into the environment 
given this  any future adverse development in market conditions would cause us to re evaluate our conclusions  and could result in material impairment charges with respect to our mezzanine loans 
the value of our properties held for development depends on market conditions  including estimates of the project start date as well as estimates of future demand of multifamily communities 
we have analyzed trends and other information related to each potential development and have incorporated this information as well as our current outlook into the assumptions we use in our impairment analyses 
due to the judgment and assumptions applied in the estimation process with respect to impairments  including the fact that limited market information regarding the value of comparable land exists at this time  it is possible actual results could differ substantially from those estimated 
we believe the carrying value of our operating real estate assets  properties under development  and land is currently recoverable 
however  if market conditions worsen beyond our current expectations  or if changes in our development strategy significantly affect any key assumptions used in our fair value calculations  we may need to take additional charges in future periods for impairments related to existing assets 
any such non cash charges would have an adverse effect on our consolidated financial position and results of operations 
we do not purchase land for resale 
however  when we own land or communities which no longer fit into our plans and we determine the best use of the asset is the sale of the asset  the asset is accounted for as properties held for sale  including land  assuming the held for sale criteria defined in statement of financial accounting standards sfas  accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  are met 
we record land held for sale at the lesser of its carrying value or fair value less estimated costs to sell 
recent accounting pronouncements in september  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas  fair value measurements 
sfas defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value in gaap  and expands disclosures about fair value measurements 
the statement does not require new fair value measurements  but is applied to the extent other accounting pronouncements require or permit fair value measurements 
the statement emphasizes fair value as a market based measurement which should be determined based on assumptions market participants would use in pricing an asset or a liability 
in february  the fasb issued fsp  effective date of fasb statement  which deferred the effective date of sfas for us to january  for all nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities  except for those which are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis 
we have adopted fas for nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities effective january   and this adoption has not and is not expected to materially affect how we determine fair value 

table of contents in december  the fasb issued sfas r  business combinations  which replaced sfas  business combinations 
sfas r applies to all transactions or events in which an entity obtains control of one or more businesses 
sfas r requires the acquiring entity in a business combination to recognize the full fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in the transaction whether a full or partial acquisition  establishes the acquisition date fair value as the measurement objective for all assets acquired and liabilities assumed  requires expensing of most transaction and restructuring costs  and requires the acquirer to disclose to investors and other users all of the information needed to evaluate and understand the nature and financial impact of the business combination 
sfas r is effective for us for business combinations made on or after january  we expect the adoption of sfas r to have a material effect on our accounting for future acquisitions of properties  which may fall under the definition of a business  as most transaction costs associated with such acquisitions will be expensed as opposed to the prior treatment of such charges as capitalized costs 
in december  the fasb issued sfas  noncontrolling interests in consolidated financial statements  an amendment of arb sfas clarifies a noncontrolling interest in a subsidiary is an ownership interest in a consolidated entity which should be reported as equity in the parent s consolidated financial statements 
sfas requires a reconciliation of the beginning and ending balances of equity attributable to non controlling interests and disclosure  on the face of the consolidated income statements  of those amounts of consolidated net income attributable to the non controlling interests  eliminating the past practice of reporting these amounts as an adjustment in arriving at consolidated net income 
sfas also requires a parent to recognize a gain or loss in net income when a subsidiary is deconsolidated and requires the parent to attribute to a noncontrolling interest its share of losses  even if such treatment results in a deficit non controlling interests balance within the parent s equity accounts 
sfas is effective for us on january  and most provisions will be applied retrospectively 
we are currently evaluating the effects  if any  the adoption of sfas may have on our financial statements 
in june  the fasb issued fasb staff position fsp  determining whether instruments granted in share based payment transactions are participating securities 
fsp affects entities which accrue non returnable cash dividends on share based payment awards during the awards service period 
the fasb concluded unvested share based payment awards which are entitled to non forfeitable cash dividends  whether paid or unpaid  are participating securities and are participants of undistributed earnings 
because the awards are considered participating securities  the issuer is required to apply the two class method of computing basic and diluted earnings per share which involves separate computations for common shares and participating securities 
as we do accrue and pay non forfeitable cash dividends on unvested share based payment awards  these types of awards are considered participating securities and will be included in our earnings per share calculation in future periods 
fsp is effective for us on january  and will require retrospective application 
the retrospective application on our adoption of this fsp would not have had any impact on basic or diluted earnings per share for the year ended december  the impact of our adoption of this fsp on basic and diluted earnings per share for the year ended december  would result in a decrease of approximately and  respectively 
in october  the fasb issued fsp  determining the fair value of a financial asset when the market for that asset is not active 
fsp clarifies the application of sfas  fair value measurements in a non active market 
fsp became effective upon issuance  including prior periods for which financial statements have not been issued 
we adopted fsp upon issuance  and it did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial position  results of operations  or cash flows 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the table below provides information about our assets and our liabilities sensitive to changes in interest rates as of december  and december  december  weighted weighted weighted weighted average average average average amount maturity interest of amount maturity interest of in millions in years rate total in millions in years rate total fixed rate debt variable rate debt excludes balances outstanding under our unsecured line of credit  which are included in variable rate debt 
includes a million term loan entered into in and million of a construction loan entered into in which has become effectively fixed by the use of an interest rate swap see discussion below 
we use variable rate indebtedness available under our revolving credit facility to initially fund acquisitions and our development pipeline 
to the extent we incur additional variable rate indebtedness  our exposure to increases in interest rates would increase 
for fixed rate debt  interest rate changes affect the fair market value but do not impact net income to common shareholders or cash flows 
conversely  for floating rate debt  interest rate changes generally do not affect the fair market value but do impact net income to common shareholders and cash flows  assuming other factors are held constant 
holding other variables constant  a one percentage point variance in interest rates would change the unrealized fair market value of the fixed rate debt by approximately million 
the net income available to common shareholders and cash flows impact on the next year resulting from a one percentage point variance in interest rates on floating rate debt  excluding debt effectively fixed by interest rate swap agreements described below  would be approximately million  holding all other variables constant 
we currently use interest rate caps and swaps to reduce the impact of interest rate fluctuations on certain variable indebtedness  not for trading or speculative purposes 
under the cap and swap agreements we agree to pay a counterparty the interest that would have been incurred on a fixed principal amount at a fixed interest rate  and the counterparty agrees to pay us the interest rate that would have been incurred on the same principal amount at an assumed floating interest rate tied to a particular market index 
as of december   the effect of our swap agreements was to fix the interest rate on approximately million of our variable rate debt 
had the swap agreements not been in place during  our annual interest costs would have been approximately million lower  based on balances and reported interest rates through the year as the variable interest rates were less than the effective interest rates on the associated swap agreements 
additionally  if the variable interest rates on this debt had been basis points higher through and the swap agreements not been in place  our annual interest cost would have been approximately million lower 
derivative financial investments expose us to credit risk in the event of non performance by the counterparties under the terms of the interest rate hedge agreements 
we believe we minimize our credit risk on these transactions by dealing with major  creditworthy financial institutions 
as part of our on going control procedures  we monitor the credit ratings of counterparties and our exposure to any single entity  thus minimizing credit risk concentration 
we believe the likelihood of realized losses from counterparty non performance is remote
