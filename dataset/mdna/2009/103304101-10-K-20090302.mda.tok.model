risk factors investment in our securities is subject to risks inherent to our business 
the material risks and uncertainties that management believes affect us are described below 
before making an investment decision  the investor should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described below together with all of the other information included or incorporated by reference in this report  including the pending litigation discussed in this report  which provides a description of our current material litigation claims and assessments 
the risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones facing us 
additional risks and uncertainties that management is not aware of or that is currently deemed immaterial may also adversely affect our business operations 
this report is qualified in its entirety by these risk factors 
if any of the following risks actually occur  our business  financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 
if this were to happen  the value of our securities  including our common stock  could decline significantly  and the investor could lose all or part of the investment 

table of contents we may incur impairments to goodwill  indefinite lived intangible assets  or long lived assets 
in accordance with the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  we test our goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment annually or if a triggering event occurs 
we perform the annual impairment testing for goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets in the second quarter of each fiscal year 
in addition  in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  we test long lived assets for impairment if a triggering event occurs 
significant negative industry or economic trends  including the market price of our common stock continuing to trade below its book value  reduced estimates of future cash flows  disruptions to our business  slower growth rates or lack of growth in our business  have resulted in significant write downs and impairment charges in  and  if such events continue  may indicate that additional impairment charges in future periods are required 
if we are required to record additional impairment charges  this could have a material adverse affect on our consolidated financial statements 
for example  for the year ended december   we recorded million in aggregate non cash impairment charges to write down certain portions of our goodwill  intangible assets and other long lived assets to their fair value at december  the impairment test for these assets was principally due to the decline in our stock price that caused our book value to exceed our market capitalization  which was an indication that these assets may not be recoverable 
the primary reason for these impairment charges relates to the ongoing recession  which has caused us to reduce our estimates for projected cash flows  has reduced overall industry valuations  and has caused an increase in discount rates in the credit and equity markets 
our business is particularly sensitive to reductions in discretionary consumer spending as a result of downturns in the economy 
consumer demand for casino hotel properties  such as ours  are particularly sensitive to downturns in the economy and the corresponding impact on discretionary spending on leisure activities 
changes in discretionary consumer spending or consumer preferences brought about by factors such as perceived or actual general economic conditions  the current housing crisis and the credit crisis  the impact of high energy and food costs  the increased cost of travel  the potential for continued bank failures  perceived or actual disposable consumer income and wealth  effects of the current recession and changes in consumer confidence in the economy  or fears of war and future acts of terrorism could further reduce customer demand for the amenities that we offer  thus imposing practical limits on pricing and harming our operations 
the current housing crisis and economic slowdown in the united states has resulted in a significant decline in the amount of tourism and spending in las vegas 
if this decline continues  our financial condition  results of operations and cash flows may be adversely affected 
our common stock price may fluctuate substantially  and a shareholder s investment could decline in value 
the market price of our common stock may fluctuate substantially due to many factors  including actual or anticipated fluctuations in our results of operations  announcements of significant acquisitions or other agreements by us or by our competitors  our sale of common stock or other securities in the future  trading volume of our common stock  conditions and trends in the gaming and destination entertainment industries  changes in the estimation of the future size and growth of our markets  and general economic conditions  including  without limitation  changes in the cost of fuel and air travel 
in addition  the stock market in general has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to companies operating performance 
broad market and industry factors may materially harm the market price of our common stock  regardless of our operating performance 
in the past  following periods of volatility in the market price of a company s securities  shareholder derivative lawsuits and or securities class action litigation has often been instituted against that company 
such litigation  if instituted against us  could result in substantial costs and a diversion of management s attention and resources 

table of contents intense competition exists in the gaming industry  and we expect competition to continue to intensify 
the gaming industry is highly competitive for both customers and employees  including those at the management level 
we compete with numerous casinos and hotel casinos of varying quality and size in market areas where our properties are located 
we also compete with other non gaming resorts and vacation destinations  and with various other casino and other entertainment businesses  and could compete with any new forms of gaming that may be legalized in the future 
the casino entertainment business is characterized by competitors that vary considerably in their size  quality of facilities  number of operations  brand identities  marketing and growth strategies  financial strength and capabilities  level of amenities  management talent and geographic diversity 
in most markets  we compete directly with other casino facilities operating in the immediate and surrounding market areas 
in some markets  we face competition from nearby markets in addition to direct competition within our market areas 
in recent years  with fewer new markets opening for development  competition in existing markets has intensified 
we have invested in expanding existing facilities  developing new facilities  and acquiring established facilities in existing markets 
in addition  our competitors have also invested in expanding their existing facilities and developing new facilities 
this expansion of existing casino entertainment properties  the increase in the number of properties and the aggressive marketing strategies of many of our competitors have increased competition in many markets in which we compete  and this intense competition can be expected to continue 
if our competitors operate more successfully than we do  if they are more successful than us in attracting and retaining employees  if their properties are enhanced or expanded  or if additional hotels and casinos are established in and around the locations in which we conduct business  we may lose market share or the ability to attract or retain employees 
in particular  the expansion of casino gaming in or near any geographic area from which we attract or expect to attract a significant number of our customers could have a significant adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we also compete with legalized gaming from casinos located on native american tribal lands 
expansion of native american gaming in areas located near our properties  or in areas in or near those from which we draw our customers  could have an adverse effect on our operating results 
for example  a federally recognized native american tribe commenced operations of a casino located near blue chip in august although we have expanded our facility at blue chip in an effort to be more competitive in this market  this casino has had  and could continue to have  an adverse impact on the operations of blue chip 

table of contents our expansion  development  investment and renovation projects may face significant risks inherent in construction projects or implementing a new marketing strategy  including receipt of necessary government approvals 
we regularly evaluate expansion  development  investment and renovation opportunities 
on january   we announced our planned las vegas strip development  echelon  which  when  or if  we resume construction  would be the largest and most expensive development project we have undertaken to date 
in addition  we recently announced the completion of the new hotel at blue chip and that borgata recently completed the water club  a second hotel at the property 
we also closed on our acquisition of dania jai alai in march these projects and any other development projects we may undertake will be subject to the many risks inherent in the expansion or renovation of an existing enterprise or construction of a new enterprise  including unanticipated design  construction  regulatory  environmental and operating problems and lack of demand for our projects 
our current and future projects could also experience delays and significant cost increases  shortages of materials  shortages of skilled labor or work stoppages  poor performance or nonperformance by any of our joint venture partners or other third parties on whom we place reliance  unforeseen construction scheduling  engineering  environmental  permitting  construction or geological problems  and weather interference  floods  fires or other casualty losses 
the completion dates of any of our projects could differ significantly from expectations for construction related or other reasons 
for example  on august   we announced that  due to the difficult environment in the capital markets  as well as weak economic conditions  our echelon project would be delayed 
due to the continued deterioration in credit market conditions and the economic outlook  it is unlikely that we will resume construction in in addition  actual costs and construction periods for any of our projects can differ significantly from initial expectations 
our initial project costs and construction periods are based upon budgets  conceptual design documents and construction schedule estimates prepared at inception of the project in consultation with architects and contractors 
many of these costs can increase over time as the project is built to completion 
for example  prior to delaying construction at echelon  we announced that the estimated cost of the wholly owned portion of echelon increased by approximately billion  principally as a result of additional scope  larger guest rooms and suites  and increased estimated construction costs  and that the estimated development costs associated with certain joint venture properties to be developed and constructed in connection with echelon increased by approximately million 
we have incurred significant costs in connection with delaying construction of echelon and anticipate that additional cost increases could continue to occur if we recommence development of echelon 
the cost of any project may vary significantly from initial budget expectations and we may have a limited amount of capital resources to fund cost overruns 
if we cannot finance cost overruns on a timely basis  the completion of one or more projects may be delayed until adequate funding is available 
we can provide no assurance that any project will be completed on time  if at all  or within established budgets  or that any project will result in increased earnings to us 
significant delays  cost overruns  or failures of our projects to achieve market acceptance could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
furthermore  our projects may not help us compete with new or increased competition in our markets 
certain permits  licenses and approvals necessary for some of our current or anticipated projects have not yet been obtained 
the scope of the approvals required for expansion  development  investment or renovation projects can be extensive and may include gaming approvals  state and local land use permits and building and zoning permits 
unexpected changes or concessions required by local  state or federal regulatory authorities could involve significant additional costs and delay the scheduled openings of the facilities 
we may not obtain the necessary permits  licenses and approvals within the anticipated time frames  or at all 
in addition  although we design our projects to minimize disruption of our existing business operations  expansion and renovation projects require  from time to time  all or portions of affected existing operations to be closed or disrupted 
for example  after closing the stardust in november  we demolished the property in march to make way for the development of echelon 
any significant disruption in operations of a property could have a significant adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 

table of contents we face risks associated with growth and acquisitions 
as part of our business strategy  we regularly evaluate opportunities for growth through development of gaming operations in existing or new markets  through acquiring other gaming entertainment facilities or through redeveloping our existing gaming facilities 
for example  in  we completed the barbary coast exchange transaction and completed the acquisition of dania jai alai 
in  we completed the new hotel project at blue chip 
we may also pursue expansion opportunities  including joint ventures  in jurisdictions where casino gaming is not currently permitted in order to be prepared to develop projects upon approval of casino gaming 
the expansion of our operations  whether through acquisitions  development or internal growth  could divert management s attention and could also cause us to incur substantial costs  including legal  professional and consulting fees 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to identify  acquire  develop or profitably manage additional companies or operations or successfully integrate such companies or operations into our existing operations without substantial costs  delays or other problems 
additionally  there can be no assurance that we will receive gaming or other necessary licenses or approvals for our new projects or that gaming will be approved in jurisdictions where it is not currently approved 
ballot measures or other voter approved initiatives to allow gaming in jurisdictions where gaming  or certain types of gaming such as slots  was not previously permitted could be challenged  and  if such challenges are successful  these ballot measures or initiatives could be invalidated 
for example  the florida ballot measure to amend the florida constitution to allow florida voters to approve slot machines at certain pari mutuel gaming facilities in miami dade and broward counties the slot initiative  where dania jai alai is located  has been subject to legal challenge since and remains unresolved 
if the slot initiative is ultimately invalidated  we would not be permitted to operate slot machines at the dania jai alai facility  which would materially affect any potential revenue and cash flow expected from the dania jai alai facility 
furthermore  there can be no assurance that there will not be similar or other challenges to legalized gaming in existing or current markets in which we may operate or have development plans  and successful challenges to legalized gaming could require us to abandon or substantially curtail our operations or development plans in those locations  which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
on august   we announced that  due to the difficult environment in both the capital markets and the economy  our echelon project would be delayed 
due to the continued deterioration in credit market conditions and the economic outlook  it is unlikely that we will resume construction in we can provide no assurances regarding the timing or effects of our delay of construction at echelon and when  or if  construction will recommence  the effect that such delay will have on our business  operations or financial condition  the effect that such delay will have on our joint venture partners  and whether such participants or other echelon project participants will terminate their agreements or arrangements with us 
in addition  our agreements or arrangements with third parties could require additional fees or terms in connection with modifying their agreements that may be unfavorable to us  and we can provide no assurances that we will be able to reach agreement on any modified terms 
additionally  in february  management determined to indefinitely postpone redevelopment of our dania jai alai facility  and in connection with that determination we recorded an million non cash impairment charge to write off dania jai alai s intangible license right and write down its property and equipment to their estimated fair values 
our decision to postpone the development was based on numerous factors  including the introduction of expanded gaming at a nearby native american casino  the potential for additional casino gaming venues in florida  and the existing broward county pari mutuel casinos performing below our expectations for the market 
there can be no assurance that we will not face similar challenges and difficulties with respect to new development projects or expansion efforts that we may undertake  which could result in significant sunk costs that we may not be able to fully recoup or that otherwise have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
if we are unable to finance our expansion  development  investment and renovation projects  as well as other capital expenditures  through cash flow  borrowings under our bank credit facility and additional financings  our expansion  development  investment and renovation efforts will be jeopardized 
we intend to finance our current and future expansion  development  investment and renovation projects  as well as our other capital expenditures  primarily with cash flow from operations  borrowings under our bank credit facility  and equity or debt financings 
if we are unable to finance our current or future expansion  development  investment and renovation 
table of contents projects  or our other capital expenditures  we will have to adopt one or more alternatives  such as reducing  delaying or abandoning planned expansion  development  investment and renovation projects as well as other capital expenditures  selling assets  restructuring debt  reducing the amount or suspending or discontinuing the distribution of dividends  obtaining additional equity financing or joint venture partners  or modifying our bank credit facility 
these sources of funds may not be sufficient to finance our expansion  development  investment and renovation projects  and other financing may not be available on acceptable terms  in a timely manner  or at all 
in addition  our existing indebtedness contains certain restrictions on our ability to incur additional indebtedness 
if we are unable to secure additional financing  we could be forced to limit or suspend expansion  development  investment and renovation projects and other capital expenditures  which may adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
furthermore  there have recently been significant disruptions in the global capital markets that have adversely impacted the ability of borrowers to access capital 
we anticipate that these disruptions may continue for the foreseeable future 
we anticipate that we will be able to fund our currently active expansion projects using cash flows from operations and availability under our bank credit facility to the extent that availability exists after we meet our working capital needs 
in addition  we recently announced that we submitted a nonbinding indication of interest to station casinos  inc station  and that if a transaction with station were to occur  we would use availability under our bank credit facility to finance such transaction 
if availability under our bank credit facility does not exist or we are otherwise unable to make sufficient borrowings thereunder  any additional financing that is needed may not be available to us or  if available  may not be on terms favorable to us 
as a result  if we are unable to obtain adequate project financing in a timely manner or at all  we may be forced to sell assets in order to raise capital for projects  limit the scope of  or defer  such projects  or cancel the projects altogether 
given the current state of the credit markets and the overall economy  we announced  on august   that we are delaying our echelon project 
in the event that capital markets do not improve and we or our joint venture participants are unable to access capital with more favorable terms  additional equity and or credit support may be necessary to obtain construction financing for the remaining cost of the project 
this additional equity and or credit support may need to be contributed by us or our joint venture participants  or from both parties  and or from one or more additional equity sponsors 
if a joint venture obtains equity financing from additional sponsors  then our percentage interest in the project and resulting cash flows will be diluted 
if a joint venture is unable to obtain adequate project financing in a timely manner  or at all  we may be forced to sell assets in order to raise capital for the project  limit the scope of the project  defer the project  or cancel the project altogether 
if we are not ultimately successful in dismissing the action filed against treasure chest casino  we may potentially lose our ability to operate the treasure chest casino property and our business  financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected 
alvin c 
copeland  the sole shareholder deceased of an unsuccessful applicant for a riverboat license at the location of our treasure chest casino  has made several attempts to have the treasure chest license revoked and awarded to his company 
in and  copeland unsuccessfully opposed the renewal of the treasure chest license and has brought two separate legal actions against treasure chest 
in november  copeland objected to the relocation of treasure chest from the mississippi river to its current site on lake pontchartrain 
the predecessor to the louisiana gaming control board allowed the relocation over copeland s objection 
copeland then filed an appeal of the agency s decision with the nineteenth judicial district court 
through a number of amendments to the appeal  copeland unsuccessfully attempted to transform the appeal into a direct action suit and sought the revocation of the treasure chest license 
treasure chest intervened in the matter in order to protect its interests 
the appeal suit  as it related to treasure chest  was dismissed by the district court and that dismissal was upheld on appeal by the first circuit court of appeal 
additionally  in  copeland filed a direct action against treasure chest and certain other parties seeking the revocation of treasure chest s license  an award of the license to him  and monetary damages 
the suit was dismissed by the trial court  citing that copeland failed to state a claim on which relief could be granted 
the dismissal was appealed by copeland to the louisiana first circuit court of appeal 
on june   the first circuit court of appeal reversed the trial court s decision and remanded the matter to the trial court 
on january   we filed a motion to dismiss the matter and that motion was partially denied 
the court of appeal refused to reverse the denial of the motion to dismiss 
in may  we filed additional motions to dismiss on other grounds 
there was no activity regarding this matter during and  and the case was set to be dismissed by the court for failure to prosecute by the plaintiffs in mid may  however on may   the plaintiff filed a motion to set a hearing date related to the motions to dismiss 
the hearing was scheduled for september   at which time all parties agreed to postpone the hearing indefinitely 
mr 
copeland recently passed away and his son  the executor of his estate  has petitioned the court to be substituted as plaintiff in the case 
we currently are vigorously defending the lawsuit 
if this matter ultimately results in the treasure chest license being revoked  it could have a significant adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 

table of contents we are subject to extensive governmental gaming regulation and taxation policies  which may harm our business 
we are subject to a variety of regulations in the jurisdictions in which we operate 
regulatory authorities at the federal  state and local levels have broad powers with respect to the licensing of casino operations and may revoke  suspend  condition or limit our gaming or other licenses  impose substantial fines and take other actions  any one of which could have a significant adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
a more detailed description of the governmental gaming regulations to which we are subject is included in exhibit to this annual report on form k and incorporated herein by reference 
if additional gaming regulations are adopted in a jurisdiction in which we operate  such regulations could impose restrictions or costs that could have a significant adverse effect on us 
from time to time  various proposals are introduced in the legislatures of some of the jurisdictions in which we have existing or planned operations that  if enacted  could adversely affect the tax  regulatory  operational or other aspects of the gaming industry and our company 
legislation of this type may be enacted in the future 
for example  on january   the new jersey state legislature enacted the smoke free air act  effective april  this law called for smoke free environments in essentially all indoor workplaces and areas open to the public  including places of business and service related activities 
the law contained several exemptions  including an exemption for all casino floor space and of a hotel s designated hotel rooms 
on february   the atlantic city council promulgated the first of a series of local ordinances that were more restrictive than the aforementioned state law 
specifically  the first ordinance reduced the casino floor exemption to of a casino s floor space 
ultimately  such of casino floor space in which smoking would be permitted was required to be enclosed and separately ventilated  however  before any gaming enclosures were constructed in accordance with this first local ordinance  the atlantic city council voted an amendment to prohibit smoking on of the casino floor  limiting smoking to enclosed and separately ventilated non gaming lounges 
this revised ban became effective october   prior to which several atlantic city casinos  including borgata  had constructed the permitted non gaming smoking lounges 
on october   after the smoking ban with non gaming lounges had been in place for days  the atlantic city council voted to suspend for one year the then current ordinance and reverted back to the non smoking and smoking configuration  without the requirement of enclosures 
the avowed reason for the suspension of the smoking ban ordinance was the current national and regional economic crisis 
the ruling further states that the smoking ban ordinance will be reconsidered on or about the one year anniversary date of the passage date of the ordinance  which will be on or about october  as per applicable law  this most recent ordinance became effective on november   prior to which the smoking ban was in effect for days 
thereafter  smoking will be permitted once again on of a casino s floor space and prohibited on of a casino s floor space  as was the case from april  until october  under all versions of the atlantic city council ordinance  including the current amendment  smoking has been  and will remain  permissible in of a hotel s designated hotel rooms  consistent with new jersey state law 
this legislation  and the local ordinance  could materially impact borgata s results of operations  similar legislation in other jurisdictions in which we operate could materially impact the results of operations of our other properties 
in addition  the state of illinois enacted a smoking ban in all casinos  effective january  the federal government has also previously considered a federal tax on casino revenues and may consider such a tax in the future 
in addition  gaming companies are currently subject to significant state and local taxes and fees  in addition to normal federal and state corporate income taxes  and such taxes and fees are subject to increase at any time 
for example  in november  nevada s largest teachers union  the nevada state educational association  submitted a petition to the nevada secretary of state s office seeking to increase the gross gaming revenue tax from to 
if this petition is successful  it could have a material adverse affect on our results of operations 
in june  the illinois legislature passed certain amendments to the riverboat gambling act  which affected the tax rate at par a dice 
the legislation  which imposes an incremental tax on adjusted gross gaming revenues  was retroactive to july  as a result of this legislation  we were required to pay additional taxes  resulting in a million tax assessment in june also  in may  blue chip received a valuation notice indicating an unanticipated increase of nearly to its assessed property value as of january  at that time  we estimated that the increase in assessed property value could result in a property tax assessment ranging between million and million for the eighteen month period ended june  we recorded an additional charge of million during the three months ended june  to increase our property tax liability to million at june   as we believed that was the most likely amount to be assessed within the range 
in december  we received a property tax bill related to our tax assessment for million 
as we have appealed the assessment  indiana statutes allow for a minimum required payment of million  which was paid against the million assessment in january in february  we received a notice of revaluation  which reduced the property s assessed value by million and the tax assessment by approximately million per year 
we believe the assessment for the thirty six month 
table of contents period ended december  could result in a property tax assessment ranging between million and million 
we have accrued a property tax liability of approximately million as of december   based on what we believe to be the most likely assessment within our range  once all appeals have been exhausted  however  we can provide no assurances that the estimated amount will approximate the actual amount 
the final assessment  post appeals  as well as the march  and assessment notices  which have not been received as of december   could result in further adjustment to our estimated property tax liability at blue chip 
if there is any material increase in state and local taxes and fees  our business  financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected 
our directors  officers and other key employees must meet approval standards of certain state regulatory authorities 
if state regulatory authorities were to find a person occupying any such position unsuitable  we would be required to sever our relationship with that person 
certain public and private issuances of securities and other transactions we are party to also require the approval of some state regulatory authorities 
in addition to gaming regulations  we are also subject to various federal  state and local laws and regulations affecting businesses in general 
these laws and regulations include  but are not limited to  restrictions and conditions concerning alcoholic beverages  environmental matters  employees  currency transactions  taxation  zoning and building codes  and marketing and advertising 
such laws and regulations could change or could be interpreted differently in the future  or new laws and regulations could be enacted 
for example  on july   new jersey gaming properties  including borgata  were required to temporarily close their casinos for three days as a result of a new jersey statewide government shutdown that affected certain new jersey state employees required to be at casinos when they are open for business 
in addition  nevada recently enacted legislation that eliminated  in most instances  and  for certain pre existing development projects such as echelon or  otherwise reduced  property tax breaks and retroactively eliminated certain sales tax exemptions offered as incentives to companies developing projects that meet certain environmental green standards 
as a result  we  along with other companies developing projects that meet such standards  may not realize the full tax benefits that were originally anticipated 
we own facilities that are located in areas that experience extreme weather conditions 
we own facilities that are located in areas that experience extreme weather conditions  including  but not limited to  hurricanes 
extreme weather conditions may interrupt our operations  damage our properties and reduce the number of customers who visit our facilities in the affected areas 
for example  our treasure chest casino  which is located near new orleans  louisiana  suffered minor damage and was closed on august  for eight days over labor day weekend  as the new orleans area was under mandatory evacuation orders during hurricane gustav 
hurricane ike resulted in a two day closure starting september at treasure chest 
additionally  at our delta downs racetrack casino hotel  which is located in southwest louisiana  hurricane gustav forced us to close for six days  beginning on august   and hurricane ike led to a second closure from september  to september  the hurricane closures during the three months ended september  totaled days for treasure chest and days for delta downs  including two full weekends at both properties 
while we maintain insurance coverage that may cover certain of the costs that we incur as a result of some extreme weather conditions  our coverage is subject to deductibles and limits on maximum benefits 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to fully collect  if at all  on any claims resulting from extreme weather conditions 
if any of our properties are damaged or if their operations are disrupted as a result of extreme weather in the future  or if extreme weather adversely impacts general economic or other conditions in the areas in which our properties are located or from which they draw their patrons  our business  financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected 
our insurance coverage may not be adequate to cover all possible losses that our properties could suffer 
in addition  our insurance costs may increase and we may not be able to obtain similar insurance coverage in the future 
although we have all risk property insurance coverage for our operating properties covering damage caused by a casualty loss such as fire  natural disasters  acts of war or terrorism  each policy has certain exclusions 
in addition  our property insurance coverage is in an amount that may be significantly less than the expected replacement cost of rebuilding the facilities if there was a total loss 
our level of insurance coverage also may not be adequate to cover all losses in the event of a major casualty 
in addition  certain casualty events  such as labor strikes  nuclear events  acts of war  loss of income due to cancellation of room reservations or conventions due to fear of terrorism  deterioration or corrosion  insect or animal damage and pollution  may not be covered at all under our policies 
therefore  certain acts could expose us to substantial uninsured losses 

table of contents we also have builder s risk insurance coverage for our development and expansion projects  including echelon 
builder s risk insurance provides coverage for projects during their construction for damage caused by a casualty loss 
in general  our builder s risk coverage is subject to the same exclusions  risks and deficiencies as those described above for our all risk property coverage 
our level of builder s risk insurance coverage may not be adequate to cover all losses in the event of a major casualty 
in addition to the damage caused to our properties by a casualty loss  we may suffer business disruption as a result of these events or be subject to claims by third parties that may be injured or harmed 
while we carry business interruption insurance and general liability insurance  this insurance may not be adequate to cover all losses in any such event 
we renew our insurance policies other than our builder s risk insurance on an annual basis 
the cost of coverage may become so high that we may need to further reduce our policy limits or agree to certain exclusions from our coverage 
our debt instruments and other material agreements require us to maintain a certain minimum level of insurance coverage 
failure to satisfy these requirements could result in an event of default under these debt instruments or material agreements 
our facilities  including our riverboats and dockside facilities  are subject to risks relating to mechanical failure and regulatory compliance 
generally  all of our facilities are subject to the risk that operations could be halted for a temporary or extended period of time  as the result of casualty  forces of nature  mechanical failure  or extended or extraordinary maintenance  among other causes 
in addition  our gaming operations  including those conducted on riverboats or at dockside facilities could be damaged or halted due to extreme weather conditions 
we currently conduct our treasure chest  par a dice  blue chip and sam s town shreveport gaming operations on riverboats 
each of our riverboats must comply with us coast guard requirements as to boat design  on board facilities  equipment  personnel and safety 
each riverboat must hold a certificate of inspection for stabilization and flotation  and may also be subject to local zoning codes 
the us coast guard requirements establish design standards  set limits on the operation of the vessels and require individual licensing of all personnel involved with the operation of the vessels 
loss of a vessel s certificate of inspection or american bureau of shipping approval would preclude its use as a casino 
us coast guard regulations require a hull inspection for all riverboats at five year intervals 
under certain circumstances  alternative hull inspections may be approved 
the us coast guard may require that such hull inspections be conducted at a dry docking facility  and if so required  the cost of travel to and from such docking facility  as well as the time required for inspections of the affected riverboats  could be significant 
to date  the us coast guard has allowed in place inspections of our riverboats 
the us coast guard may not allow these types of inspections in the future 
the loss of a dockside casino or riverboat casino from service for any period of time could adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
us coast guard regulations also require us to prepare and follow certain security programs 
in  we implemented the american gaming association s alternative security program at our riverboat casinos and dockside facilities 
the american gaming association s alternative security program is specifically designed to address maritime security requirements at riverboat casinos and their respective dockside facilities 
changes to these regulations could adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we draw a significant percentage of our customers from limited geographic regions 
events adversely impacting the economy or these regions  including man made or natural disasters  may also impact our business 
california  fremont and main street station draw a substantial portion of their customers from the hawaiian market 
for the year ended december   patrons from hawaii comprised approximately of the room nights sold at california  at fremont and at main street station 
decreases in discretionary consumer spending due to the recession  as well as an increase in fuel costs or transportation prices  a decrease in airplane seat availability  or a deterioration of relations with tour and travel agents  particularly as they affect travel between the hawaiian market and our facilities  could adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 

table of contents our las vegas properties also draw a substantial number of customers from certain other specific geographic areas  including locally  southern california and arizona 
native american casinos in california and other parts of the united states have diverted some potential visitors away from nevada  which has had and could continue to have a negative effect on nevada gaming markets 
in addition  due to our significant concentration of properties in nevada  any man made or natural disasters in or around nevada  or the areas from which we draw customers to our las vegas properties  could have a significant adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
each of our properties located outside of nevada depends primarily on visitors from their respective surrounding regions and are subject to comparable risk 
the outbreak of public health threats at any of our properties or in the areas in which they are located  or the perception that such threats exist  as well as adverse economic conditions that affect the national or regional economies  whether resulting from war  terrorist activities or other geopolitical conflict  weather  general or localized economic downturns or related events or other factors  could have a significant adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
in addition  to the extent that the airline industry is negatively impacted due to the effects of the recession  outbreak of war  public health threats  terrorist or similar activity  increased security restrictions or the public s general reluctance to travel by air  our business  financial condition and results of operations could be significantly adversely affected 
energy price increases may adversely affect our cost of operations and our revenues 
our casino properties use significant amounts of electricity  natural gas and other forms of energy 
in addition  our hawaiian air charter operation uses a significant amount of jet fuel 
while no shortages of energy or fuel have been experienced to date  substantial increases in energy and fuel prices  including jet fuel prices  in the united states have  and may continue to  negatively affect our results of operations 
the extent of the impact is subject to the magnitude and duration of the energy and fuel price increases  of which the impact could be material 
in addition  energy and gasoline price increases could result in a decline of disposable income of potential customers  an increase in the cost of travel and a corresponding decrease in visitation and spending at our properties  which could have a significant adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
certain of our stockholders own large interests in our capital stock and may significantly influence our affairs 
william s 
boyd  our executive chairman of the board of directors  together with his immediate family  beneficially owned approximately of the company s outstanding shares of common stock as of december  as such  the boyd family has the ability to significantly influence our affairs  including the election of members of our board of directors and  except as otherwise provided by law  approving or disapproving other matters submitted to a vote of our stockholders  including a merger  consolidation  or sale of assets 
some of our hotels and casinos are located on leased property 
if we default on one or more leases  the applicable lessors could terminate the affected leases and we could lose possession of the affected hotel and or casino 
we lease certain parcels of land on which the orleans  suncoast  sam s town tunica  treasure chest and sam s town shreveport are located 
in addition  we lease other parcels of land on which portions of the california and the fremont are located 
if we were to default on any one or more of these leases  the applicable lessors could terminate the affected leases and we could lose possession of the affected land and any improvements on the land  including the hotels and casinos 
this would have a significant adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations as we would then be unable to operate all or portions of the affected facilities 
we have a significant amount of indebtedness 
we had total consolidated long term debt  net of current maturities  of approximately billion at december  we expect that our long term indebtedness will substantially increase in connection with capital expenditures that we anticipate making as a result of our planned expansion  development  investment and renovation projects 
this indebtedness could have important consequences  including difficulty in satisfying our obligations under our current indebtedness  increasing our vulnerability to general adverse economic and industry conditions  
table of contents requiring us to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flows from operations to payments on our indebtedness  which would reduce the availability of our cash flows to fund working capital  capital expenditures  expansion efforts and other general corporate purposes  limiting our flexibility in planning for  or reacting to  changes in our business and the industry in which we operate  placing us at a disadvantage compared to our competitors that have less debt  and limiting  along with the financial and other restrictive covenants in our indebtedness  among other things  our ability to borrow additional funds 
failure to comply with these covenants could result in an event of default  which  if not cured or waived  could have a significant adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
our debt instruments contain  and any future debt instruments likely will contain  a number of restrictive covenants that impose significant operating and financial restrictions on us  including restrictions on our ability to  among other things incur additional debt  including providing guarantees or credit support  incur liens securing indebtedness or other obligations  dispose of assets  make certain acquisitions  pay dividends or make distributions and make other restricted payments  enter into sale and leaseback transactions  engage in any new businesses  and enter into transactions with our stockholders and our affiliates 
in addition  our bank credit facility requires us to maintain certain ratios  including a minimum interest coverage ratio of to and a total leverage ratio that adjusts over the life of the bank credit facility 
our future debt agreements could contain financial or other covenants more restrictive than those applicable under our existing instruments 
our current debt service requirements on our bank credit facility primarily consist of interest payments on outstanding indebtedness 
the bank credit facility is a billion revolving credit facility that matures in may subject to certain limitations  we may  at any time  without the consent of the lenders under our bank credit facility  request incremental commitments to increase the size of the bank credit facility  or request new commitments to add a term loan facility  by up to an aggregate amount of billion 
debt service requirements under our current outstanding senior subordinated notes consist of semi annual interest payments based upon fixed annual interest rates ranging from to and repayment of our senior subordinated notes due on december   april   and february  for each of our  and senior subordinated notes  respectively 
we are in compliance with the total leverage ratio covenant under our bank credit facility  which was to at december  during  assuming our current level of consolidated funded indebtedness remains constant  we estimate that a or greater decline in our twelve month trailing consolidated ebitda  as compared to  would cause us to exceed our maximum total leverage ratio covenant for that period 
however  in the event that we project that our consolidated ebitda may decline by or more  we could implement certain actions in an effort to minimize the possibility of a breach of the total leverage ratio covenant 
these actions may include  among others  reducing payroll and certain other operating costs  deferring or eliminating certain maintenance  expansion or other capital expenditures  reducing our outstanding indebtedness through repurchases or redemption  selling assets or issuing equity 
our ability to make payments on and to refinance our indebtedness  and to fund planned capital expenditures and expansion efforts will depend upon our ability to generate cash in the future 
this  to a certain extent  is subject to general economic  financial  competitive  legislative  regulatory and other factors that are beyond our control 
it is unlikely that our business will generate sufficient cash flows from operations  or that future borrowings will be available to us under our bank credit facility  in amounts sufficient to enable us to pay our indebtedness as it matures and to fund our other liquidity needs 

table of contents we believe that we will need to refinance all or part of our indebtedness at or prior to each maturity  however  we may not be able to refinance any of our indebtedness on commercially reasonable terms or at all 
we may have to adopt one or more alternatives  such as reducing or delaying planned expenses and capital expenditures  selling assets  restructuring debt  or obtaining additional equity or debt financing or joint venture partners 
these financing strategies may not be affected on satisfactory terms  if at all 
in addition  certain state laws contain restrictions on the ability of companies engaged in the gaming business to undertake certain financing transactions  therefore preventing us from obtaining necessary capital

item legal proceedings copeland 
alvin c 
copeland  the sole shareholder deceased of an unsuccessful applicant for a riverboat license at the location of our treasure chest casino  has made several attempts to have the treasure chest license revoked and awarded to his company 
in and  copeland unsuccessfully opposed the renewal of the treasure chest license and has brought two separate legal actions against treasure chest 
in november  copeland objected to the relocation of treasure chest from the mississippi river to its current site on lake pontchartrain 
the predecessor to the louisiana gaming control board allowed the relocation over copeland s objection 
copeland then filed an appeal of the agency s decision with the nineteenth judicial district court 
through a number of amendments to the appeal  copeland unsuccessfully attempted to transform the appeal into a direct action suit and sought the revocation of the treasure chest license 
treasure chest intervened in the matter in order to protect its interests 
the appeal suit  as it related to treasure chest  was dismissed by the district court and that dismissal was upheld on appeal by the first circuit court of appeal 
additionally  in  copeland filed a direct action against treasure chest and certain other parties seeking the revocation of treasure chest s license  an award of the license to him  and monetary damages 
the suit was dismissed by the trial court  citing that copeland failed to state a claim on which relief could be granted 
the dismissal was appealed by copeland to the louisiana first circuit court of appeal 
on june   the first circuit court of appeal reversed the trial court s decision and remanded the matter to the trial court 
on january   we filed a motion to dismiss the matter and that motion was partially denied 
the court of appeal refused to reverse the denial of the motion to dismiss 
in may  we filed additional motions to dismiss on other grounds 
there was no activity regarding this matter during and  and the case was set to be dismissed by the court for failure to prosecute by the plaintiffs in mid may  however on may   the plaintiff filed a motion to set a hearing date related to the motions to dismiss 
the hearing was scheduled for september   at which time all parties agreed to postpone the hearing indefinitely 
mr 
copeland recently passed away and his son  the executor of his estate  has petitioned the court to be substituted as plaintiff in the case 
we currently are vigorously defending the lawsuit 
if this matter ultimately results in the treasure chest license being revoked  it could have a significant adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we are also parties to various legal proceedings arising in the ordinary course of business 
we believe that  except for the copeland matter discussed above  all pending claims  if adversely decided  would not have a material adverse effect on our business  financial position or results of operations

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations we are a diversified operator of wholly owned gaming entertainment properties and one joint venture property 
headquartered in las vegas  we have gaming operations in nevada  illinois  louisiana  mississippi  indiana and new jersey  which we aggregate in order to present four reportable segments las vegas locals  downtown las vegas  midwest and south  and our joint venture that owns a limited liability company  operating borgata hotel casino spa in atlantic city  new jersey

due to the disposition of the barbary coast in february and the south coast in october  the operating results from these two properties are classified as discontinued operations in our consolidated statements of operations for the years ended december  and effective april   we reclassified the reporting of our midwest and south segment to exclude the results of dania jai alai  our pari mutuel jai alai facility  since it does not share similar economic characteristics with our other midwest and south operations  therefore  the results of dania jai alai are included as part of the other category for segment reporting

furthermore  corporate expense has been presented to include its portion of share based compensation expense 
all prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current year s presentation 
our main business emphasis is on slot revenues  which are highly dependent on the volume of customers at our properties 
gross revenues are one of the main performance indicators of our properties 
our properties have historically generated significant operating cash flow  with the majority of our revenue being cash based 
our industry is capital intensive  and we rely heavily on the ability of our properties to generate operating cash flow to repay debt financing  pay income taxes  fund maintenance capital expenditures  and provide excess cash for future development  acquisitions of our debt or equity securities  and the payment of dividends 
overall outlook over the past few years  we have been working to position our company for greater success by strengthening our existing operations and growing through capital investment and other strategic initiatives

the impairment test for these assets was principally due to the decline in our stock price that caused our book value to exceed our market capitalization  which was an indication that these assets may not be recoverable 
the primary reason for these impairment charges relates to the ongoing recession  which has caused us to reduce our estimates for projected cash flows  has reduced overall industry valuations  and has caused an increase in discount rates in the credit and equity markets 
echelon on august   due to the difficult environment in the capital markets  as well as weak economic conditions  we announced the delay of our multibillion dollar echelon development project on the las vegas strip

four fiscal quarters ending maximum total leverage ratio december  to march  through december  to march  to june  to september  to december  to march  to june  and each quarter thereafter to the foregoing description of the bank credit facility is qualified in its entirety by the full text of the first amended and restated credit agreement  dated as of may   among the company and certain other parties  which is incorporated herein by reference to exhibit of the company s quarterly report on form q for the quarter ended june  we believe we are in compliance with the bank credit facility covenants at december   which includes the total leverage ratio covenant  which is to at december  during  assuming our current level of consolidated funded indebtedness remains constant  we estimate that a or greater decline in our twelve month trailing consolidated ebitda  as compared to  would cause us to exceed our maximum total leverage ratio covenant for that period 
however  in the event that we project that our consolidated ebitda may decline by or more  we could implement certain actions in an effort to minimize the possibility of a breach of the total leverage ratio covenant 
these actions may include  among others  reducing payroll and certain other operating costs  deferring or eliminating certain maintenance  expansion or other capital expenditures  reducing our outstanding indebtedness through repurchases or redemption  selling assets or issuing equity 
senior subordinated notes 
debt service requirements under our current outstanding senior subordinated notes consist of semi annual interest payments based upon fixed annual interest rates ranging from to and repayment of our senior subordinated notes due on december   april   and february  for each of our  and senior subordinated notes  respectively 
these senior subordinated notes contain restrictions on  without limitation  i our ability and our restricted subsidiaries as defined in the indentures governing the notes ability to incur additional indebtedness  ii the payment of dividends and other distributions with respect to our capital stock and the stock of our restricted subsidiaries and the purchase  redemption or retirement of our capital stock and the stock of our restricted subsidiaries  iii the making of certain investments  iv asset sales  v the incurrence of liens  vi transactions with affiliates  vii payment restrictions affecting restricted subsidiaries  and viii certain consolidations  mergers and transfers of assets 
management believes that we are in compliance with the covenants related to notes outstanding at december  during the year ended december   we purchased and retired million principal amount of our senior subordinated notes 
the total purchase price of the notes was approximately million  resulting in a gain of approximately million  net of associated deferred financing fees 
the transactions were funded by availability under our bank credit facility 

table of contents our ability to service our debt will be dependent upon future performance  which will be affected by  among other things  prevailing economic conditions and financial  business and other factors  certain of which are beyond our control 
it is unlikely that our business will generate sufficient cash flow from operations to enable us to pay our indebtedness as it matures and to fund our other liquidity needs 
we believe that we will need to refinance all or part of our indebtedness at or prior to each maturity  however  we may not be able to refinance any of our indebtedness on commercially reasonable terms  or at all 
see note  long term debt  to our consolidated financial statements for additional information 
contractual obligations and commitments 
the following table summarizes our contractual obligations as of december  payments due by period total thereafter in thousands contractual obligations long term debt obligations capital lease obligations operating lease obligations interest obligations on fixed rate debt purchase obligations entertainment contracts construction projects other other long term contracts total contractual obligations includes interest rate obligations on our fixed rate debt that comprises billion of our total december  debt balance of billion 
our variable rate debt at december  consists of billion in outstanding balances on our bank credit facility 
interest payments for future periods related to the variable rate debt are dependent upon  at our option  the libor rate or the base rate  plus an applicable margin in either case 
the applicable margin is a percentage per annum which ranges from to if we elect to use the libor rate  and to if we elect to use the base rate determined in accordance with a specified pricing grid based upon our predefined total leverage ratio 
in addition  we incur commitment fees on the unused portion of the bank credit facility that range from to per annum 
at december   the blended interest rate for outstanding borrowings under the bank credit facility was construction projects consist primarily of purchase obligations related to the echelon development project 
other consists of various contracts for goods and services  including our contract for hawaiian air charter operations as well as our payments  including accrued interest  related to dania jai alai 
other long term obligations relate primarily to our energy services agreement at echelon and deferred compensation balances 
certain of our executive officers participate in a long term management incentive plan the plan  which currently extends through december  the components of the plan cannot be measured until the end of the performance period  as they will not be known until such period ends 
as such  we do not accrue for these items over the life of the plan  but rather accrue for that portion of the plan when it becomes measurable 
the possible future maximum payout is million for the year ending december  suncoast is situated on approximately acres of leased land 
the landlord has the option to require us to purchase the property at the end of and each year end through  at the fair market value of the real property at the time the landlord exercises the option  subject to certain pricing limitations 
if we do not purchase the property if and when required  we would be in default under the lease agreement 
we are required to pay the city of kenner  louisiana a boarding fee of for each passenger boarding our treasure chest riverboat casino during the year 
the future minimum payment due in to the city of kenner  based upon a portion of actual passenger counts from the prior year  is approximately million 
due to uncertainties surrounding the timing and amount of future cash settlements related to our income tax audits  we cannot establish a reasonably reliable estimate of the amount or period of future cash settlements related to the million of other long term tax liabilities as of december  as we are uncertain as to when  or if  such amounts may be settled  we have excluded the amount from the contractual obligations table above 
off balance sheet arrangements 
our off balance sheet arrangements mainly consist of unconsolidated investments in borgata and morgans las vegas llc  as well as our energy services agreement to provide electricity  emergency electricity generation  and chilled and hot water to echelon 
we have 
table of contents not entered into any transactions with special purpose entities  nor have we engaged in any derivative transactions other than interest rate swaps  interest rate collars and interest rate caps 
our joint venture investment in borgata allows us to realize the benefits of owning a full scale resort in a manner that lessens our initial investment 
we do not guarantee financing obtained by borgata  nor are there any other provisions of the venture agreements which are unusual or subject us to risks to which we would not be subjected if we had full ownership of the respective properties 
we have entered into certain agreements that contain indemnification provisions  including those involving certain of our joint ventures  as well as indemnification agreements involving certain of our executive officers and directors 
these agreements provide indemnity insurance pursuant to which directors and officers are indemnified or insured against liability or loss under certain circumstances  which may include liability or related loss under the securities act and the exchange act 
in addition  our restated articles of incorporation and restated bylaws contain provisions that provide for indemnification of our directors  officers  employees and other agents to the maximum extent permitted by law 
at december   we had outstanding letters of credit totaling million

additionally  this fsp requires certain disclosures to be provided by a public enterprise that is a a sponsor of a qualifying special purpose entity spe that holds a variable interest in the qualifying spe but was not the transferor of financial assets to the qualifying spe  and b a servicer of a qualifying spe that holds a significant variable interest in the qualifying spe but was not the transferor of financial assets to the qualifying spe 
the disclosures required by this fsp are intended to provide greater transparency to financial statement users about a transferor s continuing involvement with transferred financial assets and an enterprise s involvement with variable interest entities and qualifying spes 
this fsp is effective for the first reporting period ending after december   and shall apply for each annual and interim reporting period thereafter 
we believe that the adoption of this fsp will not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements

eitf  determining whether instruments granted in share based payment transactions are participating securities 
this fsp concludes that those unvested share based payment awards that contain non forfeitable rights to dividends or dividend equivalents  whether paid or unpaid  are participating securities and must be included in the computation of both basic and diluted earnings per share the two class method 
this fsp is effective during the three months ending march  and is to be applied on a retrospective basis to all periods presented 
the issue is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years and interim periods within those fiscal years beginning january  the adoption of fsp no

this statement is intended to improve financial reporting by identifying a consistent framework  or hierarchy  for selecting accounting principles to be used in preparing financial statements of nongovernmental entities that are presented in conformity with gaap 
this statement was effective november  we currently adhere to the hierarchy of gaap as presented in sfas  and the adoption is not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements

early adoption of sfas is permitted 
we have applied sfas to recognize the liability related to our derivative instruments at fair value to consider the changes in the creditworthiness of the company and our counterparties in determining any credit valuation adjustment 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
 noncontrolling interests in consolidated financial statements an amendment of arb no 
sfas 
sfas establishes new accounting and reporting standards for the noncontrolling interest in a subsidiary and for the deconsolidation of a subsidiary 
specifically  this statement requires the recognition of a noncontrolling interest minority interest as equity in the consolidated financial statements and separate from the parent s equity 
the amount of net income attributable to the noncontrolling interest will be included in consolidated net income on the face of the income statement 
sfas clarifies that changes in a parent s ownership in a subsidiary that do not result in deconsolidation are equity transactions if the parent retains its controlling financial interest 
in addition  this statement requires that a parent recognize a gain or loss in net income when a subsidiary is deconsolidated 
such gain or loss will be measured using the fair value of the noncontrolling equity investment on the deconsolidation date 
sfas also includes expanded disclosure requirements regarding the interests of the parent and its noncontrolling interest 
sfas no

in february  the fasb issued sfas no 
 the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities sfas 
sfas permits companies to choose to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value 
the objective is to improve financial reporting by providing companies with the opportunity to mitigate volatility in reported earnings caused by measuring related assets and liabilities differently without having to apply complex hedge accounting provisions 
the fair value option established by sfas permits all companies to choose to measure eligible items at fair value at specified election dates 
at each subsequent reporting date  companies must report in earnings any unrealized gains and losses on items for which the fair value option has been elected 
sfas is effective as of the beginning of a company s first fiscal year that begins after november  early adoption is permitted as of the beginning of a fiscal year that begins on or before november   provided the company also elects to apply the provisions of sfas no 
 fair value measurements 
we do not believe that the adoption of sfas will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
a variety of proposed or otherwise potential accounting standards are currently under study by standard setting organizations and certain regulatory agencies 
because of the tentative and preliminary nature of such proposed standards  we have not yet determined the effect  if any  that the implementation of such proposed standards would have on our consolidated financial statements 

table of contents critical accounting policies we prepare our consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
as such  we are required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts included in our consolidated financial statements 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from the estimates 
we believe the following critical accounting policies may require a higher degree of judgment and complexity 
goodwill  intangible assets and other long lived assets 
we evaluate our goodwill  intangible assets and other long lived assets in accordance with the applications of sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  and sfas no 
 accounting for impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
for goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets  we perform an annual impairment test of these assets in the second quarter of each year and between annual dates in certain circumstances 
for assets to be disposed of  we recognize the asset at the lower of carrying value or fair market value  less costs of disposal  as estimated based on comparable asset sales  solicited offers  or a discounted cash flow model 
for long lived assets to be held and used  we review for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable 
we then compare the estimated undiscounted future cash flows of the asset to the carrying value of the asset 
the asset is not impaired if the undiscounted future cash flows exceed its carrying value 
if the carrying value exceeds the undiscounted future cash flows  then an impairment charge is recorded  typically measured using a discounted cash flow model  which is based on the estimated future results of the relevant reporting unit discounted using our weighted average cost of capital and market indicators of terminal year free cash flow multiples 
if an asset is under development  future cash flows include remaining construction costs 
all recognized impairment charges are recorded as operating expenses 
management must make various assumptions and estimates in performing its impairment testing 
for instance  management must first determine the usage of the asset 
to the extent management decides that an asset will be sold or abandoned  it is more likely that impairment may be recognized 
assets must be tested at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows exist  which means that some assets must be grouped  and management has some discretion in the grouping of assets 
future cash flow estimates are  by their nature  subjective and actual results may differ materially from our estimates 
if our ongoing estimates of future cash flows are not met  we may have to record additional impairment charges in future accounting periods 
our estimates of cash flows are based on the current regulatory  social and economic climates  recent operating information and budgets of the various properties where we conduct operations 
these estimates could be negatively impacted by changes in federal  state or local regulations  economic downturns  or other events affecting various forms of travel and access to our properties 
see summary financial results above for a discussion of write downs and impairment charges recorded during the years ended december   and the majority of the impairment charges recorded for the year ended december  are primarily related to the ongoing recession  which has caused us to reduce our estimates for projected cash flows  has reduced overall industry valuations  and has caused an increase in discount rates in the credit and equity markets 
capital expenditures and depreciation 
we must make estimates and assumptions when accounting for capital expenditures 
whether the expenditure is considered a maintenance expense or a capital asset is a matter of judgment 
our depreciation expense is highly dependent upon the assumptions we make about our assets estimated useful lives 
we determine the estimated useful lives based upon our experience with similar assets 
whenever events or circumstances occur which change the estimated useful life of an asset  we account for the change prospectively 
in connection with the closure and demolition of the stardust  we reevaluated the estimated useful lives of the depreciable assets residing on the land associated with our echelon development project  including our corporate office building  and recorded million of accelerated depreciation expense in capitalized interest 
interest costs associated with major development and construction projects are capitalized as part of the cost of the constructed assets in accordance with sfas no 
 capitalization of interest costs 
when no debt is incurred specifically for a project  interest is capitalized on amounts expended for the project using our weighted average cost of borrowing 
capitalization of interest ceases when the project or discernible portions of the project is substantially complete 
if substantially all of the construction related activities of a project are suspended  capitalization of interest will cease until such activities are resumed 
we amortize capitalized interest over the estimated useful life of the related assets 

table of contents derivative instruments 
we utilize an investment policy for managing risks associated with our current and anticipated future borrowings  such as interest rate risk and its potential impact on our fixed and variable rate debt 
under this policy  we may utilize derivative contracts that effectively convert our borrowings from either floating to fixed or fixed to floating 
the policy does not allow for the use of derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
to the extent we employ such financial instruments pursuant to this policy  and the instruments qualify for hedge accounting  we may designate and account for them as hedged instruments 
in order to qualify for hedge accounting  the underlying hedged item must expose us to risks associated with market fluctuations and the financial instrument used must be designated as a hedge and must reduce our exposure to market fluctuations throughout the hedged period 
if these criteria are not met  a change in the market value of the financial instrument is recognized as a gain loss in the period of change 
otherwise  gains and losses are not recognized except to the extent that the hedged debt is disposed of prior to maturity or to the extent that acceptable ranges of ineffectiveness exist in the hedge 
net interest paid or received pursuant to the hedged financial instrument is included in interest expense in the period 
we have designated our current interest rate swaps as cash flow hedges and measure their effectiveness using the long haul method 
the effective portion of any gain or loss on our interest rate swaps is recorded in other comprehensive income loss 
we use the hypothetical derivative method to measure the ineffective portion of our interest rate swaps 
the ineffective portion  if any  is recorded in earnings 
we measure the mark to market value of our interest rate swaps using a discounted cash flow analysis of the projected future receipts or payments based upon the forward yield curve on the date of measurement 
we adjust this amount to measure the fair value of our interest rate swaps by applying a credit valuation adjustment to the mark to market exposure profile 
in determining the credit valuation adjustment  we consider the credit default swap rates of the company and its counterparties in each settlement period  as observed on the date of measurement 
generally accepted accounting principles gaap require all derivative instruments to be recognized on the balance sheet at fair value 
derivatives that are not designated as hedges for accounting purposes must be adjusted to fair value through earnings 
if the derivative qualifies and is designated as a hedge  depending on the nature of the hedge  changes in its fair value will either be offset against the change in fair value of the hedged item through earnings or recognized in other comprehensive income loss until the hedged item is recognized in earnings 
the ineffective portion of a derivative s change in mark to market value will be immediately recognized in earnings 
share based employee compensation 
on january   we adopted sfas no 
r  share based payment  using the modified prospective method and as such  results for prior periods have not been restated 
this statement requires us to measure the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments based on the grant date fair value of the award with limited exceptions 
this cost is recognized over the period during which an employee is required to provide service in exchange for the award 
under the modified prospective method  we expense the cost of share based compensation awards issued after january  additionally  we recognize compensation cost for the portion of awards outstanding on january  for which the requisite service has not been rendered over the period the requisite service is being rendered after january  compensation costs related to stock option awards are calculated based on the fair value of each major option grant on the date of the grant using the black scholes option pricing model that requires the formation of assumptions to be used in the model  such as expected stock price volatility  risk free interest rates  expected option lives and dividend yields 
we formed our assumptions using historical experience and observable conditions 
income taxes 
we are subject to income taxes in the united states and several states in which we operate 
we account for income taxes according to sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
sfas no 
requires the recognition of deferred tax assets  net of applicable reserves  related to net operating loss carryforwards  tax credit carryforwards and certain temporary differences 
a valuation allowance is recognized if  based upon the weight of the available evidence  it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax asset will not be recognized 
our income tax returns are subject to examination by tax authorities 
we regularly assess the potential outcome of these examinations in determining the adequacy of our provision for income taxes and our income tax liabilities 
to determine necessary reserves  we must make assumptions and judgments about potential actions by taxing authorities  partially based on past experiences 
our estimate of the potential outcome for any uncertain tax issue is highly judgmental  and we believe we have adequately provided for any reasonable and foreseeable outcomes relating to uncertain tax matters 
when actual results of tax examinations differ from our estimates or when potential actions are settled differently than we expected  we adjust the income tax provision and our tax reserves in the current period 
self insurance reserves 
we are self insured up to certain stop loss amounts for employee health coverage  workers compensation and general liability costs 
insurance claims and reserves include accruals of estimated settlements for known claims  as well as accruals of estimates for claims incurred but not yet reported 
in estimating these accruals  we consider historical loss experience and make judgments about the expected levels of costs per claim 
we believe our estimates of future liability are reasonable based upon our methodology  however  changes in health care costs  accident frequency and severity and other factors could materially affect the estimate for these liabilities 

table of contents litigation  claims and assessments 
we also utilize estimates for litigation  claims and assessments related to our business and tax matters 
these estimates are based upon our knowledge and experience about past and current events and also upon reasonable assumptions about future events 
actual results could differ from these estimates 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk market risk is the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices  such as interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices 
our primary exposure to market risk is interest rate risk  specifically long term us treasury rates and the applicable spreads in the high yield investment market and short term and long term libor rates  and its potential impact on our long term debt 
we attempt to limit our exposure to interest rate risk by managing the mix of our long term fixed rate borrowings and short term borrowings under our bank credit facility 
borrowings under our bank credit facility are based upon  at our option  the libor rate or the base rate  plus an applicable margin in either case 
the applicable margin is a percentage per annum which ranges from to if we elect to use the libor rate  and to if we elect to use the base rate determined in accordance with a specified pricing grid based upon our predefined total leverage ratio 
we also attempt to manage the impact of interest rate risk on our long term debt by utilizing derivative financial instruments in accordance with established policies and procedures 
we do not utilize derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
during the year ended december   we utilized interest rate swap agreements 
interest differentials resulting from these agreements are recorded on an accrual basis as an adjustment to interest expense 
interest rate swaps related to debt are matched to specific debt obligations 
we are exposed to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by the counterparties to the interest rate swap agreements outstanding at december   however  we believe that this risk is minimized because we monitor the credit ratings of the counterparties to the swaps 
if we had terminated our swaps as of december   we would have been required to pay million based on the fair values of the derivative instruments 
the following table provides information about our derivative instruments and other financial instruments that are sensitive to changes in interest rates  including interest swaps and debt obligations 
for our debt obligations  the table presents principal cash flows and related weighted average interest rates by expected maturity dates 
for our interest rate swaps  the table presents the notional amounts and weighted average interest rates by the expected contractual maturity dates 
the notional amounts are used to calculate the contractual cash flows to be exchanged under the contracts 
the weighted average variable rates are based upon prevailing interest rates 
the scheduled maturities of our long term debt and interest rate swap agreements outstanding as of december  for the years ending december are as follows 
year ending december  expected maturity date fair value thereafter total liabilities long term debt including current portion fixed rate average interest rate variable rate average interest rate interest rate derivatives derivative instruments pay fixed average receivable rate average payable rate 
table of contents as of december   our long term variable rate borrowings represented approximately of our total long term debt 
based on december  debt levels  a basis point change in the libor rate or the base rate would cause our annual interest costs to change by approximately million
