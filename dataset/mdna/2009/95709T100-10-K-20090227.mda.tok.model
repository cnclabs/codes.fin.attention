table of contents environmental matters general we are subject to various federal  state and local environmental laws and regulations 
environmental laws and regulations affecting power plants are overlapping  complex  subject to changes in interpretation and implementation  and have tended to become more stringent over time 
these laws and regulations relate primarily to discharges into the air  air quality  discharges of effluents into water  the use of water  and the handling  disposal and clean up of hazardous substances and wastes 
these laws and regulations require a lengthy and complex process for obtaining licenses  permits and approvals from governmental agencies for our new  existing or modified facilities 
if we fail to comply with such laws  regulations and permits  or fail to obtain and maintain necessary permits  we could be fined or otherwise sanctioned by regulators  and such fines or sanctions may not be recoverable in rates 
we have incurred and will continue to incur capital and other expenditures to comply with environmental laws and regulations 
certain of these costs are recoverable through the environmental cost recovery rider ecrr  which allows for the more timely inclusion in retail rates of capital investments related directly to environmental improvements required by the clean air act as well as many of the costs related to compliance with other environmental laws and regulations 
however  there can be no assurance that we will be able to recover all such costs from our customers or that the costs to comply with existing or future environmental laws and regulations will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial statements 
air emissions the clean air act  state laws and implementing regulations impose  among other things  limitations on pollutants generated during our operations  including sulfur dioxide so  particulate matter and nitrogen oxides nox 
certain kansas department of health and environment kdhe regulations applicable to our generating facilities prohibit the emission of so in excess of prescribed levels 
in order to meet these standards  we use low sulfur coal and natural gas and have equipped some of our generating facilities with pollution control equipment 
in addition  we must comply with the provisions of the clean air act amendments of that require a two phase reduction in certain emissions 
we have installed continuous emissions monitoring and reporting equipment in order to meet these requirements 
title iv of the clean air act created an so allowance and trading program as part of the federal acid rain program 
under the allowance and trading program  the environmental protection agency epa allocated annual so allowances for each affected unit 
an so allowance is a limited authorization to emit one ton of so during a calendar year 
at the end of each year  each emitting unit must have enough allowances to cover its emissions for that year 
allowances are tradable so that operators of affected units that are anticipated to emit so in excess of their allowances may purchase allowances in the market in which such allowances are traded 
in  we had so allowances adequate to meet planned generation and we expect to have enough in in the future if we need to purchase additional allowances our operating costs would increase 
we expect to recover the cost of emission allowances through the reca although there are no guarantees we will be able to do so 
the price of emissions allowances is determined by market forces and changes over time 
on february   we reached an agreement with the kdhe to implement a plan to improve efficiency and to install new equipment to reduce regulated emissions from jeffrey energy center 
the projects are designed to meet requirements of the clean air visibility rule and reduce emissions over our entire generating fleet by eliminating more than of so and reducing nitrous oxides between and 
on march   the epa issued the clean air mercury rule 
beginning in  the rule caps permanently and reduces the amount of mercury that may be emitted from coal fired power plants 
however  on february   the us district court of appeals for the district of columbia vacated the clean air mercury rule 
while the ultimate impact of this ruling on our operations is currently unknown  we believe that mercury emissions controls may be required in the future and that the costs to comply with these requirements may be material 

table of contents environmental requirements have been changing substantially 
accordingly  we may be required to further reduce emissions of presently regulated gases and substances  such as so  nox  particulate matter and mercury  and we may be required to reduce or limit emissions of gases and substances not presently regulated eg  carbon dioxide co 
proposals and bills in those respects include the epa s national ambient air quality standards for particulate matter and ozone  additional legislation introduced in the past few years in congress requiring reductions of presently unregulated gases related primarily to concerns about climate change  and state legislation introduced recently that could require mitigation of co emissions 
based on currently available information  we cannot estimate our costs to comply with these proposed laws  but we believe such costs could be material 
environmental costs we have identified the potential for us to make up to billion of capital expenditures at our power plants for environmental air emissions projects during the next six years 
this estimate could materially increase or decrease depending on the timing and the nature of required investments  the specific outcomes resulting from interpretation of existing regulations  new regulations  legislation and the resolution of the epa new source review investigation nsr investigation and the related department of justice doj lawsuit described below 
in addition to the capital investment  in the event we install new equipment as a result of the nsr investigation and the related doj lawsuit  such equipment may cause us to incur significant increases in annual operating and maintenance expense and may reduce net production from our power plants 
the degree to which we will need to reduce emissions and the timing of when such emissions controls may be required is uncertain 
in addition  our ability to access capital markets and the availability of materials  equipment and contractors may affect the timing and ultimate amount of these capital investments 
the ecrr allows for the more timely inclusion in retail rates of capital expenditures tied directly to environmental improvements  including those required by the clean air act 
however  increased operating and maintenance costs  other than expenses related to production related consumables  can be recovered only through a change in base rates 
new source review investigation under section a of the clean air act section  the epa is conducting investigations nationwide to determine whether modifications at coal fired power plants are subject to the new source review permitting program or new source performance standards 
these investigations focus on whether projects at coal fired plants were routine maintenance or whether the projects were substantial modifications that could reasonably have been expected to result in a significant net increase in emissions 
the new source review program requires companies to obtain permits and  if necessary  install control equipment to address emissions when making a major modification or a change in operation if either is expected to cause a significant net increase in emissions 
the epa requested information from us under section regarding projects and maintenance activities that have been conducted since at three coal fired plants we operate 
on january   the epa notified us that certain projects completed at jeffrey energy center violated certain requirements of the new source review program 
on february   the doj filed a lawsuit against us in us district court in the district of kansas asserting substantially the same claims 
a decision in favor of the doj and the epa  or a settlement prior to such a decision  if reached  could require us to update or install emissions controls at jeffrey energy center 
additionally  we might be required to update or install emissions controls at our other coal fired plants  pay fines or penalties or take other remedial action 
our ultimate costs to resolve the nsr investigation and the related doj lawsuit could be material 
we believe that costs related to updating or installing emissions controls would qualify for recovery in the prices we are allowed to charge our customers 
if  however  a penalty is assessed against us  the penalty could be material and may not be recovered in rates 
we are not able to estimate the possible loss or range of loss at this time 

table of contents manufactured gas sites we have been identified as being responsible for the clean up of a number of former manufactured gas sites located in kansas and missouri 
we and the kdhe entered into a consent agreement in governing all future work at the kansas sites 
under the terms of the consent agreement  we agreed to investigate and  if necessary  remediate these sites 
pursuant to an environmental indemnity agreement with oneok  the current owner of some of the sites  oneok assumed total liability for remediation of seven sites  and we share liability for remediation with oneok for five sites 
our total liability for the five shared sites is capped at million 
we have sole responsibility for remediation with respect to three sites 
our liability for the former manufactured gas sites identified in missouri is limited to million by the terms of an environmental indemnity agreement with the purchaser of our former missouri assets

table of contents item a 
risk factors like other companies in our industry  our consolidated financial results will be impacted by weather  the economy of our service territory and the energy use of our customers 
the value of our common stock and our creditworthiness will be affected by national and international macroeconomic trends  general market conditions and the expectations of the investment community  all of which are largely beyond our control 
in addition  the following statements highlight risk factors that may affect our consolidated financial statements 
these are not intended to be an exhaustive discussion of all such risks  and the statements below must be read together with factors discussed elsewhere in this document and in our other filings with the sec 
our revenues depend upon rates determined by the kcc and ferc the kcc and ferc regulate many aspects of our business and operations  including the rates that we charge customers for electric service 
retail rates are set by the kcc while wholesale and transmission rates are set by ferc 
both the kcc and ferc use a cost of service approach that takes into account historical operating expenses  fixed obligations and recovery of and a return on capital investments 
using this approach  the kcc and ferc set rates at a level calculated to recover such costs and a permitted return on investment 
on january   the kcc authorized a million increase in our retail rates to reflect our investment in natural gas generation facilities  wind generation facilities and other capital projects  costs attributable to the ice storm  higher operating costs and an update of our capital structure 
the new retail rates became effective on february  our costs may not be fully recovered in rates except to the extent the kcc and ferc permit us to modify our prices by using specific adjustments and riders  such as the reca  tdc and ecrr  our rates generally remain fixed until changed in a subsequent rate review 
we may apply to change our rates or intervening parties may request that our rates be reviewed for possible adjustment 
equipment failures and other external factors can adversely affect our results the generation and transmission of electricity requires the use of expensive and complicated equipment 
while we have maintenance programs in place  generating plants are subject to extended or unplanned outages because of equipment failure  weather  failure by our contractors or subcontractors to meet commitments and other factors largely beyond our control 
in such events  we must either produce replacement power from our other  usually less efficient  units or purchase power from others at unpredictable and potentially higher costs in order to meet our sales obligations 
in addition  such events can limit our ability to make opportunistic sales to wholesale customers 
fuel deliveries can be interrupted or slowed and transmission systems may be constrained coal deliveries from the prb region of wyoming  the primary source for our coal  can be interrupted or can be slowed due to rail traffic congestion  equipment or track failure or loading problems at the mines 
this may require that we implement coal conservation efforts and or take other compensating measures 
we experienced these problems and conserved coal to varying degrees in these measures may include  but are not limited to  reducing coal consumption by revising normal dispatch of generation units  purchasing power or using more expensive power to serve customers and decreasing or  if necessary  eliminating opportunistic wholesale sales 
in addition  decisions or mistakes by other utilities may adversely affect our ability to use transmission lines to deliver or import power  thus subjecting us to unexpected expenses or to the cost and uncertainty of public policy initiatives 
these factors  along with the prices and price volatility of fuel and wholesale electricity are largely beyond our control 
costs that are not recovered through the reca could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial statements 
we engage in energy marketing transactions to reduce risk from market fluctuations  enhance system reliability and increase profits 
the events mentioned above could reduce our ability to participate in energy marketing opportunities  which could reduce our profits 

table of contents we may have material financial exposure relating to environmental matters under section  the epa is conducting investigations nationwide to determine whether modifications at coal fired power plants are subject to the new source review permitting program or new source performance standards 
these investigations focus on whether projects at coal fired plants were routine maintenance or whether the projects were substantial modifications that could reasonably have been expected to result in a significant net increase in emissions 
the new source review program requires companies to obtain permits and  if necessary  install control equipment to address emissions when making a major modification or a change in operation if either is expected to cause a significant net increase in emissions 
the epa requested information from us under section regarding projects and maintenance activities that have been conducted since at three coal fired plants we operate 
on january   the epa notified us that certain projects completed at jeffrey energy center violated certain requirements of the new source review program 
on february   the doj filed a lawsuit against us in us district court in the district of kansas asserting substantially the same claims 
a decision in favor of the doj and the epa  or a settlement prior to such a decision  if reached  could require us to update or install emissions controls at jeffrey energy center 
additionally  we might be required to update or install emissions controls at our other coal fired plants  pay fines or penalties or take other remedial action 
our ultimate costs to resolve the nsr investigation and the related doj lawsuit could be material 
we believe that costs related to updating or installing emissions controls would qualify for recovery in the prices we are allowed to charge our customers 
if  however  a penalty is assessed against us  the penalty could be material and may not be recovered in rates 
we are not able to estimate the possible loss or range of loss at this time 
our activities are subject to extensive and changing environmental regulation by federal  state and local governmental authorities  particularly relating to air emissions 
in addition to laws currently in effect  numerous laws and regulations have been enacted and proposed relating to increasing national and international concern about possible global warming caused by the atmospheric release of co and other gases by industrial and other sources  including the utility industry 
on november   the governors of six midwestern states  including kansas  signed the midwest greenhouse gas reduction accord  under which the member states will  among other things  establish greenhouse gas reduction targets and develop a market based and multi sector cap and trade mechanism to help achieve such targets 
in addition  on october   the kdhe denied an application by an unrelated utility for an air quality permit for two new proposed coal generators in western kansas in part because of concerns about the increase in co and emissions and the potential ill effects those plants might have on the environment and health 
the kdhe noted that the decision constituted a first step in emerging policy to address existing and future co emissions in kansas 
the midwest greenhouse gas reduction accord or other new or changed laws and regulations  as well as third party litigation that may be brought against us or our competitors  could result in requirements to install costly equipment  increase our operating expenses  reduce production from our plants or take other actions we are unable to identify at this time 
the degree to which we may need to reduce emissions and the timing of when such emissions control equipment may be required is uncertain 
both the timing and the nature of required investments depend on specific outcomes that result from interpretation of existing regulations  new regulations  legislation and the resolution of the nsr investigation and the related doj lawsuit described above 
although we expect to recover in our rates most of the costs that we incur to comply with environmental regulations  we can provide no assurance that we will be able to fully and timely recover such costs or the costs of any failure to comply with laws and regulations 
failure to recover these associated costs could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial statements 

table of contents accounting regulations unique to public utilities could change we currently apply the accounting principles of statement of financial accounting standard sfas no 
 accounting for the effects of certain types of regulation  to our regulated business 
as of december   we had recorded million of regulatory assets  net of regulatory liabilities 
in the event we determined that we could no longer apply the principles of sfas no 
 either as i a result of the establishment of retail competition in our service territory  ii a change in the regulatory approach for setting rates from cost based ratemaking to another form of ratemaking  iii a result of other regulatory actions that restrict cost recovery to a level insufficient to recover costs  or iv a change from current generally accepted accounting principles gaap to another set of standards that does not recognize regulatory assets or liabilities  we would be required to record a charge against income in the amount of the remaining unamortized net regulatory assets 
such an action would materially reduce our shareholders equity 
we periodically review these criteria to ensure the continuing application of sfas no 
is appropriate 
based upon current evaluation of the various factors that are expected to impact future cost recovery  we believe that our regulatory assets are probable of recovery 
we face financial risks associated with wolf creek risks of substantial liability arise from the ownership and operation of nuclear facilities  including  among others  structural problems at a nuclear facility  the storage  handling and disposal of radioactive materials  limitations on the amounts and types of insurance coverage commercially available  uncertainties with respect to the cost and technological aspects of nuclear decommissioning at the end of their useful lives and costs or measures associated with public safety 
in the event of an extended or unscheduled outage at wolf creek  we would be required to generate power from more costly generating units  purchase power in the open market to replace the power normally produced at wolf creek and we would have less power available for sale into the wholesale markets 
if we were not permitted by the kcc to recover these costs  such events would likely have an adverse impact on our consolidated financial statements 
our planned capital expenditures are significant to our results of operations during the period from through and for the immediate years beyond  we plan to continue significant capital expenditures toward large projects including the expansion and modernization of our generation fleet and transmission network 
our anticipated capital expenditures for the period from through  including costs of removal  are approximately billion 
delays in engineering and construction times can occur throughout our industry 
because our capital expenditure program is large in comparison to our revenues and assets  cost increases or delays could materially affect our consolidated financial statements 
in addition  in order to fund our capital expenditure program  we rely to a large degree on access to our short term credit facility and to long term capital markets for debt and equity as sources of liquidity for capital requirements not satisfied by the cash flow from our operations 
the secured and unsecured debt of westar energy and kge are rated investment grade by all three of the best known rating agencies  but we cannot assure that such debt will continue to be rated investment grade 
if the rating agencies were to downgrade westar energy s or kge s secured or unsecured debt  our borrowing costs and the interest rates we pay on short term and long term debt would likely increase  possibly significantly 
further  market disruptions could increase our cost of borrowing or adversely affect our ability to access financial markets 
additional issuance of equity securities could dilute the value of our shares of our common stock and cause the market price of our common stock to fall 
these factors could hinder our access to capital markets and limit or delay our ability to carry out our capital expenditure program 
further  our recovery of capital expenditures depends in large degree on the outcome of retail and wholesale rate proceedings 
decisions made by the kcc or ferc  or delays in making such decisions  could have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 

table of contents uncertainty in the credit markets and the impact on the economy in our service territory continuing turmoil in the global credit markets  and the slowing of the global and us economies  may have a number of effects on our operations  financial condition and capital expenditure program 
while we cannot provide an exhaustive list of all possible effects  these market conditions may make capital more difficult and costly to obtain  may restrict liquidity available to us through our revolving credit facility  may reduce demand by our customers and increase delinquencies or non payment by our customers  may adversely impact the financial condition of our suppliers  which may in turn limit our access to inventory or capital equipment  may reduce the credit available to our energy trading counterparties and correspondingly reduce our energy trading activity or increase our exposure to counterparty default  may require us to defer or limit elements of our capital expenditure program  may reduce the value of our financial assets and correspondingly adversely impact our earnings and net cash flow  may require us to provide additional funding to our nuclear decommissioning and pension trusts  and may increase the cost or decrease the availability of insurance to us or make insurance claims more difficult to collect 
these and other related effects may have an adverse impact on our consolidated financial statements and in extreme circumstances  the combination of some or all of these effects might impact amounts available for the payment of dividends

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations introduction we are the largest electric utility in kansas 
we produce  transmit and sell electricity at retail in kansas and at wholesale in a multi state region in the central united states under the regulation of the kcc and ferc 
in management s discussion and analysis  we discuss our general financial condition  significant changes that occurred during  and our operating results for the years ended december   and as you read management s discussion and analysis  please refer to our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes  which contain our operating results 
summary of significant items overview several significant items have impacted or may impact us and our operations since january  income from operations for the year ended december   decreased compared to the prior year due primarily to a decrease in energy marketing  cooler weather  reduced margins on power sold to a few large industrial customers and additional planned outages at our base load plants in the first and second quarters of see decrease in income from operations below for additional information  we reached a settlement with the irs on issues principally related to the method used to capitalize overheads to electric plant for the years through  which resulted in a net earnings benefit of approximately million 
see recognition of previously unrecognized tax benefits below for additional information 
we also recognized million in state tax incentives related to investment and jobs creation within the state of kansas  we received regulatory approval to increase retail rates million per year 
the primary drivers for our rate increase were investments in natural gas generation facilities  wind generation facilities and other capital projects  costs attributable to the ice storm  higher operating costs and an update of our capital structure 
for additional information  see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements  rate matters and regulation  we made capital expenditures of million during see increased capacity and future plans and liquidity and capital resources below for additional information  we issued million shares of common stock for net proceeds of million through a sales agency financing agreement  a forward sale agreement and an underwriting agreement 
we also issued an additional million principal amount of first mortgage bonds as part of our efforts to raise the funds needed for our capital projects 
we expect to continue to issue equity and debt securities as external funds are needed to complete planned capital investments  as a result of market conditions  we experienced a significant loss in the value of assets in our pension and nuclear decommission trusts 
this will increase our pension expense in future periods and will require us to make additional contributions to these trusts  
table of contents global and us economic conditions throughout have begun to impact certain of our industrial and commercial customers and may affect our residential business 
kansas companies are experiencing reduced production and have announced significant employee layoffs 
kansas is experiencing an increase in unemployment claims and the unemployment rate 
we cannot determine when these conditions may reverse or whether and to what extent they may affect our results of operations 
decrease in income from operations income from operations decreased million or compared to last year 
this decrease is attributable primarily to a decrease in energy marketing  cooler weather  reduced margins on power sold to a few large industrial customers and additional planned outages at our base load plants 
energy marketing decreased million due primarily to the need to focus resources toward serving our retail customers during outages  changes in the relationships of prices among energy products historically traded and the continuing maturation of energy markets in which we participate reducing margin opportunities 
a notable trend is that more transactions are being completed through rto sponsored markets as opposed to negotiated transactions directly between individual counterparties 
in addition  as measured by cooling degree days  the weather during was cooler than last year 
while increases in the cost of fuel and purchased power generally are recoverable in the reca applicable to our retail sales  we sold power to a few large industrial customers under contracts to which the reca did not apply 
margins on sales to customers under these contracts were approximately million lower compared to last year 
effective july   an industrial customer who accounted for approximately of sales under these contracts is now served under a new tariff that incorporates the reca 
the remainder of these contracts will expire by the end of furthermore  there were additional planned outages at our base load plants in that were longer in duration than the prior year 
the additional planned outages required us to use more expensive fuel and to incur additional purchased power expense 
this resulted in reduced margins on power sold  notwithstanding higher prevailing market prices 
margins on market based wholesale sales decreased million or compared to last year 
recognition of previously unrecognized tax benefits in december  we reached a tentative settlement with the irs office of appeals on issues principally related to the method used to capitalize overheads to electric plant for years through this settlement  which was approved by the joint committee on taxation and accepted by the irs in february  resulted in a net earnings benefit of approximately million  including interest  due to the recognition of previously unrecognized tax benefits 
the recognition of these previously unrecognized tax benefits resulted in earnings of per share for the year ended december  changes in rates we filed an application with the kcc in may to increase retail rates by million per year 
the primary drivers for this application were investments in natural gas generation facilities  wind generation facilities and other capital projects  costs attributable to the ice storm  higher operating costs and an update of our capital structure 
on october   all parties to the proceeding filed an agreement with the kcc supporting a million annual increase in our retail rates 
on january   the kcc issued an order approving the settlement agreement and the new retail rates became effective on february  on july   we implemented an initial retail tdc on a revenue neutral basis to capture transmission costs ultimately approved in our general rate case 
on september   the kcc granted our request to adjust the tdc to include more recent transmission costs approved by ferc and attributable to the retail portion of our transmission service 
this served to increase our estimated annual retail revenues by million 
on may   the kcc issued an order allowing us to increase our ecrr to include costs associated with investments made in this change went into effect on june   and served to increase our estimated annual retail revenues by million 

table of contents on december   ferc issued an order approving a settlement of our transmission formula rate that allows us to include our anticipated transmission capital expenditures for the current year in our transmission formula rate  subject to true up 
in addition to the true up  we expect to update our transmission formula rate in january of each year to reflect changes in our projected operating costs and investments 
increased capacity and future plans in may  we and electric transmission america  llc formed prairie wind transmission  a joint venture company of which we own 
prairie wind transmission is proposing to construct approximately miles of kv transmission facilities in kansas extending west from near wichita to near dodge city and then south southwest to the kansas oklahoma border 
on december   ferc approved a number of key rate components related to these transmission facilities and set aside for hearing the establishment of a formula rate and associated protocols 
should prairie wind transmission receive the necessary regulatory approvals from the kcc and ferc  the facilities are expected to be in service by the end of  contingent on a number of factors including the availability and cost of capital  not all of which are under our control 
we will incur significant future capital expenditures related to this joint venture if prairie wind transmission receives regulatory approval to build the transmission facilities 
we have been working with third parties to develop approximately mw of wind generation facilities at three different sites in kansas 
under the terms of the agreements  we will own approximately half of the wind generation facilities at an expected cost of approximately million and will purchase energy produced by the wind generation facilities under twenty year supply contracts for the other half 
one of the facilities from which we purchase energy began producing energy in december and we expect the other two to begin producing energy in early we are constructing a kv transmission line from our gordon evans energy center northwest of wichita  kansas  to a new substation near hutchinson  kansas  then on to our summit substation near salina  kansas  a distance totaling approximately miles 
we completed construction of the first segment in december and expect the second segment to be completed by june we expect the total investment in the line and substations to be approximately million 
in addition to the transmission line described above  we also plan to construct a new kv line from a substation near wichita to the kansas oklahoma border  where we will interconnect with new facilities being built by an oklahoma utility 
the preliminary estimate of the investment in the line is approximately million  which is subject to change pending final engineering design  labor and materials  among other factors 
we expect to begin construction in in  we completed the first phase of our emporia energy center  a new natural gas fired peaking power plant consisting of seven combustion turbines located near emporia in lyon county  kansas  comprising approximately mw of capacity 
we expect to complete construction of the second phase  consisting of two generating units that will add an additional approximately mw of generating capacity  early in for a total investment of about million 
economic conditions in  global economic growth slowed  liquidity was reduced in global capital markets and the us entered a recession 
the downturn became more intense in the fourth quarter of growth in industrial production decreased from levels  and business and consumer confidence declined throughout the rate of inflation increased in the first half of with rising food and energy prices  but declined in the latter part of the year 
the state of the economy may adversely affect a number of aspects of our business 
while the full impact of these events is currently unknown  several developments can be highlighted 

table of contents certain of our industrial and commercial customers have informed us that they are experiencing a decrease in orders and have reduced production and work schedules 
further  several of our large industrial customers have recently announced significant employee layoffs 
our residential business may be affected by general economic conditions 
the kansas unemployment rate increased from in december to in december initial unemployment claims in kansas jumped to approximately  claims in december from approximately  claims in december we cannot predict whether these developments will continue or when the economy generally may stabilize 
we also cannot state whether or to what extent any such developments will impact our results of operations  which are affected by economic conditions as well as by a broad number of other factors  including without limitation those factors summarized in this form k in the sections entitled forward looking statements and item a 
risk factors 
critical accounting estimates our discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in conformity with gaap 
note of the notes to consolidated financial statements  summary of significant accounting policies  contains a summary of our significant accounting policies  many of which require the use of estimates and assumptions by management 
the policies highlighted below have an impact on our reported results that may be material due to the levels of judgment and subjectivity necessary to account for uncertain matters or their susceptibility to change 
regulatory accounting we currently apply accounting standards for our regulated utility operations that recognize the economic effects of rate regulation in accordance with sfas no 
accordingly  we have recorded regulatory assets and liabilities when required by a regulatory order or based on regulatory precedent 
regulatory assets represent incurred costs that have been deferred because they are probable of future recovery in utility rates 
regulatory liabilities represent probable future reductions in revenue or refunds to customers 
the deferral of costs as regulatory assets is appropriate only when the future recovery of such costs is probable 
in assessing probability  we consider such factors as specific regulatory orders  regulatory precedent and the current regulatory environment 
to the extent recovery of costs is no longer deemed to be probable  we would record a charge against income in the amount of the related regulatory assets 
pension and post retirement benefit plans actuarial assumptions we and wolf creek calculate our pension benefit and post retirement medical benefit obligations and related costs using actuarial concepts within the guidance provided by sfas no 
 employers accounting for pensions  sfas no 
 employers accounting for post retirement benefits other than pensions and sfas no 
 employers accounting for defined benefit pension and other post retirement plans an amendment of fasb statements no 
   and r 
in accounting for our retirement plans and other post retirement benefits  we make assumptions regarding the valuation of benefit obligations and the performance of plan assets 
the reported costs of our pension plans are impacted by estimates regarding earnings on plan assets  contributions to the plan  discount rates used to determine our projected benefit obligation and pension costs and employee demographics including age  compensation levels and employment periods 
a change in any of these assumptions could have a significant impact on future costs  which may be reflected as an increase or decrease in net income in the current and future periods  or on the amount of related liabilities reflected on our consolidated balance sheets or may also require cash contributions 

table of contents the following table shows the annual impact of a change in our pension plan discount rate  salary scale and rate of return on plan assets 
actuarial assumption change in assumption annual change in projected benefit obligation annual change in pension liability asset annual change in projected pension expense in thousands discount rate decrease    increase salary scale decrease    increase rate of return on plan assets decrease  increase we recorded pension costs of approximately million in and million in both and these amounts reflect the pension costs of westar energy and our responsibility for the pension costs of wolf creek 
pension costs for are expected to be approximately million 
the increase in pension costs from to that expected in is due primarily to significantly lower than expected investment returns in the investment gains or losses resulting from the difference between the expected return on assets and actual returns earned are deferred in the year the difference arises 
the gain or loss recognition occurs by using a four year moving average value of pension assets to measure the expected return on assets in the pension cost  and by amortizing deferred investment gains or losses over the average remaining service life of employees 
see notes and of the notes to consolidated financial statements  employee benefit plans and wolf creek employee benefit plans  for additional discussion of westar energy and wolf creek benefit plans  respectively 
the following table shows the annual impact of a change in the discount rate and rate of return on plan assets on our post retirement benefit plans other than pension plans 
actuarial assumption change in assumption annual change in projected benefit obligation annual change in post retirement liability asset annual change in projected post retirement expense in thousands discount rate decrease   increase   rate of return on plan assets decrease increase revenue recognition energy sales we record revenue at the time we deliver electricity to customers 
we determine the amounts delivered to individual customers through systematic monthly readings of customer meters 
at the end of each month  we estimate the electric usage from the last meter read and record the corresponding unbilled revenue 
the accuracy of our unbilled revenue estimate is affected by factors including fluctuations in energy demands  weather  line losses and changes in the composition of customer classes 
we had estimated unbilled revenue of million as of december   and million as of december  
table of contents we account for energy marketing derivative contracts under the mark to market method of accounting 
under this method  we recognize changes in the portfolio value as gains or losses in the period of change 
with the exception of a fuel supply contract and a capacity sale contract  which we record as regulatory liabilities  we include the net mark to market change in sales on our consolidated statements of income 
we record the resulting unrealized gains and losses as energy marketing long term or short term assets and liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets as appropriate 
we use quoted market prices to value our energy marketing derivative contracts when such data is available 
when market prices are not readily available or determinable  we use alternative approaches  such as model pricing 
the prices we use to value these transactions reflect our best estimate of the fair value of these contracts 
results actually achieved from these activities could vary materially from intended results and could affect our consolidated financial statements 
the tables below show the fair value of energy marketing contracts that were outstanding as of december   their sources and maturity periods 
fair value of contracts in thousands net fair value of contracts outstanding as of december  a contracts outstanding at the beginning of the period that were realized or otherwise settled during the period changes in fair value of contracts outstanding at the beginning and end of the period fair value of new contracts entered into during the period fair value of contracts outstanding as of december  a a approximately million at december   and million at december   of the fair value of energy marketing contracts is recognized as a regulatory liability 
the sources of the fair values of the financial instruments related to these contracts as of december   are summarized in the following table 
fair value of contracts at end of period sources of fair value total fair value maturity less than year maturity years maturity years maturity over years in thousands prices actively quoted futures prices provided by other external sources swaps and forwards prices based on option pricing models options and other a total fair value of contracts outstanding a options are priced using a series of techniques  such as the black option pricing model 
income taxes we use the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes as required by sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
under the asset and liability method  we recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities for the future tax consequences attributable to temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax basis of existing assets and liabilities 
we recognize the future tax benefits to the extent that realization of such benefits is more likely than not 
we amortize deferred investment tax credits over the lives of the related properties as required by tax laws and regulatory practices 

table of contents we record deferred tax assets for capital losses  operating losses and tax credit carryforwards 
however  when we believe we do not  or will not have sufficient future capital gain income or taxable income to realize the benefit of the capital loss  operating loss or tax credit carryforwards  we reduce the deferred tax assets by a valuation allowance 
we recognize a valuation allowance if we determine  based on available evidence that it is unlikely that we will realize some portion or all of the deferred tax asset 
we report the effect of a change in the valuation allowance in the current period tax expense 
we account for uncertainty in income taxes in accordance with fin  accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
the application of income tax law is complex 
laws and regulations in this area are voluminous and are often ambiguous 
accordingly  we must make subjective assumptions and judgments regarding income tax exposures 
interpretations of and guidance surrounding income tax laws and regulations change over time 
as a result  changes in our subjective assumptions and judgments can materially affect amounts we recognize in the consolidated financial statements 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements  taxes  for additional detail of our uncertainty in income taxes 
asset retirement obligations we calculate our asset retirement obligations and related costs using the guidance provided by sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations and fin  accounting for conditional asset retirement obligations 
we estimate our asset retirement obligations based on the fair value of the asset retirement obligation we incurred at the time the related long lived asset was either acquired  placed in service or when regulations establishing the obligation become effective 
in determining our asset retirement obligations  we make assumptions regarding probable disposal costs 
a change in these assumptions could have a significant impact on our asset retirement obligations reflected on our consolidated balance sheets 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements  asset retirement obligations  for additional detail of our asset retirement obligations 
contingencies and litigation we are currently involved in certain legal proceedings and have estimated the probable cost for the resolution of these claims 
these estimates are based on an analysis of potential results  assuming a combination of litigation and settlement strategies 
it is possible that our future results could be materially affected by changes in our assumptions 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements  legal proceedings  for more detailed information 
operating results we evaluate operating results based on earnings per share 
we have various classifications of sales  defined as follows retail sales of energy made to residential  commercial and industrial customers 
other retail sales of energy for lighting public streets and highways  net of revenue subject to refund 
tariff based wholesale sales of energy to electric cooperatives  municipalities and other electric utilities  the rates for which are generally based on cost as prescribed by ferc tariffs 
this category also includes changes in valuations of contracts for the sale of such energy that have yet to settle 

table of contents market based wholesale includes i sales of energy to wholesale customers  the rates for which are generally based on prevailing market prices as allowed by ferc approved market based tariffs  or where not permitted  pricing is based on incremental cost plus a permitted margin and ii changes in valuations for contracts for the sale of such contracts that have yet to settle 
energy marketing includes i transactions based on market prices with volumes not related to the production of our generating assets or the demand of our retail customers  ii financially settled products and physical transactions sourced outside our control area  iii fees we earn for marketing services that we provide for third parties  and iv changes in valuations for contracts related to such transactions that have yet to settle 
transmission reflects transmission revenues  including those based on a tariff with the spp 
other miscellaneous electric revenues including ancillary service revenues and rent from electric property leased to others 
regulated electric utility sales are significantly impacted by such things as rate regulation  customer conservation efforts  wholesale demand  the economy of our service area and competitive forces 
changing weather affects the amount of electricity our customers use 
hot summer temperatures and cold winter temperatures prompt more demand  especially among our residential customers 
mild weather serves to reduce customer demand 
our wholesale sales are impacted by  among other factors  demand  cost and availability of fuel and purchased power  price volatility  available generation capacity and transmission availability 

table of contents compared to below we discuss our operating results for the year ended december   compared to the results for the year ended december  changes in results of operations are as follows 
year ended december  change change in thousands  except per share amounts sales residential commercial industrial other retail total retail sales tariff based wholesale market based wholesale energy marketing transmission a other total sales operating expenses fuel and purchased power operating and maintenance depreciation and amortization selling  general and administrative total operating expenses income from operations other income expense investment loss earnings other income other expense total other income expense interest expense income before income taxes income tax expense net income preferred dividends earnings available for common stock basic earnings per share a transmission includes an spp network transmission tariff 
in  our spp network transmission costs were million 
this amount  less million retained by the spp as administration cost  was returned to us as revenue 
in  our spp network transmission costs were million with an administration cost of million retained by the spp 
the following table reflects changes in electric sales volumes  as measured by thousands of mwh of electricity 
no sales volumes are shown for energy marketing  transmission or other 
energy marketing activities are unrelated to the amount of electricity we generate at our generating plants 
year ended december  change change thousands of mwh residential commercial industrial other retail total retail tariff based wholesale market based wholesale total 
table of contents notwithstanding a decrease in mwh sales volumes  retail sales were million higher for the year ended december   due principally to our prices including higher fuel and purchased power costs 
residential  commercial and industrial sales increased a combined million primarily because fuel costs reflected in the reca were million higher compared to last year 
partially offsetting the higher revenues attributable to the reca was the effect of cooler weather 
as measured by cooling degree days  the weather during was cooler than during the million change in other retail sales is due primarily to decreases in refund obligations compared to last year 
tariff based wholesale sales were million higher than last year attributable principally to a higher average price per mwh for these sales compared to last year 
the higher average price was the result of including higher fuel costs in the prices we charge 
partially offsetting the higher average price per mwh was a decrease in sales volumes due primarily to the expiration of wholesale contracts 
market based wholesale sales increased million compared to last year due principally to a higher average price for these sales compared to last year 
partially offsetting the higher average price was a decrease in sales volumes attributable primarily to our having less production available due to extended outages at some of our lower cost base load plants during energy marketing decreased million compared to the previous year due to several factors 
among them were the need to focus resources toward serving our retail customers during our extended outages  changes in the relationships of prices among energy products historically traded and the continuing maturation of the energy markets in which we participate reducing margin opportunities 
a notable trend is that more transactions are being completed through rto sponsored markets as opposed to negotiated transactions directly between counterparties 
while this trend is expected to continue  we are unable to determine how all of the aforementioned factors may affect energy marketing in the future 
contributing to the decrease was the recognition of a million customer refund obligation and the recognition of a million obligation related to claims made by an independent system operator seeking the re pricing of transactions conducted within that operator s region in prior periods 
fuel and purchased power expense increased million compared to last year 
the change in fuel and purchased power expense resulted from a number of factors  including the volumes of power we produced and purchased  prevailing market prices and contract provisions that allow for price changes 
fuel used for generation increased million  or  stemming primarily from outages at our lower cost  base load plants that caused us to rely more heavily on our plants that require more expensive fuels 
when compared to the year ended december   we used less fuel by volume this year  in part because of greater purchases of power from others 
because some of our plants that use the least expensive fuels ie nuclear and coal were not producing at times due to outages  we had the choice of either producing the needed volumes at plants that are more expensive to operate or acquiring those volumes from others 
generally  purchasing power from others was the more economical alternative  and as a result  our purchased power expense increased million  reflecting a increase in such volumes 
for almost all retail customers  the cost of fuel and purchased power we incur that is in excess of costs recovered in rates is deferred as a regulatory asset until the costs are recovered 
for the year ended december   we recovered million for fuel expense previously deferred compared to deferring million of fuel expense during the year ended december  depreciation and amortization expense increased million compared to last year due to depreciation expense associated with a higher plant balance 
the million increase in selling  general and administrative expense was due primarily to a million increase in legal costs 
various court orders require that we pay legal fees incurred by two former executive officers  related to the defense of criminal charges filed against them by the united states attorneys office 
higher legal expenses were also related to more regulatory activities 
also contributing to the increase was million in additional labor costs and a million increase in bad debt expense 
offsetting these increases was a million decrease in employee benefits expense 
investment earnings decreased million compared to last year due primarily to our having recorded a million loss on investments held in a trust used to fund retirement benefits 
we recorded a million gain on these investments for the prior year 

table of contents other income increased million compared to last year due primarily to our having recorded million of equity allowance for funds used during construction afudc this year compared to million of equity afudc recorded last year 
also contributing to the increase was a million gain on the sale of oil in in addition  we recorded million of corporate owned life insurance coli benefit this year compared to million of coli benefit recorded last year 
interest expense increased million compared to last year due primarily to interest on additional debt issued to fund investments in capital equipment 
partially offsetting this increase was the reversal of million of accrued interest associated with uncertain tax liabilities during income tax expense decreased million compared to last year due to the recognition of million of previously unrecognized tax benefits and the recognition of million in state tax incentives related to investment and jobs creation within the state of kansas 
compared to below we discuss our operating results for the year ended december   compared to the results for the year ended december  changes in results of operations are as follows 
year ended december  change change in thousands  except per share amounts sales residential commercial industrial other retail total retail sales tariff based wholesale market based wholesale energy marketing transmission a other total sales operating expenses fuel and purchased power operating and maintenance depreciation and amortization selling  general and administrative total operating expenses income from operations other income expense investment earnings other income other expense total other expense income interest expense income before income taxes income tax expense net income preferred dividends earnings available for common stock basic earnings per share a transmission includes an spp network transmission tariff 
in  our spp network transmission costs were million 
this amount  less million that was retained by the spp as administration cost  was returned to us as revenue 
in  our spp network transmission costs were million with an administration cost of million retained by the spp 

table of contents the following table reflects changes in electric sales volumes  as measured by thousands of mwh of electricity 
no sales volumes are shown for energy marketing  transmission or other 
energy marketing activities are unrelated to the amount of electricity we generate at our generating plants 
year ended december  change change thousands of mwh residential commercial industrial other retail total retail tariff based wholesale market based wholesale total retail sales were million higher for the year ended december   due principally to increases in other retail  commercial and residential sales 
other retail sales increased million due primarily to decreases in refund obligations 
commercial and residential sales increased a combined million due primarily to cooler weather during the winter months and customer growth in our service territory 
when measured by heating degree days  the weather during was cooler than during tariff based wholesale sales were million higher in than in due principally to increased sales volumes that were primarily the result of additional sales from the long term sale agreement entered into in with mid kansas electric company  llc 
the average price per mwh for these sales  however  was about lower in than in market based wholesale sales were million higher in than in due principally to increased sales volumes that were primarily the result of coal conservation efforts and a scheduled refueling outage at wolf creek  both of which occurred in and did not recur in the average price per mwh for these sales  however  was about lower in than in fuel and purchased power expense increased million in compared to the change in fuel and purchased power expense resulted from a number of factors  including the volumes of power we produced and purchased  prevailing market prices and contract provisions that allow for price changes 
we used more fuel in our generating plants in  due primarily to our not having had to conserve coal this year as we did in this resulted in million higher fuel expense compared with purchased power expense increased million over due primarily to higher prices  but were largely offset by a reduction in purchased volumes 
in through the reca  we deferred for future recovery million of fuel and purchased power costs as a regulatory asset compared with million in operating and maintenance expense increased million in compared to this was due primarily to higher maintenance costs of million for our power plants  electrical distribution system and transmission system and a million increase in spp network transmission costs that are in large part recovered through higher transmission revenues 
depreciation and amortization expense increased million in compared to this was due principally to depreciation expense associated with a higher plant balance including the capital lease associated with the purchase of aquila inc s aquila leasehold interest in jeffrey energy center 
selling  general and administrative expense increased million due primarily to a million increase in employee benefit costs and a million increase in labor costs 
these increases were partially offset by reduced legal fees associated with matters having to deal with former management 

table of contents other income decreased million in compared to due primarily to our having recorded million in proceeds from coli in compared to million in coli proceeds recorded in partially offsetting this decrease was the recording of million of equity afudc for  which compares to no equity afudc recorded for income tax expense increased million in compared to due primarily to decreases in the utilization of previously unrecognized capital loss carryforwards to offset realized capital gains and decreases in non taxable income from coli 
the increase was partially offset by increased tax benefits from the utilization of a net operating loss that had not previously been applied against income for other carryback or carryover years 
financial condition a number of factors affected amounts recorded on our balance sheet as of december   compared to december  given unprecedented uncertainty in capital markets and concerns about how well the banking industry may function amidst the turmoil  we decided to increase cash holdings to allow for additional flexibility  resulting in an increase in cash and cash equivalents of million over last year 
inventories and supplies increased million due primarily to a million increase related to new facilities and large construction projects 
upward adjustments to some of our coal contracts and increased freight costs together contributed to a million increase in coal inventory 
increases were partially offset by the sale of million of oil 
the fair market value of energy marketing contracts increased million to million at december  this was due primarily to favorable changes in market values of contracts outstanding throughout  in addition to contracts entered into in tax receivable decreased million due primarily to receipt of a tax refund and the settlement of the irs audit of tax years through regulatory assets  net of regulatory liabilities  increased million to million at december   from million at december  total regulatory assets increased million due primarily to the fair market value of employee benefit plan assets decreasing 
we recognize as a regulatory asset or regulatory liability the difference between the fair value of pension and post retirement benefit plan assets and the liabilities for our pension and post retirement benefit plans 
the significant decline in the value of pension assets in resulted in a million increase in regulatory assets 
further increasing regulatory assets was million of additional net deferred future income taxes 
total regulatory liabilities decreased million due primarily to a million decrease in the fair value of the nuclear decommissioning trust largely offset by a million increase in removal costs for amounts collected and not yet spent to remove retired assets 
other long term assets decreased million due primarily to a million decrease in the fair value of assets held in a trust used to fund retirement benefits 
other current liabilities increased million due primarily to declaring dividends on a greater number of shares in long term debt  net of current maturities  increased million due principally to the issuance of million of first mortgage bonds as discussed in detail in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements  long term debt 
the increase was partially offset by the reclassification of million of long term debt due august   to current maturities 
other long term liabilities decreased million due primarily to a million decrease in uncertain tax liabilities and related accrued interest 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements  taxes 

table of contents common stock and paid in capital increased million due principally to the issuance of common stock as discussed in note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements  common and preferred stock 
liquidity and capital resources overview available sources of funds to operate our business include internally generated cash  westar energy s revolving credit facility and access to capital markets 
we expect to meet our day to day cash requirements including  among others  fuel and purchased power  dividends  interest payments  income taxes and pension contributions  primarily using internally generated cash and borrowings under the revolving credit facility 
to meet the cash requirements for our capital investments  we expect to use internally generated cash  borrowings under the revolving credit facility and the issuance of debt and equity securities in the capital markets 
we also use the proceeds from the issuance of securities to repay borrowings under the revolving credit facility  with those borrowed amounts principally related to our investments in capital equipment  and for working capital and general corporate purposes 
the aforementioned sources and uses of cash are similar to our historical activities with a significant increase in cash requirements for our capital investments 
for additional information on our future cash requirements  see future cash requirements below 
in the latter part of  capital markets experienced unprecedented volatility and dramatic declines in asset valuations 
as a result  capital is more costly and more difficult to obtain 
in light of the current volatility and the unpredictability of how long these capital market conditions will persist  we have reduced or delayed construction spending and other capital outlays in order to manage liquidity 
additionally  this volatility  accompanied by reduced asset values  will require us to make additional contributions to the westar energy pension trust and to increase our funding of the wolf creek pension trust 
see pension obligation below for additional information 
we do not expect the previously mentioned economic conditions to impact our ability to pay dividends 
uncertainties affecting our ability to meet cash requirements include  among others factors affecting sales described in operating results above  economic conditions  regulatory actions  compliance with environmental regulations and conditions in the capital markets 
capital resources as of december   we had million in unrestricted cash and cash equivalents 
on january   we filed a request with ferc for authority to issue short term securities and to pledge kge mortgage bonds in order to increase the size of westar energy s revolving credit facility from million to million 
on february   ferc granted our request and on february   a syndicate of banks in the credit facility increased their commitments to million in the aggregate 
effective february   million of the commitments of the lenders under the revolving credit facility terminate on march  the remaining million of the commitments terminate on march  lehman brothers commercial paper  inc lehman brothers is the participating lender with respect to a million commitment terminating march  on october   lehman brothers filed for bankruptcy protection 
under terms of the credit facility  we have the right to replace lehman brothers should another lender or lenders be willing to replace the million commitment 
to date  we have elected not to seek a replacement lender 
as a result  until such time as we seek and locate a replacement lender or lenders  the revolving credit facility is limited to million 
as of february   million had been borrowed and an additional million of letters of credit had been issued under the revolving credit facility 
a default by westar energy or kge under other indebtedness totaling more than million would be a default under this facility 
westar energy is required to maintain a consolidated indebtedness to consolidated capitalization ratio not greater than at all times 
at december   our ratio was 
available liquidity under the facility is not impacted by a decline in westar energy s credit ratings 
also  the facility does not contain a material adverse effect clause requiring westar energy to represent  prior to each borrowing  that no event resulting in a material adverse effect has occurred 

table of contents the westar energy and kge mortgages each contain provisions restricting the amount of first mortgage bonds that can be issued by each entity 
we must comply with such restrictions prior to the issuance of additional first mortgage bonds or other secured indebtedness 
the westar energy mortgage prohibits additional first mortgage bonds from being issued  except in connection with certain refundings  unless westar energy s unconsolidated net earnings available for interest  depreciation and property retirement which as defined  does not include earnings or losses attributable to the ownership of securities of subsidiaries  for a period of consecutive months within months preceding the issuance  are not less than the greater of twice the annual interest charges on  and of the principal amount of  all first mortgage bonds outstanding after giving effect to the proposed issuance 
in addition  the issuance of bonds is subject to limitations based on the amount of bondable property additions 
as of december   based on an assumed interest rate of  approximately million principal amount of additional first mortgage bonds could be issued under the most restrictive provisions in the mortgage  except in connection with certain refundings 
the kge mortgage prohibits additional first mortgage bonds from being issued  except in connection with certain refundings  unless kge s net earnings before income taxes and before provision for retirement and depreciation of property for a period of consecutive months within months preceding the issuance are not less than either two and one half times the annual interest charges on  or of the principal amount of  all kge first mortgage bonds outstanding after giving effect to the proposed issuance 
in addition  the issuance of bonds is subject to limitations based on the amount of bondable property additions 
as of december   based on an assumed interest rate of  approximately million principal amount of additional kge first mortgage bonds could be issued under the most restrictive provisions in the mortgage 
common stock issuance on may   we entered into an underwriting agreement relating to the offer and sale of million shares of the company s common stock 
on june   we issued all million shares and received million in total proceeds  net of underwriting discounts and fees related to the offering 
on november   we entered into a forward sale agreement with a bank  as forward purchaser  relating to million shares of our common stock 
the forward sale agreement provides for the sale of our common stock within approximately twelve months at a stated settlement price 
in connection with the forward sale agreement  the bank borrowed an equal number of shares of our common stock from stock lenders and sold the borrowed shares to another bank under an underwriting agreement among westar energy and the banks 
the underwriters subsequently offered the borrowed shares to the public at a price per share of 
on december   we delivered million newly issued shares of our common stock to a bank and received proceeds of million as partial settlement of the forward sale agreement 
additionally  on february   we delivered million shares and received proceeds of million as partial settlement of the forward sale agreement 
on june   we completed the forward sale agreement by delivering million shares and receiving proceeds of million 
on august   we entered into a sales agency financing agreement with a bank 
under the terms of the agreement  we may offer and sell shares of our common stock from time to time through the bank  as agent  up to an aggregate of million for a period of no more than three years 
we will pay the bank a commission equal to of the sales price of all shares sold under the agreement 
during we sold million shares of common stock through the bank for million and received million in proceeds net of commission 
during we sold million shares of common stock through the bank for million and received million in proceeds net of commission 
on april   we entered into an earlier sales agency financing agreement with the same bank 
as of july   we had sold million shares of our common stock for million pursuant to the agreement 
we received million in proceeds net of a commission 

table of contents we used the proceeds from the issuance of common stock to repay borrowings under westar energy s revolving credit facility  with those borrowed amounts principally related to our investments in capital equipment  as well as for working capital and general corporate purposes 
cash flows from operating activities operating activities provided million of cash in the year ended december   compared with cash provided from operating activity of million during the same period of principal contributors to the increase were additional collections from customers during due in large part to our having recovered higher fuel costs from customers through the reca and million in lower income tax payments this year compared to last year 
offsetting these increases were our having paid million to restore our electrical system which was severely damaged by an ice storm in december  additional outages occurring this year at our base load plants  our having paid more for fuel and purchased power this year compared to last year  and during  we paid million more for our share of wolf creek s refueling outage 
cash flows from operating activities decreased million to million in  from million in during  as compared to  we paid approximately million more for natural gas used in our power plants  million more for coal inventory and million more in customer refunds 
offsetting these amounts were a million reduction in la cygne unit lease payments  million less in voluntary contributions to our pension trust and cash realized from higher gross margins 
during  we also used million related to the termination of our accounts receivable sales program 
cash flows used in investing activities in general  cash used for investing purposes relates to the growth and improvement of our electric utility business 
the utility business is capital intensive and requires significant investment in plant on an annual basis 
we spent million in  million in and million in on net additions to utility property  plant and equipment 
the increase from to is due primarily to environmental projects  wind generation projects  transmission projects and the construction of emporia energy center 
cash flows used in financing activities we received net cash flows from financing activities of million in proceeds from the issuance of long term debt provided million  proceeds from the issuance of common stock provided million and borrowings from coli provided million 
we used cash to pay million in dividends and to retire million of long term debt 
in  we received net cash flows from financing activities of million 
proceeds from the issuance of long term debt provided million and proceeds from the issuance of common stock provided million 
we used cash to pay million in dividends 
in  we received net cash flows from financing activities of million 
an increase in short term debt was the principal source of cash flows from financing activities 
cash from financing activities was used to retire long term debt and to pay dividends 
future cash requirements our business requires significant capital investments 
through  we expect we will need cash primarily for utility construction programs designed to improve and expand facilities providing electric service  which include but are not limited to expenditures for peaking capacity needs  new transmission lines and for compliance with environmental regulations 
we expect to meet these cash needs with internally generated cash flow  borrowings under westar energy s revolving credit facility and through the issuance of securities in the capital markets 

table of contents we have incurred and expect to continue to incur material costs to comply with existing and future environmental laws and regulations  all of which are subject to changing interpretations and amendments 
in addition  the current focus on the effect of air emissions on the global environment could result in significantly more stringent laws and regulations or interpretations thereof that could affect our company and industry in particular 
these laws  regulations and interpretations could result in more stringent terms in our existing operating permits or a failure to obtain new permits  could cause a material increase in our capital or operational costs and could otherwise have a material effect on our operations 
while we believe we can generally recover environmental costs through rate increases  there is no guarantee that we will be able to do so 
in addition  we may be subject to significant fines and penalties in connection with the nsr investigation and the related doj lawsuit or other matters  and such fines and penalties may not be recovered through rate increases 
capital expenditures for and anticipated capital expenditures including costs of removal for through are shown in the following table 
actual in thousands generation replacements and other additional capacity wind generation environmental nuclear fuel transmission a distribution replacements and other new customers other total capital expenditures a includes  in and  in for expenditures related to prairie wind transmission 
we prepare these estimates for planning purposes and revise our estimates from time to time 
actual expenditures will differ  perhaps materially  from our estimates due to changing environmental requirements  changing costs  delays in engineering  construction or permitting  changes in the availability and cost of capital  and other factors discussed above in item a

factors that impact our credit ratings include a combination of objective and subjective criteria 
objective criteria include typical financial ratios  such as total debt to total capitalization and funds from operations to total debt  among others  future capital expenditures and our access to liquidity including committed lines of credit 
subjective criteria include such items as the quality and credibility of management  the political and regulatory environment we operate in and an assessment of our governance and risk management practices

the amount of afudc capitalized as a construction cost is credited to other income for equity funds and interest expense for borrowed funds on the accompanying consolidated statements of income  as follows year ended december  in thousands borrowed funds equity funds total average afudc rates we expect both afudc for borrowed funds and equity funds to fluctuate over the next several years as we add generating capacity  expand our transmission system and make significant environmental improvements

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our fuel procurement and energy marketing activities involve primary market risk exposures  including commodity price risk  credit risk and interest rate risk 
commodity price risk is the potential adverse price impact related to the purchase or sell of electricity and fuel procurement for our generating units 
credit risk is the potential adverse financial impact resulting from non performance by a counterparty of its contractual obligations 
interest rate risk is the potential adverse financial impact related to changes in interest rates 
market price risks we engage in physical and financial trading activities with the goals of reducing risk from market fluctuations  enhancing system reliability and increasing profits 
we procure and trade electricity  coal  natural gas and other energy related products by utilizing energy commodity contracts and a variety of financial instruments  including forward and futures contracts  options and swaps 
prices in the wholesale power markets often are extremely volatile 
this volatility impacts our cost of power purchased and our participation in energy trades 
if we were unable to generate an adequate supply of electricity for our customers  we would attempt to purchase power from others 
such supplies are not always available 
in addition  congestion on the transmission system can limit our ability to make purchases from or sell into the wholesale markets 
the inability to make wholesale purchases may require that we interrupt or curtail services to our customers 
net open positions exist  or are established  due to the origination of new transactions and our assessment of  and response to  changing market conditions 
to the extent we have open positions  we are exposed to changes in market prices 
additional factors that affect our commodity price exposure are the quantity and availability of fuel used for generation and the quantity of electricity customers consume 
the availability and deliverability of generating fuel  including fossil and nuclear fuels  can vary significantly from one period to the next 
our customers electricity usage could also vary from year to year based on the weather or other factors 
the loss of revenues or higher costs associated with such conditions could be material and adverse to our consolidated financial statements 
our risk of loss is mitigated through the use of the reca and similar adjustment mechanisms that we maintain for many of our wholesale sales contracts and tariffs 
hedging activity in an effort to mitigate market risk associated with fuel procurement and energy marketing  we may use economic hedging arrangements to reduce our exposure to price changes 
we may use physical contracts and financial derivative instruments to hedge the price of a portion of our anticipated fossil fuel needs or excess generation sales 
at the time we enter into these transactions  we are unable to determine the hedge value until the agreements are actually settled 
our future exposure to changes in prices will be dependent on the market prices and the extent and effectiveness of any economic hedging arrangements into which we enter 

table of contents commodity price exposure we manage and measure the market price risk exposure of our trading portfolio using a variance covariance value at risk var model 
in addition to var  we employ additional risk control processes such as stress testing  daily loss limits  credit limits and position limits 
we expect to use similar control processes in the use of var requires assumptions  including the selection of a confidence level for potential losses and the estimated holding period 
we express var as a potential dollar loss based on a confidence level using a one day holding period 
it is possible that actual results may differ markedly from assumptions 
accordingly  var may not accurately reflect our levels of exposures 
the energy trading and market based wholesale portfolio var amounts for and were as follows in thousands high low average we have considered a variety of risks and costs associated with the future contractual commitments included in our trading portfolios 
these risks include valuation and marking of illiquid pricing locations and products  the financial condition of our counterparties and interest rate movement 
see the credit risk and interest rate exposure discussions below for additional information 
also  there can be no assurance that the employment of var  credit practices or other risk management tools we employ will eliminate possible losses 
credit risk we have exposure to counterparty default risk with our retail  wholesale and energy marketing activities  including participation in rtos 
we maintain credit policies intended to reduce overall credit risk 
we employ additional credit risk control mechanisms that we believe are appropriate  such as requiring counterparties to issue letters of credit or parental guarantees in our favor and entering into master netting agreements with counterparties that allow for offsetting exposures 
interest rate exposure we have entered into numerous fixed and variable rate debt obligations 
for details  see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements  long term debt 
we manage our interest rate risk related to these debt obligations by limiting our variable interest rate exposure and utilizing various maturity dates 
we may also use swaps or other financial instruments to manage our interest rate risk 
we compute and present information about the sensitivity to changes in interest rates for variable rate debt and current maturities of fixed rate debt by assuming a basis point change in the current interest rate applicable to such debt over the remaining time the debt is outstanding 
we had approximately million of variable rate debt and current maturities of fixed rate debt as of december  a basis point change in interest rates applicable to this debt would impact income before income taxes on an annualized basis by approximately million 
as of december   we had million of variable rate bonds insured by bond insurers 
interest rates payable under these bonds are set at periodic auctions 
conditions in the credit markets have caused the demand for auction bonds to decline generally and have caused our borrowing costs to increase 
additionally  should those bond insurers experience a decrease in credit rating  such event would most likely increase our borrowing costs as well 
in addition  a decline in interest rates generally can serve to increase our pension and post retirement obligations and affect investment returns 

table of contents security price risk we maintain trust funds  as required by the nrc and kansas state laws  to fund certain costs of nuclear plant decommissioning 
as of december   investments by the nuclear decommissioning trust fund were allocated to equity securities  to debt securities  to real estate  to commodities and to cash and cash equivalents 
the fair value of these funds was million as of december   and million as of december  we also maintain a trust that is used to fund retirement benefits 
as of december   these funds were comprised of equity securities  debt securities and cash and cash equivalents 
the fair value of these funds was million as of december   and million as of december  by maintaining diversified portfolios of securities  we seek to maximize the returns to fund these obligations within acceptable risk tolerances 
however  debt and equity securities in the portfolios are exposed to price fluctuations in the capital markets 
if the value of the securities diminishes  the cost of funding the obligations rises 
we actively monitor the portfolios by benchmarking the performance of the investments against relevant indices and by maintaining and periodically reviewing the asset allocation in relation to established policy targets 
our exposure to equity price market risk related to the nuclear decommissioning fund is  in part  mitigated because we are currently allowed to recover decommissioning costs in the rates we charge our customers
