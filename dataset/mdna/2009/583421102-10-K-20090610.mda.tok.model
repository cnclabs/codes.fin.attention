item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations our management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations md a is intended to provide the reader of the company s financial statements with a narrative from the perspective of company s management 
to that end  this discussion contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in the forward looking statements as a result of a variety of factors  including without limitation  those factors described under the caption risk factors in part  item a of this annual report on form k 
furthermore  the following discussion of our results of operations and financial condition should be read together with the other financial information and consolidated financial statements and related notes included in this annual report on form k 
our fiscal year begins on april and ends on march references in this report to the year or fiscal refer to the month period from april  through march  and references in this report to the year or fiscal refer to the month period from april  through march  overview measurement specialties  inc is a global leader in the design  development and manufacture of sensors and sensor based systems for original equipment manufacturers and end users  based on a broad portfolio of proprietary technology 
the company is a multi national corporation with eleven primary manufacturing facilities strategically located in the united states  china  france  ireland  germany and switzerland  enabling the company to produce and market world wide a broad range of sensors that use advanced technologies to measure precise ranges of physical characteristics 
these sensors are used for automotive  medical  consumer  military aerospace  and industrial applications 
the company s sensor products include pressure sensors and transducers  linear rotary position sensors  piezoelectric polymer film sensors  custom microstructures  load cells  accelerometers  optical sensors  humidity and temperature sensors 
the company s advanced technologies include piezo resistive silicon sensors  application specific integrated circuits  micro electromechanical systems  piezoelectric polymers  foil strain gauges  force balance systems  fluid capacitive devices  linear and rotational variable differential transformers  electromagnetic displacement sensors  hygroscopic capacitive sensors  ultrasonic sensors  optical sensors  negative thermal coefficient ceramic sensors and mechanical resonators 
effective december   we completed the sale of our consumer segment  including our cayman island subsidiary  measurement limited ml  to fervent group limited fgl 
fgl is a company controlled by the owners of river display limited  our long time partner and primary supplier of consumer products in shenzhen  china 
accordingly  the related financial statements for the consumer segment are reported as discontinued operations 
all comparisons in management s discussion and analysis for each of the periods ended march   and  exclude the results of these discontinued operations except as otherwise noted 
executive summary the company remains focused on creating long term shareholder value 
to accomplish this goal  we continue to execute measures we believe will result in higher sales performance in excess of the overall market and generation of positive ebitda 
we have implemented aggressive actions not only to proactively address the current economic recession  but to position the company for future growth in sales and profitability  all of which ultimately we expect to translate to enhanced shareholder value 
we started fiscal with positive sales and profit growth  well on track to achieve another record year 
sales then changed very quickly and drastically  and by the final months of fiscal  we were into one of the worst recessions in decades 
there continues to be economic downward pressure in most areas of the economy  resulting in extremely difficult and challenging times for us and our customers 
sales in all of our markets decreased during fiscal our sales to the automotive and heavy truck sector were especially hard hit 
in spite of not losing any major customers in to competitive situations and having a diversified global customer base with a wide range of sensor products  we have had significant variability in our sales  earnings and cash flows 
the high degree of economic uncertainty has created a situation whereby our visibility with respect to future performance has been greatly diminished 
accordingly  we have taken decisive action  including aligning our labor workforce with the latest projected sale volumes 
we have lowered costs through significant reductions in headcount  cut management salaries and eliminated the company s management bonus program and k match  as well as curtailed capital expenditures and implemented other cost control measures 
additionally  the company modified the three business group structure  in order to  among other things  better focus on cross selling of the differing sensor products and to address current business conditions and certain changes within the management group  which resulted in one operating segment 
furthermore  effective april   the company entered into an amendment to the credit agreement with our lenders whereby the company proactively negotiated a reduction of our debt covenant requirements 
as a result of the decline in our sales and profitability resulting from the impact of the global recession  the company negotiated revisions to its debt covenant requirements for fiscal  which will  among other things  result in higher fees and interest rates charged by our lenders to the company and a reduction in the principal amount available under our revolver to  we believe that these revisions to our debt covenants should address the adverse impact of the recession with respect to our covenant requirements  but there can be no assurance that these reductions will be sufficient  particularly if the recession is longer or worse than we expect 
as part of this credit facility amendment  the company will be prohibited from any future acquisitions without lender approval during the covenant relief period which ends march  we have taken several additional critical steps to better position the company not only to weather the recession but to capitalize on opportunities when the economy improves 
to that end  we currently have one of the strongest product development pipelines in the history of the company  which we expect to lay the foundation for accelerated future sales growth 
research and development will continue to play a key role in our efforts to maintain product innovations for new sales and to improve profitability 
consistent with our strategy to expand our product portfolio  global footprint and additional opportunities for cost synergies  we completed the acquisitions of atexis and fgp on january  the acquisitions 
atexis expanded our temperature sensors and probes business utilizing ntc  platinum pt and thermo couple technologies and increased our temperature manufacturing base through wholly owned subsidiaries in france and china 
fgp was a competitor in custom force  pressure and vibration sensors for aerospace and test and measurement markets 
a core tenet of our strategy is providing customized solutions to our customers 
to cost effectively deliver this service  we have completed the expansion of our infrastructure in china 
today  products generating approximately of our net sales are manufactured in china and nearly of our global employees are in our china operation 
given our commitment to the region in general  and shenzhen in particular  and in order to mitigate the continued lease cost escalation in the future and add adequate room for expansion  we made the decision two years ago to lease property in shenzhen and build a new manufacturing facility and asian headquarters 
we completed construction late in calendar on our new  square foot facility 
the total investment in the new facility is approximately  this investment is at the upper end of our initial estimated range when stated in us dollars  largely due to the appreciation of the chinese renminbi rmb 
in addition to providing a low cost operation from which we can support operations in other regions of the world  we believe our operation in china provides a gateway to drive increased sales in china and asia 
our local sales in china  while relatively small today  are expanding at nearly twice the rate of our overall growth rate  and remain a key area of opportunity for the company 
while the global economic decline and recent performance of the company s stock price are disappointing  we firmly believe that long term  the company will create shareholder value through our efforts for sales growth and positive ebitda generation 
there have been a number of recent factors adversely affecting our stock price  including our direct link to the automotive business and the overall impact on equities from the economic recession  particularly in light of our relatively low trading volume 
it is important to put the company s automotive business in perspective 
our sales to the automotive market ie  passenger cars light trucks  buses  heavy trucks and tractors represents about of our overall business 
the company has a strong market position in automotive  but not to the degree to categorize the company as a primarily auto dependent supplier 
the significant drop in global automotive sales and uncertainty with the impact of the ongoing restructuring of the big three automakers in the us  have had an adverse impact on the company  because the automotive sector is an important global market for us 
however  we have a relatively broad market and customer base and next year we expect about three quarters of our sales and a greater portion of our profits to come from outside of the automotive market 
the decrease of our stock price and resulting decline in our market capitalization triggered an interim impairment test of goodwill at december  as detailed in results of operations contained later in item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  and notes and to the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report file on form k  the company is required to test goodwill for impairment annually at fiscal year end and more frequently if events and circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired 
at december  and march   the company performed an impairment assessment of goodwill  and based on this testing  there was no impairment of goodwill 
the process of evaluating the potential impairment of goodwill is subjective and requires significant judgment at many points during the analysis 
to derive the fair value of our reporting unit  the company performed various valuation analyses primarily utilizing the discounted cash flow or income approach 
under the income approach  we determined fair value based on estimated future cash flows discounted by an estimated weighted average cost of capital  which considered the overall level of inherent risk of the reporting unit and the rate of return an outside investor would expect to earn 
although our cash flow forecasts are based on assumptions that are considered reasonable by management and consistent with the plans and estimates we are using to manage the underlying businesses  there is significant judgment in determining the expected future cash flows attributable to our business 
while we believe the fair values we have estimated are reasonable  actual performance in the short term and long term could be materially different from our forecasts  which could impact future estimates of fair value of our reporting unit and may result in impairment of goodwill 
the company also performed an impairment analysis as of the end of fiscal for long lived assets and amortizable intangible assets in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets sfas no 
 since there were triggering events  including  the decline in the company s financial performance  decline in the company s stock price and negative economic trends 
long lived assets  such as property  plant  and equipment  and purchased intangibles subject to amortization are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset 
if the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its estimated future cash flows  an impairment charge is recognized by the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the asset 
the company evaluated long lived assets and amortizable intangible assets for impairment  and based on this analysis  there was no impairment identified for  or the company recorded a valuation allowance of approximately  at march  for certain deferred tax assets associated with net operating loss carryforwards nols principally at our german subsidiary 
this non cash charge to income tax expense reduced our net income by  or approximately per diluted share 
accounting guidance for such valuation allowances is strictly based on the evaluation of positive and negative evidence which can be objectively verified as to whether it is more likely than not that the nols will be utilized  and if positive evidence does not outweigh negative evidence  the conclusion is that a valuation allowance is required 
at march   our german subsidiary had cumulative losses over the past three years  primarily due to the decrease in profitability during the second half of fiscal as a result of the global recession 
the negative evidence of three years of cumulative losses was considered to outweigh the positive evidence that the net operating losses were not subject to expiration  because the long term prospects of future profitability were not considered objectively verifiable 
we expect our german subsidiary to return to profitability in a future period and we will continue to assess positive and negative evidence to determine if a valuation allowance is required in future periods 
the fundamentals of the company are sound and we continue to become the supplier of choice to oem and select end users for their physical sensing needs 
since fiscal  we have invested over  in the company s future  establishing the foundation for creating long term shareholder value 
the significant investments include the fourteen companies we have acquired with a total purchase price of over  in excess of  for our new china facility and  in other capital expenditures  all of which greatly expanded the company s global footprint to further diversify our manufacturing  customer and product bases 
trends there are a number of trends that we expect to have material effects on the company in the future  including global economic conditions with the resulting impact on sales  profitability  capital spending  changes in foreign currency exchange rates relative to the us dollar  changes in debt levels and interest rates  and shifts in our overall effective tax rate 
our visibility with respect to future sales is very limited at this time 
current market indicators are mixed  but there are some recent signs of some stabilization 
however  there continue to be indications that global demand will not quickly recover and may continue to contract for most  if not all  of fiscal such lower demand levels are anticipated to continue to adversely impact the company s sales and profitability 
in particular  the company s automotive  housing and industrial businesses are likely to be the most impacted with medical technologies less affected 
in future periods  we expect the sensor market will continue to perform well relative to the overall economy as a result of the increase in sensor content in various products across most end markets in the us  europe and asia 
while we believe third and fourth quarter sales in fiscal were unusually hard hit as a result of reducing inventory levels in the supply chain to match lower anticipated demand  it is not yet clear how much improvement  if any  we will see in future quarters  or whether sales will continue to decline 
since we cannot provide definitive sales guidance  it is also challenging to provide guidance for gross margins 
within this context  we expect gross margins in fiscal to range from approximately to  primarily reflecting the impact of a more stable product sales mix and stability in the value of the rmb relative to the us dollar 
gross margins have trended down over the past several years  largely due to unfavorable product sales mix both in terms of organic growth and acquired sales and the impact of the increase in the value of the rmb relative to the us dollar 
however  our gross margins improved slightly in fiscal as compared to the prior year because of the decrease in the proportionate amount of lower grossing product mix  especially with sales to our largest customer and automotive market 
our sales to the automotive market are usually characterized as higher volumes but carry lower gross margins than our average 
since the company s china operations have more costs than sales denominated in rmb short rmb position  increases in the rmb relative to the us dollar have resulted in margin erosion 
however  over the past several months  the rmb has stabilized relative to the us dollar  and this trend is expected to continue into fiscal finally  as with all manufacturers  our gross margins are sensitive to the overall volume of business ie  economies of scale in that certain costs are fixed  and since our overall level of business declined in  especially during the second half  our gross margins and overall level of profits decreased accordingly 
we expect continued downward pressures on our gross margins given our expectation that global demand will not recover and may continue to contract for total selling  general and administrative expense total sg a as a percent of net sales increased in as compared to prior years  reflecting the drop in sales and the increase in total sg a expenses due to sg a expenses related to acquisitions 
historically  we have been successful in leveraging our sg a expense  growing sg a expense more slowly than our sales growth in  but the global economic recession adversely impacted our sg a leverage 
as a percent of sales  total sg a has increased to  as compared to and in fiscal years and  respectively 
given fiscal sales will be lower than in past years  as well as a result of continued investment in r d costs for new programs that are not yet generating sales such as our new fluid property sensor and the higher costs associated with recent acquisitions  we are expecting a slight decrease in sg a as a percent of sales in fiscal  excluding amortization and stock option expense 
additionally  certain costs directly related to the recession could increase more than expected  including such costs as the amendment fees charged by our lenders and related professional fees  as well as bad debt expenses due to uncollectible trade receivables 
the company does not have any significant direct trade receivable exposures with chrysler or general motors  since we are primarily a tier two or tier three supplier to them 
the company attempts to offset such cost increases through continued efforts to control costs 
the company does not expect to make any acquisitions during fiscal amortization of acquired intangible assets increased dramatically from fiscal to fiscal  associated with the acquisitions of intersema and visyx the acquisitions and the acquisitions 
amortization is disproportionately loaded more in the initial year of the acquisition  and therefore amortization expense is higher in the quarters immediately following a transaction  and declines after the first year based on how various intangible assets are valued and amortized 
even with the acquisitions of atexis and fgp completed toward the end of fiscal  amortization is expected to decrease in fiscal as compared to fiscal to approximately  based on current exchange rates and preliminary purchase accounting allocations 
in addition to the margin exposure as a result of the depreciation of the us dollar due to higher level of costs than sales denominated in rmb  the company also has foreign currency exchange exposures with balance sheet accounts 
when foreign currency exchange rates fluctuate  there is a resulting revaluation of assets and liabilities denominated and accounted for in foreign currencies 
foreign currency exchange fx expense due to the revaluation of local subsidiary balance sheet accounts with realized fx transactions and unrealized fx translation adjustments has increased sharply in recent years  because of  among other factors  volatility of foreign currency exchange rates 
for example  our swiss company  intersema  which uses the swiss franc as their functional currency  holds cash denominated in foreign currencies us dollar and euro 
as the swiss franc appreciates against the us dollar and or euro  the cash balances held in those denominations are devalued when stated in terms of swiss francs 
these transaction and translation losses are reflected in our foreign currency exchange loss 
aside from cash  our foreign entities generally hold receivables in foreign currencies  as well as payables 
in fiscal and  we posted a net expense of and  respectively  in realized and unrealized foreign exchange losses associated with the revaluation of foreign assets held by foreign entities 
we would expect to see continued fx expense associated with volatility of foreign currency exchange rates 
on average the us dollar weakened relative to the rmb  but appreciated against the euro and swiss franc during fiscal the company has used foreign currency contracts to hedge some of this exposure 
the company has not hedged all of this exposure  but has accepted the exposure to exchange rate movements without using derivative financial instruments to manage this risk under hedge accounting 
therefore  both positive and negative movements in currency exchange rates relative to the us dollar will continue to affect the reported amounts of sales  profits  and assets and liabilities in the company s consolidated financial statements 
our overall effective tax rate will continue to fluctuate as a result of the allocation of earnings among various taxing jurisdictions with varying tax rates 
we expect our overall effective tax rate in to increase resulting from  among other factors  a higher tax rate in china  the valuation allowance to be recorded for additional net operating losses at our german subsidiary  and a higher percentage of total profits generated in jurisdictions with higher tax rates than our overall average effective tax rate 
the company expects to continue investing in various capital projects in fiscal  and capital spending in is expected to approximate  this level is lower than fiscal  because capital spending in included the completion of the new china facility  as well as reductions related to various cost control measures 
changes in our business acquisitions and divestures the company made two acquisitions during fiscal acquisitions 
atexis expanded our temperature sensors and probes utilizing ntc  platinum pt and thermo couples technologies and increased our temperature manufacturing base through wholly owned subsidiaries in france and china 
fgp was a competitor of custom force  pressure and vibration sensors for aerospace and test and measurement markets 
effective december   we completed the sale of the consumer segment to fervent group limited fgl  including its cayman island subsidiary  ml cayman 
fgl is a company controlled by the owners of river display limited rdl  our long time partner and primary supplier of consumer products in shenzhen  china 
accordingly  the related financial statements for the consumer segment are reported as discontinued operations 
all comparisons in management s discussion and analysis for consolidated statements of operations and consolidated statements of cash flows for each of the fiscal years ended march   and  and consolidated balance sheets as of march  and  exclude the results of these discontinued operations except as otherwise noted

application of critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and revenues and expenses during the periods reported 
the following accounting policies involve critical accounting estimates because they are particularly dependent on estimates and assumptions made by management about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the accounting estimates are made 
in addition  while we have used our best estimates based on facts and circumstances available to us at the time  different estimates reasonably could have been used in the current period  or changes in the accounting estimates we used are reasonably likely to occur from period to period which may have a material impact on the presentation of our financial condition and results of operations 
we review these estimates and assumptions periodically and reflect the effects of revisions in the period that they are determined to be necessary 
revenue recognition the company derives revenues primarily from the sale of sensors and sensor based systems 
revenue is recognized in accordance with sab no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements  as amended by sab no 
 revenue recognition 
in order for revenue and related cost of sales from product sales to be recognized there must persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the price to the buyer is fixed or determinable  and collectability of the related receivable is reasonably assured 
the company s standard terms are fob shipping point  but a small portion of our customers have fob destination terms 
based on the above criteria  revenue is recognized depending on the specific terms of the arrangement either at the point of shipment for those sales under fob shipping point terms or when it is received by the customer for sales under fob destination terms 
for those transactions that are shipped at or near the end of the reporting period for which the sales terms are fob destination  the company confirms receipt of the shipment  and if delivery has not occurred  then the revenue is not recognized 
product sales are recorded net of trade discounts at the point of sale including volume and early payment incentives because these allowances reflect a reduction in the price for the products in accordance with emerging issues task force issue eitf  accounting for consideration given by a vendor to a customer including a reseller of a vendor s products  sales returns  value added tax and similar taxes 
shipping and handling costs are included in cost of revenue 
sales to customers generally include a right of return 
the company provides for allowances for returns based upon historical and estimated return rates  as required by sfas no 
 revenue recognition when right of return exists 
sales returns have not historically been significant to our revenues and have been within the estimates made by management 
the amount of actual returns could differ from estimates 
changes in estimated returns would be accounted for in the period of change 
many of our products are designed and engineered to meet customer specifications  and customer arrangements do not involve post installation or post sale testing and acceptance 
there is no significant variation in sales terms geographically  or among product lines and industries 
accounts receivable trade accounts receivable are recorded at the invoiced amount and do not bear interest 
the majority of the company s accounts receivable is due from manufacturers of electronic  automotive  military  medical and industrial products 
credit is extended based on an evaluation of a customer s financial condition and  collateral is not required 
accounts receivable are generally due within to days and are stated at amounts due from customers net of allowances for doubtful accounts and other sales allowances 
accounts receivable outstanding longer than the contractual payment terms are considered past due 
amounts collected on trade accounts receivable are included in net cash provided by operating activities in the consolidated statements of cash flows 
the allowance for doubtful accounts is the company s best estimate of the amount of probable credit losses in the company s existing accounts receivable 
the company determines its allowance by considering a number of factors  including the length of time trade accounts receivable are past due  the company s previous loss history  the customer s current ability to pay its obligation to the company  and the condition of the general economy and the industry as a whole 
the company reviews its allowance for doubtful accounts quarterly 
recent deterioration in overall global economic conditions and worldwide credit markets heightens the uncertainties related to customers ability to pay and may increase the difficulty in collecting accounts receivable 
if the financial condition of the company s customers were to deteriorate beyond our estimates  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  the company would be required to reserve and write off additional accounts receivable balances  which would adversely impact the company s net earnings and financial condition 
actual uncollectible accounts could exceed the company s estimates and changes to its estimates will be accounted for in the period of change 
account balances are charged against the allowance after all means of collection have been exhausted and the potential for recovery is considered remote 
the company does not have any off balance sheet credit exposure related to its customers 
inventories inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market lcm 
for purposes of analyzing the lcm  market is current replacement cost 
cost is determined on a standard cost basis which approximates historical cost 
market cannot exceed the net realizable value ie  estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business less reasonably predicted costs of completion and disposal and market shall not be less than net realizable value reduced by an allowance for an approximately normal profit margin 
in evaluating lcm  management also considers  if applicable  other factors as well  including known trends  market conditions  currency exchange rates and other such issues 
if the utility of goods is impaired by damage  deterioration  obsolescence  changes in price levels or other causes  a loss shall be charged as cost of sales in the period which it occurs 
the company makes purchasing decisions principally based upon firm sales orders from customers  the availability and pricing of raw materials and projected customer requirements 
future events that could adversely affect these decisions and result in significant charges to our operations include slowdown in customer demand  customer delay in the issuance of sales orders  miscalculation of customer requirements  technology changes that render raw materials and finished goods obsolete  loss of customers and or cancellation of sales orders 
the company establishes reserves for its inventories to recognize estimated obsolescence and unusable items on a continual basis 
generally  products that have existed in inventory for months with no usage and that have no current demand or no expected demand  will be considered obsolete and fully reserved 
obsolete inventory approved for disposal is written off against the reserve 
market conditions surrounding products are also considered periodically to determine if there are any net realizable valuation matters  which would require a write down of any related inventories 
if market or technological conditions change  it may be necessary for additional inventory reserves and write downs  which would be accounted for in the period of change 
the level of inventory reserves reflects the nature of the industry whereby technological and other changes  such as customer buying requirements  result in impairment of inventory 
cash flows from the purchase and sale of inventory are included in cash flows from operating activities 
goodwill impairment goodwill represents the excess of the aggregate purchase price over the fair value of the net identifiable assets acquired in a purchase business combination 
in accordance with sfas no 
 management assesses goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level on an annual basis at fiscal year end or more frequently under certain circumstances 
the goodwill impairment test is a two step test 
under the first step  the fair value of the reporting unit is compared to its carrying value including goodwill 
if the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value  an indication of goodwill impairment exists for the reporting unit  and the enterprise must perform step two of the impairment test measurement 
under step two  an impairment loss is recognized for any excess of the carrying amount of the reporting unit s goodwill over the implied fair value 
the implied fair value of goodwill is determined by allocating the fair value of the reporting unit in a manner similar to a purchase price allocation  in accordance with sfas no 
 business combinations 
the residual fair value after this allocation is the implied fair value of the reporting unit goodwill 
fair value of the reporting unit is determined using a discounted cash flow analysis 
if the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying value  step two does not need to be performed and goodwill is not impaired 
the process of evaluating the potential impairment of goodwill is subjective and requires significant judgment at many points during the analysis 
to derive the fair value of our reporting unit  the company performed various valuation analyses primarily utilizing the discounted cash flow or income approach 
under the income approach  we determined fair value based on estimated future cash flows discounted by an estimated weighted average cost of capital  which is considered the overall level of inherent risk of a reporting unit and the rate of return an outside investor would expect to earn 
although our cash flow forecasts are based on assumptions that are considered reasonable by management and consistent with the plans and estimates we are using to manage the underlying businesses  there is significant judgment in determining the expected future cash flows attributable to these businesses 
while we believe the fair values we have estimated are reasonable  actual performance in the short term and long term could be materially different from our forecasts  which could impact future estimates of fair value of our reporting unit and may result in impairment of goodwill in future periods 
in evaluating goodwill for impairment  the fair value of the company s reporting units were determined using the discounted cash flow analysis in and the implied fair value approach in and the implied fair value approach consists of comparing the company s market capitalization to the company s book value 
if the market capitalization exceeds book value  there is no impairment of goodwill 
our evaluations were completed in the fiscal years ended march   and for asset values as of these respective dates 
based on our analyses and the guidelines established under sfas no 
 management has concluded there was no impairment of the company s goodwill in  and in for further details regarding the goodwill impairment analysis under sfas no 
 including the weighted cost of capital utilized and the reconciliation of the company s fair value based on the discounted cash flow approach to the market approach and market capitalization  see results of operations contained later in item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and notes and to the consolidated financial statements in this annual report filed on form k

in all acquisitions  the purchase price of the acquired business is allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed at their fair values on the date of the acquisition 
the fair values of these items are based upon management s best estimates using various valuation approaches  including the relief from royalty method  cost approach and income approach  depending on the circumstances 
certain of the acquired assets are intangible in nature  including customer relationships  patented and proprietary technology  covenants not to compete  trade names and order backlog  which are stated at cost less accumulated amortization 
amortization is computed by the straight line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets 
the excess purchase price over the amounts allocated to the assets is recorded as goodwill 
all such valuation methodologies  including the determination of subsequent amortization periods  involve significant judgments and estimates 
different assumptions and subsequent actual events could yield materially different results 
purchased intangibles and goodwill are usually not deductible for tax purposes in stock acquisitions 
however  purchase accounting requires the establishment of deferred tax liabilities on purchased intangible assets excluding goodwill to the extent the carrying value for financial reporting exceeds the tax basis 
long lived assets the company accounts for the impairment of long lived assets and amortizable intangible assets in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets sfas no 

long lived assets  such as property  plant  and equipment  and purchased intangibles subject to amortization are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset 
if the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its estimated future cash flows  an impairment charge is recognized by the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the asset 
management assesses the recoverability of long lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstance indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
the following factors  if present  may trigger an impairment review significant underperformance relative to historical or projected future operating results  significant negative industry or economic trends  significant decline in stock price for a sustained period  and significant change in market capitalization relative to net book value 
if the recoverability of these assets is unlikely because of the existence of one or more of the above mentioned factors  an impairment analysis is performed using projected undiscounted cash flow at the lowest level at which cash flows is identifiable 
in the event impairment is indicated  fair value is determined using the discounted cash flow method  appraisal or other accepted techniques 
management must make assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors to determine the fair value of these assets 
other factors could include  among other things  quoted market prices  or other valuation techniques considered appropriate based on the circumstances 
if these estimates or related assumptions change in the future  an impairment charge may need to be recorded 
impairment charges would be included in our consolidated statements of operations  and would result in reduced carrying amounts of the related assets on our consolidated balance sheets 
at march   the company performed an impairment analysis for long lived assets  due to triggering events which included the decline in the company s stock price  change in market capitalization relative to net book value  and decrease in financial performance relative to historical operating results 
in evaluating long lived assets and amortizable intangible assets for impairment  there was no impairment identified by our analysis indicating the carrying amount of an asset was not be recoverable in there were no indicators of potential impairment in and foreign currency translation and transactions the functional currency of the company s foreign operating companies is the applicable local currency 
in consolidation  the foreign subsidiaries assets and liabilities are translated into united states dollars using exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date and their operations are translated using the average exchange rates prevailing during the year 
the resulting translation adjustments are recorded as a component of other comprehensive income loss 
accumulated comprehensive income loss consists of net income for the period and the cumulative impact of unrealized foreign currency translation adjustments 
the company is subject to foreign exchange risk for foreign currency denominated transactions  such as receivables and payables 
foreign currency transaction gains and losses are recorded in foreign currency exchange in the company s consolidated statements of operations 
however  foreign currency exchange gains and losses on intercompany notes of a long term investment nature which management does not intend to repay in the foreseeable future are recorded as a component of other comprehensive income loss 
income taxes income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss and tax credit carry forwards 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date 
realization of a deferred tax asset is dependent on generating future taxable income  which is reviewed annually 
the company evaluates all positive and negative evidence in evaluating whether a valuation allowance is required 
consideration of current and expected future taxable income of the company indicated that an overall valuation allowance is not needed 
the company annually evaluates positive and negative evidence in determining whether a valuation allowance on deferred tax assets is required 
as detailed in note to the consolidated financial statements of the company in this annual report on form k  the company recorded a valuation allowance of approximately  at march  for certain deferred tax assets associated with net operating loss carryforwards nols principally at our german subsidiary 
this non cash charge to income tax expense reduced our net income by  or approximately per diluted share 
accounting guidance for such valuation allowances is strictly based on the evaluation of positive and negative evidence which can be objectively verified as to whether it is more likely than not that the nols will be utilized 
if positive evidence does not outweigh negative evidence  the conclusion is that a valuation allowance is required 
at march   our german subsidiary had cumulative losses over the past three years  primarily due to the decrease in profitability during the second half of fiscal as a result of the global recession 
the negative evidence of three years of cumulative losses was considered to outweigh the positive evidence that the net operating losses were not subject to expiration  because the long term prospects of future profitability were not considered objectively verifiable 
we expect our german subsidiary to return to profitability in a future period and we will continue to assess positive and negative evidence to determine if a valuation allowance is required in future periods 
transfer pricing refers to the prices that one member of a group of related companies charges to another member of the group for goods  services  or the use of intellectual property 
the company prepares various transfer pricing studies and other such procedures to assist in determining and supporting transfer pricing 
if two or more affiliated companies are located in different countries  the laws or regulations of each country generally will require that transfer prices be the same as those charged by unrelated companies dealing with each other at arm s length 
if one or more of the countries in which our affiliated companies are located believes that transfer prices were manipulated by our affiliate companies in a way that distorts the true taxable income of the companies  the laws of countries where our affiliated companies are located could require us to re determine transfer prices and thereby reallocate the income of our affiliate companies in order to reflect these transfer prices 
any reallocation of income from one of our companies in a lower tax jurisdiction to an affiliated company in a higher tax jurisdiction would result in a higher overall tax liability to us 
moreover  if the country from which the income is being reallocated does not agree to the reallocation  the same income could be subject to taxation by both countries 
contingencies and litigation liabilities for loss contingencies arising from claims  assessments  litigation  fines  and penalties and other sources are recorded when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the assessment and or remediation can be reasonably estimated 
legal costs incurred in connection with loss contingencies are expensed as incurred 
such accruals are adjusted as further information develops or circumstances change 
we periodically assess the potential liabilities related to any lawsuits or claims brought against us 
while it is typically very difficult to determine the timing and ultimate outcome of these actions  we use our best judgment to determine if it is probable that we will incur an expense related to a settlement for such matters and whether a reasonable estimation of such probable loss  if any  can be made 
given the inherent uncertainty related to the eventual outcome of litigation  it is possible that all or some of these matters may be resolved for amounts materially different from any estimates that we may have made with respect to their resolution 
share based payment the company has four active share based compensation plans  which are more fully described in note to the consolidated financial statements of the company in this annual report on form k 
prior to fiscal  the company applied the intrinsic value method prescribed in accounting principles board apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and accordingly  recognized no compensation expense for stock option grants to employees 
there was no employee compensation expense recognized in the income from continuing operations in fiscal or as a result of options issued to employees 
effective april   the company adopted sfas no 
r  share based payment  sfas no 
r utilizing the modified prospective approach 
this statement replaces sfas  accounting for stock based compensation and supersedes apb under the modified prospective approach  sfas no 
r applies to new awards and to awards that were outstanding and not vested on april   as well as those that are subsequently modified  repurchased or cancelled 
under the modified prospective approach  compensation cost recognized in the year ended march  includes compensation cost for all share based payments granted prior to  but not yet vested as of april   based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the original provisions of sfas no 
 and compensation cost for all share based payments granted subsequent to april   based on the grant date fair value using the black scholes option pricing model in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
r 
prior periods were not restated to reflect the impact of adopting the new standard 
determining the appropriate fair value model and calculating the fair value of share based payment awards require the input of subjective assumptions  including the expected life of the share based payment awards and stock price volatility 
the assumptions used in calculating the fair value of share based payment awards represent management s best estimates  but these estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of management judgment 
as a result  if factors change and we use different assumptions  our equity based compensation expense could be materially different in the future 
in addition  we are required to estimate the expected forfeiture rate and recognize expense only for those shares expected to vest 
if our actual forfeiture rate is materially different from our estimate  the equity based compensation expense could be significantly different from what we have recorded in the current period 
in order to provide an appropriate expected volatility  one which marketplace participants would likely use in determining an exchange price for an option  the company revised  during the quarter ended september   the method of calculating expected volatility by disregarding a period of the company s historical volatility data not considered representative of expected future volatility and replacing the disregarded period of time with peer group data 
the company considers the period of time disregarded to be within the rare situations stated in securities and exchange commission staff accounting bulletin no 
sab 
the company experienced  during the period of time leading up to and after the restructuring in may  a rare series of events  including a going concern situation  financial statement restatement  a class action shareholder lawsuit  an sec investigation  a  asset write down  significant net losses  and a halt in the trading of the company s common stock  none of which are expected to recur in the future 
the company receives a tax deduction for certain stock options and stock option exercises during the period the options are exercised  generally for the excess of the fair value of the stock over the exercise price of the options at the exercise date 
in accordance with sfas no 
r  the company is required to report excess tax benefits from the award of equity instruments as financing cash flows 
since the company is currently in a net operating loss carry forward position  the company applies the tax law ordering approach  whereby the tax benefits are considered realized for current year exercises of share based compensation awards 
these amounts are considered realized because such deductions offset taxable income on the company s tax return  thereby reducing the amount of income subject to tax 
the current year stock compensation deduction is used to offset taxable income before the nol carry forwards because all current year deductions take priority over nol carry forwards 
when the tax deduction exceeds the compensation expense  the tax benefit associated with any excess deduction is considered an excess tax benefit  or windfall 
the windfall portion of the share based compensation deduction reduces income tax payable and is credited to additional paid in capital apic 
the windfall credited to apic increases the company s apic pool available to offset future tax deficiencies shortfalls 
shortfalls are the amount the compensation expense exceeds the tax deduction

the overall level of organic sales for fiscal was initially expected to be lower than the past few years  however  our expectation for lower organic sales was revised downward further during the year due primarily to the challenging global economic situation and uncertainty  as well as due to lower sales with the company s largest customer 
the current recession is one of the worst recessions in decades  and there is downward economic pressure in most areas of the economy 
as such  sales for the year were down significantly  led by sharp reductions in sales to passenger and non passenger vehicle customers in us  europe and asia 
the most notable decline was with the automotive market 
while we believe sales were unusually hard hit as a result of customers reducing inventory levels to match lower anticipated demand for their products  it is not yet clear how much improvement we will see in future quarters or whether sales will continue to decline 
accordingly  we have taken decisive action  including aligning our labor workforce with the latest projected sale volumes 
we have lowered costs through significant reductions in headcount  cut management salaries and eliminated the company s management bonus program and k match  and we have curtailed capital expenditures and implemented other cost control measures 
additionally  the company modified the three business group structure  in order to  among other things  better focus on cross selling of the differing sensor products and to address current business conditions and certain changes within the management group  which resulted in one operating segment 
gross margin gross margin gross profit as a percentage of net sales increased slightly to approximately from 
the improvement in gross margin is due to several factors  including product sales mix and various cost control measures  partially offset by the strengthening of the chinese rmb  as well as the adverse impact on gross margins as a result of decrease in volumes 
the more favorable product sales mix is largely associated with decreased proportion of sales of lower gross margin products 
this would include sales to the automotive sector  which carries a lower gross margin than our average 
additionally  our gross margins were adversely impacted by the lower levels of production and absorption of costs during the fourth quarter due to the consumption of inventory as part of the china facility move and to better align inventory levels with lower sales levels 
during the first half of fiscal  there had also been an adverse impact on margins due to increases in certain costs reflecting the pervasive impact on costs associated with higher prices for certain commodities 
the average chinese rmb exchange rate relative to the us dollar appreciated approximately as compared to last year 
this translates to approximately  in annualized margin erosion 
finally  as with all manufacturers  our gross margins are sensitive to the overall volume of business in that certain costs are fixed 
since our overall level of business declined in  our gross margins and overall level of profits decreased accordingly 
on a continuing basis  our gross margin may vary due to product mix  sales volume  availability of raw materials  foreign currency exchange rates  and other factors 
selling  general and administrative overall  total selling  general and administrative expenses total sg a increased  or to  due to costs associated with the and acquisitions 
as a percent of net sales  total sg a expenses increased to from 
the increase in total sg a expenses as a percent of net sales is due to the decrease in net sales  which is the resulting impact of the global economic situation 
approximately  of the increase in total sg a was directly associated with the acquisitions and the first nine months of fiscal for acquisitions  and include higher salaries  amortization  facility expenses  professional fees  and acquisition related integration costs 
there was also an increase of in bad debt expense  reflecting the impact of the global economic recession 
partially offsetting the increases in total sg a discussed above are the impact of the various cost control measures implemented during fiscal  including reductions in headcount and management salaries  as well as the suspension of bonuses and k match 
stock option expense stock option expense decreased to  from  the decrease in stock option expense is mainly due to the lower valuation of non cash equity based compensation under sfas no 
r  share based payments  resulting primarily from the decrease in the company s stock price  partially offset by higher volatility and quantity of options issued with the annual grant in fiscal relative to the annual grant in fiscal total compensation cost related to share based payments not yet recognized totaled  at march   which is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of approximately years 
amortization of acquired intangibles amortization of acquired intangible assets increased  to  which is mainly due to higher amortization expense associated with the acquisitions 
amortization expense for intangible assets is higher during the first year after an acquisition because  among other things  the order back log is fully amortized during the initial year 
the increase in amortization expense associated with the two acquisitions consummated during the quarter ended march  was not as significant due to the close proximity of the transactions to our fiscal year end  but the impact on amortization expense related to these acquisitions is expected to be more significant next year 
interest expense  net interest expense decreased  to  for the year ended march  from  for the year ended march  the decrease in interest expense is primarily attributable to the decrease in average interest rates from last year to approximately this year  partially offset by an increase in the average total outstanding debt from an average amount outstanding of  in to  in interest expense is expected to increase during next fiscal year due to higher interest rates 
as a result of the decline in our sales and profitability resulting from the impact of the global recession  the company proactively negotiated with our lenders for an amendment to provide for the future reduction of our debt covenants  which will result in a higher interest rate charged by our lenders to the company 
the amendment will provide the company with additional flexibility under its minimum ebitda covenant  total leverage ratio covenant  fixed charge ratio covenant and maximum capital expenditure covenant included in its senior credit facility 
under the terms of the amendment  the principal amount available under the company s revolver has been reduced from  to  the amendment increased the interest rate by between and basis points  with increases in the index margin and libor margin  which vary based on the company s debt to ebitda leverage ratio 
pursuant to the amendment  the company is prohibited from consummating any business acquisitions during the covenant relief period  which ends march  foreign currency exchange gain or loss the increase in foreign currency exchange loss mainly reflects the continued appreciation of the rmb relative to the us dollar  as well as the overall decrease in the us dollar relative to the euro as compared to last year 
the company continues to be impacted by volatility in foreign currency exchange rates  especially with the continued impact of the appreciation of the rmb relative to the us dollar  even though the appreciation of the rmb was less in as compared to  as well as the impact of the fluctuation of the us dollar relative to the euro and swiss franc 
based on the variability and volatility of foreign currency exchange rates  the company is not able to provide any reasonable expectation for foreign currency exchange gains or losses during the next fiscal year 
however  the company remains subject to foreign currency exchange exposures  and as such  the company will continue to have foreign currency exchange gains and or losses 
the company monitors such exposures and attempts to mitigate such exposures through various hedging strategies  but not all exposures are hedged 
other expense and income other expense and income consist of various non operating items  including sales of tooling and other miscellaneous income and expense items 
the increase from income of last year to income of mainly reflects approximately of chinese incentives for foreign investments provided to the company  partially offset by miscellaneous expense items 
income taxes total income tax expense during fiscal decreased  to  as compared to  for fiscal the decrease in income tax expense is principally due to lower taxable income in  lower proportion of taxable income in higher tax rate jurisdictions  and favorable r d tax credits in france  which were offset by a  income tax expense for the valuation allowances recorded at march  relating to deferred tax assets principally at our germany subsidiary 
the company s income tax rate income tax expense from continuing operations and after minority interest increased to approximately as compared to last year 
the increase in the income tax rate was mainly due to the valuation allowance recorded relating to the german subsidiary 
this was partly offset by a higher proportion of income being generated in those tax jurisdictions with lower tax rates and additional r d tax benefits in france 
the company recorded a valuation allowance of approximately  at march  principally for certain deferred tax assets associated with net operating loss carryforwards nols at our german subsidiary 
this non cash charge to income tax expense reduced our net income by  or approximately per diluted share 
accounting guidance for such valuation allowances is strictly based on the evaluation of positive and negative evidence which can be objectively verified as to whether or not the nols will be utilized  and if positive evidence does not outweigh negative evidence  a valuation allowance is required 
at march   our german subsidiary had cumulative losses over the past three years  primarily due to the decrease in profitability during the second half of fiscal as a result of the global recession 
in weighing the positive and negative evidence  the negative evidence of three years of cumulative losses was considered to outweigh the positive evidence that the net operating losses were not subject to expiration  because the long term prospects of future profitability in future periods was not considered objectively verifiable 
we will continue to assess positive and negative evidence to determine if a valuation allowance is required in future periods 
during the quarter ended september   the company recorded a discrete non cash tax adjustment of approximately for the revaluation of the net deferred tax assets in germany resulting from a decrease in tax rates enacted in the company s combined tax rate in germany decreased from to  as a result of the german business tax reform  which became effective on august  the china tax authorities announced an increase in the income tax rate to on december   effective on january  also effective january  is a withholding tax on the distribution of earnings 
the company submitted an application for high tech status last year  and it was not granted 
the company intends to continue to pursue qualification as a high technology enterprise with the chinese authority  and if the company is able to be awarded such qualification  the effective income tax rate will be reduced to plus the withholding tax 
the current guidance on the china tax law  without award of high tech status  is a graduated statutory rate from in calendar to in calendar year the applicable statutory rate effective january  is and is increased january  to 
during the quarter ended march   the company recorded the reversal of a foreign income tax payable  which resulted in a reduction of income tax expense of or almost per diluted share 
the income tax payable related to a foreign tax accrual from at least fiscal  which had been previously considered a liability  however  based on discovered documentation  it was determined that the company was not liable for the amounts previously accrued 
our overall effective tax rate will continue to fluctuate based on the allocation of earnings among various taxing jurisdictions with varying tax rates and with changes in tax rates 
we expect our overall effective tax rate to generally increase due to more of our total income being generated in europe and the us  which are subject to a higher effective tax rates than our average and the impact of the increase in the china income tax rate 
discontinued operations 
discontinued operations primarily consist of the remaining activity associated with the note receivable received by the company in connection with the sale of the consumer segment  which is included in the condensed consolidated balance sheets as current and non current portions of promissory note receivable 
for the year ended march  and  imputed interest income related to the promissory note receivable totaled and  respectively  which is included in interest expense  net from continuing operations 
cash flows from discontinued operations are reported separately in the statement of cash flows  and the absence of cash flows from discontinued operations is not expected to have a material adverse affect on the future liquidity and capital resources of the company

our consolidated net sales increased  or from  to  excluding net sales from the acquisitions of  net sales increased  or defined as organic growth 
all groups posted organic sales growth  with the strongest growth coming from pressure force group pfg and humidity chemical gas temperature optical htg 
pfg net sales increased approximately  or  mainly the result of strong growth in sales to our largest customer  which primarily services the automotive market  as well as growth with our sensors and transducers in hvac  high purity  industrial and medical applications 
htg net sales increased approximately  or due to continued success of our humidity products in fogging prevention and engine management applications  as well as sense elements used in the measurement of mass air flow 
net sales within position vibration piezo pvg grew 
net sales in position products were down slightly as compared to last year  in part as a result of the phase out of a large  off road customer  offset by sales growth in vibration and piezo products  fueled by continued success of our newly introduced line of accelerometers  as well as various piezo applications in traffic  patient monitoring and consumer applications 
gross margin 
overall  gross margin gross profit as a percent of net sales decreased to for the fiscal year ended march  from for the fiscal year ended march  the decline in margin was primarily due to several factors including product sales mix  a discrete quality event discussed below and the strengthening of the chinese rmb  as well as unfavorable absorption of manufacturing overhead 
the unfavorable product sales mix is largely associated with increased sales to our largest customer  which primarily serves the automotive market and carries a lower gross margin than our average 
during the second quarter ended september   the company recorded an accrual of approximately to cover costs associated with the expected scrap and rework resulting from an isolated large return of goods 
the issue that led to the return  which the company believes has been resolved  was largely attributable to a problem with raw material supplied by one of our vendors 
in addition to this accrual  we incurred approximately in unfavorable direct labor variance in the second quarter associated with this event 
during the twelve months ended march   the chinese rmb exchange rate relative to the us dollar appreciated approximately as compared to the same period last year 
this translates to net amount of approximately  in annualized margin erosion 
also negatively impacting margins was lower absorption of manufacturing overhead in the fourth quarter relative to sales mainly due of the reduction of finished goods inventory and production levels 
operating expense 
operating expenses in fiscal increased  from  to  as a percent of net sales  operating expense declined to from 
the decrease in operating expenses as a percent of net sales was the result of net sales increasing at a higher rate as compared to the increase in costs  due to  among other factors  the impact of cost control measures over such areas as professional fees and a decrease in litigation settlement and amortization expense 
approximately  of the overall increase in operating expenses is associated with operating expense from acquisitions completed in fiscal selling  general and administrative 
selling  general and administrative sg a expenses  which include application and development engineering expense  increased  to  in fiscal from  in fiscal as a percent of net sales  sg a decreased from to 
the increase in sg a was due to approximately  increase in salary and wages  and  increase in non salary research and development r d 
the increase in salaries reflects higher headcount to support the overall growth in sales  and the increase in r d reflects the company s efforts to continually develop new products 
approximately  of the increase in sg a was associated with recently acquired companies  intersema and visyx 
partially offsetting the aforementioned increases in sg a  the prior year operating expenses were higher by approximately due to the costs associated with the closure of the barbados facility  a former operating entity of betatherm 
stock option expense 
stock option expense increased to  stock option expense represents non cash equity based compensation under sfas no 
r  share based payment 
the increase in stock option expense as compared to the same period last year was primarily the result of the increased number of granted options under the long term employment agreement with our cfo  as well as the annual stock options grant in november 
total compensation cost related to share based payments not yet recognized totaled  at march   which is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of approximately years 
litigation settlement expenses 
at march   the company accrued  in litigation settlement expenses associated with the settlement of the dewelt and samuel litigation 
the litigation settlement expenses excluded legal fees  which are included in sg a 
amortization of acquired intangibles 
amortization of acquired intangibles decreased to  for the year ended march   mainly due to higher amortization expense during the initial year after the acquisitions of ysi temperature and betatherm  which were effective april  the amortization expense for intangible assets is higher during the first year mainly because the backlog is fully amortized during the initial year 
the increase in amortization expense associated with the two acquisitions consummated during the quarter ended december  was not as significant due to the close proximity of the transactions to our fiscal year end  but the impact on amortization expense related to these acquisitions is expected to be more significant next year 
interest expense  net 
the  decrease in interest expense to  for the year ended march  was primarily attributed to the decrease in average debt outstanding and lower average interest rates 
overall  average borrowings during fiscal decreased to  from  for fiscal average interest rates decreased to from 
the impact on debt outstanding and interest expense associated with the additional borrowings from the acquisitions consummated during the quarter ended december  was not significant due to the proximity of the transactions to our fiscal year end 
the company s interest rate at march  declined to approximately 
foreign currency exchange loss 
in addition to the margin exposure as a result of the depreciation of the us dollar due to higher level of costs than sales denominated in rmb  the company also has foreign currency exchange exposures with balance sheet accounts 
when foreign currency exchange rates fluctuate  there is a resulting revaluation of assets and liabilities denominated and accounted for in foreign currencies 
foreign currency exchange loss fx due to the revaluation of balance sheet accounts with realized fx transactions and unrealized fx translation adjustments has increased sharply this year due mainly to the changes of the value of the us dollar relative to the chinese rmb and swiss franc 
for example  our swiss company  intersema  which uses the swiss franc as their functional currency  holds cash denominated in foreign currencies us dollar and euro 
as the swiss franc appreciates against the us dollar and or euro  the cash balances held in those denominations are devalued when stated in terms of swiss franc 
aside from cash  our foreign entities generally hold receivables in foreign currency  as well as payables 
income taxes 
our overall effective tax rate from continuing operations income tax from continuing operations divided by income from continuing operations before income taxes was approximately during the year ended march   as compared to last year 
total income tax expense increased  to  as compared to  last year 
the overall increase in income tax expense was because of the overall increase in profits before taxes and the increase in the consolidated effective tax rate 
the company s overall effective tax rate has been impacted by a higher portion of taxable income earned in tax jurisdictions with higher tax rates as compared to fiscal  as well as the impact of tax law changes 
the shift of taxable earnings was mainly with the higher earnings in the united states and europe  as a result of continued cost controls  operating leverage  and lower interest expense  in addition to the recent increase in the tax rate in china 
our overall effective tax rate includes the net effect of the tax law changes of or approximately income tax expense tax law change divided by income from continuing operations before income taxes 
approximately of the increase in income tax expense was a result of the non cash income tax expense adjustment recorded for the revaluation of the net deferred tax assets in germany resulting from the recent decrease in tax rates 
partially offsetting the increase in income tax expense due to the tax law changes is the impact of tax law changes in china  consisting of the income tax credit associated with the revaluation of the company s china net deferred tax assets at the new higher tax rate and the income tax expense for the withholding tax on distributable earnings 
the company s combined tax rate in germany decreased from approximately to  as a result of the german business tax reform  which became effective on august  the lower german corporate tax rates were effective in fiscal although these lower german tax rates are expected to favorably impact net income because of the resulting decrease in income tax expense associated with profits earned in germany in fiscal and beyond  the company under the provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  revalued the german net deferred tax assets at the lower combined german tax rate 
the china tax authorities announced an increase in the income tax rate to on december   effective on january  also effective january  is a withholding tax on the distribution of earnings 
during the quarter ended march   the company recorded the reversal of a foreign income tax payable  which resulted in a reduction of income tax expense of or almost per diluted share 
the income tax payable related to a foreign tax accrual from at least seven years ago  which had been previously considered a liability  however  based on recently discovered documentation  it was determined that the company was not liable for the amounts previously accrued 
liquidity and capital resources cash balances totaled  at march   an increase of  as compared to march   reflecting  among other factors  the company s ability to generate positive operating cash flows  cash from borrowings to finance acquisitions and lower net repayments of debt  which were partially offset by cash used for acquisition of businesses and the purchases of property and equipment  as well as the effect of exchange rate changes on cash balances maintained by our foreign subsidiaries 
cash balances are expected to decline as the company funds capital additions and pays down debt  as well as the overall impact of the global recession on funding operations 
the following schedule compares the primary categories of the consolidated statement of cash flows for the current year to the prior year year ended march  change net cash provided by operating activities from continuing operations net cash used in investing activities from continuing operations net cash provided by financing activities from continuing operations net cash provided by discontinued operations effect of exchange rate changes on cash net change in cash and cash equivalents from continuing operations the underlying reason for the decrease in overall operating cash flows is the economic recession  which reduced profitability and cash flows from operating working capital trade accounts receivables  inventory  less accounts payable 
net income declined  and the fluctuation in cash flows provided by operating working capital went from a source of operating cash flows of  last year to a source of operating cash flow of during the current year 
in spite of implementing various strategies to improve our cash position and working capital management  the company was not able to offset the impact of the recession 
the company closely monitors trade receivables and collections 
inventory balances increased as compared to last year mainly because of the build up in inventory for the planned china facility move 
we expect to reduce inventory levels during the next quarters with the completion of the move to our new china facility and to better align inventory levels with current levels of sales 
other items impacting operating cash flows include the fluctuation of income tax payable from a  use of cash last year to a  source of cash this year  and the  increase in depreciation and amortization expense associated with the acquisitions and the acquisitions 
prior year deferred taxes mainly reflect the discrete adjustment recorded due to the change in german income tax rates  and current year deferred taxes mainly represent the valuation allowance recorded for the deferred tax assets of our subsidiary in germany  both of which are non cash transactions

borrowings under the credit facility are generally for acquisitions  and last year s acquisitions had a larger purchase price as compared to the current year acquisitions 
additionally  the offsetting payments for repayments of debt were lower this year as compared to last year because the company retained cash to fund operations in light of the economic downturn and since interest rates were relatively low 
proceeds from exercise of options were lower than the prior year because fewer options were exercised due to the decrease in the company s stock price

the company continues to generate cash from operating activities  and the company remains in a positive financial position with availability under existing credit facilities 
the company will continue to have cash requirements to support working capital needs  capital expenditures  earn outs related to acquisitions  and to pay interest and service debt 
we believe the company s financial position  generation of cash and the existing credit facility  in addition to the potential to refinance or obtain additional financing will be sufficient to meet funding of day to day and material short and long term commitments for the foreseeable future 
management continues to monitor the financial markets and general global economic conditions

this cash balance includes cash of  in china  which is subject to certain restrictions on the transfer to another country because of currency control regulations 
the company s cash balances are generated and held in numerous locations throughout the world  including substantial amounts held outside the united states 
the company utilizes a variety of tax planning and financing strategies in an effort to ensure that its worldwide cash is available in the locations in which it is needed 
wherever possible  cash management is centralized and intra company financing is used to provide working capital to the company s operations 
most of the cash balances held outside the united states could be repatriated to the united states  but  under current law  would potentially be subject to united states federal income taxes  less applicable foreign tax credits 
repatriation of some foreign balances is restricted or prohibited by local laws 
where local restrictions prevent an efficient intra company transfer of funds  the company s intent is that cash balances would remain in the foreign country and it would meet united states liquidity needs through ongoing cash flows  external borrowings  or both 
accumulated other comprehensive income accumulated other comprehensive income primarily consists of foreign currency translation adjustments  which relate to the company s european and asian operations and the effects of changes in the exchange rates of the us dollar relative to the euro  chinese rmb  hong kong dollar  japanese yen and swiss franc 
dividends we have not declared cash dividends on our common equity 
additionally  the payment of dividends is prohibited under our amended credit facility 
we intend to retain earnings to support our growth strategy and we do not anticipate paying cash dividends in the foreseeable future 
at present  there are no material restrictions on the ability of our hong kong and european subsidiaries to transfer funds to us in the form of cash dividends  loans  advances  or purchases of materials  products  or services 
chinese laws and regulations  including currency exchange controls  however  restrict distribution and repatriation of dividends by our china subsidiary 
seasonality as a whole  there is no material seasonality in our sales 
however  general economic conditions have an impact on our business and financial results  and certain end use markets experience certain seasonality 
for example  european sales are often lower in summer months and oem sales are often stronger immediately preceding and following the introduction of new products 
inflation we compete on the basis of product design  features  and value 
accordingly  our prices generally have kept pace with inflation  notwithstanding that inflation in the countries where our subsidiaries are located has been consistently higher than inflation in the united states 
increases in labor costs have not had a significant impact on our business because most of our employees are in china  where prevailing labor costs are low 
however  we have experienced increases in materials costs  especially during the end of fiscal and during the first part of fiscal  and as a result  we suffered a decline in margin during those periods 
off balance sheet arrangements we do not have any financial partnerships with unconsolidated entities  such as entities often referred to as structured finance  special purpose entities or variable interest entities which are often established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes 
accordingly  we are not exposed to any financing  liquidity  market or credit risk that could arise if we had such relationships 
the company has acquired and divested of certain assets  including the acquisition of businesses and the sale of the consumer business 
in connection with these acquisitions and divestitures  the company often provides representations  warranties and or indemnities to cover various risks and unknown liabilities  such as claims for damages arising out of the use of products or relating to intellectual property matters  commercial disputes  environmental matters or tax matters 
the company cannot estimate the potential liability from such representations  warranties and indemnities because they relate to unknown conditions 
however  the company does not believe that the liabilities relating to these representations  warranties and indemnities will have a material adverse effect on the company s financial position  results of operations or liquidity 
the company s second restated certificate of incorporation requires it to indemnify to the full extent authorized or permitted by law any person made  or threatened to be made a party to any action or proceeding by reason of his or her service as a director  officer or employee of the company  or by reason of serving at the request of the company as a director  officer or employee of any other entity  subject to limited exceptions 
the company s amended and restated by laws provide for similar indemnification rights 
in addition  the company intends to execute with each of its directors and executive officers an indemnification agreement with the company which will provide for substantially similar indemnification rights and under which the company will agree to pay expenses in advance of the final disposition of any such indemnifiable proceeding 
while the company maintains insurance for this type of liability  a significant deductible applies to this coverage and any such liability could exceed the amount of the insurance coverage 
aggregate contractual obligations as of march   the company s contractual obligations  including payments due by period  are as follows contractual obligations payment due by period total year years years years long term debt obligations interest obligation on long term debt capital lease obligations operating lease obligations other long term obligations total operating lease obligations are not reduced for annual sublease rentals of approximately other long term obligations on the company s balance sheet under gaap primarily consist of obligations under warranty polices and tax liabilities  but excludes earn out contingencies associated with acquisitions since the satisfaction of the contingencies is not determinable or achieved at march  the timing of cash flows associated with these obligations is based upon management s estimate over the terms of these arrangements and are largely based on historical experience 
the above contractual obligation table excludes certain contractual obligations  including earn outs related to acquisitions or possible severance payments to certain executives  since these contractual commitments are not accrued as liabilities at march  these contractual obligations are accrued as liabilities when the respective contingencies are determinable or achieved 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates  commodity and credit risk  which could impact its results of operations and financial condition 
the company attempts to address its exposure to these risks through its normal operating and financing activities 
in addition  the company s broad based business activities help to reduce the impact that volatility in any particular area or related areas may have on its operating earnings as a whole 
interest rate risk under our term and revolving credit facilities  we are exposed to a certain level of interest rate risk 
interest on the principal amount of our borrowings under our revolving credit facility and term loan accrue at a rate based on either a libor rate plus a libor margin or at an indexed prime based rate plus an index margin 
the libor or index rate is at our election 
our results will be adversely affected by any increase in interest rates 
for example  based on the  of total debt outstanding under these facilities at march   an annual interest rate increase of basis points would increase interest expense and decrease our pre tax profitability by we do not currently hedge this interest rate exposure 
commodity risk the company uses a wide range of commodities in our products  including steel  non ferrous metals and petroleum based products  as well as other commodities required for the manufacture of our sensor products 
changes in the pricing of commodities directly affect our results of operations and financial condition 
we attempt to pass increases in commodity costs to our customers  and we do not currently hedge such commodity price exposures 
credit risk financial instruments that potentially subject the company to significant concentrations of credit risk consist of cash and temporary investments  foreign currency forward contracts and trade accounts receivable 
the company is exposed to credit losses in the event of nonperformance by counter parties to its financial instruments 
the company places cash and temporary investments with various high quality financial institutions throughout the world  and exposure is limited at any one institution 
although the company does not obtain collateral or other security to secure these obligations  it does periodically monitor the third party depository institutions that hold our cash and cash equivalents 
our emphasis is primarily on safety and liquidity of principal and secondarily on maximizing yield on those funds 
in addition  concentrations of credit risk arising from trade accounts receivable are limited due to the diversity of the company s customers 
the company performs ongoing credit evaluations of its customers financial conditions and the company does not obtain collateral  insurance or other security 
notwithstanding these efforts  the current distress in the global economy may increase the difficulty in collecting accounts receivable 
foreign currency exchange rate risk foreign currency exchange rate risk arises from the company s investments in subsidiaries owned and operated in foreign countries  as well as from transactions with customers in countries outside the united states 
the effect of a change in currency exchange rates on the company s net investment in international subsidiaries is reflected in the accumulated other comprehensive income component of stockholders equity 
a appreciation in major currencies relative to the us dollar at march  would result in a reduction of stockholders equity of approximately  
although the company has a us dollar functional currency for reporting purposes  it has manufacturing sites throughout the world and a large portion of its sales are generated in foreign currencies 
a substantial portion of our revenues are priced in us dollars  and most of our costs and expenses are priced in us dollars  with the remaining priced in chinese renminbi  euros  swiss francs and japanese yen 
sales by subsidiaries operating outside of the united states are translated into us dollars using exchange rates effective during the respective period 
as a result  the company is exposed to movements in the exchange rates of various currencies against the united states dollar 
accordingly  the competitiveness of our products relative to products produced locally in foreign markets may be affected by the performance of the us dollar compared with that of our foreign customers currencies 
refer to item  business  foreign operations for details concerning annual net sales invoiced from our facilities within the us and outside of the us and as a percentage of total net sales for the last three years  as well as net assets and the related functional currencies 
therefore  both positive and negative movements in currency exchange rates against the us dollar will continue to affect the reported amount of sales  profit  and assets and liabilities in the company s consolidated financial statements 
the renminbi has appreciated by  and during  and  respectively 
the chinese government no longer pegs the renminbi to the us dollar  but established a currency policy letting the renminbi trade in a narrow band against a basket of currencies 
the company has more expenses in renminbi than sales ie  short renminbi position  and as such  when the us dollar weakens relative to the renminbi  our operating profits decrease 
based on our net exposure of renminbi to us dollars for the fiscal year ended march  and forecast information for fiscal  we estimate a negative operating income impact of approximately for every appreciation in renminbi against the us dollar assuming no price increases passed to customers  and no associated cost increases or currency hedging 
we continue to consider various alternatives to hedge this exposure  and we are attempting to manage this exposure through  among other things  forward purchase contracts  pricing and monitoring balance sheet exposures for payables and receivables 
fluctuations in the value of the hong kong dollar have not been significant since october   when the hong kong government tied the value of the hong kong dollar to that of the us dollar 
however  there can be no assurance that the value of the hong kong dollar will continue to be tied to that of the us dollar 
the company s french and germany subsidiaries have more sales in euro than expenses in euro and the company s swiss subsidiary has more expenses in swiss franc than sales  and as such  if the us dollar weakens relative to the euro and swiss franc  our operating profits increase in france and germany but decline in switzerland 
based on the net exposures of euros and swiss francs to the us dollars for the fiscal year ended march   we estimate a negative operating income impact of in euros and a positive income impact of less than for every appreciation in the euro and swiss franc  respectively  relative to the us dollar assuming no price increases passed to customers  and associated cost increases or currency hedging 
the company has a number of foreign currency exchange contracts in europe and asia in an attempt to hedge the company s exposure to the euro and rmb 
the euro us dollar  euro us dollar and japanese yen euro currency contracts have gross notional amounts totaling   and  respectively  with exercise dates through august  at an average exchange rate of euro to us dollar conversion rate  rmb to us dollar conversion rate and yen euro to japanese yen 
since these derivatives are not designated as hedges under sfas no 
 changes in their fair value are recorded in earnings  not in other comprehensive income 
the fair value of our rmb currency contracts and our results of operations will be adversely affected by a decrease in value of the rmb relative to the us dollar 
for example  based on the  notional amount of these contracts outstanding at march  and current pricing of forward exchange rates of the rmb relative to the us dollar  a depreciation of the rmb would increase foreign currency expense and decrease our pre tax profitability by to manage our exposure to potential foreign currency transaction and translation risks  we may purchase additional foreign currency exchange forward contracts  currency options  or other derivative instruments  provided such instruments may be obtained at suitable prices
