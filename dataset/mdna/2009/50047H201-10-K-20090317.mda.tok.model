table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes contained elsewhere in this report 
this discussion contains forward looking statements that involve risks  uncertainties  and assumptions 
our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of a variety of factors  including those set forth under item a  risk factors and elsewhere in this report 
overview we currently own and operate restaurants located in states 
we offer freshly prepared food  personalized service  and a contemporary ambiance that create a satisfying yet affordable dining experience that we believe exceeds many traditional casual dining restaurants with whom we compete 
our high volume upscale casual restaurants feature a diverse selection of mainstream american dishes as well as a variety of appetizers and entrees with an international influence  including an extensive selection of sushi items 
our menu items are freshly prepared and incorporate over signature sauces and dressings that we make from scratch  creating broad based appeal for the lifestyle and taste trends of a diverse group of guests 
our menu is mostly standardized for all of our restaurants allowing us to deliver consistent quality meals 
we believe that our vast menu and generous portions  combined with an average check during of approximately per guest  offers our guests an attractive price value proposition 
we continue to follow a disciplined growth plan focused largely on expanding our presence in new markets 
over the last three years  we have funded our development of new restaurants primarily from the proceeds of our initial public offering  our private offering of common stock completed during november  and cash flows from operations 
we opened three restaurants during and plan to open an additional four restaurants during which will expand our presence in new markets 
we target our restaurants to achieve an average annual unit volume of million following months of operations 
we believe our typical new restaurants experience gradually increasing unit volumes as guests begin to discover our concept and we begin to generate market awareness 
our restaurants are also subject to seasonal fluctuations 
sales in most of our restaurants typically are higher during the spring and summer months and winter holiday season 
as of september   we closed our restaurant in naples  florida to focus more on our profitable locations 
as a result  we classified the naples restaurant operations and related closure costs as discontinued operations in our consolidated financial statements 
we experience various trends in our operating cost structure 
cost of sales  labor  occupancy  and other operating expenses for our restaurants open at least months generally trend consistent with restaurant sales  and we analyze those costs as a percentage of restaurant sales 
we anticipate that our new restaurants will take approximately six months to achieve operating efficiencies as a result of challenges typically associated with new restaurants  including lack of market recognition and the need to hire and sufficiently train employees  as well as other factors 
we expect cost of sales and labor expenses as a percentage of restaurant sales to be higher when we open a new restaurant  but decrease as a percentage of restaurant sales as the restaurant matures and as the restaurant management and employees become more efficient operating that unit 
as a result  the volume and timing of newly opened restaurants has had  and is expected to continue to have  an impact on costs of sales  labor  occupancy  restaurant operating expenses  and preopening expenses 
the majority of our general and administrative costs are fixed costs 
we expect our general and administrative spending to decrease as a percentage of restaurant sales as we leverage these investments and realize the benefits of higher sales volumes 

table of contents key measures we use to evaluate our company key measures we use to evaluate and assess our business include the following number of restaurant openings 
number of restaurant openings reflects the number of restaurants opened during a particular reporting period 
same store sales percentage change 
same store sales percentage change reflects the periodic change in restaurant sales for the comparable restaurant base 
in calculating the percentage change in same store sales  we include a restaurant in the comparable restaurant base after it has been in operation for more than months 
same store sales growth can be generated by an increase in guest traffic counts or by increases in the per person average check amount 
menu price changes and the mix of menu items sold can affect the per person average check amount 
average weekly sales 
average weekly sales represents the average of restaurant sales measured over consecutive monday through sunday time periods 
average unit volume 
average unit volume represents the average restaurant sales for all of our restaurants open for at least months before the beginning of the period measured 
sales per square foot 
sales per square foot represents the restaurant sales for our restaurants open for at least months  divided by the total leasable square feet for such restaurants 
restaurant operating profit 
restaurant operating profit is defined as restaurant sales minus cost of sales  labor  occupancy  and restaurant operating expenses 
restaurant operating profit does not include general and administrative expenses  depreciation and amortization  preopening expenses  or asset impairment charges 
we believe restaurant operating profit is an important component of financial results because it is a widely used metric within the restaurant industry to evaluate restaurant level productivity  efficiency  and performance 
we use restaurant operating profit as a percentage of restaurant sales as a key metric to evaluate our restaurants financial performance compared with our competitors

interest income and other  net 
interest income and other  net consists of interest earned on our cash and investments and any gains or losses on our investments

year ended december  compared with year ended december  restaurant sales 
restaurant sales increased by million  or  to million during from million during the prior year primarily attributed to restaurant sales generated from the opening of five new restaurants since november  partially offset by overall traffic declines at our existing restaurants resulting from the slowing us economy which has negatively impacted overall consumer traffic in the restaurant industry 
higher menu pricing of approximately was more than offset by reduced guest traffic as comparable restaurant sales declined during cost of sales 
cost of sales increased by million  or  to million during from million during cost of sales as a percentage of restaurant sales decreased to during from during the prior year 
cost of sales during was positively affected by increased purchasing efficiency and reduced waste attributed to the rollout of an automated food cost and inventory management system that was completed during july labor 
labor costs for our restaurants increased million  or  to million during from million during the increase was primarily due to the opening of five new restaurants since november as a percentage of restaurant sales  labor costs increased to during from during the increase in labor costs as a percentage of restaurant sales was primarily due to reduced leverage of fixed labor costs resulting from lower average weekly sales during in addition  higher average salaries to attract and retain qualified restaurant managers and federal and state minimum wage increases implemented during contributed to increased labor costs as a percentage of sales 

table of contents occupancy 
occupancy expense increased by million  or  to million during from million during occupancy expenses as a percentage of restaurant sales increased to during from during the increase reflects decreased leverage of the fixed portion of these costs from lower average weekly sales  partially offset by reduced percentage rent 
restaurant operating expenses 
restaurant operating expenses increased by million  or  to million during from million during restaurant operating expenses as a percentage of restaurant sales increased to during from during the prior year period 
during  we incurred higher repair and maintenance costs to refurbish our mature units in addition to higher utilities and increased training costs 
furthermore  reduced leverage of fixed operating costs resulting from lower average weekly sales contributed to the increase in restaurant operating expenses as a percentage of sales 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses increased by million  or  to million during from million during the increase is primarily attributable to planned investments in corporate personnel to support our growth  costs associated with our stockholder rights plan adopted in may  separation costs related to the resignation of our chief operating officer  and higher professional fees 
general and administrative expenses as a percentage of restaurant sales increased to of restaurant sales during compared to of restaurant sales during during january  we downsized and realigned certain staff at the corporate office which we estimate will result in approximately million of savings during preopening expense 
preopening expense increased by million  or  to million during compared to million during preopening expense for primarily relates to expenses associated with three restaurants opened during  one restaurant opened during january  and other restaurants scheduled to open during during  preopening expense reflected costs associated with opening four restaurants during our preopening costs will fluctuate from period to period depending upon the number of restaurants opened  the timing of new restaurant openings  the location of the restaurants  and the complexity of the staff hiring and training process 
depreciation and amortization 
depreciation and amortization expense increased million  or  to million during from million during the increase was primarily the result of additional depreciation and amortization from five restaurants opened since november depreciation and amortization expense as a percentage of restaurant sales increased to during from during reflecting decreased leverage from lower average weekly sales 
asset impairment charge 
asset impairment charge of million during  or of restaurant sales resulted from the evaluation of the long term prospects of restaurants that have not been meeting sales  profitability  and cash flow targets in accordance with statement of financial accounting standard no 
 accounting for the impairment and disposal of long lived assets 
this evaluation resulted in long lived asset impairment charges of million for our lincolnshire  illinois restaurant 
we intend to continue operating this restaurant and believe that the operating performance of this restaurant can be improved 
interest income and other  net 
interest income and other  net decreased million or  to million during from million during this decrease is primarily due to lower average investment balances  coupled with lower average interest rates  as compared to the same period last year 
in addition  we recognized a loss of approximately million on our investments as the fair value of the put option on our auction rate securities was determined to be less than the impairment recorded on our auction rate securities 
please refer to note to the consolidated financial statements for discussion of our investment in auction rate securities 
interest expense 
interest expense decreased slightly due to lower average debt balances during as compared to provision for income taxes 
during  we recorded income taxes of million primarily for states in which income taxes are not calculated based upon net income 
during  we incurred million of federal and state tax expense  including a non cash charge of million related to stock options exercised during which required the recording of additional tax expense under statement of financial accounting standard no 
r  share based payment 

table of contents loss from discontinued operations  net of tax 
during september  we closed our naples  florida restaurant to focus our attention on our profitable restaurants 
as a result of the closure  we determined that the closure met the criteria for classification as a discontinued operation during accordingly  all impairment charges and exit costs  along with the sales  costs and expenses and income taxes attributable to this restaurant are included in discontinued operations for all periods presented 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for additional discussion 
year ended december  compared with year ended december  restaurant sales 
restaurant sales increased by million  or  to million during from million during primarily as a result of million in additional revenue associated with the opening of eight restaurants since april  and a million or increase in same store sales 
the increase in comparable restaurant sales benefited from an effective menu price increase of approximately 
cost of sales 
cost of sales increased by million or  to million during from million during cost of sales as a percentage of restaurant sales decreased to in from during cost of sales in was positively affected by lower seafood costs and a reduction in the number of operating weeks contributed by restaurants open less than six months resulting from the timing of new restaurant openings 
cost of sales are typically higher during the first six months of operations for our new restaurants versus our mature restaurants as management teams become accustomed to predicting  managing  and servicing the sales volumes we expect at our restaurants 
additionally  beginning in the second half of  we started the implementation of a new automated food cost and inventory management system in our restaurants 
the initiative was completed in july of and has resulted in more efficient management of our food costs 
labor 
labor costs for our restaurants increased by million  or to million during from million during labor expenses as a percentage of restaurant sales increased to during from during this increase was primarily due to higher average wages to attract and retain qualified restaurant managers and the impact of federal and state minimum wage increases that were implemented during occupancy 
occupancy expense increased by million  or to million during from million during occupancy expenses as a percentage of restaurant sales decreased to in from in the decrease reflects increased leverage of these costs from higher sales volume 
restaurant operating expenses 
restaurant operating expenses increased by million  or to million during from million during restaurant operating expenses as a percentage of restaurant sales decreased to during from during general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses increased by million  or to million during from million during the million increase was primarily attributable to planned investments in corporate personnel to support our growth  in addition to the write off of costs for architectural drawings and certain contractor costs 
these costs were partially offset by a decrease of million in stock based compensation expense and million of separation costs incurred in related to the retirement of our former president and chief executive officer 
general and administrative expenses as a percentage of restaurant sales were during compared to during preopening expense 
preopening expense was essentially flat at million during both and our preopening costs will fluctuate from period to period depending upon the number of restaurants opened  the timing of new restaurant openings  the location of the restaurants  and the complexity of the staff hiring and training process 

table of contents depreciation and amortization 
depreciation and amortization expense increased by million  or to million during from million during the increase was primarily the result of additional depreciation and amortization on four restaurants opened during and a full year of depreciation and amortization on four restaurants that opened during depreciation and amortization expense as a percentage of restaurant sales was flat at during both and interest income and other  net 
interest income and other  net decreased by million to million during from million during primarily due to lower average investment balances as a result of the sale of investments to fund new restaurant development 
interest expense 
interest expense decreased by million to million in compared to million during the prior year 
the decrease is primarily due to higher capitalized interest incurred in the construction of our new restaurants and lower average debt balances 
provision for income taxes 
our provision for income taxes increased by million to million during compared to million during during  we incurred million of federal and state tax expense  including a non cash charge of million related to stock options exercised during which required the recording of additional tax expense under statement of financial accounting standard no 
r  share based payment 
during  we did not incur a federal income tax liability and recorded state income taxes of million for states in which no state net operating loss carryforwards exist 
potential fluctuations in quarterly results and seasonality our quarterly operating results may fluctuate significantly as a result of a variety of factors  including the following timing of new restaurant openings and related expenses  restaurant operating costs and preopening costs for our newly opened restaurants  which are often materially greater during the first several months of operation than thereafter  labor availability and costs for hourly and management personnel  profitability of our restaurants  especially in new markets  increases and decreases in comparable restaurant sales  impairment of long lived assets and any loss on restaurant closures  changes in borrowings and interest rates  general economic conditions  weather conditions or natural disasters  timing of certain holidays  new or revised regulatory requirements and accounting pronouncements  changes in consumer preferences and competitive conditions  and fluctuations in commodity prices 

table of contents our business is also subject to seasonal fluctuations 
historically  sales in most of our restaurants have been higher during the spring and summer months and winter holiday season 
consequently  our quarterly and annual operating results and comparable restaurant sales may fluctuate significantly as a result of seasonality and the factors discussed above 
accordingly  results for any one quarter are not necessarily indicative of results to be expected for any other quarter or for any year and comparable restaurant sales for any particular future period may decrease 
in the future  operating results may fall below the expectations of our investors 
in that event  the price of our common stock would likely decrease 
quarterly results of operations the following table presents unaudited consolidated statement of operations data for each of the eight quarters in the period ended december  we believe that all necessary adjustments have been included to present fairly the quarterly information when read in conjunction with our annual financial statements and related notes

table of contents liquidity and capital resources our primary capital requirements are for new restaurant development 
during the last three years  we have funded our development of new restaurants primarily from the proceeds of our initial public offering  cash flows from operations  and the sale of equity securities in a private placement transaction 
we intend to continue developing new restaurants in markets where we believe our concept will have broad appeal and attractive restaurant level economics 
similar to many restaurant chains  we utilize operating lease arrangements for all of our restaurant locations 
we believe that our operating lease arrangements provide appropriate leverage for our capital structure in a financially efficient manner 
we are typically required to expend cash to perform site related work and to construct and equip our restaurants 
the average investment cost for our restaurants depends upon the type of lease entered into  the amount of tenant improvement allowance we receive from landlords  and whether we assume responsibility for the construction of the building 
we expect the cash investment cost of our prototype restaurant to be approximately million  net of landlord tenant improvement allowances between million and million  and excluding cash preopening expenses of approximately million 
we expect these costs will vary from one market to another based on real estate values  zoning regulations  labor markets and other variables 
we also require capital resources to maintain our existing base of restaurants and to further expand and strengthen the capabilities of our corporate and information technology infrastructures 
future capital requirements our capital requirements  including development costs related to the opening of new restaurants  have historically been significant 
our future cash requirements and the adequacy of available funds will depend on many factors  including the operating performance of our restaurants  the pace of expansion  real estate markets  site locations  the nature of the arrangements negotiated with landlords and the credit market environment 
based upon our current growth plan  our current cash and investment balances coupled with anticipated cash flow generated from operations and availability under our line of credit will not be sufficient to fund planned restaurant openings during our board of directors has formed a special committee to work closely with management and the company s outside professional advisors to identify  review and oversee the structuring  negotiation and execution of reasonable financing alternatives in the best interests of the company and its stockholders 
we believe that we have many alternatives available to continue operations  including temporarily suspending new restaurant construction  to enable us to generate sufficient funds to satisfy working capital requirements until financing becomes available 
we may seek to raise such capital through public or private equity or debt financing 
financing may not be available on acceptable terms  or at all  and our failure to raise capital when needed could impact our growth plans  financial condition  and results of operations 
additional equity financing may result in dilution to current shareholders and debt financing  if available  may involve significant cash payment obligations or financial covenants and ratios that may restrict our ability to operate our business 
bridge loan on march   we entered into a note and warrant purchase agreement the agreement with certain accredited investors whereby we sold million aggregate principal amount of unsecured subordinated notes notes and warrants warrants to purchase shares of our common stock 
the principal and accrued interest outstanding under the notes are due and payable upon the earlier of i september  or ii the closing of any offering of equity securities by the company generating gross proceeds to the company of at least million 
interest on the notes is payable on the last day of each month  commencing on april  we may prepay the principal and accrued interest outstanding under the notes at anytime without penalty 
the interest rate on the notes will increase to if the notes are outstanding after maturity or upon any other event of default as specified in the agreement 
for each  issued in notes  we issued to the noteholder three year warrants to purchase  shares of our common stock at an aggregate exercise price per share of  which was equal to of the five day average of the closing price of the company s common stock during the five trading days prior to the date of issuance 
we intend to use the net proceeds from the offering to supplement our operating cash flows and fund capital expenditure requirements 

table of contents as part of the agreement  as soon as reasonably practicable after filing with the sec our annual report on form k for the year ended december   we will file with the sec a registration statement to reflect a rights offering with targeted gross proceeds to the company of at least million the rights offering pursuant to which each stockholder of the company will have the right to purchase  at a per share subscription price to be determined by the company s board of directors or a committee thereof which subscription price shall reflect a discount to the market price of our common stock on the date of determination of such price by our board of directors or a committee thereof  a number of shares of common stock for each share of common stock held as of the record date for the rights offering 
the terms of the rights offering shall provide that any shares of our common stock that are not subscribed for in the rights offering shall be offered to the investors of the notes on a pro rata basis based on the aggregate principal amount of notes outstanding and at the same subscription price as offered to the existing stockholders in the rights offering 
equipment loans as of december   we had five equipment term loans with lenders  each collateralized by restaurant equipment 
the outstanding principal balance under these loans aggregated million 
the loans bear interest at rates ranging from to and require monthly principal and interest payments aggregating approximately  the loans mature between june and june the loans also require us to maintain certain financial covenants calculated at the end of each calendar year  and we were in compliance with all such financial covenants as of december  credit facility during october  as part of the settlement agreement with ubs  our broker in which we have invested in auction rate security instruments  we entered into a line of credit that is secured by the auction rate security instruments held with the broker 
available borrowings under the line of credit are based upon terms specified in the agreement and subject to adjustment by ubs after consideration of various factors 
at december    was outstanding under the line of credit 
borrowings under the line of credit are callable by the broker at any time 
the line of credit is structured at a cost that effectively offsets the interest earned on the auction rate securities 
as a result of this callable feature  the line of credit is classified as short term in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets  even though the loan does not expire until june  see note to the consolidated financial statements for further information on the auction rate securities and the settlement agreement 
stock repurchase program during april  our board of directors approved a stock repurchase program under which we are authorized to repurchase up to  shares of our common stock 
we repurchased  shares at a total cost of  during under a section b purchase program 
the authorization does not have an expiration date and it does not require us to purchase a specific number of shares 
this authorization may be modified  suspended or terminated at any time 
the timing and number of shares repurchased pursuant to the stock repurchase authorization are subject to a number of factors  including current market conditions  legal constraints and available cash or other sources of funding 
cash flows the following table summarizes our primary sources and uses of cash during the periods presented 
year ended december  in thousands net cash provided by used in operating activities investing activities financing activities net decrease increase in cash and cash equivalents 
table of contents operating activities 
during  net cash provided by operating activities was million and exceeded our net loss by million primarily due to depreciation and amortization  non cash asset impairment charges  and an increase in the deferred rent liability  partially offset by our net loss of million 
during  net cash provided by operating activities was million and exceeded our net loss by million due principally to the effect of depreciation and amortization  an increase in the deferred rent liability and the effect of non cash stock based compensation 
net cash provided by operating activities decreased million from million during to million during principally due to a million change resulting from the timing of vendor payments and a million difference in deferred rent partially offset by a reduction in our net loss by million 
during  net cash provided by operating activities was million principally due to an increase in the deferred rent liability  depreciation and amortization  an increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses  and non cash stock based compensation  partially offset by our net loss of million  an increase in receivables primarily relating to tenant improvement allowances and an increase in other current assets 
investing activities 
we fund the development and construction of our new restaurants primarily with cash and investments 
net cash used in investing activities was million during reflecting million to fund construction at three restaurants opened during and one restaurant opened during january  as well as capital expenditures for existing restaurants and other restaurants scheduled to open during this increase was partially offset by million in proceeds from the sale of investments to fund this construction 
net cash used in investing activities was million during which consisted primarily of million in expenditures for leasehold improvements and restaurant equipment principally to construct new restaurants 
net cash used in investing activities was million during  reflecting million for the funding of construction in progress and the purchase of property and equipment  the majority of which related to our five restaurant openings in and planned restaurant openings in investing activities during also include net proceeds of million from the sale of investments to fund this construction 
financing activities 
net cash provided by financing activities was million during principally consisting of million in net borrowings under our line of credit offset by the purchase of  shares of common stock under our stock repurchase program at a total cost of million  and million in principal payments on equipment notes 
net cash provided by financing activities was approximately million during consisting primarily of million in net proceeds from the sale of common stock in a private placement transaction  million in proceeds primarily from the issuance of common stock as a result of the exercise of stock options and warrants  partially offset by million of principal payments on equipment loans 
net cash used in financing activities was million during principally consisting of million of principal payments on our equipments loans  partially offset by million in proceeds from the issuance of common stock from the exercise of stock options and stock issued under our employee stock purchase plan

payments due by period less than more than contractual obligations total year years years years long term notes payable  including current portion line of credit operating leases total the line of credit does not expire until june   but is callable upon demand and is classified as a short term obligation in the consolidated balance sheets 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for further information 

table of contents the table above does not include obligations related to lease renewal option periods even if it is reasonably assured that we will exercise the related option 
in addition  the table above does not reflect unrecognized tax benefits of  the timing of which is uncertain 
refer to note of the consolidated financial statements for additional discussion on unrecognized tax benefits 
we have evaluated and determined that we do not have any purchase obligations as defined in the sec final rule no 
 disclosure in management s discussion and analysis about off balance sheet arrangements and aggregate contractual obligations 
off balance sheet arrangements we had no off balance sheet guarantees or off balance sheet arrangements as of december  critical accounting policies critical accounting policies are those that we believe are most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and also require our most difficult  subjective  or complex judgments 
judgments or uncertainties regarding the application of these policies may result in materially different amounts being reported under various conditions or using different assumptions 
we consider the following policies to be the most critical in understanding the judgment that is involved in preparing our consolidated financial statements 
fair value measurements we adopted the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 fair value measurements sfas effective january  we rely on unobservable level inputs  which are highly subjective  in determining the fair value of our auction rate security instruments and related put option 
our investment portfolio includes auction rate securities that are reflected at estimated fair value in the consolidated balance sheets 
we held auction rate securities with a par value of million which are classified as trading securities at december  historically  due to the auction process that reset interest rates at pre determined calendar intervals  generally every days  quoted market prices were readily available  which would have qualified as level under sfas since february  events in the credit markets have adversely affected the auction market and auctions for these securities have failed  and  therefore  we estimated the fair value of our auction rate securities using valuation models obtained from third parties 
the valuation models require numerous assumptions and assessments  including the following i collateralization underlying each security  ii the present value of future principal and interest payments discounted at rates considered to reflect current market conditions  iii the creditworthiness of the counterparty  and iv the current illiquidity of the investments 
these assumptions  assessments and the interpretations of relevant market data are subject to uncertainties  are difficult to predict and require significant judgment 
the use of different assumptions  applying different judgment to inherently subjective matters and changes in future market conditions could result in significantly different estimates of fair value 
the fair value of our auction rate securities could change significantly based on market conditions and continued uncertainties in the credit markets 
due to these events  we classified our auction rate securities as level during the first quarter all of our auction rate securities are collateralized by student loan portfolios of which approximately of the par value is guaranteed by the federal government under the federal family education loan program  million of which had a aaa rating and the remainder had a aa rating  but has an insurance policy guaranteeing both the principal and accrued interest 
despite the quality of the underlying collateral  the market for auction rate securities and other securities has been diminished due to the lack of liquidity experienced in the market throughout and expected to be experienced into the future 
through september   we had experienced a million decline in fair value  which we had classified as temporary and reflected as an unrealized loss in accumulated other comprehensive loss 
as a result of the settlement agreement we entered into with ubs during october  pursuant to which ubs issued the company a right to put the securities back to ubs at full par value beginning june   we elected to transfer the securities from available for sale to trading  and as a result  recorded a million impairment as other than temporary due to the continued auction failures and expected lack of liquidity in the capital markets into the foreseeable future 

table of contents we have elected to apply the fair value option under statement of financial accounting standards no 
 the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities  to the settlement agreement with ubs in which we have the right to sell the auction rate securities at par to ubs beginning on june  we recorded a million gain associated with the fair value of this put option  which partially offsets the million of related auction rate securities impairment discussed above 
the fair value of the put option is determined by comparing the fair value of the related auction rate securities to their par values and also considers the credit risk associated with the broker 
this put option will be adjusted on each balance sheet date based on its then fair value 
the fair value of the put option is based on unobservable inputs and is therefore classified as level in the hierarchy 
property and equipment we record all property and equipment at cost less accumulated depreciation and we select useful lives that reflect the actual economic lives of the underlying assets 
we amortize leasehold improvements over the shorter of the useful life of the asset or the related lease term 
we calculate depreciation using the straight line method for financial statement purposes 
we capitalize improvements and expense repairs and maintenance costs as incurred 
we are often required to exercise judgment in our decision whether to capitalize an asset or expense an expenditure that is for maintenance and repairs 
our judgments may produce materially different amounts of repair and maintenance or depreciation expense if different assumptions were used 
we periodically perform asset impairment analysis of property and equipment related to our restaurant locations 
we perform these tests when we experience a triggering event such as a major change in a location s operating environment  or other event that might impact our ability to recover our asset investment 
this process requires the use of estimates and assumptions which are subject to a high degree of judgment 
if these assumptions change in the future  we may be required to record impairment charges for these assets 
also  we have a policy of reviewing the financial operations of our restaurant locations on at least a quarterly basis 
locations that do not meet expectations are identified and monitored closely throughout the year  including the review of actual results and analyzing of budgets for the ensuing year 
if we deem that a location s results will continue to be below expectations  we will analyze alternatives for its continued operation 
at that time  we will perform an asset impairment test 
if we determine that the asset s carrying value exceeds the future undiscounted cash flows  we will determine the fair value of the asset and record an impairment charge to reduce the asset to its fair value 
calculation of fair value requires significant estimates and judgments which could vary significantly based on our assumptions 
upon an event such as a formal decision for abandonment restaurant closure  we may record additional impairment charges 
any carryover basis of assets will be depreciated over the respective remaining useful lives 
leasing activities we lease all of our restaurant properties 
at the inception of the lease  we evaluate each property and classify the lease as an operating or capital lease in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for leases 
we exercise significant judgment in determining the estimated fair value of the restaurant as well as the discount rate used to discount the future minimum lease payments 
the term used for this evaluation includes renewal option periods only in instances in which the exercise of the renewal option can reasonably be assured and failure to exercise such option would result in an economic penalty 
all of our restaurant leases are classified as operating leases 
our lease term used for straight line rent expense is calculated from the date we take possession of the leased premises through the lease termination date 
there is potential for variability in our rent holiday period which typically begins on the possession date and ends on the store open date 
factors that may affect the length of the rent holiday period generally include construction related delays 
extension of the rent holiday period due to delays in restaurant opening will result in greater rent expensed during the rent holiday period 
we record contingent rent expense based on a percentage of restaurant sales  which exceeds minimum base rent  over the periods the liability is incurred 
contingent rent expense is recorded prior to achievement of specified sales levels if achievement of such amounts is considered probable and estimable 

table of contents income taxes we provide for income taxes based on our estimate of federal and state tax liabilities using the recognition threshold and measurement attribute provisions of financial accounting standards board fasb interpretation no

these estimates consider  among other items  effective rates for state and local income taxes  allowable tax credits for items such as taxes paid on reported tip income  estimates related to depreciation and amortization expense allowable for tax purposes  and the tax deductibility of certain other items 
our estimates are based on information available to us at the time we prepare the income tax provision 
we generally file our annual income tax returns several months after our fiscal year end 
income tax returns are subject to audit by federal  state  and local governments  generally years after the returns are filed 
these returns could be subject to material adjustments or differing interpretations of the tax laws 
deferred income tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future income tax consequences of carryforwards and temporary differences between the book and tax basis of assets and liabilities 
valuation allowances are established for deferred tax assets that are deemed more likely than not to be realized in the near term 
we must assess the likelihood that we will be able to recover our deferred tax assets 
if recovery is not likely  we establish valuation allowances to offset any deferred tax asset recorded 
the valuation allowance is based on our estimates of future taxable income in each jurisdiction in which we operate  tax planning strategies  and the period over which our deferred tax assets will be recoverable 
in the event that actual results differ from these estimates  we may be unable to implement certain tax planning strategies or adjust these estimates in future periods 
as we update our estimates  we may need to establish an additional valuation allowance which could have a material negative impact on our results of operations or financial position  or we could reduce our valuation allowances which would have a favorable impact on our results of operations and financial position 
stock based compensation we account for stock based compensation in accordance with the fair value recognition provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 
revised  share based payment sfas r 
the fair value of each option award is estimated on the date of grant using the black scholes option pricing model and is affected by assumptions regarding a number of highly complex and subjective variables 
these variables include  but are not limited to the actual and projected employee and director stock option exercise behavior 
the use of an option pricing model also requires the use of a number of complex assumptions including expected volatility  risk free interest rate  expected dividends  and expected term 
expected volatility is based on the historical volatility of a peer group of companies over the expected life of the option as we do not have enough history trading as a public company to calculate our own stock price volatility 
we utilize historical data to estimate option exercise and employee termination behavior within the valuation model 
the risk free interest rate is based on the us treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant for the expected term of the option 
sfas r also requires us to estimate forfeitures at the time of grant and revise these estimates  if necessary  in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates 
we estimate forfeitures based on our expectation of future experience while considering our historical experience 
changes in the subjective assumptions can materially affect the estimate of fair value of stock based compensation and consequently  the related amount recognized in the consolidated statement of operations 
we are also required to establish deferred tax assets for expense relating to options that would be expected to generate a tax deduction under their original terms 
the recoverability of such assets are dependent upon the actual deduction that may be available at exercise and can further be impaired by either the expiration of the option or an overall valuation reserve on deferred tax assets 
we believe the estimates and assumptions related to these critical accounting policies are appropriate under the circumstances  however  should future events or occurrences result in unanticipated consequences  there could be a material impact on our future financial condition or results of operations

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rates we are exposed to market risk primarily from fluctuations in interest rates on our investments 
we held approximately million in investments as of december  changes in interest rates affect the investment income we earn on our investments and  therefore  impact our cash flows and results of operations 
for  the average interest rate earned on our investments was approximately 
a hypothetical basis point decline in the interest rate earned on our investments would decrease our interest income by approximately million 
primary market risk exposures our primary market risk exposures are in the areas of commodity costs  labor costs  and construction costs 
many of the food products purchased by us are affected by changes in weather  production  availability  seasonality  and other factors outside our control 
in addition  we believe that almost all of our food and supplies are available from several sources  which helps to control food commodity risks 
we also believe that we have the ability to increase certain menu prices in response to food commodity price increases 
our labor costs are impacted by increases in the minimum wage rate as many of our employees are paid labor rates related to federal and state minimum wage laws 
we have exposure to rising construction costs  which may impact our actual cost to develop new restaurants 
although the cost of restaurant construction will not impact significantly the operating results of the restaurant  it would impact the return on investment for such restaurant 
in addition  many of our leases require us to pay taxes  maintenance  repairs  insurance  and utilities  all of which are generally subject to inflationary increases
