item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations contains forward looking statements 
you should read the following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations with selected financial data and our consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto 
we have based our forward looking statements about our markets and demand for our products and future results on assumptions that we consider reasonable 
actual results may differ materially from those suggested by our forward looking statements for various reasons including those discussed in cautionary statements concerning forward looking statements and item a 
business overview spartech is an intermediary processor of engineered thermoplastics which converts base polymers or resins purchased from commodity suppliers into extruded plastic sheet and rollstock  thermoformed packaging  specialty film laminates  acrylic products  specialty plastic alloys  color concentrates and blended resin compounds  and injection molded and profile extruded products for customers in a wide range of markets 
we have facilities located throughout the united states  canada  mexico and europe that are organized into three segments and one group as follows of sales custom sheet and rollstock packaging technologies color and specialty compounds engineered products we assess net sales changes using three major drivers underlying volume  the impact of business acquisitions or divestitures and price mix 
underlying volume is calculated as the change in pounds sold exclusive of the impact on pounds sold from business acquisitions or divestitures and for a comparable number of days in the reporting period 
our fiscal year ends on the saturday closest to october and our fiscal year generally contains weeks or calendar days 
because of this convention  every fifth or sixth fiscal year has an additional week and fiscal was reported as a week fiscal year containing days of activity 
the additional week was reported in the first quarter of fiscal executive summary our loss in was significantly impacted by million of non cash goodwill impairments  million of asset impairments  and million of restructuring and exit costs 
excluding the impact of asset impairments and restructuring and exit costs  our operating earnings of million in were million lower than the prior year 
this decrease was primarily caused by a significant decline in our sales volumes from weak end market demand 
most of our sales volume declines occurred in our end markets which are more sensitive to discretionary spending including the transportation and recreation and leisure markets  and residential sector of the building and construction market 
our earnings were also adversely impacted by significant increases in resin costs which were not passed to customers as higher selling prices in a timely manner  particularly in the earlier portion of the adverse impacts of our lower sales volume and resin increases were offset somewhat by the positive impact from our turnaround initiatives including our manufacturing cost optimization and margin enhancement initiatives 
our manufacturing cost optimization initiative includes our labor reduction efforts and plant consolidations 
our margin enhancement initiative is comprised of activities associated with improving margins on unprofitable customers  improving our commercial practices to reflect changes in resin costs in customer selling prices in a timely manner and consolidation of our procurement function 
we earned higher gross margins per pound sold in the later portions of because of the positive impact of these initiatives 
our cash flow performance in was solid despite our earnings decline 
we generated million in cash flow from operations in which included million from reductions in working capital balances 
we used this cash flow to invest million in capital expenditures  pay down debt of million  pay dividends of million and acquire net treasury stock of million 
outlook we expect a turbulent economy for the foreseeable future and we have undertaken several actions to address this environment 
our operating plans assume the global economic recession will continue through and that end market 
table of contents demand will remain weak through this period 
we believe our aggressive cost reduction actions and financial discipline will enable us to effectively manage through the challenging economy 
we expect to emerge from this environment a stronger and better positioned company to support future long term profitable growth 
results of operations comparison of and consolidated summary net sales were  million and  million in and  respectively  representing a decrease in the decrease was caused by underlying volume prior year additional week creative acquisition price mix our underlying volume decreased million pounds  or  because of lower end market demand and decreases in discretionary spending in the economy 
of the million pounds decrease  occurred in the transportation and recreation and leisure markets 
our volume sold to the transportation market declined from the prior year due mostly to lower volumes to the automotive sector 
volume sold to the recreation and leisure market was lower by  reflecting decreases in sales to recreational vehicles  pools  spas and marine sectors of this market 
most of the remaining of our underlying volume decrease occurred in the packaging market which declined from the prior year and our building and construction market which was lower by from the prior year 
the decrease in the packaging market was caused by lower purchases in the industrial and food packaging sectors of this market  and the decrease in the building and construction market reflected lower sales to the residential sector which were partially offset by an increase in volume sold to the commercial sector of this market 
the decrease in volume from the additional week reflects weeks of sales activity in compared to weeks in the increase from the creative acquisition represents the full year impact of sales dollars from this acquisition which occurred in september our sales comparison benefited from price mix due mostly to increases in sales dollars from the pass through of resin cost increases 
the following table presents net sales  components of cost of sales  and the resulting gross margin in dollars and on a per pound sold basis for and cost of sales presented in the consolidated statements of operations includes material and conversion costs and excludes amortization of intangible assets 
the material and conversion cost components of cost of sales are presented in the following table 
we have not presented these components as a percentage of net sales because a comparison of this measure is distorted by changes in resin costs that are typically passed through to customers as changes to selling prices 
these changes can materially affect the percentages but do not present complete performance measures of the business 
dollars and pounds in millions net sales material costs material margin conversion costs gross margin pounds sold dollars per pound sold net sales material costs material margin conversion costs gross margin 
table of contents the increases in net sales and material costs per pound in were caused by significant increases in our resin costs during the year which we passed along to customers as higher selling prices 
the cent per pound increase in material margin reflects sales mix changes and the positive impact of our margin enhancement initiative 
our conversion costs per pound increased cents because of the decrease in sales volume 
excluding the creative acquisition  our conversion cost dollars decreased due to the volume decline and the impact of our manufacturing cost optimization initiative on reducing our labor related costs 
labor related costs represent approximately half of our total conversion costs  and this initiative resulted in approximately million of lower labor costs in we expect another million of lower labor costs in compared to due to the full year impact of our initiative 
selling  general and administrative expenses were million in  representing an million increase over the prior year 
the increase was caused by the full year impact of our creative acquisition  higher information technology expenses to support our company wide oracle information system implementation  higher professional fees to support our turnaround initiatives and higher bad debts expense  the impacts of which were partially offset by the extra week and a charge associated with the resignation of the company s former president and chief executive officer  both of which occurred in amortization of intangibles was million in compared to million in the increase was due to the prior year creative acquisition 
we estimate a decrease to million of amortization in  which reflects the impact of our current year asset impairments and certain assets that became fully amortized in the million of goodwill impairments and million of fixed asset and other intangible asset impairments in reflect non cash charges which were incurred in our custom sheet and rollstock  color and specialty compounds and engineered products business segments and group 
additional details regarding these impairment charges are discussed in notes and to the consolidated financial statements 
restructuring and exit costs were million in and million in the costs are mostly comprised of employee severance  equipment moving expenses and accelerated depreciation resulting from the company s manufacturing cost optimization initiative 
for announced restructuring initiatives as of november   the company expects to incur approximately million of additional restructuring costs  primarily cash related equipment moving and installation expenses 
the costs primarily represent employee severance  equipment moving expenses and accelerated depreciation associated with the shut down of three former sheet production facilities and the movement of the business into the company s newly constructed facility in greenville  ohio 
the company reported a million operating loss in which compared to million of operating income in the million decrease reflected the million goodwill impairment in  the million increase in fixed asset and other intangible asset impairments and million increase in restructuring and exit costs 
the remaining million decrease was caused by the decline in sales volume which was mitigated somewhat by higher material margins and reductions in conversion costs 
interest expense  net was million in and million in the higher expense in was due to the increase in debt to fund the creative acquisition and stock repurchases during the fourth quarter of and the first quarter of our effective tax rate in was impacted by the significant goodwill impairments  some of which were not tax deductible 
excluding the goodwill impairments  our effective tax rate was in which compared to in our effective tax rate was positively impacted by domestic state and foreign tax law changes in the first quarter of we estimate our tax rate to be in the approximate range of to 
we reported a net loss of million in and net earnings of million in these amounts reflect the impact of the items previously discussed 

table of contents custom sheet and rollstock segment net sales were million and million in and  respectively  representing a decrease in this decrease was caused by underlying volume prior year additional week price mix most of our underlying volume decrease in this segment occurred in the transportation  recreation and leisure and building and construction markets 
volume sold to the transportation market decreased and occurred within the automotive and heavy truck sectors of this market 
the segment s volume to the recreation and leisure market was lower by reflecting lower sales of recreational vehicles  spas  pools and marine products 
we experienced an decline in volume to the building and construction market from decreases in sales of residential construction related products 
the price mix benefit was mostly from sales dollar increases from the pass through of resin cost increases 
this segment reported an operating loss of million in and operating income of million in this comparison reflects million of asset impairments in the remaining million decrease in operating earnings was caused by the lower volume and lower material margins in the early portion of because of a significant increase in resin costs that were not passed along to customers in a timely manner 
these adverse factors were partially offset by lower costs from our manufacturing cost optimization initiative and higher margins from our margin enhancement initiative in the later portion of packaging technologies segment net sales were million and million in and  respectively  representing an increase in this increase was caused by underlying volume prior year additional week creative acquisition price mix the decrease in underlying volume reflected a decline to packaging related markets  which represent approximately three fourths of this segment s total sales  and a decline in the remaining portion of this segment sold to non packaging related markets 
our creative acquisition provided additional sales of million in versus the price mix benefit was mostly from sales dollar increases from the pass through of resin cost increases 
operating earnings were million in compared to million in this decrease was caused by the decline in volume and lower underlying material margins from significant increases in resin costs in that were not passed along to customers in a timely manner due largely to indexed pricing arrangements 
these factors were partially offset by additional earnings contributed from creative and benefits from our manufacturing cost optimization initiative 
color and specialty compounds segment net sales were million and million in and  respectively  representing a decrease in this decrease was caused by underlying volume prior year additional week price mix approximately three fourths of the sales volume decline in this segment occurred from lower sales of compounds to the automotive market and industrial packaging market 
these sectors of our end markets represented about half of this segment s sales volume and were lower by and for automotive and industrial packaging  respectively  from these losses were somewhat mitigated by an increase in volumes sold to the commercial construction market 
the price mix benefit was mostly from sales dollar increases from the pass through of resin cost increases 

table of contents this segment reported an operating loss of million in and operating income of million in this comparison reflects million of asset impairments in the remaining million decrease in operating earnings was caused by the lower volume which was offset somewhat by higher material margins from improved mix and our margin enhancement initiative and lower costs from our manufacturing cost optimization initiative 
engineered products group net sales were million and million in and  respectively  representing a sales decrease in this decrease was caused by underlying volume prior year additional week price mix the underlying volume decline in this group was primarily caused by lower sales of lawn mower wheels due to decreases in discretionary spending in the economy 
the price mix benefit mostly resulted from sales dollar increases from the pass through of resin cost increases 
this group reported a million operating loss in versus million of operating income in of the million decrease  million was caused by asset impairments 
the remaining million resulted from the lower volume of lawn mower wheels sold 
corporate corporate expenses are reported as selling  general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statements of operations and include corporate office expenses  information technology costs  professional fees and the impact of foreign currency exchange 
corporate expenses were million in compared to million in the prior year 
corporate expenses increased in from higher depreciation expense  information technology related costs associated with our company wide oracle information system implementation and higher professional fees to support our turnaround initiatives 
comparison of and consolidated summary net sales were  million and  million for the years ended and  respectively  representing a decrease in the causes of this percentage decrease were as follows underlying volume volume from additional week acquisition of business price mix the decrease in underlying volume was caused by lower sales of compounds to the automotive sector of the transportation market  color concentrates to the packaging market and lower sales of sheet to the recreation and leisure market  the residential sector of the building and construction market and the heavy truck and automotive sectors of the transportation market 
these declines were partially offset by increases in sales of thermoformed product to the packaging market  sheet to the refrigeration sector of the appliance and electronics market and compounds to the commercial building and construction market 
disruptions from the greenville sheet consolidation also contributed to the decline in sales volume during sales volume from the additional week reflects weeks of sales activity in compared to weeks in the price mix impact was flat  reflecting a benefit from an increase in sales mix of thermoformed product offset by the impact from lower average resin costs in versus which were passed through to customers as lower selling prices 
the following table presents sales  components of cost of sales  and the resulting gross margin in dollars and on a per pound sold basis for and cost of sales presented in the consolidated statements of operations includes material and conversion costs and excludes amortization of intangible assets 
the material and conversion cost components of cost of sales are presented in the following table 
we have not presented these components as a percentage of net sales because a comparison of this measure is distorted by changes in resin costs that are typically passed through to customers as changes to 
table of contents selling prices 
these changes can materially affect the percentages but do not present complete performance measures of the business 
dollars and pounds in millions net sales material costs material margin conversion costs gross margin pounds sold dollars per pound sold net sales material costs material margin conversion costs gross margin material margin and gross margin per pound sold decreased primarily because of higher resin costs in the second half of which we were not able to fully pass on to customers as higher selling prices due to a soft demand environment 
conversion costs per pound sold during increased slightly from due to an increase in per pound labor related expenses and higher depreciation expense partially offset by a shift in mix of sales to lower cost plants and reductions in freight  repairs and maintenance and packaging expenses per pound sold 
selling  general and administrative expenses were million in  representing an million increase over the expenses include a million charge associated with the resignation of the company s former president and chief executive officer in the third quarter of  a million foreign currency net loss due to a weaker us dollar during and million of selling  general and administrative expenses reported in our creative business 
in our fourth quarter of  we restructured our us dollar investment previously held by our canadian operations which will mitigate the majority of our consolidated foreign currency exposure that caused the net currency losses in excluding these factors  selling  general and administrative expenses increased million in due primarily to a million increase in information technology related costs  including depreciation expense  associated with our company wide oracle information system implementation  higher professional fees and the impact from the inclusion of an additional week during  all of which were partially offset by lower incentive compensation expenses 
in the first quarter of  we adopted sfas revised  share based payment sfas r 
prior to the adoption of sfas r  we had adopted the disclosure only provisions of sfas  accounting for stock based compensation  and no expense related to stock options was recognized in our results of operations 
we implemented sfas r using the modified prospective transition method  which requires the expensing of stock options upon adoption without restating prior periods 
stock based compensation was million in  of which million was recognized in selling  general and administrative expenses and million was recorded as cost of sales 
in  stock based compensation expense was million  of which million was recognized in selling  general and administrative expenses and million was recorded as cost of sales 
in october of  pfizer  inc pfizer  a customer of creative  announced the exit of its new inhaled insulin product  exubera  which resulted in the impairment of a customer related intangible asset assigned to the pfizer relationship upon acquisition 
in the fourth quarter of  we recorded a million non cash goodwill impairment charge due to changes in our profiles business and the reorganization of the operations  management and reporting of this business which led to a redefinition of our operating segments comprising our engineered products group and allocation of goodwill to our new profiles reporting unit 
the fair value of our profiles business did not support the million goodwill allocation which resulted in the impairment charge 

table of contents restructuring and exit costs were million during and million in and largely represent employee severance  equipment moving and accelerated depreciation charges 
the restructuring and exit costs primarily reflect the expenses associated with the consolidation of three existing custom sheet and rollstock production facilities into one newly constructed facility in greenville  ohio 
the restructuring and exit costs primarily represent the expenses associated with the consolidation of three color and specialty compounds production facilities into one plant in donora  pennsylvania 
operating earnings for were million compared to million in  representing a million decrease 
the decrease in operating earnings is largely attributable to the million decrease in gross margin and the million increase in selling  general  and administrative expenses  partially offset by the reduction in goodwill impairment charges 
interest expense  net was million in compared to million in the decrease in interest expense was due to the benefit realized from our focused efforts on debt reduction and the extinguishment of our convertible subordinated debentures in  partially offset by the increase in debt to fund the creative acquisition and stock repurchases during the fourth quarter of interest expense also benefited from lower average interest rates during in  we completed a million private placement of debt and amended our us unsecured bank credit facility which increased our borrowing availability from million to million 
we used the proceeds from the private placement and borrowings from our amended credit facility to redeem our million convertible subordinated debentures which resulted in a million charge for early debt extinguishment costs 
the million early debt extinguishment costs represent million of early payment premium and million of non cash write off of unamortized debt issuance costs 
this redemption eliminated the potential dilutive effect of a future conversion of the convertible subordinated debentures and reduced our cost of borrowing 
our effective tax rate was in compared to in the improvement in the effective rate during is attributable to the impact of the non deductible goodwill impairment charge in excluding the non deductible portion of goodwill impairment charge  our effective tax rate was in we reported net earnings of million in compared to million in these amounts reflect the impact of the items previously discussed 
custom sheet and rollstock segment net sales were million and million for and  respectively  representing a decrease in this decrease was caused by underlying volume volume from additional week price mix the decrease in underlying volume was primarily due to weak demand in the durable goods markets which adversely impacted our volume sold to the heavy truck  residential construction  automotive  recreational vehicles and pool and spa sectors of our end markets 
these declines were partially offset by increases in sales of material handling sheet to the industrial packaging industry and sales of sheet from our mexico facility to the refrigeration sector of the appliance and electronics market 
two thirds of the underlying volume decline occurred at our three facilities being consolidated into our newly constructed greenville facility 
these facilities mostly produce polyethylene based product for many of the aforementioned weak markets 
the price mix impact reflects lower average resin costs in versus which were passed through to customers as lower selling prices and the impact from a lower mix of higher priced sheet  particularly in the heavy truck  recreation and leisure and pool and spa sectors of our end markets 
this segment s operating earnings in were million which compared to million in the decrease in operating earnings in was impacted by a million increase in restructuring and exit costs associated with the greenville consolidation 
excluding the impact of restructuring and exit costs  operating earnings decreased million in over  of which million occurred at the three plants impacted by the greenville consolidation 
the reduction in operating earnings in was caused by the decline in sales volume along with a reduction in gross margin per pound sold which reflects a decrease in material margin per pound sold and a increase in conversion costs per pound sold 
material margin per pound decreased because of higher resin costs in the second half of the year which we were not able to fully pass on to our customers as higher selling prices due to a soft demand environment 
the disruption associated with our greenville sheet consolidation combined with the significant increase in polyethylene prices in the second half of also 
table of contents contributed to the decline in material margin 
despite a benefit received from a shift in sales mix to lower cost plants  conversion cost per pound sold increased due to a decrease in volume that exceeded our reductions in conversion costs 
packaging technologies segment net sales were million and million in and  respectively  representing an increase in this increase was caused by underlying volume volume from additional week acquisition of business price mix the increase in underlying volume was driven by sales of thermoformed product to the food packaging market 
the creative acquisition provided additional sales revenue of million for post acquisition sales in our fourth quarter of the price mix impact reflects a larger mix of higher priced thermoformed product 
this segment s operating earnings were million in both and operating earnings in includes a million impairment charge related to the impairment of the pfizer customer related intangible asset acquired with the creative business 
excluding this impairment and a benefit from creative s operating results 
operating earnings increased million in over due to the increase in underlying sales volume 
color and specialty compounds segment net sales were million and million in and  respectively  representing a decrease in this decrease was caused by underlying volume volume from additional week price mix the decrease in underlying volume was caused by lower sales of compounds to the domestic automotive sector of the transportation market and color concentrates to the packaging market partially offset by an increase in sales of commercial roofing applications 
the decrease in price mix was largely caused by lower average resin costs in compared to which we passed through to customers as lower selling prices and a reduction in the sales mix of color concentrates which have a higher than average selling price per pound sold 
operating earnings for this segment were million in and million in the decrease in operating earnings was primarily caused by the decrease in underlying volumes coupled with a drop in gross margin per pound sold 
the drop in gross margin per pound was caused by rising resin costs in the second half of the year coupled with soft demand which prevented us from fully passing on the cost increases as higher selling prices  a lower mix of higher margin color concentrates as well as million of inventory adjustments in the fourth quarter of a portion of the million resulted from the correction of an error identified by our system implementation process and another portion from a decision to liquidate certain scrap inventory 
operating earnings in also reflect a million decrease in restructuring and exit costs from the donora consolidation 
engineered products group net sales were million and million for and  respectively  representing a sales decrease in this decrease was caused by underlying volume volume from additional week price mix the price mix impact reflects lower average resin costs in compared to which we passed through to customers as lower selling prices and a higher sales mix of wheels which have a lower per pound sales price than the segment average 

table of contents this group s operating earnings in were million compared to million in the increase in operating earnings reflects a million write off of goodwill related to our profile s business in excluding the impact of the goodwill impairment  operating earnings increased million which was driven by the profitability improvement in our wheels business 
corporate corporate expenses are reported as selling  general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statements of operations and include corporate office expenses  information technology costs  professional fees and the impact of foreign currency exchange 
corporate expenses were million in compared to million in in  corporate expenses were impacted by the million charge from the resignation of our former president and chief executive officer and a million increase in foreign currency losses due to a weakening us dollar 
excluding the impact from these items  corporate expenses increased million in from higher depreciation expense and information technology related costs associated with our company wide oracle information system implementation  higher professional fees and the impact from an additional week of expenses  all of which were partially offset by lower incentive compensation expenses 
liquidity and capital resources cash flow our primary sources of liquidity have been cash flows from operating activities and borrowings from third parties 
our principal uses of cash have been to support our operating activities  invest in capital improvements  reduce outstanding indebtedness  finance strategic business and outsourcing acquisitions  acquire treasury shares and pay dividends on our common stock 
the following summarizes the major categories of our changes in cash and cash equivalents in  and cash flows in millions net cash provided by operating activities net cash used for investing activities net cash used for financing activities decrease increase in cash and cash equivalents net cash provided by operating activities was million in compared to million in the prior year 
reductions in net working capital funded million and million in and  respectively 
excluding the net working capital reductions  net cash provided by operating activities was lower by million in  reflecting lower current year earnings 
we continued our focus on managing working capital in the current year 
our days sales outstanding  inventory turns and days payable outstanding were  and  respectively  at october compared to  and  respectively  at october the improvements in these metrics led to a reduction in our working capital as a percentage of trailing two months of net sales from at the end of fiscal to at the end of fiscal our primary investing activity in was capital expenditures 
capital expenditures are primarily incurred to enhance our facilities for safety  to improve productivity  and to modernize and expand facilities 
capital expenditures in were million compared to million in the million decrease was largely attributable to the new production facility in greenville  ohio  the expansion of our mexico operation and additional capital for our information systems implementation spent in we expect our capital expenditures to approximate our level 
we used million to fund the creative acquisition of which million occurred in the fourth quarter of and the remaining million occurred in net cash used for financing activities totaled million in and million in the net cash used for financing activities during reflects million to pay down debt  million to fund dividends and million for treasury share repurchases 
financing activities in also included million received from our chairman of the board to purchase treasury shares and million to pay fees associated with our debt refinancing 
in  we borrowed million  paid dividends of million and purchased million of treasury stock net of cash received on stock option exercises 

table of contents financing arrangements effective september   we amended our revolving credit agreement  senior notes  senior notes and euro bank term loan 
under the amendments  each facility is now secured with collateral  which includes our accounts receivable  inventory  machinery and equipment  and intangible assets 
capacity under the revolving credit agreement was reduced from million to this capacity could increase million if we meet certain financial performance metrics  but our capacity will continue to be permanently reduced annually based on mandatory principal payments resulting from a percentage of excess cash flow 
after the excess cash flow payment in the first quarter of  capacity on our revolving credit facility will be permanently reduced by million 
as of november   we had million of borrowing availability under our most restrictive financial covenant  which will not be impacted by the excess cash flow payment mentioned above and discussed further below 
the company s net working capital is generally at its highest level in the first quarter of the fiscal year and trends down to its lowest level near the end of the fiscal year due to seasonality in the business 
we expect our borrowing availability to decrease in the first quarter of due to our seasonal net working capital build 
under the amendments  we are restricted from entering into any non permitted acquisitions  repurchasing shares of our common stock  paying dividends in excess of million per quarter and are limited to the amount we can spend for capital expenditures 
pricing under the amendment for the revolving credit facility utilizes a grid structure based on leverage with initial pricing on libor plus a margin of or prime plus a margin of pricing under the senior notes increased by to and pricing under the senior notes increased by to 
pricing under the euro bank term loan utilizes a floating rate chosen by us equal to either the one month  three month or six month euribo rate plus a borrowing margin 
under the amendments  we are required to make ratable mandatory principal payments based on a percentage of our excess cash flow as defined in the agreements to the lenders of the bank credit agreement  the senior noteholders  the senior noteholders and the euro bank term loan noteholders 
based on our results in the fourth quarter of  we will be required make a million payment in first quarter and this amount is classified in current maturities of long term debt 
for and thereafter  we will be required to make mandatory principal payments on these debt agreements based on a percentage of our annual excess cash flow until such obligations are paid in full 
as of november   we had million outstanding debt with a weighted average interest rate of  of which represented fixed rate instruments with a weighted average interest rate of 
in addition  as of november   we used million of cash held in canada to pay down debt 
under internal revenue service regulations  we can use this cash to fund non canadian operations or pay down non canadian debt for consecutive days or total days during our fiscal year without incurring income tax 
if we were to permanently transfer this cash out of canada  we would be required to pay approximately million of additional income tax 
while we currently expect to be in compliance with our covenants in the next twelve months  our failure to comply with the covenants or other requirements of our financing arrangements is an event of default and could require  among other things  acceleration of the payment of our indebtedness  which could adversely impact our business  financial condition  and results of operations 
we anticipate that cash flows from operations  together with the financing and borrowings under our bank credit facilities  will provide the resources necessary for reinvestment in our existing business  strategic acquisitions and managing our capital structure on a short and long term basis 
contractual obligations the following table summarizes our contractual obligations as of november  and the estimated payments due by period in millions less than years years greater than contractual obligations total year and and years long term debt capital lease obligations operating lease obligations purchase obligations other obligations total 
table of contents amounts included in long term debt include principal and interest payments 
interest on debt with variable rates was calculated using the current rate of that particular debt instrument at november  as discussed above  certain of our long term debt agreements are subject to mandatory prepayments  which include prepayments based on amounts of excess cash flow and from the net cash proceeds of asset sales  subject to certain exceptions 
because mandatory prepayments are based on future operating results and events  we cannot predict the amount or timing of such prepayments other than the million recorded as a current maturity of long term debt 
this mandatory prepayment was based on our excess cash flow during the fourth quarter of and must be paid during the first quarter of actual amounts of interest may vary depending on principal prepayments and changes in variable interest rates 
purchase obligations primarily consist of inventory purchases made in the normal course of business to meet operational requirements 
other obligations consist primarily of a guarantee to enter into a financing agreement in return for government investment subsidies 
the table does not include long term contingent liabilities  deferred compensation obligations and liabilities related to deferred taxes because the company is not certain when these liabilities will become due 
critical accounting policies and estimates in preparing our consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  we must select and apply various accounting policies 
our most significant accounting policies are described in note to our consolidated financial statements 
in order to apply our accounting policies  we are required to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  shareholders equity  revenues and expenses  and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements 
accounting policies  estimates and judgments which we believe are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results include the following revenue recognition we recognize revenue as product is shipped and title passes to the customer 
we manufacture our products either to standard specifications or to custom specifications agreed upon with the customer in advance  and we inspect our products prior to shipment to ensure that these specifications are met 
we monitor and track product returns  which have historically been within our expectations and the provisions established 
despite our efforts to improve our quality and service to customers  we cannot guarantee that we will continue to experience the same or better return rates than we have in the past 
any significant increase in returns could have a material negative impact on our operating results 
allowance for doubtful trade receivables we perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers and adjust credit limits based upon payment history and the customer s creditworthiness  as determined by our review of their current credit information 
we monitor market and economic conditions as well as collections and payments from our customers 
we maintain a provision for estimated credit losses based upon any specific customer collection issues identified  including market and economic conditions 
while such credit losses have historically been within our expectations and the provisions established  actual credit loss rates may differ from our estimates 
any significant increase in credit losses in excess of our expectations could have a material negative impact on the value of our trade receivables and operating results 
inventory valuation and obsolescence we value inventories at the lower of i cost to purchase or manufacture the inventory or ii the current estimated market value of the inventory 
we also buy scrap and recyclable material including regrind material to be used in future production 
we record these inventories initially at purchase price  and based on the inventory aging and other considerations for realizable value  we write down the carrying value to market value where appropriate 
we review inventory on hand and record provisions for obsolete inventory 
a significant increase in the demand for our raw materials could result in a short term increase in the cost of inventory purchases  while a significant decrease in demand could result in an increase in the amount of excess inventory quantities on hand 
in addition  most of our business involves the manufacture of custom products  where the loss of a specific customer could increase the amount of excess or obsolete inventory on hand 
although we make efforts to ensure the accuracy of our forecasts of future product demand  any significant unanticipated changes in demand could have a significant impact on the value of our inventory and operating results 
goodwill our formal annual impairment testing date for goodwill is the first day of the company s fourth quarter 
in addition  a goodwill impairment assessment is performed if an event occurs or circumstances change that would make it more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting unit is below its carrying amount 
the goodwill impairment test is a two step process which requires us to make assumptions regarding fair value 
the first step consists of estimating the fair value of each reporting unit using a number of factors  including projected future operating results and business plans  economic projections  anticipated future cash flows  discount rates  the allocation of shared or corporate items  and comparable marketplace fair value data from within a comparable industry grouping 
we compare the estimated fair values of each reporting unit to the respective carrying values  which includes allocated goodwill 
if the estimated fair value is less than the carrying value  the 
table of contents second step is completed to compute the impairment amount by determining the implied fair value of goodwill 
this determination requires the allocation of the estimated fair value of the reporting unit to the assets and liabilities of the reporting unit 
any remaining unallocated fair value represents the implied fair value of goodwill  which is compared to the corresponding carrying value to compute the goodwill impairment amount 
although we believe our estimates of fair value are reasonable  many of the factors used in assessing fair value and  for certain reporting units  the allocation of estimated fair value to the assets and liabilities of those reporting units are outside the control of management  and it is reasonably likely that assumptions and estimates can change in future periods 
these changes can result in future impairments that may materially affect the carrying value of our assets and our operating results 
note to the consolidated financial statements sets out the impact of charges taken to recognize the impairment of goodwill and the factors which led to changes in estimates and assumptions 
the packaging reporting unit was the only significant reporting unit that did not have goodwill impairment in significant assumptions used in our step one discounted cash flow analysis for the packaging reporting unit included a five year weighted average growth rate of  a discount rate of  and a terminal value growth rate of 
historically  our packaging reporting unit has experienced less cyclicality than some of our other reporting units and this was specifically reflected in its discount rate 
long lived assets we review the carrying amounts of property  plant and equipment  other intangible assets and other long lived assets for potential impairment if an event occurs or circumstances change that indicates the carrying amount may not be recoverable 
in evaluating the recoverability of a long lived asset  such assets are grouped at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets  and we compare the carrying value of each asset group with the corresponding estimated undiscounted future operating cash flows 
in the event the carrying value of an asset group is not recoverable by future undiscounted operating cash flows  impairment may exist 
in the event of impairment  an impairment charge would be measured as the amount by which the carrying value of the long lived asset group exceeds its fair value 
notes and to the consolidated financial statements set out the impact of charges taken to recognize the significant impairments of fixed assets and other intangible assets and the factors which led to these impairments 
income taxes deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on temporary differences between financial statement carrying amounts and tax bases of assets and liabilities  applying enacted tax rates expected to be in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse 
deferred tax assets are recognized for credit carryforwards and then assessed to determine the likelihood of realization 
valuation allowances are established to the extent we believe it is more likely than not that deferred tax assets will not be realized 
expectations of future earnings  the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities  the ability to carryback losses and credits to offset taxable income in a prior year  and tax planning strategies are the primary drivers underlying our evaluation of valuation allowances 
deferred tax amounts recorded may materially differ from the amounts that are ultimately payable and expensed if our estimates of future earnings and outcomes of tax planning strategies are ultimately inaccurate 
deferred income taxes are not provided for undistributed earnings on foreign consolidated subsidiaries to the extent that such earnings are reinvested for an indefinite period of time 
if those undistributed foreign earnings were not considered indefinitely reinvested  we would be required to recognize approximately million to million of additional income tax expense

 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
fin 
fin requires financial statement recognition of the impact of a tax position  if that position is more likely than not to be sustained on examination  based on the technical merits of the position 
the benefit is calculated as the largest amount that is more than percent likely to be realized upon resolution of the benefit 
tax authorities regularly examine the company s tax returns in the jurisdictions in which we do business 
we regularly assess the tax risk of our return filing positions and we believe that our accruals for uncertain tax benefits are adequate as of november  contingencies we are involved in litigation in the ordinary course of business  including environmental matters 
our policy is to record expense for contingencies when it is both probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated 
estimating probable losses requires assessment of multiple outcomes that often depends on management s judgments regarding  but not limited to  potential actions by third parties such as regulators 
the final resolution of these contingencies could result in expenses different from current accruals and  therefore  have a material impact on our consolidated financial results in a future reporting period

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to changes in interest rates primarily as a result of our borrowing activities 
our earnings and cash flows are subject to fluctuations in interest rates on our floating rate debt facilities 
at november   we had million of debt subject to variable short term interest rates and million of fixed rate debt outstanding 
based upon the november  balance of the floating rate debt  a hypothetical ten percent increase in interest rates would cause an immaterial change in future net earnings  fair values and cash flows 
we are not currently engaged in any interest rate derivative instruments to manage our exposure to interest rate fluctuations 
the fair value of our fixed rate debt is subject to changes in interest rates and the november  fair values of such instruments are disclosed in note to our consolidated financial statements 
we are also exposed to market risk through changes in foreign currency exchange rates  specifically the canadian dollar  euro and mexican peso 
based upon our november  currency exposure  a hypothetical ten percent weakening of the us dollar in each currency would cause an immaterial change in future earnings  fair values and cash flows
