item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the following discussion is intended to assist in an understanding of the company s historical financial position and results of operations for each year in the three year period ended june  the following discussion is intended to assist in understanding our results of operations and our current financial condition 
our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes included elsewhere in this annual report on form k contains additional information that should be referred to when reviewing this material 
statements in this discussion may be forward looking 
these forward looking statements involve risks and uncertainties  including those discussed below  which could cause actual results to differ from those expressed 
general the company s future results of operations and growth are substantially dependent upon i its ability to acquire or find and successfully develop additional oil and gas reserves and ii the prevailing prices for oil and gas 
we have identified numerous locations to pursue additional drilling 
if we are unable to economically complete additional producing wells  the company s oil and gas production  and thus its revenues  would likely decline gradually as its reserves are depleted 
in addition  oil and gas prices are dependent upon numerous factors beyond the company s control  such as economic  political and regulatory developments and competition from other sources of energy 
the oil and gas markets have historically been very volatile  and any significant and extended decline in the price of oil or gas would have a material adverse effect on the company s financial condition and results of operations  and could result in a further reduction in the carrying value of the company s proved reserves and adversely affect its access to capital 
overview cubic energy  inc is an independent upstream energy company engaged in the development and production of  and exploration for  crude oil and natural gas 
our oil and gas assets and activities are concentrated exclusively in louisiana and texas 
our corporate strategy with respect to our asset acquisition and development efforts was to position the company in a low risk opportunity while building main stream high yield reserves 
the acquisition of our cotton valley acreage in desoto and caddo parishes  louisiana  puts us in a reservoir rich environment both in the cotton valley and bossier haynesville shale formations  which we believe gives us the potential to discover additional commercial horizons that can add value to the bottom line 
we have had success on our acreage with wells drilled by achieving production from not only the cotton valley and bossier haynesville shale formations  but also the hosston formations 
fiscal was a challenging year in many aspects 
as of june   the company has successfully drilled wells in its northwest louisiana properties in its johnson branch acreage in caddo parish  and in its bethany longstreet acreage in caddo and desoto parishes 
in its johnson branch acreage  cubic has drilled wells through the cotton valley sandstones  with three of these wells penetrating deeper into the bossier haynesville shales 
two of such bossier haynesville wells have been completed and are producing from the haynesville formation  the third such well was completed and is producing from the cotton valley formation 
to date  johnson branch wells have been completed as hydrocarbon producers in the cotton valley sandstones 
additionally  in its bethany longstreet acreage  cubic has eight producing wells in the cotton valley and hosston formations and two producing wells in the haynesville shale 

table of contents during the first quarter of fiscal  the company elected to participate in the horizontal drilling of chesapeake energy s s mitchell h and clingman h wells 
these wells are located in the johnson branch and caspiana fields of caddo parish  louisiana  and are horizontally drilled to an approximate measured depth of  feet  followed by a haynesville shale completion 
cubic has an estimated working interest in the wells 
cubic has a working interest with chesapeake energy in three johnson branch cotton valley wells the copeland and the fiest we are also participating in these haynesville horizontal wells the clingman h  the clingman h and the woolworth h cubic s future plans include participation in the beauregard  and other wells in sections controlled by chesapeake energy  goodrich petroleum and petrohawk energy  in which cubic has a working interest in the haynesville shale 
participating in these wells is expected to give cubic s technical personnel valuable insights in the methods and technologies to help the company in developing and enhancing the development of the balance of our acreage 
during the second quarter of fiscal  the company retained rbc richardson barr securities  inc  to assist the company in exploring the sale of the company  or substantially all of its assets 
the initial interest in the company s assets was very positive 
as natural gas prices continued their downward spiral in the beginning of fiscal  it became apparent to management that a bid reflecting the full value of the company s assets would not be forthcoming 
our financial results depend upon many factors  but are largely driven by the volume of our natural gas production and the price that we receive for that production 
our production volumes will decline as reserves are depleted unless we obtain and expend capital in successful development and exploration activities or acquire properties with existing production 
the amount we realize for our production depends predominantly upon commodity prices  which are affected by changes in market demand and supply  as impacted by overall economic activity  weather  pipeline capacity constraints  inventory storage levels  basis differentials and other factors 
accordingly  finding and developing oil and natural gas reserves at economical costs is critical to our long term success 
during the second half of fiscal  oil and natural gas prices declined significantly in response to the worldwide credit crisis  the turmoil in the global financial system and the economic recession in the united states and in other developed and developing countries 
in response to natural gas prices during the last quarter of fiscal  we reduced and refocused our capital budget on the development of non proved locations in our bossier haynesville shale locations 
our future drilling plans are subject to change based upon various factors  some of which are beyond our control  including drilling results  natural gas prices  the availability and cost of capital  drilling and production costs  availability of drilling services and equipment  gathering system and pipeline transportation constraints and regulatory approvals 
to the extent these factors lead to reductions in our drilling plans and associated capital budgets in future periods  our financial position  cash flows and operating results could be adversely impacted 
another consequence we face as a result of declining natural gas prices is the possibility that we may be required to recognize a non cash impairment expense under the full cost method of accounting  which we use to account for our oil and natural gas exploration and development activities 
we had recorded a full cost ceiling impairment of approximately million at june   at which time the henry hub spot market price was per mmbtu for natural gas 
if natural gas prices do not recover  we may be required to take additional impairment charges in the future 
in march  the company began a strategic campaign to pursue three options 
first  restructure our debt and operating capital 
this plan seeks to provide the capital needed for drilling seven to ten horizontal wells during second  pursue a joint venture with a larger company that could assist with operations and allow the company to maintain a working interest and become a financially strong public company 
the third 
table of contents option would be to sell the company or its assets 
this option is the least attractive to management at this time due to low natural gas prices  which makes it difficult for the company to realize acceptable shareholder value 
due to a lack of cash we did very little well workover during fiscal without the needed fracture stimulation  natural gas production of the wells continues to fall 
as the world economy declined  so did natural gas prices 
the natural gas price downward spiral and our lack of cash on hand to stimulate well production caused the company to have impairment losses for each of the first three quarters of fiscal while it created difficulties for operations  it provided a fortuitous situation in that we were not drilling and producing gas for sale into this depressed natural gas market 
as shown in the accompanying financial statements  the company incurred a net loss of  during the year ended june   and as of that date  the company s current liabilities exceeded its current assets by  and its total liabilities exceeded its total assets by  those factors  as well as the uncertain conditions that the company faces regarding its loan agreements as discussed in note e  create an uncertainty about the company s ability to continue as a going concern 
management of the company has developed a plan to reduce its liabilities through additional financing and issuance of additional stock to shareholders 
the company s plan includes several strategic opportunities to correct the current financial situation 
the company is involved in negotiations that could provide up to  in drilling credits  expand it credit facility to  from its current full utilized  facility and extend the term of the facility out two to three years beyond the current maturity date of march  the ability of the company to continue as a going concern is dependent on acceptance of the plan by the company s bank creditors and the plan s success 
the financial statements do not include any adjustments that might be necessary if the company is unable to continue as a going concern 
management continues to believe in the value of its assets and will pursue all options that allow the company to leverage those assets to gain full shareholder value 

table of contents summary operating  reserve and other data the following table presents an unaudited summary of certain operating and oil and natural gas reserve data  and non gaap financial data for the periods indicated year ended june  operating data proved reserves bcfe production mcfe producing wells at end of period  gross producing wells at end of period  net acreage  gross acreage  net production oil bbl natural gas mcf natural gas liquids gallons total oil  gas and liquids mcfe average daily mcfe weighted average sales prices oil per bbl natural gas per mcf natural gas liquids per gallon n a n a n a natural gas equivalent per mcfe selected expenses per mcfe production costs workover expenses non recurring severance taxes other revenue deductions total lease operating expenses general and administrative expenses non cash stock based compensation other general and administrative total general and administrative depreciation  depletion and amortization 
table of contents results of operations comparison of fiscal to fiscal revenues oil and gas sales decreased to  for fiscal from  for fiscal primarily due to lower gas volumes resulting from a steep production decline curve and lack of funds to workover existing wells and a decrease in the weighted average sales price for gas per mcf 
this decline was mitigated by the company having an average of approximately gross wells on line in louisiana in fiscal versus approximately gross wells in fiscal costs and expenses oil and gas production  operating and development costs also referred to as lease operating expenses elsewhere herein increased to  of oil and gas sales for fiscal from  of oil and gas sales for fiscal primarily due to more wells being on line in louisiana  which resulted in  increase in common facility expenses  a  increase in chemical cost and a  increase in salt water hauling costs 
these increases were somewhat offset by a  decrease in costs passed through to the company by the purchaser of the company s gas 
such costs are deducted from the company s gross revenue by the purchaser 
general and administrative expenses g a decreased to  for fiscal from  in fiscal as a result of a  decrease in non cash stock compensation expense due to a decrease in the number of shares of common stock granted versus the prior year period 
this decrease was somewhat offset by a  increase in corporate fees paid  which includes  in amex listing fees and a  increase due to adding two more outside directors  a  increase in legal fees due in part to the support needed to address the nyse amex non compliance issue  and  in contract services fees related to management s transition to a new chief financial officer  which occurred in fiscal  but did not occur in the prior year period 
depreciation  depletion and amortization dd a decreased to  in fiscal from  in fiscal primarily due to a decrease in capital expenditures in fiscal related to the acquisition and development of oil and gas properties 
impairment of oil and gas properties increased to  in fiscal from in fiscal the fiscal impairment resulted from a downward revision of our reserve estimates  which was effected by the following events i we experienced delays related to third party providers in our bethany longstreet acreage  including not receiving contracted for compression services  which temporarily delayed our ability to produce from these wells  ii we did not effectuate final completion of certain wells due to a shift in our focus to the development of our johnson branch acreage in caddo parish  louisiana  and  iii the lack of production history in wells recently brought online lead to a sharper decline curve being utilized by rps scotia  inc in formulating the reserve estimates 
interest expense  including amortization of loan discount increased to  in fiscal from  in fiscal primarily due to an increase in debt before discounts to  at june  from  at june  this increase resulted from the drawing down of our revolving credit line of  before discounts 
the weighted average debt balance before discounts for fiscal was  as compared to  in fiscal the credit facility with wells fargo also resulted in a loan discount being recorded 
the discount is being amortized over the original three year term of the debt as additional interest expense with  being recorded in fiscal as compared to  in fiscal there was a decrease in the capitalization of 
table of contents interest expense to the full cost pool for oil and gas properties of  in fiscal as compared to  in fiscal comparison of fiscal to fiscal oil and gas sales increased to  for fiscal from  for fiscal primarily due to higher gas volumes resulting from an average of approximately gross wells being on line in louisiana in fiscal versus approximately three and one half wells in fiscal  and a increase in the weighted average sales price for gas per mcf 
costs and expenses oil and gas production  operating and development costs also referred to as lease operating expenses elsewhere herein increased to  of oil and gas sales for fiscal from  of oil and gas sales for fiscal primarily due to more wells being on line in louisiana  which resulted in a  increase in salt water hauling and disposal costs   in common facility expenses for production from the company s johnson branch wells  which did not occur in the prior year period  a  increase in contract labor costs  a  increase in state taxes on production also referred to as severance taxes elsewhere herein  and a  increase in costs passed through to the company by the purchaser of the company s gas 
such costs are deducted from the company s gross revenue by the purchaser and include  but are not limited to costs to market the company s gas  compression fees  and the cost of fuel used by the purchaser to convey the company s gas 
these increases were somewhat offset by a  drop in non recurring workover expenses 
general and administrative expenses g a increased to  for fiscal from  in fiscal as a result of a  increase in non cash stock compensation expense related primarily to appreciation of the company s common stock price  a increase in the number of shares of common stock granted versus the prior year period  and full recognition in fiscal of stock compensation issued during that year  which vested immediately with no forfeiture provisions  rather than amortization over the four quarters of the service period  a  increase in cash compensation expense resulting from an increase in the number of employees  a  increase in reserve report expenses  a  increase in fees paid to our outside directors  and the following expenses  which occurred in fiscal but did not occur in the prior year period  in contracted professional services fees related to management s assessment of the company s internal controls over financial reporting required by section a of the sarbanes oxley act of   in marketing expenses   in expense for directors and officers insurance  and   in corporate fees related to the company s annual shareholders meeting 
these increases were partially offset by a  decrease in legal fees due to non recurrence of the preparation of documents and filings related to a private placement of shares of the company s common stock in december and the transacting of the march debt issue 
depreciation  depletion and amortization dd a increased to  in fiscal from  in fiscal primarily due to an  or  increase in capital expenditures in fiscal related to the acquisition and development of oil and gas properties

table of contents interest expense  including amortization of loan discount increased to  in fiscal from  in fiscal primarily due to an increase in debt before discounts to  at june  from  at june  this increase resulted from the repayment of a  note held by tauren on february  from the proceeds of a december equity offering  and the retirement of  of indebtedness held by petro capital v 
lp on march  via the borrowing of  pursuant to the aforementioned wells fargo credit facility s senior convertible term loan  subsequent draws of approximately  on a related revolving line of credit  and the borrowing of  under the terms of the may  subordinated note 
the weighted average debt balance before discounts for fiscal was  as compared to  in fiscal the credit facility with wells fargo also resulted in a loan discount being recorded 
the discount is being amortized over the original three year term of the debt as additional interest expense with  being recorded in fiscal as compared to  in fiscal such increases were somewhat offset by the capitalization of interest expense to the full cost pool for oil and gas properties of  in fiscal as compared to zero in fiscal loss on extinguishment of debt was in fiscal as compared to  in fiscal due to there being no retirement of debt in fiscal on march   the senior debt held by petro capital was retired with proceeds from the credit facility with wells fargo 
in connection with this retirement  the company recorded a loss on extinguishment of debt in the amount of  in fiscal such amount included the write off of deferred loan costs  and the write off of the remaining loan discount 
liquidity and capital resources overview the company s primary resource is its oil and gas reserves 
the company has entered into a senior credit facility  but the company will be required to make significant repayments of amounts borrowed by november   as a result of a re determination in the borrowing base on the revolving credit facility  primarily due to lower commodity prices 
on march   cubic entered into a credit agreement with wells fargo providing for the credit facility  which consists of a convertible term loan of  and a revolving credit facility of  in order to fund the drilling and completion of new wells 
on may   the company issued a subordinated promissory note in the amount of  to diversified dynamics corporation see notes to financial statements note e long term debt elsewhere herein 
on june   we received a letter from wells fargo energy capital  inc the lender informing the us that the lender has made a redetermination of the borrowing base  which reduced the borrowing base from million to million  requiring a payment of million from the company to the lender 
through waiver  the lender originally extended the date for the payment until september  this date has been extended to november  and we have the right to pay the deficiency in five monthly installments as provided in our credit agreement with the lender 
if the company is not successful in renegotiating this agreement the lender can foreclose on our assets 
the company is working closely with the lender to assist in avoidance of such actions 
product prices  over which we have no control  have a significant impact on revenues from production and the value of such reserves and thereby on the company s borrowing capacity in the event the company determines to borrow additional funds 
within the confines of product pricing  the company must be able to find and develop or acquire oil and gas reserves in a cost effective manner in order to generate sufficient financial resources through internal means to complete the financing of its capital expenditure program 

table of contents during the twelve months ended june   the company used cash flows from operating activities of  as compared to  in fiscal cash flow from operations is dependent on our ability to increase production through our development and exploratory activities and the price received for oil and natural gas 
working capital and cash flow the company s working capital decreased to  at june  from  at june  this decrease was primarily due to  of debt scheduled to mature on march and april  becoming a part of current liabilities during the quarter ended march  and year ended june  the downturn in the price for natural gas lowered revenue this reclassification was partially offset by cash flows provided by financing activities of  resulting from  of proceeds from the issuance of common stock as a result of the exercise of warrants  and the borrowing of  on the aforementioned revolving line of credit with wells fargo in fiscal the company anticipates the following capital expenditures in the remainder of fiscal re completions of up to four wells in its johnson branch acreage  the acquisition of additional leaseholds in and around its core acreage position  final payments that may be outstanding as a result of the acquisition of rights of way in certain of our leases  and the election to participate in certain horizontal haynesville shale wells operated by an unrelated third party  which began production during the year ending june  as a result  our projected capital expenditures are expected to be in a range of approximately  to  for fiscal any significant capital expenditures will depend on obtaining additional funds and restructuring our current indebtedness 
due to the significant downturn in the price of natural gas  continued prudence will be exercised in the undertaking of any new operations during the near term 
no assurance can be given that all or any of these anticipated projects will be completed as currently anticipated 
while the company is negotiating with wells fargo to expand its revolving note and extend the maturity date  we currently have very little cash on hand and our ability to continue to meet our obligations and fund the projected capital expenditure at this time is not certain for fiscal additionally  because future cash flows and the availability of borrowings are subject to a number of variables  such as prevailing prices of oil and gas  actual production from existing and newly completed wells  the company s success in developing and producing new reserves  and the uncertainty with respect to the amount of funds which may ultimately be required to finance the company s development and exploration program  there can be no assurance that the company s capital resources will be sufficient to sustain the company s development and exploration activities 
the company s working capital decreased to  at june  from  at june   primarily due to capital expenditures of  related to the drilling and completion of new wells and the aforementioned  use of cash from operating activities in fiscal these uses of cash were somewhat offset by the borrowing of  on the aforementioned revolving line of credit with wells fargo  the borrowing of  under the aforementioned subordinated promissory note issued to diversified dynamics corporation and  in proceeds from the issuance of stock  resulting from the exercise of warrants  during fiscal capital expenditures the majority of our oil and gas reserves are undeveloped 
as such  recovery of the company s future undeveloped proved reserves will require significant capital expenditures 
our management estimates that aggregate capital expenditures ranging from a minimum of approximately  from currently available funds and projected cash from operating activities to a maximum of approximately  subject to the availability of additional financing will be made to further develop these reserves during fiscal moreover  additional capital expenditures may be required for exploratory drilling on our 
table of contents undeveloped acreage 
the company may increase its planned activities for fiscal if product prices improve and if we are able to obtain the additional capital resources necessary to finance such activities 
however  to the extent that i we are not able to renegotiate our revolving note with wells fargo  ii we are not able to raise additional capital  or iii drilling rigs  drill pipe and other material used in oil and gas drilling and completing are unavailable  our capital expenditures will be restricted 
capital resources the company plans to fund its development and exploratory activities through cash on hand which was approximately  as of the date of this filing  cash provided from operations  the potential exercises of warrants for cash  and one of  or a combination of  the following potential transactions a private placement of common stock  a public offering of common stock  a joint venture with a more well financed industry partner in which we would farm out a to be determined percentage of our working interests in certain properties  or a disposition of assets 
while we expect production from the wells drilled and completed in fiscal   and subsequent to the end of fiscal to provide cash flow to support additional drilling in fiscal  the company cannot be certain that adequate funds will be available from cash on hand  operating cash flow  the exercise of warrants  and the aforementioned potential transactions to fully fund the projected capital expenditures for fiscal additionally  because future cash flows  the availability of borrowings  and the ability to consummate the aforementioned potential transactions are subject to a number of variables  such as prevailing prices of oil and gas  actual production from existing and newly completed wells  the company s success in developing and producing new reserves  the uncertainty of financial markets and joint venture and merger and acquisition activity  and the uncertainty with respect to the amount of funds which may ultimately be required to finance the company s development and exploration program  there can be no assurance that the company s capital resources will be sufficient to sustain the company s development and exploratory activities 
although the company believes it will be able to obtain funds pursuant to the above mentioned alternatives  management cannot be assured that such capital resources will be available to the company 
if we are unable to obtain such capital resources on a timely basis  the company may curtail its planned development and exploratory activities 
critical accounting policies the preparation of our financial statements requires us to make a number of estimates and assumptions relating to the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the period 
when alternatives exist among various accounting methods  the choice of accounting method can have a significant impact on reported amounts 
the following is a discussion of our accounting estimates and judgments that management believes are most significant in its application of generally accepted accounting principles used in the preparation of the financial statements 
impairment of long lived assets and long lived assets to be disposed of the company has adopted the provisions of the financial accounting standards board s the fasb statement of financial accounting standards fas no 
fas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  effective for periods beginning july   and thereafter 
fas no 
replaces fas no 
 and  among other matters  addresses financial accounting and reporting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
fas no 
retains the basic provisions of fas no 
 but broadens its scope and establishes a single model for long lived assets to be disposed of by sale 
in addition  the company is subject to the rules of the securities and exchange commission with respect to 
table of contents impairment of oil and gas properties accounted for under the full cost method of accounting  as described below 
full cost method of accounting for oil and gas properties the company has adopted the full cost method of accounting for oil and gas properties 
management believes adoption of the full cost method more accurately reflects management s exploration objectives and results by including all costs incurred as integral for the acquisition  discovery and development of whatever reserves ultimately result from its efforts as a whole 
under the full cost method of accounting  all costs associated with acquisition  exploration and development of oil and gas reserves  including such costs as leasehold acquisition costs  interest costs related to exploratory and development activities  and directly related overhead costs  are capitalized into the full cost pool 
all capitalized costs of oil and gas properties  including the estimated future costs to develop proved reserves  are amortized on the unit of production method using estimates of proved reserves 
investments in unproved properties and major development projects are not amortized until proved reserves associated with the projects can be determined or until impairment occurs 
if the results of an assessment indicate that the properties are impaired  the amount of the impairment is added to the capitalized costs to be amortized 
in addition  the capitalized costs are subject to a full cost ceiling test  which generally limits such costs to the aggregate of the estimated present value discounted at a percent interest rate of future net revenues from proved reserves  based on current economic and operating conditions  plus the lower of cost or fair market value of unproved properties 
sales of proved and unproved properties are accounted for as adjustments of capitalized costs with no gain or loss recognized  unless such adjustments would significantly alter the relationship between capitalized costs and proved reserves of oil and gas  in which case the gain or loss is recognized in income 
oil and gas revenues the company recognizes oil and gas revenues when oil and gas production is sold to a purchaser at a fixed or determinable price  when delivery has occurred and title has transferred  and if collectability of the revenue is probable 
delivery occurs and title is transferred when production has been delivered to a purchaser s pipeline or truck 
as a result of the numerous requirements necessary to gather information from purchasers or various measurement locations  calculate volumes produced  perform field and wellhead allocations and distribute and disburse funds to various working interest partners and royalty owners  the collection of revenues from oil and gas production may take up to days following the month of production 
therefore  we make accruals for revenues and accounts receivable based on estimates of our share of production 
since the settlement process may take to days following the month of actual production  our financial results include estimates of production and revenues for the related time period 
we record any differences  which historically have not been significant  between the actual amounts ultimately received and the original estimates in the period they become finalized 
differences between sales and production volumes during the years ended june   and were not significant 
use of estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes 
actual results could differ from those estimates 

table of contents certain significant estimates management s estimates of oil and gas reserves are based on various assumptions  including constant oil and gas prices 
it is reasonably possible that a future event in the near term could cause the estimates to change and such changes could have a severe impact 
actual future production  cash flows  taxes  operating expenses  development expenditures and quantities of recoverable oil and gas reserves may vary substantially from those assumed in the estimates 
the accuracy of any reserve estimate is a function of the quality of available data  engineering and geological interpretation  and judgment 
subsequent evaluation of the same reserves based upon production history will result in variations  which may be substantial  in the estimated reserves 
while it is at least reasonably possible that the estimates above will change materially in the near term  no estimate can be made of the range of possible changes that might occur 
stock based compensation the company accounts for its stock based employee compensation plans pursuant to fas no 
r  share based payment  which is a revision of fas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  and supersedes accounting principles board apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees apb no 

this fas requires the company to recognize compensation costs related to stock based payment transactions ie  the granting of stock options and warrants  and awards of unregistered shares of common stock in the financial statements 
with limited exceptions  the amount of compensation is measured based on the grant date fair value of the equity issued 
compensation cost is recognized over the period that an employee provides services in exchange for the award 
this new standard became effective for awards that are granted  modified or settled in cash in interim and annual financial periods beginning after june  subsequent events in may  the fasb issued sfas no 
subsequent events sfas 
sfas establishes general standards of accounting for and disclosure of events that occur after the balance sheet date but before financial statements are issued or are available to be issued 
sfas sets forth the period after the balance sheet date during which management of a reporting entity should evaluate events or transactions that may occur for potential recognition or disclosure in the financial statements  the circumstances under which an entity should recognize events or transactions occurring after the balance sheet date in its financial statements and the disclosures that an entity should make about events or transactions that occurred after the balance sheet date 
sfas is effective for interim or annual financial periods ending after june  the adoption of this statement did not have a material effect on the company s financial statements 
other accounting policies and recent accounting pronouncements please see notes to financial statements note b significant accounting policies elsewhere herein 
inflation although the level of inflation affects certain of the company s costs and expenses  inflation did not have a significant effect on the company s results of operations during fiscal related party transactions a description of our related party transactions is included in note f related party transactions in the notes to the financial statements of the company included elsewhere in this report  and is incorporated herein by reference

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk commodity price risk we are subject to price fluctuations for natural gas and crude oil 
prices received for natural gas sold on the spot market are volatile due primarily to seasonality of demand and other factors beyond our control 
reductions in crude oil  natural gas and natural gas liquids prices could have a material adverse effect on our financial position  results of operations and quantities of reserves recoverable on an economic basis 
any reduction in reserves  including reductions due to price fluctuations  can adversely affect our liquidity and our ability to obtain capital for our acquisition and development activities 
to date  we have not entered into futures contracts or other hedging agreements to manage the commodity price risk for a portion of our production 
interest rate risk as of june   we had  of long term debt outstanding under our credit facility and the subordinated note  each of which matures in fiscal and bears interest at the prime rate plus 
as a result  our interest costs fluctuate based on short term interest rates
