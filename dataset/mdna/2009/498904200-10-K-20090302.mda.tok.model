item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations provides an account of our financial performance and financial condition that should be read in conjunction with the accompanying audited consolidated financial statements 
overview we are a designer and manufacturer of furnishings  textiles and fine leathers for the workplace and home 
our commitment to innovation and modern design has yielded a comprehensive portfolio of products and a brand recognized for high quality and a sophisticated image 
our products are targeted at the middle to upper end of the market and are sold primarily in north america through a direct sales force and a broad network of independent dealers 
our business structure and operating approach have resulted in industry leading operating income margins among our primary publicly held competitors 
we operate under a management philosophy that incorporates a collaborative culture  client driven processes and a lean  agile operating structure 
our employees are performance driven and motivated by a variable incentive compensation system and broad based equity ownership in the company 
this operating philosophy has enabled us to achieve strong financial performance 
historically  the majority of our revenues were derived from sales of office systems in north america 
however  we believe our strategy to diversify our sources of revenue away from a primary dependence on north america office systems will enable us to better maintain and grow our sales and profitability during both ups and downs in the industry 
in  despite a challenging macroeconomic environment  we were able to grow our full year sales by to billion  versus a decline in our industry as reported by our trade association  the business and institutional furniture manufacturer s association bifma 
in  we reported diluted earnings per share of  a increase from per share in net income in grew to million 
our specialty and complimentary businesses drove our sales growth in  including a benefit from sales generated by edelman leather  which we acquired in october in  we also benefited from our knollstudio business  which grew in  and our international businesses  which grew to the largest portion of our revenues in the history of the company 
international sales grew from million in to million in despite the success that our diversification strategy has created  we are experiencing unprecedented world wide economic instability that has and will continue to affect our industry 
bifma estimates that our industry will experience an decline in accordingly  during we took actions to reduce our fixed costs in order to stay competitive in the current economic environment 
on april   we announced a restructuring plan totaling million of expenses related to job eliminations and the discontinuation of a product line 
these actions are expected to save the company approximately million dollars annually 
during the fourth quarter of additional job eliminations were announced in order to further reduce our fixed costs 
for the fourth quarter of restructuring charges of million were incurred and we estimate this will generate million in annual savings 
we expect many challenges in  but we believe we are better positioned than ever to face them 
we are very excited about our new product pipeline and will continue to push our growth internationally and our focus on our high design  high margin specialty businesses 
we will also continue to relentlessly manage our operating costs and focus on our profitability 
despite significant problems in the us credit markets  our liquidity remains strong 
we have million in cash at year end and another million remaining available under our million revolving credit facility  which is not scheduled to expire until

liquidity and capital resources the following table highlights certain key cash flows and capital information pertinent to the discussion that follows in thousands cash provided by operating activities capital expenditures net cash used in investing activities purchase of common stock net proceeds from repayment of debt payment of dividends net proceeds from issuance of stock net cash used for financing activities historically  we have carried significant amounts of debt  and cash generated by operating activities has been used to fund working capital  capital expenditures  repurchase shares and scheduled payments of principal and interest under our debt 
our capital expenditures are typically for new product tooling and manufacturing equipment 
these capital expenditures support new products and continuous improvements in our manufacturing processes 

table of contents during the first half  we implemented our million discretionary stock repurchase program and began using cash generated by operating activities to buy back shares 
on february   our board of directors approved a million increase to this discretionary stock repurchase program 
as of december   we had remaining authority under this discretionary stock repurchase program to spend approximately million 
we use our revolving credit facility in the ordinary course of business to fund our working capital needs  and at times make significant borrowings and repayments under the revolving facility depending on our cash needs and availability at such time 
net cash provided by operating activities was million in  million in and million in for the year ended december   net cash provided by operating activities consisted of million from net income plus non cash amortizations  plus million of favorable changes in working capital 
for the year ended december   net cash provided by operating activities consisted of million from net income plus non cash amortization  minus million of unfavorable changes in working capital 
for the year ended december   we used available cash  including the million of net cash from operating activities and million of proceeds from the issuance of common stock  to repay million of debt  fund million in capital expenditures  repurchase million of common stock for treasury  fund dividend payments to shareholders totaling million  and to fund working capital 
in  we used available cash  including the million of net cash from operating activities  million of proceeds from the issuance of common stock  and million of net borrowings  to fund million in capital expenditures  repurchase million of common stock for treasury  fund dividend payments to shareholders totaling million  and fund working capital 
in addition  on october   we completed the acquisition of teddy arthur edelman  limited 
cash expenditures for the transaction totaled million  net of cash acquired 
cash from financing activities in also included the payment of fees on the refinanced credit facility 
we are currently in compliance with all of the covenants and conditions under our revolving credit facility 
we believe that existing cash balances and internally generated cash flows  together with borrowings available under our revolving credit facility  will be sufficient to fund normal working capital needs  capital spending requirements  debt service requirements and dividend payments for at least the next twelve months 
in addition  we believe that we will have adequate funds available to meet long term cash requirements and that we will be able to comply with the covenants under the credit agreement 
future principal debt payments may be paid out of cash flows from operations  from future refinancing of our debt or from equity issuances 
however  our ability to make scheduled payments of principal  to pay interest on or to refinance our indebtedness  to satisfy our other debt obligations and to pay dividends to stockholders will depend upon our future operating performance  which will be affected by general economic  financial  competitive  legislative  regulatory  business and other factors beyond our control 
contractual obligations the following summarizes our fixed long term contractual cash obligations as of december  in thousands payments due by period less than year to years to years more than years total long term debt operating leases purchase commitments pension plan contributions postretirement benefit plan obligations total 
table of contents contractual obligations for long term debt include principal and interest payments 
interest has been included at either the fixed rate or the variable rate in effect as of december   as applicable 
environmental matters our past and present business operations and our past and present ownership and operation of manufacturing plants on real property are subject to extensive and changing federal  state  local and foreign environmental laws and regulations  including those relating to discharges to air  water and land  the handling and disposal of solid and hazardous waste and the clean up of properties affected by hazardous substances 
as a result  we are involved from time to time in administrative and judicial proceedings and inquiries relating to environmental matters and could become subject to fines or penalties related thereto 
we cannot predict what environmental legislation or regulations will be enacted in the future  how existing or future laws or regulations will be administered or interpreted or what environmental conditions may be found to exist 
compliance with more stringent laws or regulations  or stricter interpretation of existing laws  may require additional expenditures by us  some of which may be material 
we have been identified as a potentially responsible party pursuant to the comprehensive environmental response  compensation and liability act of cercla for remediation costs associated with waste disposal sites that we previously used 
the remediation costs and our allocated share at some of these cercla sites are unknown 
we may also be subject to claims for personal injury or contribution relating to cercla sites 
we reserve amounts for such matters when expenditures are probable and reasonably estimable 
off balance sheet arrangements we do not currently have any material relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships  such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities  which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes 
in addition  we do not engage in trading activities involving non exchange traded contracts 
as a result  we are not materially exposed to any financing  liquidity  market or credit risk that could arise if we had engaged in these relationships 
section of the sarbanes oxley act of beginning in late  we began a process to document and evaluate our internal controls over financial reporting in order to satisfy the requirements of section of the sarbanes oxley act of and the related regulations  which require annual management assessments of the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting and a report by our independent auditors on the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting 
in this regard  management has dedicated internal resources  engaged outside consultants and adopted and implemented a detailed work plan to i assess and document the adequacy of internal controls over financial reporting  ii take steps to improve control processes  where appropriate  iii validate through testing that controls are functioning as documented and iv implement a continuous reporting and improvement process for internal control over financial reporting 
our efforts to comply with section of the sarbanes oxley act of and the related regulations regarding our assessment of our internal controls over financial reporting have resulted  and are likely to continue to result  in increased expenses 
management and our audit committee have given our compliance with section the highest priority 
we cannot  however  be certain that these measures will ensure that we implement and maintain adequate controls over our financial processes and reporting in the future 
any failure to implement required new or improved controls  or difficulties encountered in their implementation  could harm our operating results or cause us to fail to meet our reporting obligations 
if we fail to correct any issues in the design or operating effectiveness of internal controls over financial reporting or fail to prevent fraud  current and potential stockholders could lose confidence in our financial reporting  which could harm our business and the trading price of our common stock 

table of contents forward looking statements this annual report on form k contains forward looking statements  principally in the sections entitled quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  risk factors and business 
statements and financial discussion and analysis contained in this annual report on form k that are not historical facts are forward looking statements 
these statements discuss goals  intentions and expectations as to future trends  plans  events  results of operations or financial condition  or state other information relating to us  based on our current beliefs as well as assumptions made by us and information currently available to us 
forward looking statements generally will be accompanied by words such as anticipate  believe  could  estimate  expect  forecast  intend  may  possible  potential  predict  project  or other similar words  phrases or expressions 
although we believe these forward looking statements are reasonable  they are based upon a number of assumptions concerning future conditions  any or all of which may ultimately prove to be inaccurate 
important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the forward looking statements include  without limitation the risks described under item a and in item a of this annual report on form k  changes in the economy or financial stability of our clients resulting in decreased corporate spending and service sector employment  changes in relationships with clients  the mix of products sold and of clients purchasing our products  the success of new technology initiatives  changes in business strategies and decisions  competition from our competitors  our ability to recruit and retain an experienced management team  changes in raw material prices and availability  restrictions on government spending resulting in fewer sales to one of our largest customers  our debt restrictions on spending  our ability to protect our patents  copyrights and trademarks  our reliance on furniture dealers to produce sales  lawsuits arising from patents  copyrights and trademark infringements  violations of environment laws and regulations  potential labor disruptions  the financial strength and stability of our suppliers  customers and dealers  adequacy of our insurance policies  the availability of future capital  and currency rate fluctuations 
the factors identified above are believed to be important factors but not necessarily all of the important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed in any forward looking statement 
unpredictable or unknown factors could also have material adverse effects on us 
all forward looking statements included in this annual report on form k are expressly qualified in their entirety by the foregoing cautionary statements 
except as required under the federal securities laws and the rules and regulations of the securities and exchange commission  we undertake no obligation to update  amend  or clarify forward looking statements  whether as a result of new information  future events  or otherwise 
critical accounting policies the preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the us gaap requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of certain assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and the disclosure of certain contingent assets and liabilities 
actual results may differ from such estimates 
we believe that the critical accounting policies that follow are those policies that require the most judgment  estimation and assumption in preparing our consolidated financial statements 
allowance for doubtful accounts we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our clients and dealers to make required payments 
the allowance is determined through an analysis of the aging of accounts receivable and assessments of risk that are based on historical trends and an evaluation of the impact of current and projected economic conditions 
we evaluate the past due status of our trade receivables based on contractual terms of sale 
if the financial condition of our clients and dealers were to deteriorate  additional allowances may be required 
accounts receivable are charged off against the allowance for doubtful accounts when we determine that recovery is unlikely 
inventory inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market 
cost is determined using the first in  first out method 
we write down inventory that  in our judgment  is impaired or obsolete 
obsolescence may be caused by the 
table of contents discontinuance of a product line  changes in product material specifications  replacement products in the marketplace and other competitive influences 
goodwill and other intangible assets intangible assets consist of goodwill  trademarks and deferred financing fees 
goodwill is recorded at the amount by which cost exceeds the net assets of acquired businesses  and all other intangible assets are recorded at cost 
goodwill and other intangible assets are tested for impairment annually unless indicators of impairment exist 
on december   we purchased certain intangibles as an investment in our seating line 
a definite useful life was assigned to these intangibles and  as such  amortization will be recorded over the economic life of the intangibles in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards goodwill and other intangible assets 
on october   in combination with the acquisition of teddy arthur edelman  limited  we acquired certain intangible assets related to a trade name  non compete agreement and customer relationships 
the trade name was valued at million and it will be tested annually for impairment 
the non compete agreement and customer relationships intangibles were valued at million and million  respectively 
these were assigned definite useful lives and  as such  amortization will be recorded over the economic life of the intangibles in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards goodwill and other intangible assets 
financing costs that are incurred by us in connection with the issuance of debt are deferred and amortized to interest expense over the life of the underlying indebtedness 
the period of these costs may be shortened if the underlying indebtedness is modified or retired 
product warranty we provide for the estimated cost of product warranties at the time revenue is recognized 
while we engage in product quality programs and processes  our warranty obligation is affected by product failure rates and by material usage and service costs incurred in correcting a product failure 
cost estimates are based on historical product failure rates and identified one time fixes for each specific product category 
warranty cost generally varies in direct relation to sales volume  as such costs tend to be a consistent percentage of revenue 
should actual costs differ from original estimates  revisions to the estimated warranty liability would be required 
employee benefits we are partially self insured for our employee health benefits 
we accrue for employee health benefit obligations based on an actuarial valuation 
the actuarial valuation is based upon historical claims as well as a number of assumptions  including rates of inflation for medical costs  and benefit plan changes 
actual results could be materially different from the estimates used 
pension and other postretirement benefits we sponsor two defined benefit pension plans and two other postretirement benefit plans that cover substantially all of our us employees 
several statistical and other factors  which attempt to anticipate future events  are used in calculating the expense and liability related to the plans 
key factors include assumptions about the expected rates of return on plan assets  discount rates  and health care cost trend rates  as determined by us  within certain guidelines 
we consider market conditions  including changes in investment returns and interest rates  in making these assumptions 
we determine the expected long term rate of return on plan assets based on aggregating the expected rates of return for each component of the plan s asset mix 
we use historic plan asset returns combined with current market conditions to estimate the rate of return 
the expected rate of return on plan assets is a long term 
table of contents assumption and generally does not change annually 
the discount rate reflects the market rate for high quality fixed income debt instruments as of our annual measurement date and is subject to change each year 
holding all other assumptions constant  a one percentage point increase or decrease in the assumed rate of return on plan assets would decrease or increase net periodic pension expense by approximately million 
likewise  a one percentage point increase or decrease in the discount rate would decrease or increase net periodic pension expense by approximately million or million  respectively 
unrecognized actuarial gains and losses are recognized over the expected remaining service life of the employee group 
unrecognized actuarial gains and losses arise from several factors  including experience and assumption changes with respect to the obligations and from the difference between expected returns and actual returns on plan assets 
these unrecognized gain and losses are systematically recognized as a change in future net periodic pension expense in accordance with fasb statement no 
 employers accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans an amendment of fasb no 
   and r sfas 
key assumptions we use in determining the amount of the obligation and expense recorded for postretirement benefits other than pensions opeb  under fasb statement no 
 employers accounting for postretirement benefits other than pensions  include the assumed discount rate and the assumed rate of increases in future health care costs 
the discount rate we use to determine the obligation for these benefits matches the discount rate used in determining our pension obligations in each year presented 
in estimating the health care cost trend rate  we consider actual health care cost experience  future benefit structures  industry trends and advice from our actuaries 
we assume that the relative increase in health care costs will generally trend downward over the next several years  reflecting assumed increases in efficiency in the health care system and industry wide cost containment initiatives 
at december   the expected rate of increase in future health care costs was in determining the benefit obligation for and in determining the net periodic benefit cost for the rate was then assumed to decrease per year to an ultimate rate of for and thereafter for the benefit obligation 
increasing the assumed health care cost trend by one percentage point in each year would increase the benefit obligation as of december   by million and increase the aggregate of the service and interest cost components of net periodic benefit cost for by approximately million 
decreasing the assumed health care cost trend rate by one percentage point in each year would decrease the benefit obligation as of december  by approximately million and decrease the aggregate of the service and interest cost components of net periodic benefit cost for by approximately million 
in accordance with sfas  we recognized in our statement of financial position the funded status ie the difference between the fair value of plan assets and the projected benefit obligation of our defined benefit pension and postretirement benefit plans 
to record the unfunded status of our plans we recorded an additional liability and an adjustment to accumulated other comprehensive income  net of tax 
the actuarial assumptions we use in determining our pension and opeb retirement benefits may differ materially from actual results due to changing market and economic conditions  higher or lower withdrawal rates  or longer or shorter life spans of participants 
while we believe that the assumptions used are appropriate  differences in actual experience or changes in assumptions may materially affect our financial position or results of operations 
commitments and contingencies we establish reserves for the estimated cost of environmental and legal contingencies when such expenditures are probable and reasonably estimable 
a significant amount of judgment and use of estimates is required to quantify our ultimate exposure in these matters 
we engage outside experts as deemed necessary or appropriate to assist in the evaluation of exposure 
from time to time  as information becomes available regarding changes in circumstances for ongoing issues as well as information regarding emerging issues  our potential liability is reassessed and reserve balances are adjusted as necessary 
revisions to our estimates of 
table of contents potential liability  and actual expenditures related to environmental and legal contingencies  could have a material impact on our results of operations or financial position 
taxes we account for income taxes in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes sfas no 
 which requires that deferred tax assets and liabilities be recognized using enacted tax rates for the effect of temporary differences between book and tax bases of recorded assets and liabilities 
sfas no 
also requires that deferred tax assets be reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be recognized 
at december   deferred tax liabilities of million exceeded deferred tax assets of million by million 
at december   our deferred tax liabilities of million exceeded deferred tax assets of million by million 
our deferred tax assets at december  and of million and million  respectively  are net of valuation allowances of million and million  respectively 
we have recorded the above valuation allowance primarily for net operating loss carryforwards in foreign tax jurisdictions where we have incurred historical tax losses from operations or acquired tax losses through acquisition  and have determined that it is more likely than not that these deferred tax assets will not be realized 
we evaluate on a quarterly basis the realizability of our deferred tax assets and adjust the amount of the allowance  if necessary 
the factors used to assess the likelihood of realization include our forecast of future taxable income and our assessment of available tax planning strategies that could be implemented to realize the net deferred tax assets 
the company accounts for uncertain tax positions in accordance with fin  accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
accordingly  the company reports a liability for unrecognized tax benefits resulting from uncertain tax positions taken  or expected to be taken  in an income tax return 
the company recognizes interest and penalties  if any  related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax expense 
interest rate swap and cap agreements we account for our interest rate swap and cap agreements in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  as amended sfas 
on may   we entered into four interest rate swap agreements for purposes of managing risk in interest rate fluctuations 
the company has elected to apply hedge accounting under sfas no 
to these agreements 
changes in the fair value of the interest rate swap agreements are recorded in the period the value of the contract changes 
the net amount paid or received upon quarterly settlements will be recorded as an adjustment to interest expense  while the change in fair value is recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income in the equity section of the balance sheet 
our two interest rate cap agreements  which matured on september   were classified as risk management instruments and management elected not to apply hedge accounting 
changes in the fair value of the contracts were reported in earnings in the period the value of the contract changed as a component of other income expense

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk during the normal course of business  we are routinely subjected to market risk associated with interest rate movements and foreign currency exchange rate movements 
interest rate risk arises from our debt obligations and related interest rate hedge agreements 
foreign currency exchange rate risk arises from our non us operations and purchases of inventory from foreign suppliers 
we have risk in our exposure to certain material and transportation costs 
steel  leather  wood products and plastics are all used in the manufacture of our products
