item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations business description and overview the company is a leading manufacturer and marketer of products incorporating liquid flow measurement and control technologies  developed both internally and in conjunction with other technology companies 
its products are used in a wide variety of applications to measure and control the flow of liquids  but primarily water 
the company s product lines fall into two general categories  utility and industrial 
the utility category is comprised of two primary product lines residential and commercial water meters that are used by water utilities as the basis for generating water and wastewater revenues 
the market for these product lines is north america  primarily the united states  because these meters are designed and manufactured to conform to standards promulgated by the american water works association 
the utility flow measurement products constitute a majority of the company s sales 
industrial product line sales comprise the remainder of the company s sales and include precision valves  electromagnetic inductive flow meters  impeller flow meters  and turbine and positive displacement industrial flow meters 
rounding out the industrial product line are automotive fluid meters used for the measurement of various types of automotive fluids 
residential and commercial water meters have generally been classified as either manually read meters or remotely read meters via radio technology 
a meter that is manually read consists of the water meter and a register that gives a visual display of the meter reading 
meters equipped with radio transmitters convert the mechanical measurement to a digital format which is then transmitted via radio frequency to a receiver that collects and formats the data appropriately for a water utility s billing computer 
drive by systems are referred to as automatic meter reading amr systems and have been the primary technology deployed by water utilities over the past decade  providing cost effective and accurate billing data 
in a drive by amr system  a vehicle equipped for meter reading purposes  including a radio receiver and computer  collects meter reading data 
of growing interest to water utilities are fixed network advanced metering infrastructure ami systems 
these systems do not rely on a drive by data collector  but rather incorporate a network of permanent radio receivers or data collectors that are always active or listening to the radio transmission from the utility s meters 
not only do fixed network systems eliminate the need for meter readers  but they have the ability to provide the utility with more frequent and diverse data at specified intervals 
the company s response to these market requirements is detailed further in the business trends section 
the company s net sales and corresponding net earnings depend on unit volume and mix of products  with the company generally earning higher margins on meters equipped with amr or ami technology 
in addition to selling its proprietary amr ami products including the orion drive by amr technology and the galaxy fixed network ami system  the company also remarkets the itron drive by amr product under a license and distribution agreement 
the company s proprietary amr ami products generally result in higher margins than the non proprietary amr ami products that the company remarkets 
the company also sells registers and radios separately to customers who wish to perform a field upgrade of their existing meters 
one distinctive advantage of the orion amr technology is that while it is fundamentally a drive by amr system  the proprietary receiver technology of orion has been licensed to other technology providers  including those providing amr ami products that communicate over power lines  broadband networks  and proprietary radio frequency networks 
in addition  the company produces a universal gateway receiver for orion that enables orion amr data to be transmitted to a utility customer over a variety of public wireless networks 
utility meter and amr ami product sales are generally derived from the water meter replacement requirements of customers  along with their plans for adoption and deployment of new technology 
to a much lesser extent  housing starts also contribute to the base of new product sales 
over the last decade there has been a growing trend in the conversion to amr ami from manually read water meters 
this conversion rate is accelerating and contributing to an increased base of business available to meter and amr ami producers 
it is currently estimated that less than of water meters installed in the united states have been converted to amr ami systems 
badger meter s strategy is to fulfill customers metering expectations and requirements with its proprietary meter reading systems or other systems available through its alliance partners in the marketplace 
the industrial products generally serve a variety of niche flow measurement applications across a broad range of industries 
for instance  the impeller product line is widely used in irrigation  hvac and fire prevention equipment 
some of the flow measurement technologies used for industrial applications have been derived from utility meter technologies  such as positive displacement and turbine flow measurement 
other technologies are very specific to industrial applications 
in addition  a growing requirement is for industrial meters to be equipped with specialized communication protocols that control the entire flow measurement process 
serving both the utility and industrial flow measurement market enables the company to use its wide variety of technology for specific flow measurement and control applications  as well as to utilize existing capacity and spread fixed costs over a larger sales base 
business trends ami is the growing standard of technology deployment in the electric utility industry 
ami provides an electric utility with two way communication to monitor and control electrical devices at the customer s site 
ami deployments are fixed network technologies 
although the company does not participate in the electric market  the trend toward ami is now affecting the markets the company does participate in  namely water and gas utility markets 
specifically  in the water industry  fixed network ami enables the water utility to capture interval readings from each meter on a daily basis 
while two way communication is limited in water fixed network ami  utilities are contemplating how two way networks could benefit them 
as noted above  the company markets the orion drive by amr product line as well as the galaxy fixed network ami product line 
the company is positioned to sell either product in responding to customer requirements 
since both products have comparable margins  any acceleration or slowdown in this trend is not expected to have a significant impact on the company 
although there is growing interest in fixed network communication by water utilities  the vast majority of utilities currently installing amr ami continue to select drive by amr technologies for their applications 
the company s orion technology has experienced rapid acceptance in the united states 
by the end of  more than  water utilities had selected orion as their amr solution of choice 
there are approximately  water utilities in the united states and the company estimates that less than of them have converted to an amr or ami technology 
it is anticipated that even with growing interest in fixed network ami  drive by amr will continue to be the primary product of choice by water utilities for a number of years 
drive by amr technology is simply the most cost effective form of amr currently available to water utilities 
revenue and product mix prior to the company s introduction of its own proprietary orion products  itron water utility related products were a dominant amr contributor to the company s results 
itron products are sold under an agreement between the company and itron  inc that was recently extended to early the company s orion products directly compete with itron water amr products and  in recent years  many of the company s customers have selected orion products 
in  orion sales increased while itron licensed product sales increased compared to for the year  orion sales were times greater than those of the itron licensed products 
the company expects this relationship to continue and expects that the itron products will remain a significant component of utility sales 
the increases in both product lines underscores the continued acceptance of the amr technology by water utilities and affirms the company s strategy of selling itron products in addition to its own proprietary products 
as the industry continues to evolve  there may be additional opportunities for revenue enhancement 
for instance  in recent years the company has been asked to oversee and perform installation of its products in the field for a limited number of customers 
this is usually accomplished by the company assuming the role of the general contractor  hiring a subcontractor and supervising their work 
in  revenues for these types of services totaled approximately million compared to million in  with most of the increase coming from the installation work for the city of chicago during the company also sells certain extended warranty programs for the technology sold with meters 
the extended warranties provide additional services beyond the one year standard warranty 
revenues for these services are not yet significant 
the company has also begun to sell the orion technology to natural gas utilities for installation on their gas meters 
in  sales of these products totaled million  an increase over sales of million 
at this time  it is uncertain as to the extent of growth for these other types of products and services on future periods 
discontinued operations during  the company carefully evaluated strategic alternatives for its subsidiaries in nancy  france  including restructuring  sale or shutdown 
in the third quarter of  the company began the process under french law to obtain the requisite governmental and regulatory approvals to close the operation 
on october   the decision was finalized 
from that date through  all assets and liabilities were liquidated resulting in total after tax charges of million  of which million of charges  net of the income tax benefit  were recognized in all results associated with the company s french operations during and have been removed from continuing operations and are presented as results of discontinued operations 
see note discontinued operations in the notes to consolidated financial statements in part ii  item of this annual report on form k 
all remaining comments in this section relate to continuing operations 
results of operations net sales badger meter s net sales increased in to million from million in the increase was the net result of higher utility sales  partially offset by lower sales of industrial products 
residential and commercial water meter and related technology sales represented of total net sales in compared to in these sales increased to million  a increase over sales in of million 
this increase was driven by increased volumes in amr ami sales 
sales of the company s orion amr technology increased over from levels and its sales were times greater than the itron related products  which saw a increase from levels 
commercial meter sales increased over due to both volume and price increases 
offsetting these increases was a decline in local read meters 
industrial sales are affected by economic conditions  domestically and internationally  in each of the markets served by the company s various product lines 
these sales declined to million in from million in due to volume declines caused by the economic climate 
with the exception of the precision valve products  sales for the company s industrial products declined in international sales for utility products are generally to customers in canada and mexico  which use similar mechanical technology for the water meter itself 
international sales for the industrial products are comprised primarily of sales of small valves  electromagnetic meters and automotive fluid meters in europe  sales of electromagnetic meters with water meters and related technologies in latin america  and sales of valves and other metering products throughout the world 
in europe  sales are made primarily in euros 
other international sales are made in us dollars or local currencies 
international sales increased to million in from million in due principally to higher sales of industrial products in europe and higher sales into mexico 
badger meter s net sales of million increased million  or  for compared to million for the increase was the result of sales increases in industrial products  while utility sales were approximately the same between years  as further explained below 
residential and commercial water meter net sales represented of total net sales in compared to in these sales of million increased just  in compared to overall volume declines in bronze manual read meters  meters with itron licensed technology and commercial meters were offset by volume increases in plastic meters and in meters with the company s orion amr technology 
in  sales of orion products increased nearly  due mostly to volume increases 
by contrast  sales of itron related products declined nearly due to lower volumes 
industrial product net sales increased in over levels 
in total  the sales of industrial products represented of total net sales in compared to in industrial product net sales increased million to million in compared to million in primarily due to higher sales of automotive fluid products  precision valves and other industrial products 
international sales increased to million in from million in due principally to higher sales of industrial products in europe 
favorable foreign exchange rate changes also contributed to the sales increase  notably the strengthening of the euro against the us dollar 
gross margins gross margins were  and for  and  respectively 
gross margins increased in as a result of increases in amr volumes driven by sales of orion and itron related products as well as price increases put into effect to recover higher cost of materials 
also included in gross margin for was  of pre tax gain associated with the sale of the company s rio rico  arizona facility 
the increase in gross margin in was partially offset by lower industrial sales which generally have higher margins  the mix of amr technologies sold  and higher sales of turnkey or installation projects on which margins are lower for the services provided 
gross margins increased in as a result of increases in amr volumes driven mainly by sales of orion products  as well as price increases put into effect to recover the higher cost of materials 
operating expenses selling  engineering and administration costs increased in compared to and were the result of increased selling costs related to efforts to establish a presence for orion in the natural gas industry  increased costs associated with higher sales volumes  consulting costs associated with sales process enhancements  increased research and development costs  the effects of foreign exchange  and increased intangible amortization related to the acquisition of the north american rights for the galaxy fixed network ami technology in the second quarter of in addition  the company experienced normal inflationary increases  which were somewhat offset by continuing cost containment efforts 
selling  engineering and administration costs increased in compared to as a net result of higher legal fees associated with successfully completed litigation  increased reserves for uncollectible receivables  increased product development costs and normal inflationary pressures  partially offset by continued cost controls 
interest expense interest expense increased slightly in compared to as the result of higher debt levels primarily due to the acquisition of the north american rights for the galaxy fixed network ami technology 
interest expense was approximately the same between and income taxes income taxes as a percentage of earnings from continuing operations before income taxes were  and for  and  respectively 
the decrease in the effective tax rate in and was due to an increase in the us income tax deduction available to manufacturers for qualified production activities section deduction 
earnings and diluted earnings per share from continuing operations as a result of the above mentioned items  earnings from continuing operations were million  million and million in  and  respectively 
on a diluted basis  earnings per share from continuing operations were  and respectively  for the same periods 
liquidity and capital resources the main sources of liquidity for the company are cash from operations and borrowing capacity 
cash provided by operations in was million compared to million in the decrease in cash provided by operations in was due to higher receivable and inventory balances  partially offset by improved earnings 
cash provided by operations in was million compared to million in the increase in cash provided by operations in was due principally to improved earnings 
receivables at december  increased by compared to december   due primarily to higher fourth quarter sales  which increased in compared to the fourth quarter of inventories at december  increased by compared to december   due to the increased sales activity and the timing of inventory purchases 
prepaid expenses and other current assets decreased million between december  and the main reason for the decrease was that the prior year balance included million of remaining book value related to the rio rico  arizona facility that was sold in capital expenditures totaled million in  million in and million in these amounts vary due to the timing of capital expenditures 
included in capital expenditures for and was approximately million and million  respectively  related to the construction of two facilities in mexico and a small addition to the czech republic facility compared to million of construction in for new facilities in mexico and germany 
the company believes it now has capacity to increase production levels with minimal additional capital expenditures 
intangible assets increased to million at december  from million at december  due to the acquisition of the north american rights for the galaxy fixed network ami technology 
long term deferred income tax assets increased to million at december  from million at december  principally due to the tax impact of the increased pension liabilities 
short term debt  the current portion of long term debt and long term debt all vary individually due to the amounts borrowed and the timing of payments 
these accounts totaled million at december   which was an increase from million at december  the debt levels increased primarily because of the acquisition of the galaxy fixed network ami technology in the second quarter of at december   debt represented of the company s total capitalization 
none of the company s debt carries financial covenants or is secured 
the million increase in payables between years was primarily the result of the timing of purchases 
accrued compensation and employee benefits increased million between years due primarily to higher employee incentives 
warranty and after sale costs decreased million to million at december  due to fewer warranty claims as the result of improved manufacturing processes for products introduced in recent years 
other accrued employee benefits increased to million at december  from million at december   primarily due to an increase in the company s pension liability  resulting from the negative return on pension plan assets in common stock and capital in excess of par value both increased during due primarily to the exercise of stock options  stock compensation expense and the tax benefit on stock options 
treasury stock decreased due to shares issued in connection the company s dividend reinvestment program 
accumulated other comprehensive loss increased by million  net of tax  primarily due to changes in the funded status of the company s pension plan and other post employment benefits 
despite the current economic climate  badger meter s financial condition remains strong 
the company believes that its operating cash flows  available borrowing capacity including million of unused credit lines at december   and its ability to raise capital provide adequate resources to fund ongoing operating requirements  future capital expenditures and development of new products 
the company continues to take advantage of its local commercial paper market and carefully monitors the current borrowing market 
the company s principal line of credit is in effect until october  off balance sheet arrangements the company had no off balance sheet arrangements at december  contractual obligations the company guarantees the outstanding debt of its employee savings and stock option plan the essop that is recorded in long term debt  offset by a similar amount of unearned compensation that has been recorded as a reduction of shareholders equity 
the loan amount is secured by shares of the company s common stock 
payments of  and  in and  respectively  reduced the loan to  at december  the terms of the loan allow variable payments of principal with the final principal and interest payment due on april  the following table includes the company s significant contractual obligations as of december  there are no undisclosed guarantees 
payments due by period less than total year years years in thousands current portion and long term debt interest on current portion and long term debt short term debt construction of facilities essop operating leases total contractual obligations other than items included in the preceding table  as of december   the company had no additional material purchase obligations other than those created in the ordinary course of business related to inventory and property  plant and equipment  which generally have terms of less than days 
the company also has long term obligations related to its pension and postretirement plans which are discussed in detail in note employee benefit plans in the notes to consolidated financial statements in part ii  item of this annual report on form k 
as of the most recent actuarial measurement date  a contribution to the pension plan is initially anticipated to be million in due to the reduction in the market value of the underlying investments 
however  this estimate is subject to further calculations prior to the actual payment 
postretirement medical claims are paid by the company as they are submitted  and they are anticipated to be  in based on actuarial estimates  however  these amounts can vary significantly from year to year because the company is self insured 
critical accounting policies and use of estimates the company s accounting policies are more fully described in note summary of significant accounting policies in the notes to consolidated financial statements in part ii  item of this annual report on form k 
as discussed in note  the preparation of financial statements in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes 
the company s more significant estimates relate primarily to the following judgmental reserves allowance for doubtful accounts  reserve for obsolete inventories  warranty and after sale costs reserve  and the health care reserve for claims incurred  as well as claims incurred but not reported 
each of these reserves is evaluated quarterly and is reviewed with the company s disclosure committee and the audit and compliance committee of the board of directors 
the basis for the reserve amounts is determined by analyzing the anticipated exposure for each account  and then selecting the most likely amount based upon historical experience and various other considerations that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
this method has been used for all years in the presented financials and has been used consistently throughout each year 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the criteria used for calculating each of the reserve amounts varies by type of reserve 
for the allowance for doubtful accounts reserve  significant past due balances are individually reviewed for collectibility  while the balance of accounts are reviewed in conjunction with applying historical write off ratios 
the calculation for the obsolete inventories reserve is determined by analyzing the relationship between the age and quantity of items on hand versus estimated usage to determine if excess quantities exist 
the calculation for warranty and after sale costs reserve uses criteria that include known potential problems on past sales as well as historical claim experience and current warranty trends 
the health care reserve for claims incurred  but not reported is determined by using medical cost trend analyses  reviewing subsequent payments made and estimating unbilled amounts 
the changes in the balances of these reserves at december  compared to the prior year were due to normal business conditions and are not deemed to be significant 
while the company continually tries to improve its estimates  no significant changes in the underlying processes are expected in the company also uses estimates in three other significant areas i pension and other postretirement obligations and costs  ii stock based compensation  and iii income taxes 
the actuarial valuation of benefit obligations and net periodic benefit costs rely on key assumptions including discount rates  long term expected return on plan assets  future compensation and healthcare cost trend rates 
the total cost of the company s share based awards is equal to the grant date fair value per award multiplied by the number of awards granted  adjusted for forfeitures 
forfeitures are initially estimated based on historical company information and subsequently updated over the life of the awards to ultimately reflect actual forfeitures  which could have an impact on the amount of stock compensation cost recognized from period to period 
in calculating the provision for income taxes on an interim basis  the company uses an estimate of the annual effective tax rate based upon the facts and circumstances known at each interim period 
on a quarterly basis  the actual effective tax rate is adjusted as appropriate based upon the actual results as compared to those forecasted at the beginning of the fiscal year 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
the company evaluates and updates all of these assumptions quarterly 
actual results may differ from these estimates 
other matters the company is subject to contingencies related to environmental laws and regulations 
currently  the company is in the process of resolving matters relating to two landfill sites where it has been named as one of many potentially responsible parties and to a parcel of land adjoining the company s property 
the landfill sites are impacted by the federal comprehensive environmental response  compensation and liability act and other environmental laws and regulations 
at this time  the company does not believe the ultimate resolution of these issues will have a material adverse effect on the company s financial position or results of operations  either from a cash flow perspective or on the financial statements as a whole 
this belief is based on the company s assessment of its limited past involvement with these landfill sites as well as the substantial involvement of other named third parties in these matters 
however  due to the inherent uncertainties of such proceedings  the company cannot predict the ultimate outcome of these matters 
a future change in circumstances with respect to these specific matters or with respect to sites formerly or currently owned or operated by the company  or with respect to off site disposal locations used by the company  could result in future costs to the company and such amounts could be material 
expenditures during  and for compliance with environmental control provisions and regulations were not material 
like other companies in recent years  the company has been named as a defendant in numerous multi claimant multi defendant lawsuits alleging personal injury as a result of exposure to asbestos  manufactured by third parties  and integrated into or sold with a very limited number of the company s products 
the company is vigorously defending itself against these claims 
although it is not possible to predict the ultimate outcome of these matters  the company does not believe the ultimate resolution of these issues will have a material adverse effect on the company s financial position or results of operations  either from a cash flow perspective or on the financial statements as a whole 
this belief is based in part on the fact that no claimant has demonstrated exposure to products manufactured or sold by the company and that a number of cases have been voluntarily dismissed 
market risks in the ordinary course of business  the company is exposed to various market risks 
the company operates in an environment where competition varies from moderate to intense 
the company believes it currently provides the leading technology in water meters and amr ami systems for water utilities 
a number of the company s competitors in certain markets have greater financial resources 
competitors also include alliance partners that sell products that do or may compete with our products  particularly those that provide amr ami connectivity solutions 
in addition  the market s level of acceptance of the company s newer products may have a significant effect on the company s results of operations 
as a result of significant research and development activities  the company enjoys favorable patent positions for several of its products 
the company s ability to generate operating income and to increase profitability depends somewhat on the general health of the united states and foreign economies  including to some extent such things as the length and severity of the current global economic downturn  the ability of municipal water utility customers to authorize and finance purchases of the company s products  the company s ability to obtain financing  housing starts in the united states  and overall industrial activity 
in addition  changes in governmental laws and regulations  particularly laws dealing with the use of lead or rules affecting the use and or licensing of radio frequencies necessary for amr ami products may impact the results of operations 
these factors are largely beyond the company s control and depend on the economic condition and regulatory environment of the geographic region of the company s operations 
the company does rely on single suppliers for certain castings and components in several of its product lines 
although alternate sources of supply exist for these items  loss of certain suppliers could temporarily disrupt operations in the short term 
the company attempts to mitigate these risks by working closely with key suppliers  purchasing minimal amounts from alternative suppliers and by purchasing business interruption insurance where appropriate 
raw materials used in the manufacture of the company s products include metal or alloys such as bronze  which uses copper as its main component  aluminum  stainless steel  cast iron  brass and stellite  plastic resins  glass  microprocessors and other electronic subassemblies and components 
the price and availability of raw materials is influenced by economic and industry conditions  including supply and demand factors that are difficult to anticipate and cannot be controlled by the company 
commodity risk is managed by keeping abreast of economic conditions and locking in purchase prices for quantities that correspond to the company s forecasted usage 
the company s foreign currency risk relates to the sales of products to foreign customers and purchases of material from foreign vendors 
the company uses lines of credit with us and european banks to offset currency exposure related to european receivables and other monetary assets 
as of december  and  the company s foreign currency net monetary assets were substantially offset by comparable debt resulting in no material exposure to the results of operations 
the company typically does not hold or issue derivative instruments and has a policy specifically prohibiting the use of such instruments for trading purposes 
the company s short term debt on december  was floating rate debt with market values approximating carrying value 
fixed rate debt was principally two us dollar term loans with a and interest rate  respectively  and a euro revolving term loan with a interest rate 
for the short term floating rate debt  future annual interest costs will fluctuate based upon short term interest rates 
for the short term debt on hand on december   the effect of a change in interest rates is approximately  item a
