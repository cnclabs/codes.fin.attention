the changes are indicative of the company s efforts to use technology to become more efficient  and the economic environment which has lead to reduced volume of loan activity and associated expenses 
in particular  the  decrease in the other category of other noninterest expense is primarily due to reduced expenses associated with reduced home equity lending activity in other noninterest expenses increased  to  in the increase was mainly due to new branches opened in and inflation that were partially offset by a  decrease in intangible amortization

classified assets the company closely monitors the markets in which it conducts its lending operations and continues its strategy to control exposure to loans with high credit risk 
asset reviews are performed using grading standards and criteria similar to those employed by bank regulatory agencies 
assets receiving lesser grades fall under the classified assets category  which includes all nonperforming assets and potential problem loans  and receive an elevated level of attention to ensure collection 
the following is a summary of classified assets on the dates indicated dollars in thousands at december  at december  gross guaranteed net gross guaranteed net classified loans       other classified assets total classified assets       allowance for loan losses classified loans classified assets  net of guarantees of the us government  including its agencies and its government sponsored agencies at december   increased  to  from  at december  nonperforming assets loans on which the accrual of interest has been discontinued are designated as nonaccrual loans 
accrual of interest on loans is generally discontinued either when reasonable doubt exists as to the full  timely collection of interest or principal or when a loan becomes contractually past due by days or more with respect to interest or principal 
when loans are days past due  but in management s judgment are well secured and in the process of collection  they may not be classified as nonaccrual 
when a loan is placed on nonaccrual status  all interest previously accrued but not collected is reversed 
income on such loans is then recognized only to the extent that cash is received and where the future collection of principal is probable such loans are classified as performing nonaccrual loans 
interest accruals are resumed on such loans only when they are brought fully current with respect to interest and principal and when  in the judgment of management  the loans are estimated to be fully collectible as to both principal and interest 
the reclassification of loans as nonaccrual does not necessarily reflect management s judgment as to whether they are fully collectible 
interest income on nonaccrual loans which would have been recognized during the year ended december   if all such loans had been current in accordance with their original terms  totaled  interest income actually recognized on these loans in was  the bank s policy is to place loans days or more past due on nonaccrual status 
in some instances when a loan is days past due management does not place it on nonaccrual status because the loan is well secured and in the process of collection 
a loan is considered to be in the process of collection if  based on a probable specific event  it is expected that the loan will be repaid or brought current 
generally  this collection period would not exceed days 
loans where the collateral has been repossessed are classified as other real estate owned oreo or  if the collateral is personal property  the loan is classified as other assets on the company s financial statements 
management considers both the adequacy of the collateral and the other resources of the borrower in determining the steps to be taken to collect nonaccrual loans 
alternatives that are considered are foreclosure  collecting on guarantees  restructuring the loan or collection lawsuits

allowance for loan losses credit risk is inherent in the business of lending 
as a result  the company maintains an allowance for loan losses to absorb losses inherent in the company s loan and lease portfolio 
this is maintained through periodic charges to earnings 
these charges are shown in the consolidated income statements as provision for loan losses 
all specifically identifiable and quantifiable losses are immediately charged off against the allowance 
however  for a variety of reasons  not all losses are immediately known to the company and  of those that are known  the full extent of the loss may not be quantifiable at that point in time 
the balance of the company s allowance for loan losses is meant to be an estimate of these unknown but probable losses inherent in the portfolio 
for the remainder of this discussion  loans shall include all loans and lease contracts  which are a part of the bank s portfolio 
assessment of the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses the company formally assesses the adequacy of the allowance on a quarterly basis 
determination of the adequacy is based on ongoing assessments of the probable risk in the outstanding loan and lease portfolio  and to a lesser extent the company s loan and lease commitments 
these assessments include the periodic re grading of credits based on changes in their individual credit characteristics including delinquency  seasoning  recent financial performance of the borrower  economic factors  changes in the interest rate environment  growth of the portfolio as a whole or by segment  and other factors as warranted 
loans are initially graded when originated 
they are re graded as they are renewed  when there is a new loan to the same borrower  when identified facts demonstrate heightened risk of nonpayment  or if they become delinquent 
re grading of larger problem loans occurs at least quarterly 
confirmation of the quality of the grading process is obtained by independent credit reviews conducted by consultants specifically hired for this purpose and by various bank regulatory agencies 
the company s method for assessing the appropriateness of the allowance includes specific allowances for identified problem loans and leases  formula allowance factors for pools of credits  and allowances for changing environmental factors eg  interest rates  growth  economic conditions  eg allowances for identified problem loans are based on specific analysis of individual credits 
allowance factors for loan pools are based on the previous years historical loss experience by product type 
allowances for changing environmental factors are management s best estimate of the probable impact these changes have had on the loan portfolio as a whole 
the components of the allowance for loan losses as noted above  the overall allowance consists of a specific allowance  a formula allowance  and an allowance for environmental factors 
the first component  the specific allowance  results from the analysis of identified credits that meet management s criteria for specific evaluation 
these loans are reviewed individually to determine if such loans are considered impaired 
impaired loans are those where management has concluded that it is probable that the borrower will be unable to pay all amounts due under the contractual terms 
loans specifically reviewed  including those considered impaired  are evaluated individually by management for loss potential by evaluating sources of repayment  including collateral as applicable  and a specified allowance for loan losses is established where necessary 
the second component  the formula allowance  is an estimate of the probable losses that have occurred across the major loan categories in the company s loan portfolio 
this analysis is based on loan grades by pool and the loss history of these pools 
this analysis covers the company s entire loan portfolio including unused commitments but excludes any loans  that were analyzed individually and assigned a specific allowance as discussed above 
the total amount allocated for this component is determined by applying loss estimation factors to outstanding loans and loan commitments 
the loss factors are based primarily on the company s historical loss experience tracked over a five year period and adjusted as appropriate for the input of current trends and events 
because historical loss experience varies for the different categories of loans  the loss factors applied to each category also differ 
in addition  there is a greater chance that the company has suffered a loss from a loan that was graded less than satisfactory than if the loan was last graded satisfactory 
therefore  for any given category  a larger loss estimation factor is applied to less than satisfactory loans than to those that the company last graded as satisfactory 
the resulting formula allowance is the sum of the allocations determined in this manner 
the third component  the environmental factor allowance  is a component that is not allocated to specific loans or groups of loans  but rather is intended to absorb losses that may not be provided for by the other components 
there are several primary reasons that the other components discussed above might not be sufficient to absorb the losses present in portfolios  and the environmental factor allowance is used to provide for the losses that have occurred because of them 
the first reason is that there are limitations to any credit risk grading process 
the volume of loans makes it impractical to re grade every loan every quarter 
therefore  it is possible that some currently performing loans not recently graded will not be as strong as their last grading and an insufficient portion of the allowance will have been allocated to them 
grading and loan review often must be done without knowing whether all relevant facts are at hand 
troubled borrowers may deliberately or inadvertently omit important information from reports or conversations with lending officers regarding their financial condition and the diminished strength of repayment sources 
the second reason is that the loss estimation factors are based primarily on historical loss totals 
as such  the factors may not give sufficient weight to such considerations as the current general economic and business conditions that affect the company s borrowers and specific industry conditions that affect borrowers in that industry 
the factors might also not give sufficient weight to other environmental factors such as changing economic conditions and interest rates  portfolio growth  entrance into new markets or products  and other characteristics as may be determined by management 
specifically  in assessing how much environmental factor allowance needed to be provided at december   management considered the following o with respect to the economy  management considered the effects of changes in gdp  unemployment  cpi  debt statistics  housing starts  housing sales  auto sales  agricultural prices  and other economic factors which serve as indicators of economic health and trends and which may have an impact on the performance of our borrowers  and o with respect to changes in the interest rate environment  management considered the recent changes in interest rates and the resultant economic impact it may have had on borrowers with high leverage and or low profitability  and o with respect to changes in energy prices  management considered the effect that increases  decreases or volatility may have on the performance of our borrowers  and o with respect to loans to borrowers in new markets and growth in general  management considered the relatively short seasoning of such loans and the lack of experience with such borrowers 
each of these considerations was assigned a factor and applied to a portion or the entire loan portfolio 
since these factors are not derived from experience and are applied to large non homogeneous groups of loans  they are available for use across the portfolio as a whole 
although the weakening economy and resultant recession called for an increase in the factor related to economic conditions  the reductions in interest rates and energy prices coupled with very little loan growth resulted in a decrease in these factors causing the overall environmental factors allowance to decrease 
also  in prior years  the bank maintained a separate factor for real estate risk due to the fact that the bank had little or no losses in this loan category but anticipated that such losses would be experienced at some time 
during the course of the bank eliminated this environmental factor and instead provided for this risk in the formula allowance based on actual and expected loss ratios 
this not only resulted in a reduction of the environmental factors allowance but also resulted in an increase in the formula allowance 
the formula allowance was further increased due to increases in losses over the course of which in turn resulted in increases in the reserve factors for certain loan types accordingly 
these increased factors primarily affected construction loans  helocs  and indirect auto loans

market risk management overview 
the goal for managing the assets and liabilities of the bank is to maximize shareholder value and earnings while maintaining a high quality balance sheet without exposing the bank to undue interest rate risk 
the board of directors has overall responsibility for the company s interest rate risk management policies 
the bank has an asset and liability management committee alco which establishes and monitors guidelines to control the sensitivity of earnings to changes in interest rates 
asset liability management 
activities involved in asset liability management include but are not limited to lending  accepting and placing deposits  investing in securities and issuing debt 
interest rate risk is the primary market risk associated with asset liability management 
sensitivity of earnings to interest rate changes arises when yields on assets change in a different time period or in a different amount from that of interest costs on liabilities 
to mitigate interest rate risk  the structure of the balance sheet is managed with the goal that movements of interest rates on assets and liabilities are correlated and contribute to earnings even in periods of volatile interest rates 
the asset liability management policy sets limits on the acceptable amount of variance in net interest margin  net income and market value of equity under changing interest environments 
market value of equity is the net present value of estimated cash flows from the bank s assets  liabilities and off balance sheet items 
the bank uses simulation models to forecast net interest margin  net income and market value of equity 
simulation of net interest margin  net income and market value of equity under various interest rate scenarios is the primary tool used to measure interest rate risk 
using computer modeling techniques  the bank is able to estimate the potential impact of changing interest rates on net interest margin  net income and market value of equity 
a balance sheet forecast is prepared using inputs of actual loan  securities and interest bearing liability ie deposits borrowings positions as the beginning base 
in the simulation of net interest margin and net income under various interest rate scenarios  the forecast balance sheet is processed against seven interest rate scenarios 
these seven interest rate scenarios include a flat rate scenario  which assumes interest rates are unchanged in the future  and six additional rate ramp scenarios ranging from to basis points around the flat scenario in basis point increments 
these ramp scenarios assume that interest rates increase or decrease evenly in a ramp fashion over a twelve month period and remain at the new levels beyond twelve months 
the following table summarizes the effect on net interest income and net income due to changing interest rates as measured against a flat rate no interest rate change scenario 
the simulation results shown below assume no changes in the structure of the company s balance sheet over the twelve months being measured a flat balance sheet scenario  and that deposit rates will track general interest rate changes by approximately interest rate risk simulation of net interest income and net income as of december  estimated change in estimated change in change in interest net interest income nii net income ni rates basis points as of flat nii as of flat ni ramp ramp ramp flat ramp ramp ramp in the simulation of market value of equity under various interest rate scenarios  the forecast balance sheet is processed against seven interest rate scenarios 
these seven interest rate scenarios include the flat rate scenario described above  and six additional rate shock scenarios ranging from to basis points around the flat scenario in basis point increments 
these rate shock scenarios assume that interest rates increase or decrease immediately in a shock fashion and remain at the new level in the future

liability sensitive implies that earnings decrease when interest rates rise  and increase when interest rates decrease 
the magnitude of all the simulation results noted above is within the bank s policy guidelines 
the asset liability management policy limits aggregate market risk  as measured in this fashion  to an acceptable level within the context of risk return trade offs 
the simulation results noted above do not incorporate any management actions that might moderate the negative consequences of interest rate deviations 
in addition  the simulation results noted above contain various assumptions such as a flat balance sheet  and the rate that deposit interest rates change as general interest rates change 
therefore  they do not reflect likely actual results  but serve as estimates of interest rate risk 
as with any method of measuring interest rate risk  certain shortcomings are inherent in the method of analysis presented in the preceding tables 
for example  although certain of the bank s assets and liabilities may have similar maturities or repricing time frames  they may react in different degrees to changes in market interest rates 
in addition  the interest rates on certain of the bank s asset and liability categories may precede  or lag behind  changes in market interest rates 
also  the actual rates of prepayments on loans and investments could vary significantly from the assumptions utilized in deriving the results as presented in the preceding tables 
further  a change in us treasury rates accompanied by a change in the shape of the treasury yield curve could result in different estimations from those presented herein 
accordingly  the results in the preceding tables should not be relied upon as indicative of actual results in the event of changing market interest rates 
additionally  the resulting estimates of changes in market value of equity are not intended to represent  and should not be construed to represent  estimates of changes in the underlying value of the bank 
interest rate sensitivity is a function of the repricing characteristics of the bank s portfolio of assets and liabilities 
one aspect of these repricing characteristics is the time frame within which the interest bearing assets and liabilities are subject to change in interest rates either at replacement  repricing or maturity 
an analysis of the repricing time frames of interest bearing assets and liabilities is sometimes called a gap analysis because it shows the gap between assets and liabilities repricing or maturing in each of a number of periods 
another aspect of these repricing characteristics is the relative magnitude of the repricing for each category of interest earning asset and interest bearing liability given various changes in market interest rates 
gap analysis gives no indication of the relative magnitude of repricing given various changes in interest rates 
interest rate sensitivity management focuses on the maturity of assets and liabilities and their repricing during periods of changes in market interest rates 
interest rate sensitivity gaps are measured as the difference between the volumes of assets and liabilities in the bank s current portfolio that are subject to repricing at various time horizons 
the following interest rate sensitivity table shows the bank s repricing gaps as of december  in this table transaction deposits  which may be repriced at will by the bank  have been included in the less than month category 
the inclusion of all of the transaction deposits in the less than month repricing category causes the bank to appear liability sensitive 
because the bank may reprice its transaction deposits at will  transaction deposits may or may not reprice immediately with changes in interest rates 
in recent years of moderate interest rate changes the bank s earnings have reacted as though the gap position is slightly asset sensitive mainly because the magnitude of interest bearing liability repricing has been less than the magnitude of interest earning asset repricing 
this difference in the magnitude of asset and liability repricing is mainly due to the bank s strong core deposit base  which although deposits may be repriced within three months  historically  the timing of their repricing has been longer than three months and the magnitude of their repricing has been minimal 
due to the limitations of gap analysis  as described above  the bank does not actively use gap analysis in managing interest rate risk 
instead  the bank relies on the more sophisticated interest rate risk simulation model described above as its primary tool in measuring and managing interest rate risk

liquidity liquidity refers to the bank s ability to provide funds at an acceptable cost to meet loan demand and deposit withdrawals  as well as contingency plans to meet unanticipated funding needs or loss of funding sources 
these objectives can be met from either the asset or liability side of the balance sheet 
asset liquidity sources consist of the repayments and maturities of loans  selling of loans  short term money market investments  maturities of securities and sales of securities from the available for sale portfolio 
these activities are generally summarized as investing activities in the consolidated statement of cash flows 
net cash used by investing activities totaled approximately  in increased securities and loan balances were responsible for the major use of funds in this category 
liquidity is generated from liabilities through deposit growth and borrowings 
these activities are included under financing activities in the consolidated statement of cash flows

while these sources are expected to continue to provide significant amounts of funds in the future  their mix  as well as the possible use of other sources  will depend on future economic and market conditions 
liquidity is also provided or used through the results of operating activities

the growth of deposit balances is subject to heightened competition  the success of the company s sales efforts  delivery of superior customer service and market conditions 
the recent series of reductions in the federal funds rate resulted in declining short term interest rates  which could impact deposit volumes in the future 
depending on economic conditions  interest rate levels  and a variety of other conditions  deposit growth may be used to fund loans  to reduce short term borrowings or purchase investment securities 
however  due to concerns such as uncertainty in the general economic environment  competition and political uncertainty  loan demand and levels of customer deposits are not certain 
the principal cash requirements of the company are dividends on common stock when declared 
the company is dependent upon the payment of cash dividends by the bank to service its commitments 
shareholder dividends are expected to continue subject to the board s discretion and continuing evaluation of capital levels  earnings  asset quality and other factors 
the company expects that the cash dividends paid by the bank to the company will be sufficient to meet this payment schedule 
dividends from the bank are subject to certain regulatory restrictions 
the maturity distribution of certificates of deposit in denominations of  or more is set forth in the following table 
these deposits are generally more rate sensitive than other deposits and  therefore  are more likely to be withdrawn to obtain higher yields elsewhere if available
