consolidated results of operations revenues dollars in millions years ended december  commercial airplanes integrated defense systems boeing capital corporation other unallocated items and eliminations revenues the decrease in revenues of  million is primarily due to lower revenues at commercial airplanes 
commercial airplanes revenues decreased by  million  primarily as a result of decreases in new airplane deliveries reflecting the effects of the labor strike  partially offset by higher intercompany revenues and higher pre strike deliveries and model mix 
we delivered fewer than expected airplanes due to the iam strike during this reduced revenue by approximately billion for the twelve months ended december  ids revenues were unchanged as revenue growth in global services and support gs s was offset by decreases in boeing military airplanes bma and network and space systems n ss 
bcc revenues decreased by million primarily due to lower interest income on financing receivables and notes and a decrease in the customer financing portfolio 
other segment revenues increased by million primarily due to the sale of four c aircraft during  that were held under an operating lease 
unallocated items and eliminations changed by million  primarily due to the intercompany elimination of p a poseidon program p a revenues recognized by commercial airplanes 

table of contents revenues in grew by  million  primarily due to the growth at commercial airplanes 
commercial airplanes revenues increased by  million  primarily due to higher new airplane deliveries and increased commercial aviation support activities

unallocated items and eliminations in improved by million compared with  which is further explained in the table below 
operating earnings in improved by  million compared with the increase is partly due to the million global settlement with us department of justice us doj that occurred in the second quarter of commercial airplanes earnings increased by million compared with the same period in  primarily due to higher new airplane deliveries  commercial aviation support activities and improved cost performance offset by increased research and development expense 
commercial airplanes research and development expense increased by million to  million compared with the same period  primarily due to spending on the and programs 
ids earnings increased by million compared with the increase is primarily due to charges of million in the bma segment related to aew c  partially offset by lower earnings on several programs in the bma and n ss segments 
bcc operating earnings decreased million reflecting lower revenues partially offset by a recovery of losses and lower expenses 
other segment earnings improved by million primarily due to the absence of losses related to connexion by boeing  which included a charge of million to exit this business in unallocated items and eliminations in contributed million to the earnings improvement  which is further explained in the table below 

table of contents the most significant items included in unallocated items and eliminations are shown in the following table dollars in millions years ended december  pension and other postretirement share based plans deferred compensation benefit expense other unallocated items and eliminations total we recorded net periodic benefit cost related to pensions and other postretirement benefits of  million   million and  million in  and  respectively 
not all net periodic benefit cost is recognized in earnings in the period incurred because it is allocated to production as product costs and a portion remains in inventory at the end of the reporting period 
accordingly  earnings from operations included  million   million and  million in  and  respectively 
a portion of pension and other postretirement expense is recorded in the business segments and the remainder is included in unallocated pension and other postretirement expense 
unallocated pension and other postretirement expense represents the difference between costs recognized under generally accepted accounting principles in the united states of america gaap in the consolidated financial statements and federal cost accounting standards required to be utilized by our business segments for us government contracting purposes 
pension and other postretirement expense decreased during when compared with primarily due to a decrease in overall pension costs compared to the same period in the prior year 
pension and other postretirement expense increased during when compared with primarily due to increased overall pension costs recognized in inventory as of december   which were subsequently expensed in cost of sales in the reduction in share based plans expense is primarily due to the expiration of certain performance shares during and higher expense acceleration during  resulting from six payouts compared with zero payouts in the reduction in share based plans expense during is primarily due to lower performance shares outstanding in and higher expense acceleration during  resulting from payouts compared with six payouts in the year over year changes in deferred compensation expense are primarily driven by changes in our stock price and broad stock market conditions 
other unallocated items and expense includes a charge related to satellite litigation of million  offset by lower performance based compensation in other unallocated items and expense in decreased as a result of reduced intercompany profit elimination as a result of fewer intercompany deliveries than the previous year

table of contents segment results of operations and financial condition commercial airplanes business environment and trends airline industry environment for the world s airlines  was a challenging year characterized by volatility of several key operational factors including oil prices  economic growth  exchange rates and financing terms 
in the first half of the year  airlines focused on adapting to spiking oil prices which peaked close to barrel in july 
in the second half of  the focus turned to the implications of the global credit crisis and recession as fuel prices fell below barrel for the first time since air traffic growth declined toward the end of the year as higher fares to cover higher fuel costs earlier in the year and the economic slowdown reduced demand for air travel 
the impact to airline operations and profitability was dramatic 
globally  over airlines entered bankruptcy  and airlines curtailed capacity growth by cutting unprofitable routes and flights  reducing utilization  and parking older generation airplanes 
following its first profitable year since in  the airline industry fell back into losses in led by us airlines 
us airlines were most exposed to the fuel price shock due to limited hedging and a weakening dollar  but as the demand environment deteriorated  airlines in all regions faced lower profit outlooks by the end of the near term outlook is highly uncertain due to the volatility of key drivers such as economic growth and fuel prices 
near term air traffic growth forecasts vary significantly but generally indicate minimal to negative growth in early airline schedules show a decline in world capacity as airlines attempt to match capacity with air travel demand 
profitability forecasts for also range widely both at the global as well as regional levels 
airlines continue to cut non fuel costs including distribution  labor and overhead but significant uncertainty remains around fuel prices and revenues 
from time to time certain customers may request cancelations  modifications  or rescheduling of their existing orders to meet revised fleet plans 
whether such requests will result in a material adverse impact on our earnings  cash flow or financial position depends on a number of factors including whether the request is granted  the type of aircraft  how much compensation is paid to us for costs already incurred and our ability to reschedule other orders to replace those canceled  modified  or rescheduled 
the fundamental drivers of air travel growth are a combination of economic growth and the increasing propensity to travel due to increased trade  globalization and improved airline services driven by liberalization of air traffic rights between countries 
beyond the near term market uncertainties  our year forecast is for a long term average growth rate of per year for passenger traffic  and per year for cargo traffic based on projected average annual worldwide real economic growth rate of 
based on long term global economic growth projections  and factoring in increased utilization of the worldwide airplane fleet and requirements to replace older airplanes  we project a trillion market for  new airplanes over the next years 
the industry remains vulnerable to near term exogenous developments including disease outbreaks such as avian flu  terrorism  and increased global environmental regulations 
industry competitiveness the commercial jet aircraft market and the airline industry remain extremely competitive 
we expect the existing long term downward trend in passenger revenue yields worldwide measured in real terms to continue into the foreseeable future 
market liberalization in europe and asia has continued to enable low cost airlines to gain market share 
these airlines have increased the downward pressure on airfares 
this results in continued cost pressures for all airlines and price pressure on our products 
major productivity gains are essential to ensure a favorable market position at acceptable profit margins 

table of contents continued access to global markets remains vital to our ability to fully realize our sales potential and long term investment returns 
approximately of commercial airplanes contractual backlog in dollar terms is with us airlines 
we face aggressive international competitors who are intent on increasing their market share 
they offer competitive products and have access to most of the same customers and suppliers 
airbus has historically invested heavily to create a family of products to compete with ours 
regional jet makers embraer and bombardier  coming from the less than seat commercial jet market  continue to develop larger and more capable airplanes 
additionally  other competitors from russia  china  and japan are likely to enter the to seat aircraft market over the next few years 
this market environment has resulted in intense pressures on pricing and other competitive factors 
worldwide  airplane sales are generally conducted in us dollars 
fluctuating exchange rates affect the profit potential of our major competitors  all of whom have significant costs in other currencies 
a decline of the us dollar relative to their local currencies as experienced in puts pressure on competitors revenues and profits 
competitors often respond by aggressively reducing costs and increasing productivity  thereby improving their longer term competitive posture 
airbus has announced such initiatives targeting overhead cost savings  a reduction in its development cycle and a significant increase in overall productivity through if the us dollar continues to strengthen  airbus can use the improved efficiency to fund product development  gain market share through pricing  and or improve earnings 
we are focused on improving our processes and continuing cost reduction efforts 
we continue to leverage our extensive customer support services network which includes aviation support  spares  training  maintenance documents and technical advice for airlines throughout the world 
this enables us to provide a higher level of customer satisfaction and productivity 
these efforts enhance our ability to pursue pricing strategies that enable us to price competitively 
operating results dollars in millions years ended december  revenues of total company revenues earnings from operations operating margins research and development contractual backlog revenues year over year changes in revenue are shown in the following table dollars in millions vs vs new airplane sales aircraft trading commercial aviation services business total 
table of contents the decrease in revenue of  million in from is primarily attributable to lower new airplane deliveries 
the iam strike resulted in airplane deliveries moving out of which reduced revenues by  million 
the strike impact was partially offset by higher intercompany revenues of million  and higher pre strike deliveries  net of model mix changes  of million 
aircraft trading activity decreased by million as a result of fewer sales of used aircraft 
revenues in commercial aviation services business increased by million driven by increased spares and services revenue offset by decreased passenger to freighter conversions 
the increase in revenue of  million in from is attributable to increased new airplane deliveries  including model mix changes  of  million  increased commercial aviation services business of  million and increased aircraft trading activity of million 
commercial jet aircraft deliveries as of december  including deliveries under operating lease  which are identified by parentheses  were as follows ng total cumulative deliveries deliveries cumulative deliveries deliveries cumulative deliveries deliveries intercompany deliveries were two aircraft and two next generation aircraft in  one aircraft and one next generation aircraft in and two aircraft and eight next generation aircraft in earnings from operations earnings from operations decreased by  million in when compared with  a decrease in operating margins of percentage points to 
lower new airplane deliveries  partially offset by higher intercompany revenues  reduced earnings by  million 
a charge for a reach forward loss on the program resulting from increases to estimated costs for development and production of derivatives reduced earnings by million 
infrastructure cost allocations related to the and schedule delays and infrastructure costs incurred during the iam strike reduced earnings by million 
the and schedule delays resulted in production programs receiving larger allocations of current and future infrastructure costs and reduced margins on deliveries  while the program infrastructure costs incurred during the iam strike decreased margins on airplanes delivered during the second half of the year 
increased period cost and other performance reduced earnings by million 
a reduction in commercial aviation services volume and mix related earnings of million was primarily due to a decrease in volume on passenger to freighter conversion programs 
lower research and development costs improved earnings by million 
earnings from operations increased by million in when compared with  an increase in operating margins of percentage points to 
the increase is primarily attributable to an increase in new airplane deliveries of million  improved cost performance of million and commercial aviation services business increase of million 
these were offset by increased research and development costs of million 

table of contents backlog firm backlog represents orders for products and services where no contingencies remain before boeing and the customer are required to perform 
backlog does not include prospective orders where customer controlled contingencies remain  such as the customers receiving approval from their board of directors  shareholders or government and completing financing arrangements 
all such contingencies must be satisfied or have expired prior to recording a new firm order even if satisfying such conditions is highly certain 
firm orders exclude options 
a number of our customers may have contractual remedies that may be implicated by program delays 
we continue to address customer claims and requests for other contractual relief as they arise 
however  once orders are included in firm backlog  orders remain in backlog until canceled or fulfilled  although the value of orders is adjusted as changes to price and schedule are agreed to with customers 
the backlog increase in related to orders in excess of deliveries for our ng   and programs  while the increase in related to orders in excess of deliveries for all programs 
accounting quantity the accounting quantity is our estimate of the quantity of airplanes that will be produced for delivery under existing and anticipated contracts and is limited by the ability to make reasonably dependable estimates of the revenue and costs of these contracts 
it is a key determinant of gross margins we recognize on sales of individual airplanes throughout a program s life 
estimation of each program s accounting quantity takes into account several factors that are indicative of the demand for that program  including firm orders  letters of intent from prospective customers  and market studies 
we review our program accounting quantities quarterly 
commercial aircraft production costs include a significant amount of infrastructure costs  a portion of which do not vary with production rates 
as the amount of time needed to produce the accounting quantity decreases  the average cost of the accounting quantity also decreases as these infrastructure costs are included in the total cost estimates  thus increasing the gross margin and related earnings provided other factors do not change 

table of contents the accounting quantity for each program may include units that have been delivered  undelivered units under contract  and units anticipated to be under contract in the reasonable future anticipated orders 
in developing total program estimates all of these items within the accounting quantity must be considered 
the table below provides details as of december program ng program accounting quantities undelivered units under firm orders cumulative firm orders cfo anticipated orders n a n a n a n a anticipated orders as a of cfo n a n a n a n a program accounting quantities undelivered units under firm orders cumulative firm orders cfo anticipated orders n a n a n a n a anticipated orders as a of cfo n a n a n a n a program accounting quantities undelivered units under firm orders cumulative firm orders cfo anticipated orders n a n a n a anticipated orders as a of cfo n a n a n a the accounting quantity for the program will be determined in the year of first airplane delivery  targeted for undelivered units are not adjusted for cancellations subsequent to december  cumulative firm orders represent the cumulative number of commercial jet aircraft deliveries plus undelivered firm orders 
next generation the accounting quantity for the next generation program increased by units during due to the program s normal progression of obtaining additional orders and delivering aircraft 
program in november  we announced a revised schedule for the delivery of the freighter and intercontinental airplanes 
deliveries of the first freighter moved from the fourth quarter of into the third quarter of delivery of the intercontinental moved from the fourth quarter of into the second quarter of the schedule change was caused by design changes  limited availability of engineering resources and the recent iam strike 
in the third quarter of  we increased our cost estimates to incorporate the anticipated schedule delay and design changes and reduced margins on the program to zero 
we experienced further cost growth in the fourth quarter and recorded a charge of million to recognize a reach forward loss 
the charge is primarily related to higher than anticipated costs due to late changes to wing design which drove new load requirements into the fuselage and created other statement of work changes for our suppliers 
design and load changes also reduced commonality with and resulted in increased costs for components and systems 
higher pension costs  infrastructure cost shifts  delays in transitioning certain components to suppliers and higher internal production costs also increased cost estimates 
we believe that the cost and revenue estimates incorporated in the financial statements are appropriate  however  this remains a development program  with the associated inherent risks 

table of contents the accounting quantity for the program increased by units in program the accounting quantity for the program increased by units during on february   the us air force announced it had chosen a competitor s bid over our proposed derivative to build replacement tankers for the air force s aging kc fleet of air to air refueling tankers 
on march   we filed a formal protest with the government accountability office  citing irregularities with the process of the tanker competition and the evaluation of the competitors bids 
on june   the government accountability office sustained our protest of the contract award 
on september   the department of defense notified the congress and the two competing contractors  boeing and northrop grumman  that it was terminating the current competition for a us air force airborne tanker replacement 
we anticipate that the tanker competition will re open in program the accounting quantity for the program increased by units during delivery of the first freighter is scheduled for early program we are in the final stages of assembly of the initial airplanes and planning for flight test 
the risks that are always inherent in the latter stages of new airplane program production remain 
we continue to address challenges associated with assembly of the first few airplanes  including management of our extended global supply chain  completion and integration of traveled work  weight and systems integration 
we are also continuing efforts to satisfy customer mission and performance needs in light of the anticipated weight of their respective aircraft 
during  we announced schedule delays for the airplane 
first flight of the airplane has moved from the second quarter of into the second quarter of delivery of the first moved from early into the first quarter of delivery schedules for derivative airplanes may also be impacted 
the revised schedule reflects the cumulative impacts of disruption caused by the recent iam strike  the requirement to replace certain fasteners in early production airplanes  as well as the impact from the challenges mentioned above 
we continue to work with our customers and suppliers to assess the specific impacts of schedule changes  including delivery delays and supplier assertions associated with such changes 
a number of our customers have contractual remedies that may be implicated by our revised plan for the we continue to address customer claims and requests for other contractual relief as they arise 
fleet support we provide the operators of our commercial airplanes with assistance and services to facilitate efficient and safe aircraft operation 
collectively known as fleet support services  these activities and services begin prior to aircraft delivery and continue throughout the operational life of the aircraft 
they include flight and maintenance training  field service support costs  engineering services and technical data and documents 
the costs for fleet support are expensed as incurred and have been historically less than of total consolidated costs of products and services 
this level of expenditures is anticipated to continue in the upcoming years 
these costs do not vary significantly with current production rates 
research and development the following chart summarizes the time horizon between go ahead and certification initial delivery for major commercial airplanes derivatives and programs

table of contents our research and development expense decreased million in research and development expense is net of development cost sharing payments received from suppliers 
the decrease in research and development spending for was primarily due to reduced product development activities partially offset by million of increased spending on the program and million of lower supplier development cost sharing payments 
our research and development expense increased million in the increase in was due to higher spending of million  primarily on and  and million of lower supplier development cost sharing payments 
additional considerations in  we recorded a reach forward loss on the program and announced additional delays and challenges on the program that highlight the risks that are always inherent in new airplane programs and derivative airplanes 
costs related to development of new programs and derivative airplanes are generally expensed as incurred 
costs to produce new aircraft are included in inventory and accounted for using program accounting 
airplane programs have risk for reach forward losses if our estimated production costs exceed our estimated program revenues for the accounting quantity 
generally commercial airplanes are sold on a firm fixed price basis with an indexed price escalation clause and are often sold several years before scheduled delivery 
while firm fixed price contracts allow us to benefit from cost savings  they also expose us to the risk of cost overruns 
many new airplanes and derivatives have highly complex designs and require extensive coordination and integration with supplier partners 
as technical or quality issues arise  we may experience schedule delays and cost impacts  which could increase our estimated cost to perform the work or reduce our estimated price and result in higher period costs for research and development or reduce margins on future deliveries or in a material charge if the program has or is determined to have a reach forward loss 
changes to estimates of the program accounting quantity  production costs and rates  learning curve and costs of derivatives could also result in lower margins or reach forward losses 
while we believe the cost and revenue estimates incorporated in the financial statements are appropriate  the technical complexity of these programs creates financial risk as additional completion costs may become necessary or scheduled delivery dates could be extended  which could trigger termination provisions  order cancellations or other financially significant exposure 
examples of such commercial development programs include the  and freighter

defense environment overview the us is faced with the continuing struggle to balance funding priorities for current irregular threats while preparing for potential threats from near peer states with growing sophistication and military means 
the us department of defense us dod faces the simultaneous requirements to recapitalize important defense capabilities and to transform the force to take advantage of available technologies to meet the changing national security environment as outlined in the latest national defense strategy 
all of this must be carried out against a backdrop of significant competing national priorities including dealing with the economic crisis 
we anticipate that the national security environment will remain challenging well into the next decade 
policies of the new administration will impact the defense environment and will likely include a complete review of the defense budget in fy and beyond  more emphasis on increasing diplomatic efforts to expand and strengthen our alliances  and reforms to the defense acquisition process 

table of contents because us dod spending was about half of worldwide defense spending and represented approximately of ids revenue in  the trends and drivers associated with the us dod budget are critical 
although the us dod budget has grown substantially over the past decade  we anticipate the growth rate to level off over the next several years 
in addition to the fiscal year discretionary budget request of billion  the president submitted supplemental requests totaling billion 
procurement and research and development accounts continue to face increasing budgetary pressures due to growing requirements from operations and maintenance o m and personnel costs tied to us commitments overseas 
however  this trend is partially offset by equipment recapitalization efforts and continued demand for systems development 
near term forecast of the defense budget environment shows limited growth in the to period for investment efforts with greater concern existing for the period following us troop draw downs in iraq 
we continue to see pressure to significantly reduce emergency supplemental requests that have been used to cover the ongoing costs of the global war on terror 
it is unlikely that the us dod will be able to fully fund all programs of record already in development as well as new initiatives 
this imbalance between future costs of programs and expected funding levels is not uncommon in the us dod and is routinely managed by internally adjusting priorities and schedules  restructuring programs  and lengthening production runs to meet the constraints of available funding and occasionally by cancellation of programs 
we expect the us dod will respond to future budget constraints by focusing on affordability strategies that emphasize utilization of off the shelf solutions and network enabled operations 
these strategies will be enabled through persistent intelligence  surveillance  and reconnaissance isr  long range strike  special operations  unmanned systems  cyber security  precision guided kinetic and non kinetic weapons as well as continued outsourcing of logistics and support activities to improve overall effectiveness while maintaining control over costs 
while international defense markets have not demonstrated the dramatic increases experienced by the us market in recent years they have reversed the declining trend seen in the s 
the procurement deferrals taken by international countries has resulted in growing demands for new equipment to address operational requirements  aging inventories  and changing threat environments 
asymmetric warfare remains a key challenge with many nations placing renewed emphasis on acquiring material that is deployable  survivable  and interoperable with the international community 
similar to the us  many european nations are facing pressures in their o m and personnel budgets that are squeezing funding for investment 
middle eastern markets continue to spend significant amounts on new equipment  however  the impact from volatile oil prices has the potential to affect willingness to commit extra budgetary resources 
in asia growth is continuing with multiple nations pursuing major new acquisitions to address growing regional threats 
the international market will be affected by the global economic challenges  however  the continuing threat environment should keep the market stable in federal market environment we continue to see growth in the needs of federal customers particularly for the intelligence community and the department of homeland security 
areas such as cyber security  border protection  and infrastructure security have increased in importance in order to meet the needs of the national security environment 
we also anticipate a continuation of the trend toward outsourcing federal and government services 
civil space transportation and exploration environment the national aeronautics and space administration nasa has had stable annual funding in this decade 
nasa s budget remains focused on needed funds for space shuttle operations  international space station  and new initiatives associated with the vision for space exploration 
nasa is continuing to pursue elements of the vision for space exploration  which will provide additional opportunities in launch activities and research and development 

table of contents commercial satellite environment the commercial satellite market has strengthened since the downturn earlier in the decade and is expected to stabilize with replacement demand through the end of the decade 
despite improvement in market demand the industry continues to be characterized by overcapacity creating strong competitive pressures on pricing 
segment name changes in the third quarter of  we changed the names of the precision engagement and mobility systems segment to boeing military aircraft bma and the support systems segment to global services and support gs s 
ids realignment effective january  and  certain programs were realigned between ids segments 
in addition  certain environmental remediation contracts formerly included in n ss were transferred to the other segment 
business segment data for all periods presented have been adjusted to reflect the realignment 
see note operating results dollars in millions years ended december  revenues of total company revenues earnings from operations operating margins research and development contractual backlog unobligated backlog since our operating cycle is long term and involves many different types of development and production contracts with varying delivery and milestone schedules  the operating results of a particular year  or year to year comparisons of revenues and earnings  may not be indicative of future operating results 
in addition  depending on the customer and their funding sources  our orders might be structured as annual follow on contracts  or as one large multi year order or long term award 
as a result  period to period comparisons of backlog are not necessarily indicative of future workloads 
the following discussions of comparative results among periods should be viewed in this context 
revenues ids revenues were unchanged in as revenue growth in gs s was offset by decreases in bma and n ss 
ids revenues decreased by in primarily due to the exclusion of the government delta volume from n ss revenues  now a revenue component for our joint venture ula 
decreased revenue from this exclusion and lower revenues in the bma segment were partially offset by increased volume in other n ss programs and growth in the gs s segment 
operating earnings ids earnings  which include the effects of the iam strike  decreased by million in primarily due to lower earnings in the bma segment resulting from a million charge taken on the aew c program in the second quarter partially offset by higher earnings in the n ss segment 
ids operating earnings increased by million in compared with primarily due to million of charges on aew c in the increase was partially offset by lower earnings in the n ss segment and other bma programs 

table of contents backlog total backlog is comprised of contractual backlog  which represents work we are on contract to perform for which we have received funding  and unobligated backlog  which represents work we are on contract to perform for which funding has not yet been authorized and appropriated 
ids total backlog increased in  from  million to  million  primarily due to multi year contracts for the v and chinook and international orders for f and c aircraft 
the increases were partially offset by deliveries and sales on multi year contracts awarded in prior years with the largest decreases in the fcs  c  f a and f programs 
for further details on the changes between periods  refer to the discussions of the individual segments below 
additional considerations our business includes a variety of development programs which have complex design and technical challenges 
many of these programs have cost type contracting arrangements 
in these cases the associated financial risks are primarily in lower profit rates or program cancellation if milestones and technical progress are not accomplished 
examples of these programs include airborne laser  ea g  family of beyond line of sight terminals  fcs  ground based midcourse defense gmd  joint tactical radio system jtrs  p a and proprietary programs 
some of our development programs are contracted on a fixed price basis 
many of these programs have highly complex designs 
as technical or quality issues arise  we may experience schedule delays and cost impacts  which could increase our estimated cost to perform the work or reduce our estimated price  either of which could result in a material charge 
these programs are ongoing  and while we believe the cost and fee estimates incorporated in the financial statements are appropriate  the technical complexity of these programs creates financial risk as additional completion costs may become necessary or scheduled delivery dates could be extended  which could trigger termination provisions  the loss of satellite in orbit incentive payments  or other financially significant exposure 
these programs have risk for reach forward losses if our estimated costs exceed our estimated contract revenues 
examples of these programs include aew c  international kc tanker  commercial and military satellites  vigilare and high frequency modernisation 
boeing military aircraft operating results dollars in millions years ended december  revenues of total company revenues earnings from operations operating margins research and development contractual backlog unobligated backlog revenues bma revenues decreased in and in the decrease of million in is primarily driven by lower f  apache  f and chinook revenue partially offset by increased deliveries on f and international kc tankers and c contract mix 
the decrease of million in was due to reduced deliveries of the apache and t aircraft and joint direct attack munitions  partially offset by higher deliveries of chinook and f a aircraft and higher volume on the p a program 

table of contents deliveries of new build production aircraft  excluding remanufactures and modifications  were as follows years ended december  f a models t ts goshawk f e eagle c globemaster kc tanker ch chinook ah apache c a clipper total new build production aircraft operating earnings bma operating earnings decreased by million in primarily due to a charge of million taken on the aew c program in the second quarter 
delivery mix  lower volume and the iam strike also contributed to the decrease in operating earnings increased by million in primarily due to the charges of million on aew c  which were partially offset by lower earnings due to revised cost estimates on the international kc tanker program  lower prices on the c program and revised cost and revenue estimates on the aew c program 
research and development the bma segment continues to focus research and development resources to leverage customer knowledge  technical strength and large scale integration capabilities that provide innovative solutions to meet the warfighter s enduring needs 
research and development has remained consistent over the past several years 
research and development activities utilize our capabilities in architectures  system of systems integration and weapon systems technologies to develop solutions which are designed to enhance our customers capabilities in the areas of mobility  precision effects  situational awareness and survivability 
these efforts focus on increasing mission effectiveness and interoperability  and improving affordability  reliability and economic ownership 
backlog bma total backlog increased by in compared with primarily due to an increase in the v  chinook and f program backlog 
these increases were partially offset by deliveries and sales on multi year contracts awarded in prior years with the largest decreases in the c and f a programs 
total backlog decreased by in compared with primarily due to deliveries and sales on c  f a  p a and f these decreases were partially offset by a multi year contract for f aircraft and international orders for aew c and f a aircraft 
additional considerations items which could have a future impact on bma operations include the following aew c during  we recorded charges of million and during the second quarter of we recorded a charge of million related to revised cost and revenue estimates to complete the aew c programs in australia and turkey 
the charge is primarily related to our program in australia and is due to subsystem development issues on the electronic warfare and ground support systems and the additional time required for integration testing 
these factors required a revised delivery schedule for the australian aircraft 
these delays are not expected to affect delivery schedules to our other aew c customers 
the aew c development program  also known as wedgetail in australia  peace eagle in turkey and peace eye in the republic of korea  consists of a aircraft outfitted with a variety of command and control and advanced radar systems  some of which 
table of contents have never been installed on an airplane before 
wedgetail includes six aircraft and peace eagle and peace eye include four aircraft each 
these are advanced and complex fixed price development programs involving technical challenges at the individual subsystem level and in the overall integration of these subsystems into a reliable and effective operational capability 
we believe that the cost and revenue estimates incorporated in the financial statements are appropriate  however  the technical complexity of the programs creates financial risk as additional completion costs may be necessary or scheduled delivery dates could be delayed 
international kc tanker program during and  the bma segment recorded charges of million and million 
the charge was partially offset at the consolidated level 
the international kc tanker program includes four aircraft for the italian air force and four aircraft for the japanese air self defense force 
we delivered the first two tankers to japan during the first quarter of these programs are ongoing  and while we believe the cost estimates incorporated in the financial statements are appropriate  the technical complexity of the programs creates financial risk as additional completion and development costs may be necessary or remaining scheduled delivery dates could be delayed 
c as of december   we delivered of the c aircraft ordered by the us air force usaf  with final deliveries scheduled for in june and april  we directed key suppliers to begin work on and aircraft  respectively  beyond the to support potential fiscal year fy and fiscal year fy orders and anticipated international orders 
our authorizations allowed us to maintain the current c production rate and to provide for cost effective acquisition of the aircraft 
as of december   inventory expenditures and potential termination liabilities to suppliers  primarily related to the anticipated fy usaf order  totaled approximately million 
in june  the fy supplemental defense spending bill  signed by the president  included funding for up to an additional c aircraft 
the usaf placed these aircraft on contract on february  there continues to be substantial interest in purchasing additional c aircraft from both the us government and international customers 
the national defense authorization act signed into law by the president authorizes the procurement of six c s in fy however  funding would need to be addressed in a future defense appropriations bill 
should additional orders not materialize  it is reasonably possible that we will decide in to complete production of the c we are still evaluating the full financial impact of a potential production shut down  including any recovery that would be available from the government 
such recovery from the government would not include the costs incurred by us resulting from our direction to key suppliers to begin working on aircraft beyond the ordered by the usaf

table of contents revenues n ss revenues decreased in and in the decrease of million in is primarily due to decreased revenues in fcs  proprietary and satellite programs partially offset by increased revenues in the sbinet program 
the decrease of million in was primarily due to the exclusion of government delta volume  now a component of our equity investment in ula and lower fcs volume  partially offset by increased volume on sbinet and several satellite programs 
delta launch and new build satellite deliveries were as follows years ended december  delta ii commercial delta ii government delta iv government satellites delta government launches are excluded from our deliveries after december  due to the formation of ula 
operating earnings n ss operating earnings increased by million in was primarily due to increased earnings from our investment in ula 
the decrease in was due to lower earnings on fcs and several satellite programs 
these decreases were partially offset by higher award fees on gmd and a million gain on sale of a property in anaheim 
n ss operating earnings include equity earnings of million  million and million from the united space alliance joint venture in   and  respectively and equity earnings of million  a loss of million and equity earnings of million from the ula joint venture in  and  respectively 
the ula equity earnings and loss amounts are net of the basis difference amortization 
research and development the n ss research and development funding remains focused on the development of communications  command and control  computers  intelligence  surveillance and reconnaissance systems cisr  communications and command and control c capabilities that support a network enabled architecture approach for our various government customers 
we are investing in communications capabilities to enable connectivity between existing air ground platforms  increase communications availability and bandwidth through more robust space systems  and leverage innovative communications concepts 
key programs in this area include jtrs  fcs  global positioning system  tracking and data relay satellite  ares crew launch vehicle and gmd 
investments were also made to support concepts that may lead to the development of next generation space intelligence systems 
along with increased funding to support these areas of architecture and network enabled capabilities development  we also maintained our investment levels in global missile defense and advanced missile defense concepts and technologies 
backlog n ss total backlog decreased by in compared with primarily due to revenues recognized on multi year orders received in prior years on fcs  gmd and c programs  partially offset by an increase in the international space station program 
total backlog decreased by in compared with due to revenues recognized on fcs and proprietary programs  partially offset by an increase in space exploration programs 
additional considerations items which could have a future impact on n ss operations include the following united launch alliance on december   we completed the transaction with lockheed martin corporation lockheed to create a joint venture named united launch alliance llc ula 
ula combines the production  engineering  test and launch operations associated with us government launches of boeing delta and lockheed atlas rockets 
in connection with the transaction  
table of contents we initially contributed net assets of million at december  the book value of our investment exceeds our proportionate share of ula s net assets 
this difference will be expensed ratably in future years 
based on the adjusted contributions and the conformed accounting policies established by ula  this amortization is expected to be approximately million annually for the next years 
in connection with the formation of ula  we and lockheed each committed to provide up to million in additional capital contributions and we each have agreed to extend a line of credit to ula of up to million to support its working capital requirements 
we and lockheed transferred performance responsibility for certain us government contracts to ula as of the closing date 
we and lockheed agreed to jointly guarantee the performance of those contracts to the extent required by the us government 
ula made a million earnings distribution to each partner during the fourth quarter of in conjunction with the distribution  we and lockheed committed to provide ula with additional capital contributions up to the amount of such distributions in the event ula does not have sufficient funds to make a required payment to us under the inventory supply agreement 
see note and note we agreed to indemnify ula through december  against potential non recoverability of  million of boeing delta inventories included in contributed assets plus  million of inventory subject to an inventory supply agreement which ends on march  since inception  ula sold million of inventories that were contributed by us 
as part of its integration  ula is continuing to assess the future of the delta ii program beyond what is currently on contract 
future decisions regarding the delta ii program could reduce our earnings by up to million 
we agreed to indemnify ula in the event ula is unable to obtain re pricing of certain contracts which we contributed to ula and to which we believe ula is entitled 
we will be responsible for any shortfall and may record up to million in pre tax losses related to these contracts 
sea launch the sea launch venture  in which we are a partner  provides ocean based launch services to commercial satellite customers 
we issued credit guarantees to creditors of the sea launch venture to assist it in obtaining financing and other support 
in the event we are required to perform on these guarantees  we believe we can recover a portion of the cost estimated at million through guarantees from the other venture partners 
we have also made loans directly to sea launch in the past 
in the event that sea launch is unable to repay those loans  we believe we can recover a portion of the cost estimated at million from the other venture partners 
the components of this exposure are as follows dollars in millions estimated maximum exposure established reserves estimated proceeds from recourse estimated net exposure credit guarantees partner loans principal and interest trade receivable from sea launch subcontract termination other receivables and inventory we made no additional capital contributions to the sea launch venture during the year ended december  our trade receivable increased from million at december  to 
table of contents million at december  the related allowance for losses increased from million at december  to million at december  reflecting sea launch s ongoing liquidity challenges 
the venture conducted five  zero and five successful launches for the years ended december    and  respectively 
the venture has incurred losses during  and the losses in and were due to the relatively low price of launches  driven by a depressed commercial satellite market and oversupply of launch vehicles as well as a high level of debt and debt servicing requirements 
the venture incurred losses in due to a delay in its launch manifest that was caused by a launch anomaly in january and unusually strong ocean currents at the launch site during november and december 
we suspended recording equity losses after writing our investment in and direct loans to sea launch down to zero in and accruing our obligation for third party guarantees on sea launch indebtedness 
we are not obligated to provide any further financial support to the sea launch venture 
however  in the event that we do extend additional financial support to sea launch in the future  we will recognize suspended losses as appropriate 
approximately million of sea launch s bank loans expire during in the event this amount is refinanced  boeing may be called upon to renew its credit guarantee to sea launch lenders  or  in the event sea launch is unable to obtain financing  boeing may be required to perform on the existing credit guarantee  which could put in default sea launch s other external debt of approximately million 
in the event sea launch is unable to refinance its debt or meet its other contractual obligations and we are unable to recover guarantees from the other venture partners  we could be required to pay up to million under credit guarantees  which could result in charges of up to million 
we continue to look at alternatives to address funding requirements for the venture

boeing capital corporation business environment and trends bcc s customer financing and investment portfolio at december  totaled  million  which was substantially collateralized by boeing produced commercial aircraft 
a substantial portion of bcc s portfolio is concentrated among us commercial airlines customers 
continued problems in the airline industry could have a negative impact on lease rates  airline credit ratings and aircraft valuations  and bcc s future results of operations could be adversely affected in the form of lower revenues  increased asset impairments  increased allowance for losses and increased redeployment costs 
continued problems in the airline industry could also affect our commercial airplanes and other segment 
the global credit crisis has affected the availability of credit generally 
while there are still sources of financing available for aircraft deliveries  the amount of third party financing available has declined 
we expect to finance some new deliveries of boeing aircraft in and expect our portfolio size to increase 
once capital market conditions improve  we believe the overall aircraft financing market should improve as well and lessen the need for us to provide financing for boeing aircraft deliveries  although we can provide no assurance when that will occur 
aircraft values and lease rates are impacted by the number and type of aircraft that are currently out of service 
approximately  western built commercial jet aircraft of current world fleet were parked as of december  including both in production and out of production aircraft types  of which over are not expected to return to service 
in december and  and of the western built commercial jet aircraft were parked 
aircraft valuations could decline if significant numbers of aircraft  particularly types with relatively few operators  are placed out of service

at december  and  bcc had million and million of assets that were held for sale or re lease of which million and million had firm contracts to be sold or placed on lease 
the increase in assets held for sale or re lease primarily resulted from the return of aircraft previously leased to midwest airlines midwest and the return of four aircraft previously leased to ata holdings corp  which filed for bankruptcy protection on april  additionally  aircraft subject to leases with a carrying value of approximately million are scheduled to be returned off lease in the next months 
these aircraft are being remarketed or the leases are being extended and million were committed at december  bcc enters into certain transactions with the other segment in the form of intercompany guarantees and other subsidies 

table of contents restructurings and restructuring requests as of december   bcc has received a number of requests from both domestic and foreign airlines to reduce lease or rental payments or to otherwise restructure obligations 
whether such requests will result in a material adverse impact on our earnings  cash flow or financial position depends on a number of factors including whether the request is granted  the type of aircraft  the collateral value and market rental rates of the returned aircraft 
in september  we agreed to a restructuring of lease terms with midwest  under which midwest returned of aircraft 
additionally  the agreement provides us with options to require midwest to return the remaining nine aircraft with varying notice periods 
we are pursuing remarketing options for the aircraft returned to date and expected to be returned in the future 
we do not expect that the return of these aircraft as a result of this restructuring will have a material effect on our financial position  results of operations or cash flow

the increase in inventories was driven by continued spending on production materials  airplane engines  and supplier advances during the iam strike  lower commercial airplane deliveries and the continued ramp up of the program 
we expect to generate positive operating cash flows in net cash provided by operating activities increased by  million to  million in  primarily due to an increase in net earnings 
net working capital improvements in reflect higher advances driven by commercial airplane orders and decreases in customer financing assets due to pre payment of certain notes receivable and normal portfolio run off  which were partially offset by an increase in inventories driven by the continued ramp up of the program

table of contents on january  standard poor s confirmed boeing s a credit rating but changed its outlook from stable to negative  citing the challenging commercial aviation environment 
capital resources we have substantial borrowing capacity 
we and bcc have commercial paper programs that continue to serve as significant potential sources of short term liquidity 
throughout and at december   neither we nor bcc had any commercial paper borrowings outstanding 
currently  we have  million  million exclusively available for bcc of unused borrowing on revolving credit line agreements  of which  million is a year credit facility expiring in november and  million is a day revolving credit facility expiring in november both the year and day credit facilities have a one year term out option which allows us to extend the maturity of any borrowings one year beyond the aforementioned expiration dates 
in  we renewed the  million day revolving credit facility  of which million is allocated to bcc 
we anticipate that these credit lines will primarily serve as backup liquidity to support possible commercial paper borrowings in bcc has a  million shelf registration statement that was declared effective on november  under which it may offer debt securities 
we believe our ability to access external capital resources should be sufficient to satisfy existing short term and long term commitments and plans  and also to provide adequate financial flexibility to take advantage of potential strategic business opportunities should they arise within the next year 
at this point in time  our access to liquidity sources has not been materially impacted by the current credit environment  and we do not expect that it will be materially impacted in the near future 
there can be no assurance  however  that the cost or availability of future borrowings  if any  under our commercial paper program  in the debt markets or our credit facilities will not be materially impacted by the ongoing capital market disruptions

  and r sfas  we recognize the funded status of our defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans  with a corresponding after tax adjustment to accumulated other comprehensive loss 
the annual remeasurement of our pension and other postretirement plans resulted in a net  million decrease in shareholders equity  primarily due to declines in our pension plan assets  as a result of declines in financial markets 
as a result of the pension remeasurement  we have negative shareholders equity at december  we do not expect negative shareholders equity to affect our ability to pay dividends or comply with debt covenants 
the annual remeasurement of our pension and other postretirement plans resulted in a net  million increase in shareholders equity 
at december  our pension plans were  million underfunded as measured under gaap and  in the aggregate  approximately  million underfunded as measured under the employee retirement income security act erisa 
the difference in the funded status between the two standards is mostly attributable to the fact that erisa uses average asset values and discount rates  whereas gaap requires us to measure our plan assets and discount our benefit obligations as of the end of the year 
required contributions under erisa  as well as rules governing funding of our non us pension plans  are not expected to exceed million in we anticipate contributing approximately million to our pension plans in absent a recovery of asset values or higher interest rates  we will be required to make higher contributions in future years 
as of december   we were in compliance with the covenants for our debt and credit facilities

we are not able to reasonably estimate the timing of future cash flows related to the remaining  million 
our income tax obligations are excluded from the table above 
see note pension and other postretirement benefits pension cash requirements are based on an estimate of our minimum funding requirements  pursuant to erisa regulations  although we may make additional discretionary contributions 
estimates of other postretirement benefits are based on both our estimated future benefit payments and the estimated contributions to a single plan that is funded through a trust 
purchase obligations purchase obligations represent contractual agreements to purchase goods or services that are legally binding  specify a fixed  minimum or range of quantities  specify a fixed  minimum  variable  or indexed price provision  and specify approximate timing of the transaction 
in addition  the agreements are not cancelable without substantial penalty 
purchase obligations include amounts recorded as well as amounts that are not recorded on the statements of financial position 
approximately of the purchase obligations disclosed above are reimbursable to us pursuant to cost type government contracts 
purchase obligations not recorded on the consolidated statement of financial position production related purchase obligations not recorded on the consolidated statement of financial position include agreements for production goods  tooling costs  electricity and natural gas contracts  property  plant and equipment  and other miscellaneous production related obligations 
the most significant obligation relates to inventory procurement contracts 
we have entered into certain significant inventory procurement contracts that specify determinable prices and quantities  and long term delivery timeframes 
in addition  we purchase raw materials on behalf of our suppliers 
these agreements require suppliers and vendors to be prepared to build and deliver items in sufficient time to meet our production schedules 
the need for such arrangements with suppliers and vendors arises from the extended production planning horizon for many of our products 
a significant portion of these inventory commitments is supported by firm contracts and or has historically resulted in settlement 
table of contents through reimbursement from customers for penalty payments to the supplier should the customer not take delivery 
these amounts are also included in our forecasts of costs for program and contract accounting 
some inventory procurement contracts may include escalation adjustments 
in these limited cases  we have included our best estimate of the effect of the escalation adjustment in the amounts disclosed in the table above 
industrial participation agreements we have entered into various industrial participation agreements with certain customers outside of the us to facilitate economic flow back and or technology transfer to their businesses or government agencies as the result of their procurement of goods and or services from us 
these commitments may be satisfied by our placement of direct work or vendor orders for supplies  opportunities to bid on supply contracts  transfer of technology or other forms of assistance 
however  in certain cases  our commitments may be satisfied through other parties such as our vendors who purchase supplies from our non us customers 
we do not commit to industrial participation agreements unless a contract for sale of our products or services is signed 
in certain cases  penalties could be imposed if we do not meet our industrial participation commitments 
during  we incurred no such penalties 
as of december   we have outstanding industrial participation agreements totaling billion that extend through purchase order commitments associated with industrial participation agreements are included in the table above 
to be eligible for such a purchase order commitment from us  a foreign supplier must have sufficient capability to meet our requirements and must be competitive in cost  quality and schedule 
purchase obligations recorded on the consolidated statement of financial position purchase obligations recorded on the consolidated statement of financial position primarily include accounts payable and certain other liabilities including accrued compensation and dividends payable 
commercial commitments the following table summarizes our commercial commitments outstanding as of december  dollars in millions total amounts committed maximum amount of loss less than year years years after years standby letters of credit and surety bonds commercial aircraft financing commitments total commercial commitments commercial aircraft financing commitments include commitments to arrange or provide financing related to aircraft on order  under option for deliveries or proposed as part of sales campaigns based on estimated earliest funding dates 
based on historical experience  we currently do not anticipate that all of these commitments will be exercised by our customers  see note industrial revenue bonds we utilize industrial revenue bonds irb to finance the purchase and or construction of real and personal property  see note contingent obligations we have significant contingent obligations that arise in the ordinary course of business  which include the following legal various legal proceedings  claims and investigations are pending against us 
legal contingencies are discussed in note  including our contesting the default termination of the a aircraft  employment and benefits litigation brought by several of our employees  and litigation arbitration involving bssi programs 

table of contents environmental remediation we are involved with various environmental remediation activities and have recorded a liability of million at december  for additional information  see note income taxes we have recorded a net liability of  million at december  for uncertain tax positions 
for further discussion of these contingencies  see note off balance sheet arrangements we are a party to certain off balance sheet arrangements including certain guarantees 
for discussion of these arrangements  see note critical accounting policies contract accounting contract accounting involves a judgmental process of estimating the total sales and costs for each contract  which results in the development of estimated cost of sales percentages 
for each contract  the amount reported as cost of sales is determined by applying the estimated cost of sales percentage to the amount of revenue recognized 
due to the size  length of time and nature of many of our contracts  the estimation of total sales and costs through completion is complicated and subject to many variables 
total contract sales estimates are based on negotiated contract prices and quantities  modified by our assumptions regarding contract options  change orders  incentive and award provisions associated with technical performance  and price adjustment clauses such as inflation or index based clauses 
the majority of these contracts are with the us government 
generally the price is based on estimated cost to produce the product or service plus profit 
the federal acquisition regulations provide guidance on the types of cost that will be reimbursed in establishing contract price 
total contract cost estimates are largely based on negotiated or estimated purchase contract terms  historical performance trends  business base and other economic projections 
factors that influence these estimates include inflationary trends  technical and schedule risk  internal and subcontractor performance trends  business volume assumptions  asset utilization  and anticipated labor agreements 
the development of cost of sales percentages involves procedures and personnel in all areas that provide financial or production information on the status of contracts 
estimates of each significant contract s sales and costs are reviewed and reassessed quarterly 
any changes in these estimates result in recognition of cumulative adjustments to the contract profit in the period in which changes are made 
due to the significance of judgment in the estimation process described above  it is likely that materially different cost of sales amounts could be recorded if we used different assumptions or if the underlying circumstances were to change 
changes in underlying assumptions estimates  supplier performance  or circumstances may adversely or positively affect financial performance in future periods 
if the combined gross margin for all contracts in ids for all of had been estimated to be higher or lower by  it would have increased or decreased pre tax income for the year by approximately million 
program accounting program accounting requires the demonstrated ability to reliably estimate the relationship of sales to costs for the defined program accounting quantity 
a program consists of the estimated number of units accounting quantity of a product to be produced in a continuing  long term production effort for delivery under existing and anticipated contracts 
the determination of the accounting quantity is limited by the ability to make reasonably dependable estimates of the revenue and cost of existing and 
table of contents anticipated contracts 
for each program  the amount reported as cost of sales is determined by applying the estimated cost of sales percentage for the total remaining program to the amount of sales recognized for airplanes delivered and accepted by the customer 
factors that must be estimated include program accounting quantity  sales price  labor and employee benefit costs  material costs  procured part costs  major component costs  overhead costs  program tooling costs  and routine warranty costs 
estimation of the accounting quantity for each program takes into account several factors that are indicative of the demand for the particular program  such as firm orders  letters of intent from prospective customers  and market studies 
total estimated program sales are determined by estimating the model mix and sales price for all unsold units within the accounting quantity  added together with the sales prices for all undelivered units under contract 
the sales prices for all undelivered units within the accounting quantity include an escalation adjustment that is based on projected escalation rates  consistent with typical sales contract terms 
cost estimates are based largely on negotiated and anticipated contracts with suppliers  historical performance trends  and business base and other economic projections 
factors that influence these estimates include production rates  internal and subcontractor performance trends  customer and or supplier claims or assertions  asset utilization  anticipated labor agreements  and inflationary trends 
to ensure reliability in our estimates  we employ a rigorous estimating process that is reviewed and updated on a quarterly basis 
changes in estimates are normally recognized on a prospective basis  when estimated costs to complete a program exceed estimated revenues from undelivered units in the accounting quantity  a loss provision is recorded in the current period for the estimated loss on all undelivered units in the accounting quantity 
the program method of accounting allocates tooling and production costs over the accounting quantity for each program 
because of the higher unit production costs experienced at the beginning of a new program and substantial investment required for initial tooling  new commercial aircraft programs  such as the program  typically have lower margins than established programs 
due to the significance of judgment in the estimation process described above  it is likely that materially different cost of sales amounts could be recorded if we used different assumptions  or if the underlying circumstances were to change 
changes in underlying assumptions estimates  supplier performance  or circumstances may adversely or positively affect financial performance in future periods 
if combined cost of sales percentages for commercial airplane programs  excluding the program  for all of had been estimated to be higher or lower by  it would have increased or decreased pre tax income for the year by approximately million 
the program is in a reach forward loss position 
absent changes in the estimated revenues or costs  subsequent deliveries are recorded at zero margin 
reductions to the estimated loss in subsequent periods are spread over all undelivered units in the accounting quantity  whereas increases to the estimated loss are recorded immediately 
aircraft valuation impairment review for assets under operating leases and held for re lease we evaluate for impairment assets under operating lease or assets held for re lease when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the expected undiscounted cash flow from the asset may be less than its carrying value 
we use various assumptions when determining the expected undiscounted cash flow including the expected future lease rates  lease terms  residual value of the asset  periods in which the asset may be held in preparation for a follow on lease  maintenance costs  remarketing costs and the remaining economic life of the asset 
when we determine that impairment is indicated for an asset  the amount of impairment expense recorded is the excess of the carrying value over the fair value of the asset 

table of contents had future lease rates on assets evaluated for impairment been lower  we estimate that we would have incurred additional impairment expense of million for the year ended december  allowance for losses on customer financing receivables the allowance for losses on receivables valuation provision is used to provide for potential impairment of receivables in the consolidated statements of financial position 
the balance represents an estimate of probable but unconfirmed losses in the receivables portfolio 
the estimate is based on various qualitative and quantitative factors  including historical loss experience  collateral values  and results of individual credit and collectibility reviews 
the adequacy of the allowance is assessed quarterly 
three primary factors influencing the level of our allowance are customer credit ratings  collateral values and default rates 
if each customer s credit rating were upgraded or downgraded by one major rating category at december   the allowance would have decreased by million or increased by million 
if the collateral values were higher or lower at december   the allowance would have decreased by million or increased by million 
if the cumulative default rates used for each rating category should increase or decrease  the allowance would have increased by million or decreased by million 
lease residual values equipment under operating leases is carried at cost less accumulated depreciation and is depreciated to estimated residual value using the straight line method over the period that we project we will hold the asset for lease 
estimates used in determining residual values significantly impact the amount and timing of depreciation expense for equipment under operating leases 
if the estimated residual values declined at december   this would result in a future cumulative pre tax earnings impact of million recognized over the remaining depreciable periods  of which million would be recognized in goodwill and indefinite lived intangible impairments goodwill and other acquired intangible assets with indefinite lives are not amortized but are annually tested for impairment  and when an event occurs or circumstances change such that it is reasonably possible that an impairment may exist 
april is our annual testing date 
we test goodwill for impairment by first comparing the book value of net assets to the fair value of the related operations 
if the fair value is determined to be less than book value  a second step is performed to compute the amount of the impairment 
in this process  a fair value for goodwill is estimated  based in part on the fair value of the operations  and is compared to its carrying value 
the shortfall of the fair value below carrying value represents the amount of goodwill impairment 
we estimate the fair values of the related operations using discounted cash flows 
forecasts of future cash flows are based on our best estimate of future sales and operating costs  based primarily on existing firm orders  expected future orders  contracts with suppliers  labor agreements  and general market conditions 
changes in these forecasts could significantly change the amount of impairment recorded  if any 
the cash flow forecasts are adjusted by an appropriate discount rate derived from our market capitalization plus a suitable control premium at the date of evaluation 
therefore  changes in the stock price may also affect the amount of impairment recorded 
since the date of our annual impairment test on april  we have updated our forecasts to reflect among other things the global economic downturn  delays in development programs  and the impacts of the recent iam strike 
because of these changes in circumstances  we have verified that goodwill is not impaired as of december  however  further changes in our forecasts or decreases in the value of our common stock could cause book values of certain operations to exceed their fair values which may result in goodwill impairment charges in future periods 
a decrease in the estimated fair value of any of our operations will have no impact on the carrying value of goodwill 

table of contents as of december  and  we had million of indefinite lived intangible assets related to the jeppesen and aviall brand and trade names acquired in business combinations 
we test these intangibles for impairment by comparing their carrying value to current projections of discounted cash flows attributable to the brand and trade names 
any excess carrying value over the amount of discounted cash flows represents the amount of the impairment 
a decrease in the discounted cash flows could result in an impairment charge of approximately million 
postretirement plans substantially all our employees are covered by defined benefit pension plans 
we also have other postretirement benefits consisting principally of healthcare coverage for eligible retirees and qualifying dependents 
accounting rules require an annual measurement of our projected obligations and plan assets 
these measurements require several assumptions  the most significant of which are the discount rate  the expected long term rate of asset return  and medical trend rate rate of growth for medical costs 
changes in assumptions can significantly affect our future annual expense and projected benefit obligations 
in addition  as a result of our adoption of sfas  differences between actual and expected returns on assets  changes in assumptions  and changes in plan provisions could significantly increase or decrease shareholders equity net of taxes at future measurement dates 
effective for december   sfas requires us to measure our plan assets and benefit obligations as of december  our year end 
previously  our annual measurement date was september we use a discount rate that is based on a point in time estimate as of our december annual measurement date 
changes in the discount rate will increase or decrease our recorded liabilities with a corresponding adjustment to shareholders equity as of the measurement date 
in the following table  we show the sensitivity of our pension and other postretirement benefit plan liabilities and net periodic cost to a basis point change in the discount rate 
as of december  in millions change in discount rate increase bps change in discount rate decrease bps pension plans dollars dollars projected benefit obligation pensions net periodic pension cost other postretirement benefit plans accumulated postretirement benefit obligation net periodic postretirement benefit cost pension expense is also sensitive to changes in the expected long term rate of asset return 
a decrease or increase of basis points in the expected long term rate of asset return would have increased or decreased net periodic pension expense by million 
for  we are reducing our expected rate of return on pension plan assets by basis points to which will increase net periodic pension cost by approximately million 
differences between actual and expected returns can affect future year s pension cost 
the asset balance used to calculate the expected return on pension plan assets is a calculated value that recognizes changes in the fair value of assets over a five year period 
losses incurred on our pension investments in will increase net periodic pension cost by approximately million through a combination of lower expected returns on assets and higher amortization of actuarial losses 
absent a recovery of asset values or higher interest rates or higher contributions  net periodic pension expense will increase further in future years 

table of contents the assumed medical trend rates have a significant effect on the following year s expense  recorded liabilities and shareholders equity 
in the following table  we show the sensitivity of our other postretirement benefit plan liabilities and net periodic cost to a basis point change

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk we have financial instruments that are subject to interest rate risk  principally investments  fixed rate debt obligations  and customer financing assets and liabilities 
historically  we have not experienced material gains or losses on these instruments due to interest rate changes 
additionally  bcc uses interest rate swaps with certain debt obligations to manage exposure to interest rate changes 
the principal source of bcc s market risk relates to interest rate changes 
exposure to this risk is managed by generally matching the profile of bcc s liabilities with that of bcc s assets in relation to amount and terms such as expected maturities and fixed versus floating interest rates 
interest rate derivatives are tools used to assist with this matching and are not used for speculative purposes 
matching is a dynamic process affected by changes in our assets that may require adjusting our liabilities and or derivatives 
although many of the assets  liabilities and derivatives affected by a change in interest rates are not traded  if we had an immediate  one time  basis point increase in market rates at december   we estimate that the tax adjusted net fair value of these items would have decreased by million compared to a decrease of million at december  based on the portfolio of other boeing existing debt  the unhedged exposure to interest rate risk is not material 
the investors in the fixed rate debt obligations that we issue do not generally have the right to demand we pay off these obligations prior to maturity 
therefore  exposure to interest rate risk is not believed to be material for our fixed rate debt 
foreign currency exchange rate risk we are subject to foreign currency exchange rate risk relating to receipts from customers and payments to suppliers in foreign currencies 
we use foreign currency forward and option contracts to hedge the price risk associated with firmly committed and forecasted foreign denominated payments and receipts related to our ongoing business 
foreign currency contracts are sensitive to changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
at december   a increase in the exchange rate in our portfolio of foreign currency contracts would have decreased our unrealized losses by million and a decrease in the exchange rate would have decreased our unrealized losses by million 
consistent with the use of these contracts to neutralize the effect of exchange rate fluctuations  such unrealized losses or gains would be offset by corresponding gains or losses  respectively  in the remeasurement of the underlying transactions being hedged 
when taken together  these forward currency contracts and the offsetting underlying commitments do not create material market risk
