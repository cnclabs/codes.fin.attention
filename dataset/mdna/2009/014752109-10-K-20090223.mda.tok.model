item management s discussion and analysis of financial conditions and results of operations overview alexander s  inc nyse alx is a real estate investment trust reit engaged in leasing  managing  developing and redeveloping properties 
all references to we  us  our  company  and alexander s  refer to alexander s  inc and its consolidated subsidiaries 
we are managed by  and our properties are leased and developed by  vornado realty trust vornado nyse vno 
we have seven properties in the greater new york city metropolitan area including the lexington avenue property  a  square foot multi use building in manhattan  and the kings plaza regional shopping center located in brooklyn 
we compete with a large number of real estate property owners and developers 
our success depends upon  among other factors  trends of national and local economies  the financial condition and operating results of current and prospective tenants  the availability and cost of capital  interest rates  construction and renovation costs  taxes  governmental regulations and legislation  population trends  zoning laws  and our ability to lease  sublease or sell our properties  at profitable levels 
our success is also subject to our ability to refinance existing debt as it comes due and on acceptable terms 
in the second half of the residential mortgage and capital markets began showing signs of stress  primarily in the form of escalating default rates on sub prime mortgages  declining home values and increasing inventory nationwide 
in  the credit crisis spread to the broader commercial credit and financial markets resulting in illiquidity and volatility in the bond and equity markets 
we are currently in an economic recession  which has negatively affected all businesses  including ours 
during the past year  real estate transactions have diminished significantly and capitalization rates have risen 
our real estate portfolio may be affected by declining demand for office and retail space and tenant bankruptcies  store closures  lower occupancy and effective rents  which would result in a corresponding decrease in net income  funds from operations and cash flow 
for example  circuit city  a tenant which leases space at our rego park i location aggregating  square feet  approximately  of annual property rental income  recently announced that it is liquidating pursuant to bankruptcy court approval 
as a result  we wrote off approximately  of unamortized costs at december   including tenant improvements and receivables arising from the straight lining of rent 
year ended december  financial results summary net income for the year ended december  was  or per diluted share  compared to net income of  or per diluted share  for the year ended december  funds from operations ffo for the year ended december  was  or per diluted share  compared to ffo of  or per diluted share  for the year ended december net income and ffo for the year ended december  include  or per diluted share  for the reversal of a portion of stock appreciation rights sars compensation expense  compared to  or per diluted share  for such reversal in the prior year 
rego park shopping center the development at our rego park ii location consists of a  square foot shopping center on four levels and a parking deck containing approximately  spaces 
as of december    was drawn on the construction loan 
the loan has an interest rate of libor plus at december   and matures in december  with a one year extension option 
the shopping center will be anchored by a  square foot century department store  a  square foot home depot and  square foot kohl s 
flushing in february  we leased the flushing property to a developer for the remainder of our ground lease term 
overview continued stock appreciation rights on september and october   steven roth  the chairman of our board of directors and chief executive officer  exercised an aggregate of  of his existing sars  which were scheduled to expire on march   and received gross proceeds of  special dividend on september   our board of directors declared a special dividend of per share  or  in the aggregate  which was paid on october   to stockholders of record on october  the dividend was attributable to the liquidation of the wholly owned lexington avenue taxable reit subsidiary into alexander s 
critical accounting policies and estimates our financial statements are prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  which requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
set forth below is a summary of our accounting policies that we believe are critical to the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
this summary should be read in conjunction with a more complete discussion of our accounting policies included in note to the consolidated financial statements in this annual report on form k 
real estate real estate is carried at cost  net of accumulated depreciation and amortization 
as of december  and  the carrying amount of our real estate  net of accumulated depreciation  was  and  respectively 
depreciation is provided on a straight line basis over the assets estimated useful lives  which range from to years 
betterments  significant renewals and certain costs directly related to the acquisition  improvement and leasing of real estate are capitalized 
maintenance and repairs are charged to operations as incurred 
as real estate is undergoing development activities  all property operating expenses  including interest expense  are capitalized to the cost of the real property to the extent that we believe such costs are recoverable through the value of the property 
the recognition of depreciation expense requires estimates by us of the useful life of each property and improvement  as well as an allocation of the costs associated with a property to its various components 
if we do not allocate these costs appropriately or incorrectly estimate the useful lives of our real estate  depreciation expense could be misstated 
our properties  including any related intangible assets  are individually reviewed for impairment if events or circumstances change indicating that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable 
an impairment exists when the carrying amount of an asset exceeds the aggregate projected future cash flows over our anticipated holding period on an undiscounted basis 
an impairment loss is measured based on the excess of the property s carrying amount over its estimated fair value 
impairment analyses are based on our current plans  intended holding periods and available market information at the time the analyses are prepared 
if our estimates of the projected future cash flows  our anticipated holding period for properties  or the estimated fair value of properties change based on market conditions or otherwise  our evaluation of impairment charges may be different and such differences could be material to our consolidated financial statements 
the evaluation of anticipated cash flows is subjective and is based  in part  on assumptions regarding future occupancy  rental rates and capital requirements that could differ materially from actual results 
plans to hold properties over longer periods decrease the likelihood of recording impairment losses 
allowance for doubtful accounts we periodically evaluate the collectibility of amounts due from tenants and maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts  and  as of december  and  respectively for estimated losses resulting from the inability of tenants to make required payments under the lease agreements 
we also maintain an allowance for receivables arising from the straight lining of rents  if necessary 
this receivable arises from earnings recognized in excess of amounts currently due under the lease agreements 
as of december  and  there were no allowances for receivables arising from the straight lining of rents 
we exercise judgment in establishing these allowances and consider payment history and current credit status in developing these estimates 
these estimates may differ from actual results  which could be material to our consolidated financial statements 
critical accounting policies and estimates continued revenue recognition we have the following revenue sources and revenue recognition policies base rent revenue arising from tenant leases these rents are recognized over the non cancelable term of the related leases on a straight line basis  which includes the effects of rent steps and free rent abatements under the leases 
we commence rental revenue recognition when the tenant takes possession of the leased space and the leased space is substantially ready for its intended use 
in addition  in circumstances where we provide a tenant improvement allowance for improvements that are owned by the tenant  we recognize the allowance as a reduction of rental revenue on a straight line basis over the term of the lease 
percentage rent revenue arising from retail tenant leases that is contingent upon the sales of tenants exceeding defined thresholds these rents are recognized in accordance with staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition  which states that this contingent revenue is only to be recognized after the contingency has been removed ie  the sales threshold has been achieved 
expense reimbursement revenue arising from tenant leases which provide for the recovery of all or a portion of the operating expenses and real estate taxes of the respective properties this revenue is accrued in the same periods as the expenses are incurred 
parking income revenue arising from the rental of parking space at our properties this income is recognized as cash is received 
we assess  among other things  the collectibility of revenue before recognition 
if we incorrectly assess collectibility of revenue  net earnings and assets could be misstated 
stock appreciation rights stock appreciation rights sars are granted at of the market price of our common stock on the date of grant 
because the sars were granted in  they are accounted for under the intrinsic value method in accordance with fasb interpretation fin  an interpretation accounting principles board apb opinions and accordingly  compensation expense for each sar is measured by the excess of the stock price at the current balance sheet date over the stock price at the previous balance sheet date 
if the stock price is lower at the current balance sheet date  previously recognized expense is reversed  but not below zero 
income taxes we operate in a manner intended to enable us to continue to qualify as a reit under sections through of the internal revenue code of  as amended the code 
in order to maintain our qualification as a reit  we are required  among other conditions  to distribute as dividends to our stockholders at least of annual reit taxable income 
as of december  and  we had net operating loss carryovers nols of approximately  and  respectively 
pursuant to the code  our nols generally would be available to offset the amount of our reit taxable income that would otherwise be required to be distributed as dividends to our stockholders 
accordingly  no regular dividends were paid in and prior to its liquidation on september   our wholly owned subsidiary  residential llc  was treated as a taxable reit subsidiary trs 
the trs was subject to income tax at regular corporate tax rates 
our nols were not available to offset taxable income of the trs 
in the years ended december  and  the trs paid  and  respectively 
under statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  deferred income taxes would be recognized for temporary differences between the financial reporting basis of assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis and for operating loss and tax credit carryforwards based on enacted tax rates expected to be in effect when such amounts are realized or settled 
however  deferred tax assets are recognized only to the extent that it is more likely than not that they will be realized based on consideration of available evidence  including tax planning strategies and other factors 
as of december  and  there were no deferred tax assets or liabilities on our consolidated balance sheets 
recently issued accounting literature in september  the fasb issued sfas no 
 fair value measurements 
sfas no 
defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and expands disclosures about fair value measurements 
sfas no 
became effective for our financial assets and liabilities on january  the fasb has deferred the implementation of the provisions of sfas no 
relating to certain non financial assets and liabilities until january  sfas no 
did not materially affect how we measure and value financial assets and will not have a material impact on how we measure and value non financial assets 
in february  the fasb issued sfas no 
 the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities 
sfas permits companies to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value 
sfas is effective for us on january  we did not elected the fair value option for any of our existing financial instruments on the effective date and have not determined whether or not we will elect this option for any eligible financial instruments we acquire in the future 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
r  business combinations 
sfas no 
r broadens the guidance of sfas no 
 extending its applicability to all transactions and other events in which one entity obtains control over one or more other businesses 
it broadens the fair value measurement and recognition of assets acquired  liabilities assumed  and interests transferred as a result of business combinations  and stipulates that acquisition related costs be expensed rather than included as part of the basis of the acquisition 
sfas no 
r expands required disclosures to improve the ability to evaluate the nature and financial effects of business combinations 
sfas no 
r is effective for all transactions entered into  on or after january  we believe that the adoption of this standard on january   will not have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
 noncontrolling interests in consolidated financial statements an amendment of arb no 
sfas no 
requires a noncontrolling interest in a subsidiary to be reported as equity and the amount of consolidated net income specifically attributable to the noncontrolling interest to be identified in the consolidated financial statements 
sfas no 
also calls for consistency in the manner of reporting changes in the parent s ownership interest and requires fair value measurement of any noncontrolling equity investment retained in a deconsolidation 
sfas no 
is effective on january  we believe that the adoption of this standard on january   will not have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements

funds from operations ffo for the years ended december  and ffo is computed in accordance with the definition adopted by the board of governors of the national association of real estate investment trusts nareit 
nareit defines ffo as net income or loss determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles gaap  excluding extraordinary items as defined under gaap and gains or losses from sales of previously depreciated operating real estate assets  plus specified non cash items  such as real estate asset depreciation and amortization  and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures 
ffo and ffo per diluted share are used by management  investors and industry analysts as supplemental measures of operating performance of equity reits 
ffo and ffo per diluted share should be evaluated along with gaap net income and income per diluted share the most directly comparable gaap measures  as well as cash flow from operating activities  investing activities and financing activities  in evaluating the operating performance of equity reits 
management believes that ffo and ffo per diluted share are helpful to investors as supplemental performance measures because these measures exclude the effect of depreciation  amortization and gains or losses from sales of real estate  all of which are based on historical costs which implicitly assumes that the value of real estate diminishes predictably over time 
since real estate values instead have historically risen or fallen with market conditions  these non gaap measures can facilitate comparisons of operating performance between periods and among other equity reits 
ffo does not represent cash generated from operating activities in accordance with gaap and is not necessarily indicative of cash available to fund cash needs as disclosed in the company s statements of cash flows 
ffo should not be considered as an alternative to net income as an indicator of the company s operating performance or as an alternative to cash flows as a measure of liquidity 
ffo for the year ended december  was  or per diluted share  compared to  or per diluted share  for the year ended december  ffo for the year ended december  includes  or per diluted share  for the reversal of a portion of sars compensation expense  compared to  or per diluted share  for such reversal in the prior year

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we have exposure to fluctuations in interest rates  which are sensitive to many factors that are beyond our control
