item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in this annual report on form k 
overview we are a biopharmaceutical company focused on the discovery  development and commercialization of therapeutic products for diseases such as diabetes and cancer 
our lead product candidate  afresa  is an ultra rapid acting insulin that has completed phase 
table of contents clinical trials evaluating its safety and efficacy in the treatment of diabetes 
we believe that the performance characteristics  unique kinetics  convenience and ease of use of afresa may have the potential to change the way diabetes is treated 
we are a development stage enterprise and have incurred significant losses since our inception in as of december   we have incurred a cumulative net loss of billion 
to date  we have not generated any product revenues and have funded our operations primarily through the sale of equity securities 
as discussed below in liquidity and capital resources  if we are unable to obtain additional funding  there will be substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern 
we do not expect to record sales of any product prior to regulatory approval and commercialization of afresa 
we currently do not have the required approvals to market any of our product candidates  and we may not receive such approvals 
we may not be profitable even if we succeed in commercializing any of our product candidates 
we expect to make substantial expenditures and to incur additional operating losses for at least the next several years as we continue the clinical development of afresa for the treatment of diabetes  expand our manufacturing operations for afresa to meet our currently anticipated commercial production needs  expand our other research  discovery and development programs  expand our proprietary technosphere platform technology and develop additional applications for the pulmonary delivery of other drugs  and enter into sales and marketing collaborations with other companies  if available on commercially reasonable terms  or develop these capabilities ourselves 
our business is subject to significant risks  including but not limited to the risks inherent in our ongoing clinical trials and the regulatory approval process  the results of our research and development efforts  competition from other products and technologies and uncertainties associated with obtaining and enforcing patent rights 
research and development expenses our research and development expenses consist mainly of costs associated with the clinical trials of our product candidates that have not yet received regulatory approval for marketing and for which no alternative future use has been identified 
this includes the salaries  benefits and stock based compensation of research and development personnel  raw materials  such as insulin purchases  laboratory supplies and materials  facility costs  costs for consultants and related contract research  licensing fees  and depreciation of laboratory equipment 
we track research and development costs by the type of cost incurred 
we partially offset research and development expenses with the recognition of estimated amounts receivable from the state of connecticut pursuant to a program under which we can exchange qualified research and development income tax credits for cash 
included in research and development expenses for the year ended december  were purchases of insulin totaling million and precursor raw material of million 
our research and development staff conducts our internal research and development activities  which include research  product development  clinical development  manufacturing and related activities 
this staff is located in our facilities in valencia  california  paramus  new jersey  and danbury  connecticut 
we expense the majority of research and development costs as we incur them 
clinical development timelines  likelihood of success and total costs vary widely 
we are focused primarily on advancing afresa through regulatory filings 
based on the results of preclinical studies  we plan to develop additional applications of our technosphere technology 
additionally  we anticipate that we will continue to determine which research and development projects to pursue  and how much funding to direct to each project  on an ongoing basis  in response to the scientific and clinical success of each product candidate 
we cannot be certain when any revenues from the commercialization of our products will commence 
at this time  due to the risks inherent in the clinical trial process and given the early stage of development of our product candidates other than afresa  we are unable to estimate with any certainty the costs that we will incur in the continued development of our product candidates for commercialization 
the costs required to complete the development of afresa will be largely dependent the cost and efficiency of our manufacturing process and discussions with the fda on its requirements 

table of contents general and administrative expenses our general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries  benefits and stock based compensation for administrative  finance  business development  human resources  legal and information systems support personnel 
in addition  general and administrative expenses include professional service fees and business insurance costs 
critical accounting policies we have based our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations on our financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities and expenses 
we evaluate our estimates and judgments on an ongoing basis 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making estimates of expenses such as stock option expenses and judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the significant accounting policies that are critical to the judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements are described in more detail below 
impairment of long lived assets assessing long lived assets for impairment requires us to make assumptions and judgments regarding the carrying value of these assets 
we evaluate long lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable 
the assets are considered to be impaired if we determine that the carrying value may not be recoverable based upon our assessment of the following events or changes in circumstances significant changes in our strategic business objectives and utilization of the assets  a determination that the carrying value of such assets cannot be recovered through undiscounted cash flows  loss of legal ownership or title to the assets  or the impact of significant negative industry or economic trends 
if we believe our assets to be impaired  the impairment we recognize is the amount by which the carrying value of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets 
any write downs would be treated as permanent reductions in the carrying amount of the asset and an operating loss would be recognized 
in addition  we base the useful lives and related amortization or depreciation expense on our estimate of the useful lives of the assets 
if a change were to occur in any of the above mentioned factors or estimates  our reported results could materially change 
to date  we have had recurring operating losses  and the recoverability of our long lived assets is contingent upon executing our business plan 
if we are unable to execute our business plan  we may be required to write down the value of our long lived assets in future periods 
clinical trial expenses our clinical trial accrual process seeks to account for expenses resulting from our obligations under contract with vendors  consultants  and clinical site agreements in connection with conducting clinical trials 
the financial terms of these contracts are subject to negotiations which vary from contract to contract and may result in payment flows that do not match the periods over which materials or services are provided to us under such contracts 
our objective is to reflect the appropriate trial expenses in our financial statements by matching period expenses with period services and efforts expended 
we account for these expenses according to the progress of the trial as measured by patient progression and the timing of various aspects of the trial 
we determine accrual estimates through discussions with internal clinical personnel and outside service providers as to the progress or state of completion of trials  or the services completed 
service provider status is then compared to the contractual obligated fee to be paid for such services 
during the course of a clinical trial  we adjust our rate of clinical expense recognition if actual results differ from our estimates 
in the event that we do not identify certain costs that have begun to be incurred or we underestimate or overestimate the level of services performed or the costs of such services  our reported expenses for a period would be too low or too high 
the date on which certain services commence  the level of services performed on or before a given date and the cost of the services are often judgmental 
we make these judgments based upon the facts and circumstances known to us in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 

table of contents stock based compensation on january   the company adopted the provisions of fasb statement no 
r  which is a revision of fasb statement no 
 accounting for stock based compensation fasb statement no 

prior to january   the company accounted for employee stock options and the employee stock purchase plan using the intrinsic value method in accordance with accounting principles board apb opinion no 
apb no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and adopted the disclosure only alternative of fasb statement no 
fasb statement no 
r eliminated the intrinsic value method of accounting for stock options which the company followed until december  further  fasb statement no 
r requires all share based payments to employees  including grants of stock options and the compensatory elements of employee stock purchase plans  to be recognized in the income statement based upon the fair value of the awards at the grant date 
upon adoption of fasb statement no 
r  the company selected the modified prospective transition method whereby unvested awards at the date of adoption  as well as awards that are granted  modified or settled after the date of adoption  will be measured and accounted for in accordance with fasb statement no 
r 
measurement and attribution of compensation cost for awards unvested as of january  is based on the same estimate of the grant date or modification date fair value and the same attribution method straight line used previously under fasb statement no 
our consolidated financial statements as of and for the years ended december  and reflect the impact of fasb statement no 
r 
in accordance with the modified prospective transition method  our consolidated financial statements for prior periods have not been restated to reflect  and do not include  the impact of fasb statement r 
accounting for income taxes we must make management judgments when determining our provision for income taxes  our deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against our net deferred tax assets 
at december   we have established a valuation allowance of million against all of our net deferred tax asset balance  due to uncertainties related to our deferred tax assets as a result of our history of operating losses 
the valuation allowance is based on our estimates of taxable income by jurisdiction in which we operate and the period over which our deferred tax assets will be recoverable 
in the event that actual results differ from these estimates or we adjust these estimates in future periods  we may need to change the valuation allowance  which could materially impact our financial position and results of operations 
in july  the fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
fin  which clarifies the accounting and disclosure for uncertainty in tax positions  as defined 
fin seeks to reduce the diversity in practice associated with certain aspects of the recognition and measurement related to accounting for income taxes 
we are subject to the provisions of fin as of january  we believe that our income tax filing positions and deductions will be sustained on audit and do not anticipate any adjustments that will result in a material change to our financial position 
therefore  no reserves for uncertain income tax positions have been recorded pursuant to fin the cumulative effect  if any  of applying fin is to be reported as an adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings in the year of adoption 
our adoption of fin did not result in a cumulative effect adjustment to retained earnings 
tax years since remain subject to examination by the major tax jurisdictions in which we are subject to tax 
results of operations years ended december  and revenues during the years ended december  and  the company recognized  and  respectively  in revenue under a license agreement 
we do not anticipate sales of any product prior to regulatory approval and commercialization of afresa

we anticipate that our research and development expenses will decrease in as we completed our pivotal afresa clinical trials and the expansion of our commercial manufacturing facilities during the research and development tax credit recognized for the years ended december  and partially offsets our research and development expenses 
the state of connecticut provides an opportunity to exchange certain research and development income tax credit carryforwards for cash in exchange for forgoing the carryforward of the research and development credits 
estimated amounts receivable under the program are recorded as a reduction of research and development expenses

we expect general and administrative expenses to decrease slightly in as a result of decreased salary related expenses and consulting fees 
interest income and expense interest income for the year ended december  decreased million as compared to the year ended december  primarily due to lower cash balances as the company used cash to fund operating and capital expenditures 
interest expense for the year ended december  was related to the convertible notes issued in december and amortization of the debt issuance costs  partially offset by capitalized interest related to construction in progress 
interest expense for the year ended december  also included interest related to amounts borrowed under the loan agreement with our principal stockholder in december

table of contents liquidity and capital resources we have funded our operations primarily through the sale of equity securities 
in october  we issued and sold a total of  shares of our common stock 
of this total   shares were sold to our principal stockholder at a price per share of and  shares were sold to other investors at a price per share of 
the resulting aggregate net proceeds were approximately million after expenses 
in december  we issued and sold  shares of our common stock at a price of per share in an underwritten public offering 
the resulting aggregate net proceeds to us from this common stock offering were approximately million after expenses 
in december  we also sold million aggregate principal amount of senior convertible notes due the resulting aggregate net proceeds to us from this note offering were approximately million after expenses 
in august  we entered into a million loan arrangement with our principal stockholder  which was amended on august  and replaced with a new loan arrangement on october  allowing us to borrow up to a total of million before january  on february   as a result of our principal stockholder being licensed as a finance lender under the california finance lenders law  the promissory note underlying the loan arrangement was revised to reflect the lender as the mann group llc  or the lender  an entity controlled by our principal stockholder 
this new license also eliminated the draw restrictions under the previous loan arrangement and we are now able to borrow up to a total of million from time to time with appropriate notice to the lender 
interest will accrue on each outstanding advance at a fixed rate equal to the one year libor rate as reported by the wall street journal on the date of such advance plus per annum and will be payable quarterly in arrears 
principal repayment is due on december  at any time after january   our lender can require us to prepay up to million in advances that have been outstanding for at least months 
if our lender exercises this right  we will have until the earlier of days after our lender provides written notice or december  to prepay such advances 
in the event of a default  all unpaid principal and interest either becomes immediately due and payable or may be accelerated at our lender s option  and the interest rate will increase to the one year libor rate calculated on the date of the initial advance or in effect on the date of default  whichever is greater  plus per annum 
any borrowings under the loan arrangement will be unsecured 
the loan arrangement contains no financial covenants 
there are no warrants associated with the loan arrangement  nor are advances convertible into our common stock 
as of december   the amount outstanding under the arrangement was million 
during the year ended december   we used million of cash for our operations compared to using million for our operations in the year ended december  we had a net loss of million for the year ended december   of which million consisted of non cash charges such as depreciation and amortization  stock based compensation  and other stock based charges pursuant to a research agreement 
we expect our negative operating cash flow to continue at least until we obtain regulatory approval and achieve commercialization of afresa 
we spent million of cash for investing activities during the year ended december   compared to generating million for the year ended december  for the year ended december   cash used by investing activities was primarily for million in machinery and equipment purchases  mainly used to expand our manufacturing operations  and net purchases of marketable securities of million 
cash provided by investing activities in was primarily from net sales of marketable securities of million partially offset by million in machinery and equipment purchases 
our financing activities provided cash of million for the year ended december  compared to million for for  cash from financing activities was primarily from the related party borrowings received in december  as well as the exercise of stock awards 
cash from financing activities in was primarily from the equity offering in october and the exercise of stock options throughout the year 
as of december   we had million in cash and cash equivalents 
although we believe our existing cash resources  including the million of available borrowing under the loan arrangement with our principal stockholder  will be sufficient to fund our anticipated cash requirements through the first quarter of  we will require significant additional financing in the future to fund our operations and if we are unable to do so  there will be substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern 
accordingly  we expect that we will need to raise additional capital  either through the sale of equity and or debt securities  a strategic business collaboration with a pharmaceutical or biotechnology company or the establishment of other funding facilities  in order to continue the development and commercialization of afresa and other product candidates and to support our other ongoing activities 
we intend to use our capital resources to continue the development and commercialization  if approved  of afresa and to develop additional applications for our proprietary technosphere platform technology 
in addition  portions of our capital resources will be devoted to expanding our other product development programs for the treatment of different types of cancers 
we are expending a portion of our capital to scale up our manufacturing capabilities in our danbury facilities 
we also intend to use our capital resources for general corporate purposes  which may include in licensing or acquiring additional technologies 

table of contents we have held extensive discussions with a number of pharmaceutical companies concerning a potential strategic business collaboration for afresa 
to date  we have not reached agreement with any of these companies on a collaboration 
while we are continuing to engage in such discussions  we believe that we will have to expend significant additional time and effort before we could reach agreement  and we cannot predict when  if ever  we could conclude such an agreement with a partner 
there can be no assurance that any such collaboration will be available to us on a timely basis or on acceptable terms  if at all 
if we enter into a strategic business collaboration with a pharmaceutical or biotechnology company  we would expect  as part of the transaction  to receive additional capital 
in addition  we expect to pursue the sale of equity and or debt securities  or the establishment of other funding facilities 
issuances of debt or additional equity could impact the rights of our existing stockholders  dilute the ownership percentages of our existing stockholders and may impose restrictions on our operations 
these restrictions could include limitations on additional borrowing  specific restrictions on the use of our assets as well as prohibitions on our ability to create liens  pay dividends  redeem our stock or make investments 
we also may seek to raise additional capital by pursuing opportunities for the licensing  sale or divestiture of certain intellectual property and other assets  including our technosphere technology platform 
there can be no assurance  however  that any strategic collaboration  sale of securities or sale or license of assets will be available to us on a timely basis or on acceptable terms  if at all 
if we are unable to raise additional capital  we may be required to enter into agreements with third parties to develop or commercialize products or technologies that we otherwise would have sought to develop independently  and any such agreements may not be on terms as commercially favorable to us 
however  we cannot provide assurances that our plans will not change or that changed circumstances will not result in the depletion of our capital resources more rapidly than we currently anticipate 
if planned operating results are not achieved or we are not successful in raising additional equity financing or entering a business collaboration  we may be required to reduce expenses through the delay  reduction or curtailment of our projects  including afresa development activities  or further reduction of costs for facilities and administration  and there will be substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern 
off balance sheet arrangements as of december   we did not have any off balance sheet arrangements 
commitments and contingencies our contractual obligations represent future cash commitments and liabilities under agreements with third parties  and exclude contingent liabilities for which we cannot reasonably predict future payments 
accordingly  the table below excludes contractual obligations relating to milestone and royalty payments due to third parties  all of which are contingent upon certain future events 
the expected timing of payment of the obligations presented below is estimated based on current information 
future payments relate to operating lease obligations including facility leases executed in march and november  the senior convertible notes  and open purchase order and supply commitments consisted of the following at december  in thousands payments due in less than more than contractual obligations one year years years years total open purchase order and supply commitments senior convertible note obligations note payable to principal stockholder operating lease obligations total contractual obligations the amounts included in open purchase order and supply commitments are subject to performance under the purchase order or contract by the supplier of the goods or services and do not become our obligation until such performance is rendered 
the amount shown is principally for the purchase of materials for our clinical trials  the acquisition of manufacturing equipment  and commitments related to the expansion of our manufacturing plant and the purchase of raw materials under long term supply agreements 
the senior convertible note obligation amounts include future interest payments at a fixed rate of and payment of the notes in full upon maturity in the obligation for the note payable to the principal stockholder includes future principal and interest payments related to the 
table of contents million borrowing received on december  interest is paid based on a fixed rate equal to the one year libor rate on the date of advance plus and the principal payment is due on december  related party transactions for a description of our related party transactions see note related party transactions in the notes to our financial statements 
recent accounting pronouncements in december  the fasb ratified the eitf consensus on eitf issue no 
 accounting for collaborative arrangements  that discusses how parties to a collaborative arrangement which does not establish a legal entity within such arrangement should account for various activities 
the consensus indicates that costs incurred and revenues generated from transactions with third parties ie parties outside of the collaborative arrangement should be reported by the collaborators on the respective line items in their income statements pursuant to eitf issue no 
 reporting revenue gross as a principal versus net as an agent  additionally  the consensus provides that income statement characterization of payments between the participants in a collaborative arrangement should be based upon existing authoritative pronouncements  analogy to such pronouncements if not within their scope  or a reasonable  rational  and consistently applied accounting policy election 
eitf issue no 
is effective beginning january  and is to be applied retrospectively to all periods presented for collaborative arrangements existing as of the date of adoption 
we believe that the adoption of eitf no 
will not have a material effect on our results of operations  financial position  or cash flows 
in december  the fasb issued fasb statement no 
r  business combinations and fasb statement no 
 accounting and reporting of noncontrolling interests in consolidated financial statements an amendment of arb no 
fasb statement no 

these standards will significantly change the accounting and reporting for business combination transactions and noncontrolling minority interests in consolidated financial statements  including capitalizing at the acquisition date the fair value of acquired ipr d  and remeasuring and writing down these assets  if necessary  in subsequent periods during their development 
these new standards will be applied prospectively for business combinations that occur on or after january   except that presentation and disclosure requirements of fasb statement no 
regarding noncontrolling interests shall be applied retrospectively 
adoption of these statements are expected to have a significant effect on how acquisition transactions  subsequent to january   are reflected in the financial statements 
as of january   we adopted on a prospective basis certain required provisions of fasb statement no 
 fair value measurements fasb statement no 
 as amended by fasb financial staff position fsp no 
those provisions relate to our financial assets and liabilities carried at fair value and its fair value disclosures related to financial assets and liabilities 
fasb statement defines fair value  expands related disclosure requirements and specifies a hierarchy of valuation techniques based on the nature of the inputs used to develop the fair value measures 
fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date 
there are three levels of inputs to fair value measurements level  meaning the use of quoted prices for identical instruments in active markets  level  meaning the use of quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets or quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are not active or are directly or indirectly observable  and level  meaning the use of unobservable inputs 
observable market data should be used when available 
all of our marketable securities are classified as available for sale securities and are carried at fair value 
our valuation measurements for the available for sale securities are level measurements 
the partial adoption of fasb statement did not have a significant impact on our results of operations  financial position or cash flows 
in may  the fasb issued fsp no 
apb fsp no 
apb  accounting for convertible debt instruments that may be settled in cash upon conversion including partial cash settlement 
fsp no 
apb establishes that the liability and equity components of convertible debt instruments within the scope of fsp apb no 
shall be separately accounted for in a manner that will reflect the entity s nonconvertible debt borrowing rate when interest cost is recognized in subsequent periods 
the carrying amount of the liability component of the convertible debt instrument will be determined by measuring the fair value of a similar liability that does not have an associated equity component 
the carrying value of the equity component will be determined by deducting the fair value of the liability component from the initial proceeds ascribed to the convertible debt instrument as a whole 
related transaction costs shall be allocated to the liability and equity components in proportion to the allocation of proceeds and accounted for as debt issuance costs and equity issuance costs  respectively 
the excess of the principal amount of the liability component over its carrying amount shall be amortized to interest cost using the interest method 
fsp no 
apb is effective beginning january  and shall be applied retrospectively to all periods presented with the cumulative effect of the change in accounting principle on periods prior to those presented recognized as of the beginning of the first period presented 
early adoption is not permitted 
the adoption of fsp no 
apb will not have a material effect on our financial condition or results of operations 

table of contents in june  the fasb issued eitf issue determining whether an instrument or embedded feature is indexed to an entity s own stock eitf no 

paragraph a of fasb statement no 
accounting for derivatives and hedging activities specifies that a contract that would otherwise meet the definition of a derivative but is both a indexed to the company s own stock and b classified in stockholders equity in the statement of financial position would not be considered a derivative financial instrument 
eitf no 
provides a new two step model to be applied in determining whether a financial instrument or an embedded feature is indexed to an issuer s own stock and thus able to qualify for the sfas paragraph a scope exception 
eitf no 
is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after december   and interim periods within those fiscal years 
early adoption is not permitted 
we believe that the adoption of eitf no 
will not have a material effect on our results of operations  financial position  or cash flows 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we have not used derivative financial instruments in the past to hedge market risk 
we are exposed to market risk related to changes in interest rates impacting our short term investment portfolio as well as the interest rate on our credit facility with an entity controlled by our principal stockholder 
the interest rate on our credit facility with our principal stockholder is a fixed rate equal to the one year libor rate as reported by the wall street journal on the date of such advance plus per annum 
our current policy requires us to maintain a highly liquid short term investment portfolio consisting mainly of us money market funds and investment grade corporate  government and municipal debt 
none of these investments is entered into for trading purposes 
our cash is deposited in and invested through highly rated financial institutions in north america 
our short term investments at december  are comprised mainly of short term us treasury notes 
if we were to draw the available amount on our million credit facility and interest rates were to increase from levels at december  we could experience a higher level of interest expense than assumed in our current operating plan
