item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following management s discussion and analysis has been prepared with reference to the historical financial condition and results of operations of air transport services group  inc  and its subsidiaries the company and should be read in conjunction with the risk factors on page of this report  our historical financial statements  and the related notes contained in this report 
introduction air transport services group  inc atsg is a holding company whose principal subsidiaries include three independently certificated airlines  abx air  inc abx  capital cargo international airlines  inc ccia and air transport international  llc ati and cargo aircraft management  inc cam  an aircraft leasing company 
the holding company  atsg  acquired all outstanding ownership of orlando  florida based cargo holdings international  inc chi on december  chi was the parent company of ccia  ati and cam 
the consolidated financial statements of atsg include the results of chi and its primary subsidiaries  including cam  ccia  and ati  as of the date of acquisition 
accordingly  the activities of chi are not included in atsg s consolidated statements of earnings or consolidated statements of cash flows for or when the context requires  we may also use the terms company and atsg in this report to refer to the business of atsg and its subsidiaries on a consolidated basis 
the company has three reportable segments dhl  acmi services  and cam 
each of these is described below 
dhl dhl express usa  inc and dhl network operations usa  inc 
collectively  dhl is the company s largest customer  accounting for approximately of the company s revenues and of the pre tax earnings excluding impairment charges in abx has two commercial agreements with dhl 
under an aircraft  crew  maintenance and insurance agreement acmi agreement and a hub services agreement  abx provides airlift  package handling  and other cargo related services to dhl sort facilities 
expenses incurred under the agreements were generally marked up by the base mark up and included in base revenues 
both agreements also allowed abx to earn incremental revenues calculated on mark ups above the base mark up up to an additional under the acmi agreement and an additional under the hub services agreement from the achievement of certain cost related and service goals specified in the two agreements 
fuel  rent  interest on the promissory note to dhl  and ramp and landing fees incurred under the acmi agreement are expense items reimbursed by dhl without mark up and recorded as other reimbursable revenues 
in november  dhl began to restructure its us operations  significantly impacting abx s operations 
in conjunction with that restructuring  the company and dhl agreed to modify the agreements for the fourth quarter of and the first quarter of as described below 
acmi services through its airline subsidiaries  the company provides airlift to other airlines  freight forwarders and the us military  typically through acmi agreements 
the airlines serve a variety of customers in the air cargo industry by flying in north america  south america  central america and asia 
at december   abx operated boeing freighter aircraft that were not under the dhl acmi agreement  while ccia and ati operated aircraft and aircraft  respectively 
customers are usually charged based on the number of block hours flown  and typical agreements specify a minimum number of block hours to be charged monthly 
ccia and ati each have contracts to provide airlift to bax global  inc bax under acmi agreements 
bax provides freight transportation and supply chain management services  specializing in the heavy freight 
table of contents market for business to business shipping 
ati also provides passenger transportation primarily to the us military using its dc combi aircraft that are certified to carry passengers as well as cargo on the main flight deck 
acmi services also includes revenues from block space agreements  in which customers contract for specific amounts of space on certain flights 
in these agreements  customers are typically charged by the weight carried on the aircraft during a flight 
acmi services includes revenues from supplemental airlift provided to dhl under additional acmi arrangements 
cam the company offers aircraft leasing through its cam subsidiary 
aircraft leases normally cover a term of several years 
in a typical leasing agreement  customers pay rent and a maintenance deposit on a monthly basis 
cam had aircraft that were under lease at the end of  of them to abx  ati and ccia 
other activities in addition to its acmi services  the company sells aircraft parts and provides aircraft maintenance and modification services to other airlines 
through a wholly owned subsidiary  the company operates three us postal service usps sorting facilities 
the company also provides equipment leasing and maintenance  specialized services for aircraft fuel management and freight logistics 
these other business activities do not constitute reportable segments 
other activities include general and administrative expenses not associated with the dhl commercial agreements  including an allocation of abx s overhead expenses  starting january  segment analysis dhl segment on may   dhl announced a plan to restructure its us business and negotiate an agreement with united parcel service  inc ups to provide air uplift  sorting and other services for dhl s us domestic and international shipments within north america 
additionally  under that plan  dhl would take over management of the regional hubs currently managed by abx throughout the us on november   dhl announced a revised plan to discontinue intra us domestic pickup and delivery 
instead  dhl has been providing only international services to and from the u 
s since late january in january  dhl ceased its intra us domestic pickup and delivery services 
as a result  by late january  the regional hubs were closed  the wilmington based day sort ceased to operate and all remaining mcdonnell douglas dc aircraft that abx flew for dhl were removed from the acmi agreement 
at this time  abx continues to provide airlift and sorting for dhl s international delivery services through abx s boeing aircraft and staffing at the wilmington  ohio night sort operations 
abx provides these services to dhl under the acmi and hub services agreements  as amended in november in november  abx and dhl amended the pricing provisions of the acmi and hub services agreements revenue amendment 
the revenue amendment  which became effective october   effectively fixed abx pre tax earnings for the dhl agreements for the fourth quarter of including incremental mark ups 
under the revenue amendment  abx billed dhl the base revenues and incremental revenues that abx would have earned based on its service and cost performance levels had the dhl restructuring not occurred 
beginning with dhl s may announcement  approximately  employees were terminated through february in august  abx and dhl executed a severance and retention agreement s r agreement and  after dhl s announcement in november to discontinue intra us domestic pickup and air delivery  abx and dhl amended the s r agreement 
the agreement specifies employee severance and retention benefits that dhl will reimburse abx for payment to its employees that are displaced in conjunction with dhl s us restructuring plan 
dhl reimburses abx for the cost of employee severance and retention 
table of contents benefits paid in accordance with the agreement 
abx revenues and expenses for include million for severance and retention benefits incurred under the s r agreement terminations see note e in the accompanying audited financial statements 
additionally  under the s r agreement  dhl reimburses abx for employee accrued vacation benefits that abx pays to terminated employees 
our dhl revenues include million in reimbursement of vacation benefits paid to employees 
the table below compares our dhl earnings in thousands year ended december  acmi base vacation reimbursement quarterly incremental annual incremental total acmi hub services base vacation reimbursement quarterly incremental annual incremental total hub services total dhl pre tax earnings outlook although abx continues to provide boeing aircraft and staffing for the wilmington  ohio night sort operations for dhl s international delivery services  continuation of this business will depend on dhl s strategic plans in the us  general economic conditions and the volume of shipments 
dhl has not reached an agreement with ups 
dhl has indicated that their network will continue to utilize some abx boeing aircraft and wilmington  ohio sorting operations to support its international services at least through september we expect to make further reductions in the number of abx employees supporting dhl and remove some boeing aircraft from the dhl network in significant restructuring  downsizing and wage concessions will be required to position abx to competitively pursue longer term acmi business with dhl 
these reductions include the cost of flight crews and aircraft maintenance 
the november revenue amendment provides for abx s dhl pre tax earnings for the first quarter of to be million above abx s expenses that are reimbursable under the dhl acmi and hub services agreements 
first quarter mark up will include amounts for service and cost incentives that in prior years were recorded in the fourth quarter 
the first quarter revenues will also include the reimbursement of employee vacation payments for abx employees terminated in the first quarter of abx will allocate million of overhead expenses toward non dhl segments in the first quarter of abx management expects to finalize a similar revenue arrangement with dhl for the second and third quarters of at this time  we cannot reasonably estimate revenues or the revenue structure beyond september of the s r agreement includes provisions to pay abx for crewmember benefits if abx and the collective bargaining unit for the crewmembers can reach an agreement in regards to the use of those funds for severance  retention or other issues arising from dhl s us restructuring plan 
this is not expected to occur in the first quarter of 
table of contents acmi services segment acmi services revenues  excluding reimbursed expenses  were million for  increasing million compared to approximately million of this growth was organic to abx  while the remaining increase resulted from the acquisition of ati and ccia 
abx s organic growth reflects the deployment of four additional boeing aircraft into service since mid the acmi services segment had a pre tax loss of million for  including impairment charges of million 
excluding the impairment charges  the acmi services segment had pre tax earnings of million for compared to million for segment results for acmi services were positively impacted by ccia and ati  which contributed million to pre tax earnings in in  abx incurred significant maintenance expenses compared to periods due to planned c checks  which are expensed as incurred for boeing aircraft 
abx flight crew wages negatively impacted results  when abx flight crews decided not to voluntarily bid for extra flying  as is customary 
as a result  abx assigned the trips at an additional cost 
during  ati and ccia incurred approximately million of expenses excluding intercompany lease charges of million from cam while completing the faa certification process to add aircraft types to their respective operating certificates 
ati added the boeing to its operating certificate  while ccia added the boeing acmi services results included revenues of million from boeing freighter aircraft that abx supplied during under a supplemental agreement with dhl 
additionally  abx charged a carrying cost to dhl for ad hoc usage of abx boeing aircraft that were not under the acmi agreement 
such costs were based on block hours flown and a pre established rate 
the costs are included in acmi expenses subject to mark up and accordingly reflected in the dhl segment revenues with a corresponding expense reduction to acmi services 
acmi services expenses were credited million for the current global economic recession is negatively affecting us customers  including bax in ati and ccia will each reduce their planned flying for bax in by removing aircraft from bax s us network 
ati will operate seven aircraft in the bax network in compared to nine dc aircraft in  and ccia will operate ten aircraft in  compared to twelve boeing aircraft for bax s us network in in accordance with statements of financial accounting standard sfas no 
 we tested the recorded goodwill associated with ati and ccia for impairment 
to test the goodwill  we determined the fair values of ati and ccia separately using industry market multiples and discounted cash flows  utilizing a market derived rate of return 
after comparing the fair values of each reporting unit to their respective carrying values  the company recognized an impairment charge of million to reduce the combined ati and ccia goodwill to million in the impairment charge was precipitated by a large scale drop in market values of transportation companies and higher costs of capital emerging from the credit crisis in the fourth quarter of projected cash flows for the airlines are expected to decline beginning in due to the deep economic recession 
in conjunction with the goodwill test  we recorded a charge of million in to reduce the customer relationship intangibles to their fair value at december  outlook global shipping volumes continue to decline in besides reductions in the number of boeing and dc aircraft provided to bax  in march  all nippon airways co 
ana will terminate the boeing acmi operation that abx provides ana in japan 
however  aside from the ana termination  interest for the boeing remains steady 
the fuel efficiency  cubic capacity  payload and operating cost of the boeing make it a desirable freighter aircraft in medium range international air cargo markets and in trans us routes less than  nautical miles 
in  abx began a trans atlantic service for a large european based shipper 
dhl s restructuring and cam s agreement to dry lease boeing aircraft to a miami  florida based operator beginning in mid may adversely impact abx s operation of two boeing aircraft into the central and south america markets 

table of contents our operating results could be impacted by aircraft utilization levels  including the timing difference between the redelivery of a modified aircraft to us and that aircraft s deployment into revenue service 
we begin to incur depreciation expense for each additional aircraft when an aircraft is ready for service 
revenue generating service may begin sometime later  however  depending on satisfaction of a number of conditions  including international regulations and laws  contract negotiations  flight crew availability  and arranging resources for aircraft handling 
new customer agreements typically involve start up expenses  including those for route authorities  overfly rights  travel and other activities  and may impact future operating results 
additionally  our pre tax earnings will fluctuate due to the timing of scheduled heavy maintenance  which  under abx s policy  are expensed as maintenance is performed 
cam segment segment earnings for cam were million for and reflect an allocation of interest expense based on prevailing interest rates and the carrying value of its operating assets 
cam s revenues include million for the leasing of aircraft to ati  ccia and abx 
at december   cam had aircraft that were under lease to subsidiaries of the company 
during  cam began leasing two boeing aircraft to an external customer under a long term lease 
cam had two boeing aircraft and one boeing aircraft that were undergoing freighter modification as of december  one boeing and the boeing went into service during the first quarter of  while the remaining aircraft is expected to become ready for service during in february  cam finalized a lease agreement to provide boeing aircraft to a miami  florida based operator 
the lease agreement  which is for two aircraft  is expected to begin in the second quarter of and includes the option to lease up to three more boeing aircraft 
in march  cam signed an agreement to lease a boeing to a canadian carrier under a three year term 
outlook atsg expects cam to add more boeing aircraft to its fleet over the next two years 
on september   cam entered into an agreement with israel aerospace industries ltd 
iai for the conversion of up to boeing to full freighter configuration 
atsg plans to modify several of the boeing aircraft that are currently under contract to dhl under the acmi agreement to a standard freighter configuration as the aircraft are removed from the dhl network 
the conversion primarily consists of the installation of a standard cargo door and loading system replacing the passenger door and loading system currently in the aircraft 
to finance the conversions  management anticipates that it will sell nearly all of the remaining dc aircraft to dhl under the aircraft put provisions of the acmi agreement 
additionally  management expects to put to dhl several of the non standard freighter boeing aircraft that are currently under the acmi agreement 
as atsg s boeing aircraft become available for service  we anticipate that some portion of them will be leased to other airlines  while some may be operated by an atsg airline 
we will make the decision to deploy each aircraft either in our airlines operations or in leasing arrangements  depending on which alternative will generate the higher return on capital 
other activities revenues from other activities increased million to million in compared to increased revenues were primarily a result of an increase in aircraft parts sales and maintenance services when compared to of this increase  million was for the inter company aircraft part sales and maintenance services within the atsg companies 
internal sales and earnings were eliminated from the consolidated results 
pre tax earnings from other activities were million in compared to million in pre tax earnings in included a net gain of approximately million related to the disposition of an abx boeing aircraft that experienced a fire prior to engine start 
the aircraft was fully insured and the company s insurer rendered the aircraft a complete loss 
this gain was offset in by expenses resulting from an arbitration matter with dhl 
in accordance with the arbitrator s ruling  abx recorded a million non reimbursable 
table of contents expense in for professional fees stemming from astar air cargo s astar indication of interest and issued a corresponding expense credit to dhl 
additionally  abx and dhl agreed to an overhead allocation of million for  thus reducing revenue from dhl and increasing non dhl expenses accordingly 
outlook atsg s diversification plans for include the establishment of a new atsg subsidiary to compete separately as an aircraft maintenance and repair organization mro 
management believes that organizing the aircraft maintenance capabilities separately from abx will facilitate a cost structure and marketing organization which can better compete in the aircraft maintenance industry 
the mro will operate as a federal aviation administration faa certificated repair station  initially utilizing the wilmington  ohio facilities including hangars and a component shop leased by abx from dhl 
the mro subsidiary can leverage the company s existing engineering skills and experience to perform airframe maintenance  component repairs  part sales  line maintenance and avionics modifications 
chi atsg acquired all outstanding ownership of chi on december  chi was the parent company of ccia  ati and cam 
the purchase price for all of chi s equity securities was approximately million  consisting of approximately million in cash from the company  million in cash from chi and the value of four million common shares of the company  valued at million  which were issued to certain shareholders 
atsg also repaid million of chi s existing indebtedness under its senior credit facility and acquired approximately million in chi cash 
the overall transaction value was approximately million 
the company obtained million of these funds from a new unsubordinated term loan 
we believe the acquisition of chi and its wholly owned subsidiaries will result in a number of strategic benefits  including improved economies from a larger base of operations and expanded market leadership in freighter services 
we have continued the business operations of chi s subsidiaries with largely the same management and employee team that was in place at the time of the acquistion 
the acquisition of chi had a significant impact on the company s financial results

after having the aircraft appraised  management decided to exercise the put provisions on three of these aircraft 
the removal of aircraft from service to dhl required us to evaluate the recoverability of the carrying value of those aircraft removed from the acmi agreement 
in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  we recorded an impairment charge of million in for the excess of the carrying value of the aircraft over their fair value less cost to sell

pre tax earnings from the charter segment were million for compared to million for pre tax earnings from the charter segment in were negatively impacted by the start up time necessary to get newly delivered aircraft deployed for customers and the timing of scheduled heavy maintenance 
additionally  our margins during were hurt by high aircraft crewing expenses in our asia start up operations 
efforts to cooperatively find a long term alternative to a foreign domicile at the request of the pilots union proved unsuccessful 
we initially implemented a temporary crew rotation plan for the asian operations that was too costly to maintain 
in december  we established a crew domicile in japan under the provisions of our collective bargaining agreement 
other activities other activities revenue increased to million in compared to million in increased revenues were a result of being awarded two additional usps sort center contracts in september of and an increase in aircraft maintenance work compared to as a result  pre tax earnings from all other activities increased million during  compared to in aggregate  pre tax earnings on these operations as a percentage of revenues declined to for from for  due primarily to the increase in lower margin usps revenues 
operating expenses the table below summarizes certain operational measures that affected abx s expense levels 
year ended december  percentage increase decrease pounds processed for dhl millions dhl agreement aircraft block hours flown charter segment aircraft block hours flown aircraft block hours flown for the dhl acmi agreement declined by in compared to  due to the removal of dc and dc aircraft in and aircraft block hours flown for charter segment customers increased by in compared to  reflecting the deployment of ten boeing aircraft since april salaries  wages and benefits expense decreased by approximately during compared to the decrease reflects an approximately decrease in part time and full time staffing levels compared to and includes transferring the allentown  pennsylvania hub operation to dhl in january  the riverside  california hub operation in june  and the south bend  indiana hub operation in november fuel expense increased slightly in compared to gallons consumed for the dhl network flights declined due to the flight reductions made by dhl 
these declines were offset by increased fuel prices compared to we do not hedge fuel prices or purchase fuel derivatives 
during  the volatility of fuel prices was effectively assumed by dhl and other customers through acmi agreements 
maintenance  materials and repairs decreased by approximately during compared to the primary reason for the decrease was reduced spending on scheduled heavy maintenance checks for aircraft  which was a result of dhl s removal of aircraft from operations under the acmi agreement 

table of contents depreciation and amortization expense increased by million in compared to the increase is primarily a result of seven additional boeing aircraft that we placed in service in our depreciation expense for will be impacted by the timing of the additional boeing s and s we anticipate placing into service 
landing and ramp expense  which includes the cost of deicing chemicals  increased by in compared to these expenses increased due to the more difficult winter weather experienced during the first quarter of compared to the first quarter of purchased line haul and yard management expenses decreased by million  or  during compared to the decrease is primarily a result of dhl assuming management of its line haul trucking operations from abx in may travel expenses increased by million in compared to the increase is driven by asian travel cost in the acmi services segment when abx began rotating crews to japan 
insurance expenses decreased by in compared to the decrease is due to a change in the insurance providers and resulting decrease in premiums 
other operating expenses include professional fees  utilities  costs of parts sold to non dhl customers and packaging supplies 
other operating expenses increased by million in compared to the increase is driven by increased impairments costs of million in compared to million in additionally  the increase in includes increases in the cost of parts and services sold 
interest income and expense our interest expense for increased million to million compared to the increase in interest expense is a result of seven boeing aircraft financed through december  interest income decreased million during compared to due to lower cash balances and lower interest rates in compared to income tax our effective tax rate for was approximately 
the increase in the effective tax rate for is due to an increase in non deductible expenses 
in the third quarter and the first nine months of  income tax expense was offset by reductions in the tax valuation allowance 
in the fourth quarter of  we recorded an income tax benefit to completely reverse the remaining valuation allowance on the company s deferred tax assets 
the valuation allowance had originally been placed on income tax carryforwards and other deferred tax assets since abx s separation from airborne  inc in august the allowance was originally recorded due to a significant operating loss at that time and uncertainty in abx s future earnings prospects 
abx s former parent  airborne  inc  which had been our predominant source of business for over twenty years  was acquired by dhl in since that time  the company has generated annual pre tax earnings in each year 
the company diversified its revenues and earnings  growing non airborne dhl revenues from million in to million in our projections of taxable income and a successful implementation of diversification strategies  combined with a four year record of profitable results  indicate it is more likely than not that all the deferred tax assets will be realized prior to their expiration 
as a result  the asset valuation allowance that had been placed on income tax carryforwards and other deferred tax assets were completely reversed in 
table of contents financial condition  liquidity and capital resources commitments as of december   the company had two boeing and one boeing aircraft in various stages of modification from passenger to a standard freighter configuration 
we have contracted with aircraft maintenance and modification providers to convert these aircraft from passenger to standard freighter configuration 
based on the most current projections  we expect to place all three of these aircraft into service during as modifications are completed 
the estimated cost of the remaining anticipated modification work approximated million as of december   all of which is expected to be paid in additionally  the company is committed to purchase another boeing for approximately million after the aircraft is completely modified to freighter configuration  which we anticipate in the table below summarizes the company s contractual obligations and commercial commitments in thousands as of december  it does not include cash contributions for pension funding due to the absence of scheduled maturities 
the timing of pension and post retirement healthcare payments cannot be reasonably determined  except for million scheduled to be paid in  which is discussed under cash flows in note l to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
the long term debt bears interest at to per annum 
payments due by period contractual obligations total less than year years years after years long term debt  including interest payments capital lease obligations operating leases unconditional purchase obligations employee severance and retention benefits uncertain tax positions total contractual cash obligations the unconditional purchase obligations consist of commitments to acquire and modify aircraft to a standard cargo configuration 
we plan to finance the cost of modifying the aircraft with existing cash  cash generated from aircraft sold to dhl under existing put options and cash generated from operations during the modification period 
abx has an agreement with dhl to provide employee severance benefits  retention payments and vacation payouts to abx employees that are affected by dhl s restructuring plans 
dhl is contractually obligated to reimburse abx after abx makes the related benefit payments 
the table includes the contingent fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for income taxes fin liability of million 
at december   the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits of million includes million recorded as a non current fin liability that would be paid from cash and a million reduction to the net operating loss deferred tax asset 
the amount of the fin liability and the timing of its recognition are subject to significant uncertainty and are contingent on the occurrence of future events  such as audits and examinations by various income tax authorities 
provisions of the company s credit agreement require that cash proceeds from the sale of equipment and recoveries from insurance proceeds must be reinvested in like kind assets within days of receipt or remitted as a repayment against the term loan 
aggregate proceeds exceeding million in a calendar year must be remitted as a repayment against the term loan  except that the company is not required to remit proceeds from the put of aircraft to dhl toward the term loan 

table of contents cash flows operating cash flows were million  million and million for  and  respectively 
increased cash flows in compared to previous years were driven primarily by expanded business operations due to the acquisition of chi 
capital expenditures capital spending levels are primarily a result of aircraft acquisitions and related freighter modification costs 
cash payments for capital expenditures were million in compared to million and million in and  respectively 
capital expenditures in included cargo modification costs for nine aircraft 
our capital expenditures for included the cargo modification costs for eleven aircraft 
our capital expenditures in included the acquisitions of eight boeing aircraft and cargo modification costs for nine aircraft 
during  we completed six cargo modifications  and in  we completed seven 
we estimate the total level of capital spending for will be approximately million 
proceeds from the disposal of equipment included million in from insurance proceeds for an aircraft 
during  the aircraft experienced a fire prior to engine start and was rendered a complete loss by the company s insurer 
proceeds from borrowing during  the company drew million on the revolver loan and made principal payments of million 
the principal payments included million paid by a subsidiary of the company to the lead banks of the credit agreement to invest in the company s unsubordinated term loan 
this intercompany loan is eliminated in consolidation  reflecting the company s net unsubordinated term loan position of million 
during  the company raised million to finance five boeing aircraft and the acquisition of chi 
during  debt origination costs were million 
liquidity at december   the company had approximately million of cash balances and marketable securities 
the company had million of unused credit facility  net of outstanding letters of credit of million  through a syndicated credit agreement that expires in december credit agreement through its credit agreement  the company has a syndicated  unsubordinated term loan and a revolving credit facility that are collateralized by substantially all the aircraft  property and equipment owned by the company that are not separately collateralized under aircraft loans or capital leases 
the lenders currently consist of us based banks 
under the credit agreement  the company is subject to expenses  covenants and warranties that are usual and customary 
the credit agreement contains covenants including  among other things  limitations on certain additional indebtedness  guarantees of indebtedness  and the level of annual capital expenditures 
the credit agreement stipulates events of default including unspecified events that may have material adverse effects on the company 
the conditions of the credit agreement and the aircraft loans cross default 
dhl s us restructuring announcement  turmoil in the global financial markets and the crisis in the us credit market could affect the company s access to liquidity 
certain lenders have questioned whether dhl s decision to restructure its us business constitutes a material adverse event mae under provisions of the credit agreement and aircraft loans 
if a lender within the credit agreement declares an mae  availability under the revolving credit facility will be reduced by the lender s portion of the facility 
further  the credit agreement provides that if lenders having more than half of the outstanding dollar amount of the commitments assert that an 
table of contents mae exists at the time the borrowers attempt to borrow under the credit facility  they can assert that an event of default exists under the credit agreement and require the lead bank to exercise its remedies 
the company is not currently aware of any events of default  under the credit agreement 
if an event of default occurs  the company may be forced to repay  renegotiate or replace the credit agreement 
given the current credit crisis and dhl s us restructuring plan  the interest rates and other costs of a renegotiated or new facility  assuming the company could obtain a new facility  would be more expensive and may require more rapid amortization of principal than under the terms of the current credit agreement 
pension obligations scheduled cash contributions to the defined benefit pension plans are currently estimated to be at least million in we will periodically evaluate whether to make additional contributions 
funding for the contributions will be generated primarily from abx s operating agreements with dhl 
the company provides defined benefit pension plans to certain employee groups see note l in the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
the turbulence in the financial markets has negatively affected the company s funded pension plans 
investment losses in of approximately of plan assets decreased the funded status of the plans and increased abx s pension liability 
based on existing laws  the increase in the unfunded status could increase the contributions which abx is expected to make into the plans in or become subject to penalty 
since dhl s strategic announcement in may  the pension benefits guaranty corporation pbgc  a governmental company that insures pension plan benefits in the us  has made several inquiries of management regarding the plans status  and as to dhl s intentions with respect to providing additional plan funding 
the company has approached dhl to request that dhl make additional contributions to strengthen the funded status of the plans 
discussions with dhl are ongoing and the outcome uncertain 
the pbgc has broad authority over pension funding and could compel abx to terminate and settle the plans 
dhl note in  dhl made a demand for payment in full of the unsecured promissory note 
in its demand  dhl asserted that the acquisition by the company of chi and the related financing transaction  which closed on december   constituted a change of control under the terms of the unsecured promissory note 
on march   the company and dhl reached an agreement to amend the unsecured dhl promissory note 
the company agreed to pay dhl million of the principal balance  while dhl agreed to extinguish an additional million of principal balance in further  dhl agreed it would forever discharge its claim that the company s acquisition of chi and the related financing transaction  constituted a change of control 
based on the anticipated principal payment in  the company s balance sheet as of december  reflects million of the million dhl note as a current liability 
the due date of august for the remaining million remains unchanged 
until that time  the dhl note continues to bear interest at a rate of per annum and dhl will continue to reimburse abx the interest expense from the note at least through the dhl note will include certain covenants and events of default 
the acmi agreement allows abx to put aircraft under contract to dhl  requiring dhl to buy such aircraft from abx at the lesser of book value or fair market value 
if abx s stand alone stockholders equity  as distinguished from atsg s  is greater than million  as it is at this time  any amount by which fair market value is less than net book value would be recorded as an operating charge 
if abx s stand alone stockholders equity is less than or equal to million at the time of sale  any amount by which the appraised fair market value is less than net book value would be applied to a promissory note abx owes to dhl 
for purposes of applying the million stockholders equity threshold  abx s stand alone stockholders equity will be calculated after including the effect of any charges caused by the removal of aircraft 
aircraft leases on march   the company and dhl executed a memorandum of understanding related to boeing aircraft leases mou 
if a definitive agreement is consummated  dhl would have the option to lease from abx four boeing aircraft under month lease terms commencing august  
table of contents dhl would assume all of abx s financial obligations for five other boeing aircraft currently under capital leases  retroactive to january  abx would grant dhl a credit of million as prepaid rent toward the four aircraft leases 
dhl would have until february  to exercise the lease option on each aircraft 
if dhl does not exercise its lease option for an aircraft  abx would pay dhl million of the prepaid rent credit 
at dhl s request  abx would continue to operate the five boeing aircraft  currently under lease  for dhl under the acmi agreement after the aircraft have been transferred to dhl 
as of december   the company s balance sheet reflected approximately million of debt obligations and million of net book value related to these five aircraft 
the company will account for dhl s assumption of the obligations and disposition of the aircraft to dhl when these events occur 
the mou expires on april  outlook the company s financial condition will depend in part on abx s contractual termination rights and management s ability to negotiate contract termination payments with dhl 
additionally  the company s financial condition will be impacted by negotiations between abx s management and the pilots collective bargaining unit 
significant wage concessions and productivity gains are required to position abx competitively in the market 
management currently believes that the company has adequate sources of liquidity in place to operate its businesses  make planned capital expenditures  meet its anticipated financial obligations and remain in compliance with its financial covenants during these sources of liquidity include its internally generated cash flows  funds from the sale of aircraft to dhl and the availability of credit under the company s credit agreement 
there are circumstances beyond the company s control that could adversely impact liquidity in the near term  such as weakening demand for boeing aircraft  the failure of dhl to provide adequate funding for termination and wind down costs being incurred by abx as a result of dhl s restructuring of its us operations  or a decision by the company s lenders to declare an event of default under the credit agreement 
if management should conclude that the company has insufficient liquidity to fund its operations  it would carefully evaluate a number of alternatives to address the situation including the sale of assets  the suspension of planned capital expenditures  further cost reductions in its operations  the securing of additional financing or seeking relief from its creditors 
off balance sheet arrangements as part of our ongoing business  we do not participate in transactions that generate relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships  such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities spes  which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes 
as of december   we are not involved in any material unconsolidated spe transactions 
certain of our operating leases and agreements contain indemnification obligations to the lessor or one or more other parties that are considered ordinary and customary eg use  tax and environmental indemnifications  the terms of which range in duration and are often limited 
such indemnification obligations may continue after the expiration of the respective lease or agreement 
no amounts have been recognized in our financial statements for the underlying fair value of guarantees and indemnifications 
critical accounting policies and estimates management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  as well as certain disclosures included elsewhere in this report  are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to select appropriate accounting policies and make 
table of contents estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingencies 
in certain cases  there are alternative policies or estimation techniques which could be selected 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our selection of policies and the estimation techniques we use  including those related to revenue recognition  post retirement liabilities  bad debts  self insurance reserves  accruals for labor contract settlements  valuation of spare parts inventory  useful lives  salvage values and impairment of property and equipment  income taxes  contingencies and litigation 
we base our estimates on historical experience  current conditions and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources  as well as for identifying and assessing our accounting treatment with respect to commitments and contingencies 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following significant and critical accounting policies involve the more significant judgments and estimates used in preparing the consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition revenues from dhl are recognized when the related services are performed 
revenues from dhl are determined based on the expenses incurred during a reporting period for the acmi and hub services agreements 
expenses incurred under these agreements are generally subject to a base mark up of  which is recognized in the period during which the expenses are incurred 
certain costs  the most significant of which include fuel costs  interest on the promissory note to dhl  airport rent  ramp and landing fees incurred for performance under the acmi agreement  are reimbursed and included in revenues without mark up 
in addition to a base mark up of  both the acmi and hub services agreements provide for an incremental mark up potential above the base  based on our achievement of specified cost and service goals 
the acmi agreement provides for a maximum potential incremental mark up of  with based on cost performance and based on service performance 
the hub services agreement provides for a maximum potential incremental mark up of  with based on cost performance and on service performance 
both contracts call for of any incremental mark up earned from cost performance to be recognized based on quarterly results  with measured against annual results 
accordingly  a maximum mark up of approximately may be achieved based on quarterly results and recognized in our quarterly revenues 
up to a maximum mark up of approximately based on annual cost performance could be recognized during the fourth quarter  when full year results are known 
incremental mark up potential associated with the service goals in the acmi agreement and in the hub services agreement is measured annually and any revenues earned from their attainment would be recognized during the fourth quarter  when full year results are known 
management cannot predict to what degree the company will be successful in achieving incremental mark up 
in november  abx and dhl amended the acmi agreement and the hub services agreement to set the base mark up and incremental mark up to specific amounts for the fourth quarter of and the first quarter of the company derives a portion of its revenues from customers other than dhl 
non dhl acmi charter service revenues are recognized on scheduled and non scheduled flights when the specific flight has been completed 
aircraft parts and fuel sales are recognized when the parts and fuel are delivered 
revenues earned and expenses incurred in providing aircraft related maintenance repair services or technical maintenance services are recognized in the period in which the services are completed and delivered to the customer 
revenues derived from transporting freight and sorting parcels are recognized upon delivery of shipments and completion of service 

table of contents goodwill and intangible assets goodwill arises from business acquisitions and represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the assets acquired 
in accordance with statement of financial accounting standard sfas no 
 accounting for goodwill and other intangible assets  sfas we assess in the fourth quarter of each year whether goodwill acquired in the acquisition of chi is impaired 
additional impairment assessments may be performed on an interim basis if the company finds it necessary 
finite lived intangible assets are amortized over their estimated useful economic lives and are periodically reviewed for impairment 
indefinite lived intangible assets are not amortized but are assessed for impairment annually 
application of the goodwill impairment test requires significant judgment  including the determination of the fair value of each reporting unit that has goodwill 
the company has three reporting units  ati  ccia and cam that have goodwill 
we estimate the fair value of the reporting units separately using a market approach and an income approach utilizing discounted cash flows applied to market derived rate of return 
the market approach utilizes market multiples from comparable publicly traded companies 
the market multiples include revenues  ebit earnings before interest and taxes and ebitda earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization 
assumptions critical to the fair value estimates under the discounted cash flow models include discount rates  cash flow projections  projected long term growth rates and the determination of terminal values 
the first step of the impairment test requires a comparison of the fair value of the reporting unit to its respective carrying value 
if the carrying value of a reporting unit is less than its fair value  no indication of impairment exists and a second step is not performed 
if the carrying amount of a reporting unit is higher than its fair value  there is an indication that an impairment may exist and a second step is performed 
in the second step  fair values are assigned to all of the assets and liabilities of a reporting unit  including any unrecognized intangible assets  and the implied fair value of goodwill is calculated 
if the implied fair value of goodwill is less than the recorded goodwill  an impairment loss is recorded for the difference and charged to operations 
sfas does not allow the recognition of a reporting unit s implied goodwill that may be greater than the recorded goodwill 
therefore  the company may be required to record goodwill impairments  even when the aggregate fair value of its reporting units may increase 
depreciation depreciation of property and equipment is provided on a straight line basis over the lesser of the asset s useful life or lease term 
we periodically evaluate the estimated service lives and residual values used to depreciate our property and equipment 
the acceleration of depreciation expense or the recording of significant impairment losses could result from changes in the estimated useful lives of our assets 
we may change the estimated useful lives due to a number of reasons  such as the existence of excess capacity in our air system or ground networks or changes in regulations grounding or limiting the use of aircraft 
self insurance we self insure certain claims relating to workers compensation  aircraft  automobile  general liability and employee healthcare 
we record a liability for reported claims and an estimate for incurred claims that have not yet been reported 
accruals for these claims are estimated utilizing historical paid claims data  recent claims trends and  in the case of employee healthcare and workers compensation  an independent actuarial evaluation 
changes in claim severity and frequency could result in actual claims being materially different than the costs provided for in our annual results of operations 
we maintain excess claim coverage with common insurance carriers to mitigate our exposure to large claim losses 

table of contents contingencies we are involved in legal matters that have a degree of uncertainty associated with them 
we continually assess the likely outcomes of these matters and the adequacy of amounts  if any  provided for these matters 
there can be no assurance that the ultimate outcome of these matters will not differ materially from our assessment of them 
there also can be no assurance that we know all matters that may be brought against us at any point in time 
income taxes we account for income taxes under the provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
the objectives of accounting for income taxes are to recognize the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year and deferred tax liabilities and assets for the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in the company s financial statements or tax returns 
judgment is required in assessing the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in the company s financial statements or tax returns 
fluctuations in the actual outcome of expected future tax consequences could materially impact the company s financial position or its results of operations 
the company has significant deferred tax assets including net operating loss carryforwards nol cfs for federal income tax purposes which begin to expire in based upon projections of taxable income  we determined that it was more likely than not that all the net deferred tax assets  including the nol cf s will be realized prior to their expiration 
accordingly  we do not have an allowance against deferred tax assets at this time 
we recognize the impact of a tax position  if that position is more likely than not of being sustained on audit  based on the technical merits of the position 
post retirement obligations we sponsor qualified defined benefit plans for abx s flight crewmembers and other eligible employees 
we also sponsor unfunded post retirement healthcare plans for abx s flight crewmembers and non flight crewmember employees 
we also sponsor non qualified  unfunded excess plans that provide benefits to executive management and pilots that are in addition to amounts permitted to be paid through our qualified plans under provisions of the tax laws 
the accounting and valuation for these post retirement obligations are determined by prescribed accounting and actuarial methods that consider a number of assumptions and estimates 
the selection of appropriate assumptions and estimates is significant due to the long time period over which benefits will be accrued and paid 
the long term nature of these benefit payouts increases the sensitivity of certain estimates on our post retirement costs 
in actuarially valuing our pension obligations and determining related expense amounts  assumptions we consider most sensitive are discount rates  expected long term investment returns on plan assets and future salary increases 
other assumptions concerning retirement ages  mortality and employee turnover also affect the valuations 
for our post retirement healthcare plans  consideration of future medical cost trend rates is an important assumption in valuing these obligations 
actual results and future changes in these assumptions could result in future costs that are materially different than those recorded in our annual results of operations 
our actuarial valuation includes an assumed long term rate of return on plan assets of 
our assumed rate of return is based on a targeted long term investment allocation of equity securities  fixed income securities and real estate 
the actual asset allocation at december  was equities  fixed income  real estate and cash 
the company s pension investments include million of the company s assets whose fair values have been estimated in the absence of readily determinable fair values 
such investments include private equity  multi fund investments and real estate funds 
management s estimates are based on information provided by the fund managers or general partners of those funds 

table of contents in evaluating our assumption regarding expected long term investment returns on plan assets  we consider a number of factors including our historical plan returns in connection with our asset allocation policies  assistance from investment consultants hired to provide oversight over our actively managed investment portfolio and long term inflation assumptions 
the selection of the expected return rate materially affects our pension costs 
we reduced our expected long term rate of return from to after analyzing current expected returns on investment vehicles 
if we were to lower our long term rate of return assumption by a hypothetical basis points  expense in would be increased by approximately million 
we use a market value of assets as of the measurement date for determining pension expense 
in selecting the interest rate to discount estimated future benefit payments that have been earned to date to their net present value defined as the projected benefit obligation  we match the plan s benefit payment streams to high quality bonds of similar maturities 
the selection of the discount rate not only affects the reported funded status information as of december as shown in note l to the accompanying consolidated financial statements but also affects the succeeding year s pension and post retirement healthcare costs 
the discount rates selected for december   based on the method described above  was for three plans and for two plans 
if we were to lower our discount rates by a hypothetical basis points  pension expense in would be increased by approximately million 
the assumed future increase in salaries and wages is also a significant estimate in determining pension costs 
in selecting this assumption  we consider abx s historical wage and pensionable earnings increases  future wage increase projections  abx s collective bargaining agreements with its flight crewmembers  and inflation 
we have used a salary increase assumption for abx s non flight crewmembers and a salary increase for flight crewmembers in and will use the same assumptions for in  if we used a salary increase assumption which was basis points higher than that used  pension costs would have increased by approximately million 
the following table illustrates the sensitivity of the aforementioned assumptions on our pension expense in thousands effect of change december  change in assumption pension expense funded status accumulated other comprehensive income pre tax basis point decrease in rate of return basis point decrease in discount rate basis point increase in compensation rates aggregate effect of all the above changes exit activities we account for the costs associated with exit activities in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities 
one time  involuntary employee termination benefits are generally expensed when the company communicates the benefit arrangement to the employee that it will no longer require the services of the employee beyond a minimum retention period 
liabilities for contract termination costs associated with exit activities are recognized in the period incurred and measured initially at fair value 
pension obligations are accounted for in accordance with sfas no 
 employers accounting for settlements and curtailments of defined benefit pension plans and for termination benefits in the event that a significant number of employees are terminated or a pension plan is suspended 

table of contents new accounting pronouncements in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
r  business combinations sfas r 
sfas r amends sfas and provides guidance for recognizing and measuring identifiable assets and goodwill acquired  liabilities assumed  and any non controlling interest in the acquiree 
it revises the treatment of valuation allowance adjustments related to income tax benefits in existence prior to a business combination or prior to the adoption of fresh start reporting 
under sfas  any reduction in the valuation allowance as a result of the recognition of deferred tax assets is adjusted through goodwill  followed by other indefinite lived intangible assets until the net carrying costs of these assets is zero 
by contrast  sfas r requires that any reduction in this valuation allowance be reflected through the income tax provision 
sfas r also provides disclosure requirements to enable users of the financial statements to evaluate the nature and financial effects of the business combination 
sfas r will be effective for fiscal years beginning on or after december  and will be applied prospectively 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
 non controlling interests in consolidated financial statements an amendment of arb no 
sfas 
sfas requires that ownership interests in subsidiaries held by parties other than the parent  and the amount of consolidated net income  be clearly identified  labeled and presented in the consolidated financial statements 
it also requires that once a subsidiary is deconsolidated  any retained non controlling equity investment in the former subsidiary be initially measured at fair value 
sufficient disclosures are required to clearly identify and distinguish between the interests of the parent and the interests of the non controlling owners 
sfas is effective for fiscal years beginning on or after december  and requires retroactive adoption of the presentation and disclosure requirements for existing minority interests 
all other requirements shall be applied prospectively 
the company currently has controlling interests in all subsidiaries  therefore  management expects this standard to have no impact on its financial statements 
in march  the fasb issued sfas no 
 disclosures about derivative instruments and hedging activities an amendment of fasb statement no 
sfas 
sfas requires companies to provide enhanced disclosures regarding derivative instruments and hedging activities 
it requires companies to better convey the purpose of derivative use in terms of the risks that such company is intending to manage 
disclosures about a how and why an entity uses derivative instruments  b how derivative instruments and related hedged items are accounted for under sfas no 
and its related interpretations  and c how derivative instruments and related hedged items affect a company s financial position  financial performance  and cash flows are required 
this statement retains the same scope as sfas no 
and is effective for fiscal years and interim periods beginning after november  the company is currently assessing implementation plans and does not expect the adoption of sfas to have a material impact  if any  on its condensed consolidated financial statements 
in may  the fasb issued sfas no 
 the hierarchy of generally accepted accounting principles sfas 
sfas mandates the gaap hierarchy resides in the accounting literature as opposed to the audit literature 
this has the practical impact of elevating fasb statements of financial accounting concepts in the gaap hierarchy 
the company does not believe this pronouncement will impact its financial statements 
in may  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for financial guarantee insurance contracts an interpretation of fasb statement no 
sfas 
the scope of sfas is limited to financial guarantee insurance and reinsurance contracts 
the pronouncement is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  the company does not believe this pronouncement will impact its financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk in the ordinary course of our business  we are exposed to market risk for changes in the price of jet and diesel fuel  however  this risk is largely mitigated by reimbursement through the dhl acmi agreement and charter agreements with other customers 

table of contents the company also faces financial exposure to changes in interest rates 
as of december   we have million of fixed interest rate debt and million of variable interest rate debt outstanding 
variable interest rate debt exposes us to differences in future cash flows resulting from changes in market interest rates 
some of this risk was mitigated during  as a portion of our interest expense for the debt with variable rate risk was marked up and charged to dhl under our acmi agreement 
at december   million of the million of variable rate debt outstanding had interest that was not marked up and was not charged to dhl under this agreement 
variable interest rate risk can be quantified by estimating the change in annual cash flows resulting from a hypothetical increase in interest rates 
a hypothetical increase or decrease in interest rates would have resulted in a change in interest expense of approximately million for the year ended december  the debt issued at fixed interest rates is exposed to fluctuations in fair value resulting from changes in market interest rates 
fixed interest rate risk can be quantified by estimating the increase in fair value of our long term debt through a hypothetical increase in interest rates 
as of december   a increase in interest rates would have decreased the fair value of our fixed interest rate debt by approximately million 
to reduce our exposure to rising interest rates on anticipated aircraft financing transactions  we entered into five forward treasury lock agreements treasury locks with a major us financial institution during the first quarter of the value of the treasury locks were also based on the ten year us treasury rates  effectively countering the effect of changing interest rates on the anticipated financing transactions 
the last outstanding treasury lock was settled in cash in july  near the forecasted execution date of the anticipated financing transaction 
see note m in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for discussion of our accounting treatment for these hedging transactions 
to reduce the effects of fluctuating libor based interest rates on interest payments that stem from its variable rate outstanding debt  the company entered into interest rate swaps in january under the interest rate swap agreements  the company will pay a fixed rate of and receive a floating rate that resets quarterly based on libor 
for the outstanding notional value  the company expects that the amounts received from the floating leg of the interest rate swap will offset fluctuating payments for interest expense because interest rates for its outstanding debt and the interest rate swap are both based on libor and reset quarterly 
we are exposed to concentration of credit risk primarily through cash deposits  cash equivalents  marketable securities and derivatives 
as part of our risk management process  we monitor and evaluate the credit standing of the financial institutions with which we do business 
the financial institutions with which we do business are generally highly rated 
we are exposed to counterparty risk  which is the loss we could incur if a counterparty to a derivative contract defaulted 
at december   the abx defined benefit pension plan had total investment assets of million under investment management 
see note l in the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further discussion of these assets
