item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
these historical results are not necessarily indicative of the results of operations to be expected for any future period 
in october  we were acquired by orion marine group  inc  formerly known as hunter acquisition corp  a corporation formed and controlled by our former principal stockholders 
for accounting purposes  our company as it existed until the time we were acquired by hunter acquisition corp 
is referred to as our predecessor and our company as it has existed since the acquisition is referred to as our successor 
concurrent with the acquisition and in accordance with gaap  we wrote up the value of our assets to their current market value as determined by appraisals for certain of our assets  such as equipment and land at the time of the transaction 
the result of this write up increased the book value of our assets and the associated depreciation expense 
therefore  depreciation expense for our predecessor was less than depreciation expense for our successor 
in february  we acquired substantially all of the assets  consisting primarily of equipment and excluding working capital  and related business  principally consisting of contracts in progress of orlando  florida based subaqueous services  inc ssi for million in cash

we define ebitda as income before interest  income taxes  depreciation and amortization 
ebitda is used as a supplemental financial measure by our management and by external users of our financial statements such as investors  commercial banks and others  to assess the financial performance of our assets without regard to financing methods  capital structure or historical cost basis  the ability of our assets to generate cash sufficient to pay interest costs and support our indebtedness  our operating performance and return on capital as compared to those of other companies in our industry  without regard to financing or capital structure  and the viability of acquisitions and capital expenditure projects and the overall rates of return on alternative investment opportunities 
ebitda is not a presentation made in accordance with gaap 
ebitda should not be considered an alternative to  or more meaningful than  net income  operating income  cash flows from operating activities or any other measure of financial performance presented in accordance with gaap as measures of operating performance  liquidity or ability to service debt obligations 
because ebitda excludes some  but not all  items that affect net income and is defined differently by different companies in our industry  our definition of ebitda may not be comparable to similarly titled measures of other companies 
ebitda has important limitations as an analytical tool  and you should not consider it in isolation

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations management s discussion and analysis md a provides an overview of our consolidated financial condition and results of operations as well as an analysis of the factors that caused certain key elements of our financial statements to change from one year to the next 
in this md a  we use certain terms and abbreviations that are defined as follows aicpa the american institute of certified public accountants  accounting guidance promulgated by the aicpa is part of the authoritative literature comprising united states gaap 
apb accounting principles board gaap generally accepted accounting principles in the united states sfas statement of financial accounting standards  which accounting standards are adopted by the financial accounting standard board fasb overview we are a leading marine specialty contractor serving the heavy civil marine infrastructure market 
we provide a broad range of marine construction and specialty services on  over and under the water along the gulf coast  the atlantic seaboard and the caribbean basin 
our customers include federal  state and municipal governments  the combination of which accounted for approximately of our revenue in the year ended december   as well as private commercial and industrial enterprises 
we are headquartered in houston  texas 
our contracts are obtained primarily through competitive bidding in response to requests for proposals by federal  state and local agencies and through negotiation with private parties 
our bidding activity is affected by such factors as backlog  current utilization of equipment and other resources  ability to obtain necessary surety bonds and competitive considerations 
the timing and location of awarded contracts may result in unpredictable fluctuations in the results of our operations 
most of our revenue is derived from fixed price contracts 
there are a number of factors that can create variability in contract performance and therefore impact the results of our operations 
the most significant of these include the following completeness and accuracy of the original bid  increases in commodity prices such as concrete  steel and fuel  customer delays and work stoppages due to weather and environmental restrictions  availability and skill level of workers  and a change in availability and proximity of equipment and materials 
all of these factors can impose inefficiencies on contract performance  which can impact the timing of revenue recognition and contract profitability 
we plan our operations and bidding activity with these factors in mind and they have not had a material adverse impact on the results of our operations in the past 
business drivers and measures industry trends impact our results of operations 
in operating our business and monitoring its performance  we also pay attention to a number of performance measures and operational factors 

table of contents industry trends our performance is impacted by overall spending in the heavy civil marine infrastructure market 
spending by our customers  both government and private  is impacted by several important trends affecting our industry  including the following port and channel expansion and maintenance  deteriorating condition of intracoastal waterways and bridges  continued demand in the cruise industry  the continuing us base realignment and closure program brac  infrastructure spending by the united states navy and coast guard  near shore oil and gas capital expenditures ongoing us coastal wetlands restoration and reclamation  recurring hurricane restoration and repair  the billion federal water resources development act of wrda  and the billion american recovery and reinvestment act of not trends in the aggregate  these industry trends drive marine transportation facility construction  dredging  bridge building  repair and maintenance  as well as specialty services that we perform in our markets 
bidding most of our contracts are obtained through competitive bidding on terms specified by the party inviting the bid 
the nature of the contract specifications dictates the type of equipment  material and labor involved  all of which affect the cost of performing the contract and the price that our competitors will bid 
contracts for projects are generally awarded to the lowest qualified bidder  provided the bid is no greater than the amount of funds that are budgeted and available for the project 
if all bids are greater than the available funds  then projects may be subject to rebid or cancellation as a result of budget constraints 
utilization an important factor that we take into consideration when we manage our business is the current and projected utilization of our equipment and personnel 
we do not measure utilization of equipment or personnel in the aggregate  but rather track utilization by our major pieces of equipment  such as barges  cranes  dredges  tugs  etc  and the associated personnel required to operate the equipment 
backlog once we have successfully bid on a project and executed a contract to perform the work  we record the value of the contract as backlog 
our backlog is the financial representation of the revenue associated with the future commitments of our equipment and personnel tracked in our project management software system 
backlog consists of projects that have either a not yet started  or b are in progress but are not yet complete 
consequently  backlog is also an important factor we use to monitor our business 
the typical duration of our contracts is three to nine months  so our backlog at any point in time usually represents only a portion of the revenue that we expect to realize during a twelve month period 
as our business continues to grow  we expect that our backlog will increase over time 
however  our backlog may fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter  and a quarterly decrease of our backlog might not necessarily translate into a deterioration of our business 
for example  in anticipation of bidding on a large project for which we believe we will be the successful bidder  we may choose not to bid on near term projects so that our schedule can accommodate a large job 
even though this management decision would result in a near term decline in our backlog  it is not inconsistent with our dual goals of maintaining high utilization rates of our equipment and personnel and long term growth in our backlog 
revenue we recognize our revenue using the percentage of completion methodology 
percentage of completion for construction contracts is measured principally by the costs incurred and accrued to date for each contract to the estimated total costs for each contract at completion 
we generally consider contracts substantially complete upon acceptance by the customer and departure from the construction site 
a significant portion of our revenue depends on project funding by various government agencies and is adversely affected by decreased level of  or delays in  government funding 
cost of revenue the components of costs of contract revenues include labor  equipment including depreciation  insurance  fuel  maintenance and supplies  materials  lease expense and project overhead 
costs of contract revenues vary significantly depending on the type and location of work performed and assets utilized 
since the realization of our revenue is driven primarily by the cost of our revenues in relation to our estimated total costs to complete a contract  we monitor the costs realized to date and the estimated costs required to complete a project very closely  on a project by project basis  using our project management software system 
by closely monitoring our jobs  we are able to quickly identify potential issues and respond accordingly 
we believe that our ability to effectively manage the cost of revenue is a competitive strength of our organization and is indicative of the depth of our management team 

table of contents another important aspect of managing our cost of revenue is to recognize opportunities for change orders  which is a change to the original specifications of the contract  and occurs once a project has begun 
in doing so  we are able to a recognize additional revenue from a project on a negotiated basis  rather than a competitive bidding situation  at generally higher margins  and b avoid potential disputes with our customers regarding required deviations from the original terms of the contract 
selling  general and administrative expenses our selling  general and administrative costs include non contract related salaries and expenses  incentive compensation  discretionary profit sharing and other variable compensation  as well as other overhead costs to support our overall business 
in general  these costs will increase in response to our growth and the related increased complexity of our business 
other factors other factors that will influence our operations in future periods include the following seasonality 
substantially all of our services are performed on  over and under the water  causing our results to be subject to seasonal variations due to weather conditions 
the core markets in which we operate the gulf coast  the atlantic seaboard and the caribbean basin are affected by hurricanes and tropical storms during hurricane season  which occurs annually in the gulf of mexico and atlantic ocean from june through november 
over of the hurricanes and tropical storms occur during hurricane season  and occur from august through october 
generally  wet conditions do not affect our operations  but major hurricanes and tropical storms may temporarily delay our operations  and we monitor all named storm systems to determine which projects  if any  will be affected 
because hurricanes and tropical storms move slowly  we usually have ample time to prepare appropriately for the storm  which typically includes demobilizing much of our equipment and removing our employees from the job site 
once the storm has passed  we must then mobilize our personnel and equipment back to the job site  which results in delays in the completion of our work and may result in an increase in the costs associated with performing our work 
generally  in our fixed price contracts we bear the risks of increased costs  delays to completion of work  damage to our equipment  and damage to the work already completed at a job site  related to severe weather conditions  such as hurricanes and tropical storms 
consequently  our cost estimates to complete a job in a hurricane prone area during hurricane season include costs related to mobilizing and demobilizing personnel and equipment  and our schedule assumes there will be delays associated with hurricanes and tropical storms 
in  seven named storms affected the atlantic and gulf coastal regions of the united state 
at least one storm during this time affected all of our job sites  and several projects experienced delays due to the impact of as many as three storms  utilizing the contingencies in place and resulting in higher project costs than if we had not used the contingency 
in years where the hurricane activity is less than expected or does not significantly impact our job sites  as was the case in and  we are able to release certain contingencies within our jobs as they are completed 
surety bonding 
in connection with our business  we generally are required to provide various types of surety bonds that provide an additional measure of security to our customers for our performance under certain government and private sector contracts 
our ability to obtain surety bonds depends upon our capitalization  working capital  past performance  management expertise and external factors  including the capacity of the overall surety market 
surety companies consider such factors in light of the amount of our backlog that we have currently bonded and their current underwriting standards  which may change from time to time 
during the year ended december   approximately of our projects  measured by revenue  required us to post a bond 
the bonds we provide typically have face amounts ranging from to million 
as of december   we had approximately million in surety bonds outstanding and we believe our capacity under our current bonding arrangement was in excess of million in aggregate surety bonds 
we believe that our bonding capacity provides us with a significant competitive advantage relative to many of our local competitors  as many of these competitors are sole proprietors and are often required to personally guarantee their surety bonds  which frequently limits their bonding capacity 

table of contents outlook 
global economic conditions have worsened due to the effects of continuing tight credit conditions  reduced consumer and capital spending and other recessionary factors 
concerns over the economic downturn are affecting numerous companies and industries  and many states are facing difficult budget decisions which could result in reduced demand for general construction projects 
this reduced demand may increase the number of potential bidders in our markets and could increase the competitive environment through pressure on pricing 
budgeting decisions and constraints due to the tight credit markets or other recessionary factors may result in the diversion of funds from projects we perform to other uses  project bids may be postponed or otherwise delayed  and existing projects may be cancelled or reduced in scope 
a weak economy may also produce less tax revenue  thereby decreasing funds for public sector projects 
to date  we have not seen a general  significant decline in our end market bidding activity  including port development projects  cruise ship pier development  and general infrastructure maintenance and improvements 
however  in this uncertain economic climate  deterioration or delays in certain end markets may develop  while bidding opportunities in other end markets  such as infrastructure spending and hurricane protection may increase 
additionally  supplemental emergency funding legislation signed into law in provides million to the corp of engineers allocated for emergency dredging and construction projects in areas affected by the storms  which include the markets in which we operate 
the billion american recovery and reinvestment act was recently signed into law and provides billion of infrastructure spending  including billion toward highway construction  billion to the us army corps of engineers  and million for us coast guard bridge alterations and construction improvements 
the cost of certain commodities used in our business  such as concrete  steel and fuel  continued to fluctuate significantly in recent months 
because our projects are normally short term in nature  we are generally able to include price increases in the costs of our bids  and  in certain circumstances  may be able to negotiate for price escalations during the execution of a contract 
however  certain projects may be negatively impacted by substantial cost increases 
we continue to evaluate our credit exposure as the global credit market crises continues 
during the year ended december   our operations provided cash from operations in excess of million and our cash position at december  was in excess of million 
our operations are not currently dependent on external short term funding and we have not utilized the million available to us under our revolving credit facility 
our focus in will be to concentrate on our core objectives  to manage our business effectively and efficiently in this recessionary economic environment  to pursue rational growth strategies while closely monitoring the costs of our operations  and to maintain our strong balance sheet 
significant changes in ownership private placement in may  we completed the sale of  shares of our common stock at a sale price of per share to qualified institutional buyers  non us persons and accredited investors 
in addition  we repurchased and retired all of our outstanding preferred stock and  shares of our common stock from our former principal stockholders using approximately million of the net proceeds  which resulted in a net increase in shares outstanding of  shares 
the private placement is more fully described in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 

table of contents critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements  and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
our significant accounting policies are described in more detail in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements  we believe the following accounting policies to be critical to the judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements 
revenue recognition we enter into construction contracts principally on the basis of competitive bids 
although the terms of our contracts vary considerably  most are made on a fixed price basis 
revenues from construction contracts are recognized on the percentage of completion method in accordance with the aicpa statement of position  accounting for performance of construction type and certain production type contracts 
the percentage of completion method measures the ratio of costs incurred and accrued to date for each contract to the estimated total costs for each contract at completion 
this requires us to prepare on going estimates of the costs to complete each contract as the project progresses 
in preparing these estimates  we make significant judgments and assumptions concerning our significant cost drivers of materials  labor and equipment  and we evaluate contingencies based on possible schedule variances  production delays or other productivity factors 
actual costs may vary from the costs we estimated 
variations from estimated contract costs along with other risks inherent in fixed price contracts may result in actual revenue and gross profits differing from those we estimated and could result in losses on projects 
if a current estimate of total contract cost indicates a loss on a contract  the projected loss is recognized in full when determined 
we consider unapproved change orders to be contract variations on which we have customer approval for scope change  but not for price associated with that scope change 
these costs are included in the estimated cost to complete the contracts and are expensed as incurred 
we recognize revenue equal to cost incurred on unapproved changed orders when realization of price approval is probable and the estimated amount is equal to or greater than our cost related to the unapproved change order and the related margin when the change order is formally approved by the customer 
revenue recognized on unapproved change orders is included in contract costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings on uncompleted contracts on the balance sheet 
we consider claims to be amounts that we seek or will seek to collect from customers or others for customer caused changes in contract specifications or design  or other customer related causes of unanticipated additional contract costs on which there is no agreement with customers on both scope and price changes 
revenue from claims is recognized when agreement is reached with customers as to the value of the claims  which in some instances may not occur until after completion of work under the contract 
costs associated with claims are included in the estimated costs to complete the contracts and are expensed when incurred 
depending on the size of a particular project  variations from estimated project costs could have a significant impact on our operating results for any fiscal quarter or year 
we believe our exposure to losses on fixed price contracts is limited by the relatively short duration of the contracts we undertake and our management s experience in estimating contract costs 
we provide for contract losses in their entirety in the period they become known  without regard to the percentage of completion 
long lived assets fixed assets are carried at cost and are depreciated over their estimated useful lives  ranging from one to thirty years  using the straight line method for financial reporting purposes and accelerated methods for tax reporting purposes 
the carrying value of all long lived assets is evaluated periodically in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  to determine if adjustment to the depreciation period or the carrying value is warranted 
if events and circumstances indicate that the long lived assets should be reviewed for possible impairment  we use projections to assess whether future cash flows on a non discounted basis related to the tested assets are likely to exceed the recorded carrying amount of those assets to determine if write down is appropriate 
if we identify impairment  we will report a loss to the extent that the carrying value of the impaired assets exceeds their fair values as determined by valuation techniques appropriate in the circumstances that could include the use of similar projections on a discounted basis 

table of contents goodwill we evaluate goodwill annually for potential impairment in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets and more frequently if an event or circumstance indicates that impairment may have occurred 
we perform our required annual impairment test for goodwill using a discounted cash flow analysis supported by comparative market multiples to determine the fair values of our reporting units versus their book values 
when a possible impairment for a reporting unit is indicated  the implied fair value of goodwill is tested by comparing the carrying amount of net assets of the reporting unit excluding goodwill to the total fair value 
when the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value  an impairment charge is recorded 

included in this evaluation are certain assumptions and estimates to determine fair value of reporting units such as estimates of future cash flows  discount rates as well as assumptions and estimates related to valuation of other identifiable intangible assets 
changes in these assumptions and estimates or significant changes to the market value of our company could materially impact our results of operations or financial position 
as of december   goodwill was million and no impairment loss was recorded during the year 
income taxes we account for income taxes in accordance with sfas no 
accounting for income taxes and other applicable authoritative pronouncements 
we evaluate valuation allowances for deferred tax assets for which future realization is uncertain 
we perform this evaluation at least annually at the end of each fiscal year 
the estimation of required valuation allowance includes estimates of future taxable income 
in our assessment of our deferred tax assets at december   we considered that it was more likely than not that all of the deferred tax assets would be realized 
the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible 
we consider the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities  projected future taxable income and tax planning strategies in making this assessment 
we account for uncertain tax positions in accordance with the provisions of fasb interpretation no 
accounting for uncertainty in income taxes fin 
the implementation of fin required us to make subjective assumptions and judgments regarding income tax exposure 
interpretations of and guidance surrounding income tax laws and regulations change over time  and these may change our subjective assumptions  which in turn  may affect amounts recognized in the condensed consolidated balance sheets and statements of income 
insurance matters  litigation  claims and contingencies we maintain insurance coverage for our business and operations 
insurance related to property  equipment  automobile  general liability and a portion of workers compensation is provided through traditional policies  subject to a deductible 
a portion of our workers compensation exposure is covered through a mutual association  which is subject to supplemental calls 
we have elected to retain a portion of losses that may occur through the use of various deductibles  limits and retentions under our insurance programs 
in accordance with sfas no 
accounting for contingencies  losses on these policies up to the deductible amounts are accrued in our consolidated balance sheets based on known claims incurred and an estimate of claims incurred but not yet reported 
we derive our accruals from actuarial studies  known facts  historical trends and industry averages utilizing the assistance of an actuary to determine the best estimate of the ultimate expected loss 
actual claims may vary from our estimate 
we include any adjustments to such reserves in our consolidated results of operations 
accounting for stock issued to employees and others we account for equity awards issued to employees and others under the provisions of sfas no 
r  share based payment 
among its provisions  sfas no 
r requires the company to recognize compensation expense for equity awards over the vesting period based on the fair value of these awards at the date of grant 
we use the black scholes option pricing model to compute the fair value of option awards on the date of grant 
the black scholes model requires the use of highly subjective assumptions in the computation 
changes in these assumptions can cause significant fluctuations in the fair value assigned to the option award 
the fair value of restricted stock grants is equivalent to the fair value of the stock issued on the date of grant 

table of contents acquisition of assets as discussed in note in the notes to consolidated financial services  on february   subaqueous services  llc ssllc  a wholly owned subsidiary of the company purchased substantially all of the assets and related business of subaqueous services  inc ssi 
since the date of acquisition  we have integrated these assets into our operations  and stand alone information is not provided

total revenue increased million or  from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  the increase in revenue was due to geographic expansion of our dredging capabilities along the eastern coast of the united states and to the progress schedules and rate of completion of the contracts in progress in  despite an active hurricane season in the year with seven named storms that affected our entire operations at various times 
revenues generated by the private sector increased by a substantial in as compared with however  revenues generated from federal agencies decreased by in as compared with due to a slow volume of bid opportunities by the corps of engineers 
gross profit 
gross profit was comparable to the prior year  however  gross margin decreased from in to in the downward pressure on margin was due primarily to the use of outside subcontractors resulting from the scope of work in the mix of contracts in progress during  which reduced our self performance rate as measured by cost from in to in significant production delays which resulted from unexpected amounts of trash and unforeseen site conditions on two projects involving dredging services  negatively affected gross margins 
in addition  we achieved higher margins on certain projects in  due to productivity gains on labor and other factors 
selling  general and administrative expense 
as compared with the prior year  selling  general and administrative expenses sg a increased million or in current year expenses include amortization related to intangible assets  additional overheads to support the business growth we experienced in  and a full complement of annual public company expenses 
in addition  we increased our bad debt reserve to million  related to receivables on two projects  and our property taxes increased as compared with  due in part to property taxes related to our geographic expansion 
in the prior year  we incurred one time payments of bonuses and incentives to key employees upon the successful consummation of the common stock offering in may  which totaled approximately million 
as a percentage of revenues  however  sg a expenses decreased slightly  from of revenues to  reflecting our continued focus on the management of costs 

table of contents interest expense  net of interest income 
the increase in interest expense in directly resulted from debt incurred to purchase the assets of ssi in february in  upon closing of the private placement transaction  we repaid all debt outstanding at that time 
we earn interest income on the cash balances we maintain throughout the year 
income tax expense 
our effective tax rate of differed from our statutory rate of  primarily due to the benefit of the domestic production activities deduction on the company s tax return and true ups of federal and state deferred taxes 
excluding these true ups  which should not reoccur  our effective tax rate was and differed from the statutory rate due to our estimate of the impact of certain permanent deductions available on our federal tax return  offset by increases in state income taxes 
the effective rate of in differed from the statutory rate primarily due to permanent non deductible differences and to state income taxes

total revenue increased million or  from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  the increase in revenue was due to the progress schedules and rate of completion of the contracts in progress in  which is driven by the size  composition and scope of the projects during the year 
revenues generated by local government agencies and the private sector increased by a substantial in as compared with however  revenues generated from federal agencies decreased by in as compared with due to funding constraints on the corps of engineers  which reduced the availability of work in that sector 
during  we began construction of a causeway in florida  and we completed a cruise dock terminal facility in texas 
other projects of significance in included work on container terminals in texas and louisiana  a shoreline protection project in louisiana and a bridge replacement in florida 
gross profit 
gross profit increased million or in as compared with  and gross margin improved from to 
we achieved these increases in profit and margin through productivity gains on labor and a reduction in subcontracting costs to of total costs compared with of total costs in the same period last year  reflecting our self performance of more of the work on contracts during the year 

table of contents selling  general and administrative expense 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased million or in compared with the increase was due to one time payments of bonuses and incentives to key employees upon the successful consummation of the common stock offering in may  which totaled approximately million 
in addition  salaries and benefits increased by million driven by increases in headcount  realignment of our incentive programs  increases in our current estimate under our self insurance plans and to increases in our stock based compensation expense 
interest income  expense  net 
the decrease was primarily due to a reduction in interest expense in  resulting from the repayment of debt in the current year 
in addition  we generated interest income from cash received on the proceeds of our sale of common stock in may income tax expense 
our effective tax rate of was comparable to the prior year rate of 
liquidity and capital resources our primary liquidity needs are for financing working capital  investment in capital expenditures and strategic acquisitions 
historically  our source of liquidity has been cash provided by our operating activities and borrowings under our credit facility 
as of december   we had available cash of million and million in debt  which matures in at december   we had available cash of million  with no debt outstanding 
during  we efficiently managed our working capital components of accounts receivable and payable  completed the purchase of the assets of ssi  and enhanced our equipment fleet through million in capital expenditures 
in  we completed an offering of our common stock to investors  and increased our operating margins  which factors generated sufficient funds to support our cash demands and reduce our debt 
as of december   our working capital was million compared to million at december  the increase of million in working capital was primarily due to an increase in trade accounts receivable of million  resulting from the higher revenues generated in  increases in income tax receivables and prepaid items  increase in billings in excess of costs and estimated earnings on uncompleted contracts  net of costs and estimated earnings on uncompleted contracts  reflecting the timing of billings to customers and the utilization of funds we receive in advance for such contract items as mobilization 
fluctuations in working capital result from normal increases and decreases relative to our operational activity 
as of december   we had cash on hand and availability under our revolving credit facility of million 
we continue to evaluate our credit exposure in response to the current global credit market crises 
at december   our operations provided cash from operations in excess of million and our cash position was in excess of million 
our operations are not currently dependent on external short term funding and we have not utilized our available borrowing of million under our revolving credit facility 
however  we have identified the following risks to our liquidity and capital resources 
these are included and discussed in detail in item a risk factors  elsewhere in this annual report on form k the global financial crisis may have impacts on our business and financial condition that we currently cannot predict 
the downturn in economic conditions may impact our customers ability to pay for services and finance projects 

table of contents we expect to meet our future internal liquidity and working capital needs  service our debt  and maintain our equipment fleet through capital expenditure purchases and major repairs  from funds generated in our operating activities for at least the next months 
at december   we had million in cash  an increase of million compared with our cash balances at december   and we increased our working capital position by million in the comparable periods 
we believe our cash position  combined with the capacity available under our revolving credit facility is adequate for our general business requirements 
the following table provides information regarding our cash flows and our capital expenditures for the years ended december   and year ended december  in thousands cash provided by used in operating activites investing activities financing activities capital expenditures included in investing activities above operating activities 
fluctuations in cash generated by operating activities are generally the result of timing differences related to the nature and volume of contracts in any given year 
in  we sold a vessel no longer considered integral to our fleet and recognized a gain of million upon the sale 
our accounts receivable balances increased approximately million compared with levels  of which million is attributable to retentions held until project completion beyond in addition  accounts payable balances increased by million in as compared with  generally related to the timing of payments to vendors

investing activities 
we purchase capital equipment to support our construction activities as well as perform major maintenance and upgrades of our existing fleet and construction equipment 
capital expenditures supporting our operations totaled million in  an increase of million as compared with in  we upgraded a dredge to enhance our dredging capabilities
