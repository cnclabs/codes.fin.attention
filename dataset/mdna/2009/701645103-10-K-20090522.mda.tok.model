item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
you should read the following discussion in conjunction with part i  including matters set forth in the risk factors section of this annual report on form k  and our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere in this form k 
on may   we announced a two for one stock split of common stock in the form of a dividend  for stockholders of record on may  the stock split 
the stock split was effected on june   and did not include shares held in treasury 
all discussions concerning common stock  earnings per share  and outstanding shares throughout this annual report on form k as well as comparable share information  have been adjusted to reflect the stock split 
in connection with the stock split  we modified outstanding warrants 
see note v to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further discussion of the effect of the modification of warrants in connection with the stock split and the related non cash share based compensation expense recorded during the year ended march  overview parlux fragrances  inc is engaged in the business of creating  designing  manufacturing  distributing and selling prestige fragrances and beauty related products marketed primarily through specialty stores  national department stores and perfumeries on a worldwide basis 
the fragrance market is generally divided into a prestige group distributed primarily through department and specialty stores and a mass market group primarily chain drug stores  mass merchandisers  smaller perfumeries and pharmacies 
our fragrance products are positioned primarily in the prestige group 
we distribute certain brands through perfumania  a specialty retailer of fragrances in the united states and puerto rico  a wholly owned subsidiary of perfumania holdings  inc  formerly known as e com ventures  inc  a company in which our former chairman and chief executive officer had an ownership interest and held identical management positions until february perfumania is one of our largest customers  and transactions with perfumania are closely monitored by management  and any unusual trends or issues are brought to the attention of our audit committee and board of directors 
during fiscal year  perfumania holdings  inc s majority shareholders acquired an approximate ownership interest in the company at that time at march   and accordingly  transactions with perfumania will continue to be presented as related party transactions 
during the fiscal year ended march   we engaged in the manufacture through sub contractors  distribution and sale of paris hilton  guess  jessica simpson  nicole miller  xoxo  ocean pacific  maria sharapova  andy roddick  and babygund fragrances on an exclusive basis as a licensee 
during the fiscal year ended march   we entered into exclusive license agreements with josie natori  queen latifah  and mark ecko and extended the license with paris hilton for an additional five years through june  during december  we sold the perry ellis fragrance rights and other related assets to the licensor  perry ellis international pei 
additionally  we previously manufactured  distributed and sold fred hayman beverly hills fhbh fragrances on a worldwide basis until we sublicensed these rights in the paris hilton and guess brands of fragrances and accessories accounted for approximately and  respectively  of our gross sales from continuing operations during the fiscal year ended march   and and  respectively  of our gross sales from continuing operations during the year ended march  if paris hilton s appeal as a celebrity were to diminish  or guess would not approve shipments to our international distributors see licensing agreements in item for further discussion it could result in a material reduction in our sales of products licensed by them  adversely affecting our results of operations and operating cash flows 
that risk has become more significant as these product lines have become our primary source of revenue 
the paris hilton fragrance license is scheduled to expire on june  the guess license is scheduled to expire on december  we anticipate that t he guess license will not be renewed beyond its current expiration date 
we may be required to record charges to operations to reduce the recorded value of any remaining inventory to the amounts which would be realized upon their sale or liquidations 
we continue to discuss the transition of any remaining inventory with guess and have implemented a plan to reduce the inventory levels of the guess products 
under the terms of the license agreement  we would have ninety days after the termination of the license to sell off any remaining inventory 
at the end of that period  guess has the option of purchasing the remaining inventory  or the inventory must be destroyed 
while management believes that our inventory position in guess products is stated at its lower of cost or market  if at the end of the contract period  inventory levels are significant  and guess elects not to purchase the entire remaining inventory  we could have a material inventory write off 
we expanded our product licenses under the paris hilton brand into the accessory market in  specifically  watches  handbags  purses  small leather goods  cosmetics and sunglasses 
we believed such products  which have similar distribution channels to our fragrance products  could strengthen our position with our current customers and distributors while providing incremental sales volume 
our sales under such accessory licenses have been insufficient to offset the minimum annual royalties paid to the licensor 
we are currently analyzing different options for these additional licenses to determine the most efficient and profitable method to produce and distribute such products  including possible assignment or sublicensing of our rights thereunder 
during the year ended march   we sublicensed the international rights for handbags  purses  wallets  and other small leather goods 
we generated million in fiscal year and million in fiscal year in sublicense revenue 
we anticipate minimum revenues of million under this sublicense for fiscal in addition  during january  we sublicensed the worldwide exclusive licensing rights for paris hilton sunglasses 
although we remain contingently liable for the minimum guaranteed royalty from our assignment of the license  we anticipate offsetting approximately of the remaining minimum guaranteed royalty from our assignment of the license over the remaining terms of the agreement 
critical accounting policies and estimates sec financial reporting release no 
 cautionary advice regarding disclosure about critical accounting policies frr  suggests companies provide additional disclosure and commentary on those accounting policies considered most critical 
frr considers an accounting policy to be critical if it is important to the company s financial condition and results  and requires significant judgment and estimates on the part of management in its application 
we believe the accounting policies described below represent our critical accounting policies as contemplated by frr see note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for a detailed discussion on the application of these and other accounting policies 
accounting for long lived assets 
the majority of our long lived assets are the result of the acquisition of existing license brands 
for newly launched brands our long lived assets are generally the result of our investment in trademarking brand names and designs  and are generally not a material portion of our assets 
the value of our long lived assets  including brand licenses and trademarks  is exposed to future adverse changes if we experience declines in operating results or experience significant negative industry or economic trends 
on an annual basis  long lived assets are reviewed for impairment under the provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  or sooner  if events or circumstances have occurred that indicate a potential impairment 
impairment losses are recognized if expected undiscounted future cash flows of the long lived assets are less than their carrying va lues 
future cash flows can be effected by changes in industry or market conditions 
the assumptions used include an analysis by license  and by fragrance produced under each license  which may vary depending on the age of the product 
expected sales along with related costs of sales  direct expenses and certain allocated charges are projected through the end of each given license period 
expected sales estimates incorporate the age of a product and its market distribution 
although certain products may not be widely distributed  we may have certain distribution channels  such as specialty discount stores  where the product is in demand 
direct expenses  including cost of goods and royalties  vary by product  but generally range between to 
allocated charges include selling and distribution costs  marketing expenses and depreciation of molds 
although these costs vary by brand  management anticipates that these costs would range between and 
the net unamortized balance of our trademarks and l icenses at march   is approximately million 
management does not anticipate any further material write down will be required going forward  however  if actual results differ from management s estimates  or if the economic environment should deteriorate  additional write downs may be required which could have a material adverse effect on our operating results 
we recorded a non cash impairment charge for the xoxo fragrance license of million in fiscal year and million in fiscal year these impairment charges are included in depreciation and amortization expense in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations 
our management determined that this asset would be reviewed on a quarterly basis going forward 
as a result of our quarterly review  we determined that there was no further impairment charges recorded during the year ended march  allowance for sales returns 
as is customary in the prestige fragrance industry  we grant most of our unrelated us department store customers the right to return a product which does not sell through to consumers 
at the time of sale  we record a provision for estimated product returns based on our historical sell through experience  economic trends and changes in our assessment of customer demand 
based upon this information  we provide an allowance for sales returns 
it is generally after the specific gift giving season mother s day  christmas  etc 
that our customers request approval for the return of unsold items 
we decide to accept returns on a case by case basis 
there is considerable judgment used in evaluating the factors influencing the provision for returns  and additional allowances in any particular period may be needed  if actual returns received exceed estimates  reducing net sales 
the allowance for sales returns was million and million at march   and  respectively 
fluctuations in the allowance balance are generally higher after gift giving seasons and are estimated based on a three month period  as it generally takes between two to three months for us to receive such returns 
historically  our estimated allowances have been sufficient to cover the amount of returns subsequently received 
however  an increase in sales returns due to a change in economic conditions  or otherwise  could have a material impact on our operating results 
allowances for doubtful accounts receivable 
we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts to cover anticipated uncollectible accounts receivable  and we evaluate our accounts receivable to determine if they will ultimately be collected 
this evaluation includes significant judgments and estimates  including a customer by customer review for large accounts 
if the financial condition of our customers  or any one customer  deteriorates resulting in an impairment of their ability to pay  additional allowances may be required 
the allowance for doubtful accounts receivable was million and million at march   and  respectively 
we continuously monitor the collectability of our receivables by analyzing the aging of our accounts receivable  assessing our customers credit worthiness  and evaluating the impact of the changes in economic conditions 
historically  our estimated allowances have been sufficient to cover our uncollectable receivables 
however  significant changes in the circumstances that affect the collectability of our receivables could have a material impact on our cash flows and operating results 
we have an ongoing relationship with perfumania for almost years 
all activities with perfumania are reported as related party activities  due to certain common stockholders 
while our invoice terms to perfumania are stated as net ninety days  for over ten years  management has granted longer payment terms see note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further discussion 
management evaluates the credit risk involved  which is determined based on perfumania s reported results and comparable store sales performance 
our management holds discussions with perfumania s management on a regular on going basis in order to monitor their activity 
on an annual basis  as well as quarterly  sales projections to perfumania are reviewed along with a planned payment program  in order to ensure that perfumania s receivable balance is maintained at acceptable levels 
based upon these facts  management believes that n o reserves are required for the receivable due from perfumania 
inventory write downs 
inventories are stated at the lower of cost using the first in  first out method or market 
the cost of inventories includes product costs  inbound freight and handling charges  including an allocation of our applicable overhead in an amount of million and million at march   and  respectively 
we classify certain inventories as non current when projected sales indicate that such inventory will not be sold within the next twelve month period 
the lead time for certain of our raw materials and components inventory up to days requires us to maintain at least a three to six month supply of some items in order to ensure production schedules 
these lead times are most effected for glass and plastic components orders  as many of our unique designs require the production of molds in addition to the normal production process 
this may take to days  or longer  to receive in stock 
in addition  when we launch a new brand or stock keeping unit sku  we frequently produce a six to nine month supply to ensure adequate inventories if the new products exceed our forecasted expectations 
we believe that the gross margins on our products outweigh the potential for out of stock situations  and the additional carrying costs to maintain higher inventory levels 
also  the composition of our inventory at any given point can vary considerably depending on whether there is a la unch of a new product  or a planned sale of a significant amount of product to one or more of our major distributors 
however  if future sales do not reach forecasted levels  it could result in excess inventories and may cause us to decrease prices to reduce inventory levels 
we classify our inventory into three major categories finished goods  raw materials  and components and packaging materials 
finished goods include items that are ready for sale to our customers  or essentially complete and ready for use in value sets or other special offers 
raw materials consist of fragrance oils or bulk 
components and packaging materials such as bottles  caps  boxes  etc 
are the individual elements used to manufacture our finished goods 
the levels of our inventory maintained vary depending on the age of a brand  its commercial success and market distribution 
we normally carry higher levels of new products and older products for which demand remains high 
older  slower moving products are periodically reviewed  and inventory levels adjusted  based upon expected future sales 
if inventory levels exceed projected demand  our management determines whether a product requires a markdown in order to sell the inventory at discounted prices 
our management also reviews whether there are any excess components which should be marked down or scrapped due to decreased product demand 
our inventories and write downs  by major categories  as of march   and  are as follows march  finished goods components and packaging material raw material total in millions inventories less write downs net inventories march  finished goods components and packaging material raw material total in millions inventories less write downs net inventories we perform a review of our inventory on a quarterly basis  unless events or circumstances indicate a need for review more frequently 
the write down of inventory results from the application of an analytical approach that incorporates a comparison of our sales expectations to the amount of inventory on hand 
other qualitative reasons for marking down selected inventory may include  but is not limited to  product expiration  licensor restrictions  damages  and general economic conditions 
as of march   and  management determined that approximately million and million  respectively  of the finished goods inventory was either selling slower than anticipated or showed signs of deterioration 
this inventory was marked down by million and million in fiscal year and  respectively 
components and packaging materials are reviewed in light of estimated future sales for finished go ods or damages sustained during the production of finished goods 
as of march   and  approximately million and million  respectively  were identified as problematic and the inventory was marked down by million and million  respectively 
raw materials are usually scrapped due to spoilage or stability issues 
as of march   and  approximately million and million were identified as problematic and the inventory was marked down by million and million  respectively 
during the years ended march    and  the carrying value of certain inventory was reduced by million  million  and million  respectively  which was recorded in cost of goods sold in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations 
based upon this review  management has determined that its inventory is stated at the lower of cost or market value  however  if we are not successful in selling our inventory  we may need to write down our inventory further or sell it at significantly reduced prices or we may not be able to sell such inventory at all  which could have a material adverse affect on our financial condition and results of operations 
demonstration and cooperative advertising allowances 
we record allowances for demonstration chargebacks and cooperative advertising costs 
the demonstration chargebacks are recorded based on demonstration programs with specific us department stores 
the allowance for demonstration chargebacks was million and million at march   and  respectively 
fluctuations in the allowance balance are generally higher after gift giving seasons and are estimated based on a three month period 
cooperative advertising  which is under the direct control of our customer and includes a percentage rebate or deduction based on net sales to the customer  is accrued and recorded as a reduction of net sales at the time of sale 
cooperative advertising with our customers  which is under our direct control  and at our option  including catalogue and other forms of print advertising  are included in advertising and promotional expenses in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations 
the costs associated with the specific advertisements are recorded as incurred  and when applicable  are applied against trade accounts receivable 
the allowance for cooperative advertising was million and million at march   and  respectively 
historically  our estimated allowances have been sufficient to cover the amount of our chargebacks and cooperating advertising costs 
income taxes and valuation allowance 
if warranted  we record a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
we consider projected future taxable income and ongoing tax planning strategies in assessing the valuation allowance 
in the event we determine that we may not be able to realize all or part of our deferred tax asset in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would be charged to earnings in the period of such determination  which such adjustment could be material 
on april   we adopted the provisions of financial accounting standards board fasb interpretation no 
fin  accounting for uncertainty in income taxes  an interpretation of fasb statement no 
 which clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in the financial statements in accordance with fasb statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for income taxes 
fin prescribes a recognition threshold of more likely than not and a measurement attribute on all tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return in order to be recognized in the financial statements 
in making this assessment  a company must determine whether it is more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained upon examination  including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes  based sol ely on the technical merits of the position and must assume that the tax position will be examined by appropriate taxing authority that would have full knowledge of all relevant information 
once the recognition threshold is met  the tax position is then measured to determine the actual amount of benefit to recognize in the financial statements 
in addition  the recognition threshold of more likely than not must continue to be met in each reporting period to support continued recognition of the tax benefit 
tax positions that previously failed to meet the more likely than not recognition threshold should be recognized in the first financial reporting period in which that threshold is met 
previously recognized tax positions that no longer meet the more likely than not recognition threshold should be derecognized in the financial reporting period in which that threshold is no longer met 
as a result of the implementation of fin  we did not recognize a liability for unrecognized tax benefits or adjust any r ecorded liabilities for uncertain tax positions and  accordingly  we were not required to record any cumulative effect adjustment to beginning of year retained earnings 
as of the date of adoption through the year ended march   there was no material liability for income tax associated with unrecognized tax benefits 
we do not anticipate any material adjustments relating to unrecognized tax benefits within the next twelve months  however  the outcome of tax matters is uncertain and unforeseen results can occur 
stock based compensation 
prior to april   we accounted for our compensation plans under the recognition and measurement provisions of accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and related interpretations 
the fair values of options and shares issued pursuant to our plans at each grant date were estimated using the black scholes option pricing model 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
revised  share based payment sfas r 
sfas r requires companies to expense the estimated fair value of stock options and similar equity instruments issued to employees 
previously  companies were required to calculate the estimated fair value of these share based payments and could elect to either include the estimated cost in earnings or disclose the pro forma effect in the footnotes to their financial statements 
the fair value concepts were not changed significantly in sfas r  however  in adopting sfas r  companies must choose among alternative valuation models and amortization assumptions 
the valuation model and amortization assumption used by us continues to be available 
sfas no 
r was effective for our fiscal year beginning april  transition options allowed companies to choose whether to adopt prospectively  restate results to the beginning of the year  or to restate prior periods with the amounts that have been included in the footnotes 
we adopted prospectively  and continued to utilize the current black scholes option pricing model 
there were no unvested options or warrants outstanding at march   and as such  the result of adopting sfas r on april   did not have an effect on our results of operations or financial position 
see note v to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further discussion of the effect of the modification of outstanding warrants in connection with the stock split and the related non cash share based compensation expense recorded during the fiscal year ended march  since april  we have not made any changes of these critical accounting policies  nor have we made any material changes in any of the critical accounting estimates underlying these accounting policies 
recent accounting pronouncements in september  the fasb issued sfas no 
 fair value measurements sfas 
sfas defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value and enhances disclosures about fair value measures required under other accounting pronouncements  but does not change existing guidance as to whether or not an instrument is carried at fair value 
sfas is effective for fiscal years beginning after november  fair value is defined under sfas as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability an exit price in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date 
valuation techniques used to measure fair value under sfas must maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs 
the standard describes how to measure fair value based on a three level hierarchy of inputs  of which the first two are considered observable and the last unobservable 
level quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities 
level inputs other than level that are observable  either directly or indirectly  such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities  quoted prices in markets that are not active  or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities 
level unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities 
the adoption of sfas  with respect to financial assets and liabilities  did not have a material impact on our fair value measurements 
in february  the fasb issued fasb staff position no 
fas  effective date of fasb statement no 
fsp  which provided a one year deferral of the effective date of sfas for non financial assets and non financial liabilities  except for those that are recognized or disclosed in the financial statements at fair value at least annually

april  the fasb issued fasb staff position no 
fas  determining the fair value when the volume and level of activity for the asset or liability have significantly decreased and identifying transactions that are not orderly fsp  which emphasizes that even if there has been a significant decrease in the volume and level of activity for an asset or liability  the objective of the fair value measurement remains the same

significant trends over the last few years  a significant number of new prestige fragrance products have been introduced on a worldwide basis 
the beauty industry  in general  is highly competitive and consumer preferences often change rapidly 
the initial appeal of these new fragrances  launched for the most part in us department stores  has fueled the growth of our industry 
department stores continue to lose sales to the mass market as a product matures 
to counter the effect of lower department store sales  companies are required to introduce new products more quickly  which requires additional spending for development and advertising and promotional expenses 
in addition  a number of the new launches are with celebrities either entertainers or athletes which require substantial royalty commitments and whose careers and or appeal could change drastically  both positively and negatively  based on a single event 
we believe these trends will continue 
if one or more of our new product introductions would be unsuccessful  or the appeal of the celebrity would diminish  it could result in a substantial reduction in profitability and operating cash flows 
in the past  certain us department store retailers consolidated operations resulting in the closing of retail stores as well as implementing various inventory control initiatives 
we expect that these store closings  the inventory control initiatives  and the current global economic conditions will continue to affect our sales in the short term 
in response  we have implemented a number of cost reduction initiatives including a targeted reduction in staff  along with a reduction in committed advertising and promotional spending  and expect to reduce our production levels in response to the current economic environment 
during the recent holiday season  us department store retailers experienced a major reduction in consumer traffic  resulting in decreased sales 
in response  the retailers offered consumers deep discounts on most of their products 
as is customary in the fragrance industry  these discounts were not offered on fragrances and cosmetics 
this resulted in an overall reduction in sales of these products 
historically  as is the case for most fragrance companies  our sales have been influenced by seasonal trends generally related to holiday or gift giving periods 
substantial sales often occur during the final month of each quarter 
this practice assumes activities in future periods will support planned objectives  but there can be no assurance that will be achieved and future periods may be negatively affected 
in light of the recent downturn in the global economy  we have performed a quarterly review of our intangible  long lived assets during the year ended march  this review was based upon the estimated future net cash flows for the remaining period of each license 
based upon our review  no impairment charges are deemed necessary 
looking forward to fiscal  we expect that our license with guess will terminate and not be renewed at the end of our third fiscal quarter on december  for fiscal  we expect to offset any reduction in sales of guess products by increased sales of fragrances launched during fiscal  including our jessica simpson fragrance  fancy  and paris hilton fragrance  fairy dust  as well as sales from our contemplated product launches in fiscal of new fragrances under our paris hilton  nicole miller  josie natori  queen latifah and mark ecko licenses 
we do not anticipate launching new fragrances under our recently signed rihanna and kanye west licenses until fiscal we also anticipate a continued shift in our sales from international to domestic  in part due to our belief that guess is a stronger international brand than several of our new fragrances being launched in fiscal  as well as to economic cond itions and changes in our arrangements with international distributors 
it is always very difficult to predict sales levels  and is even more difficult in a challenging economic environment 
we have taken steps to attempt to reduce our expenses by approximately by reducing employee headcount and advertising expenses  and we are cautiously optimistic that we are positioned for a profitable fiscal with our expected product mix and cost structure 
results of operations on november   our board of directors approved the sale of the perry ellis fragrance brand license and related assets back to pei 
a definitive agreement was signed on december   and the sale closed shortly thereafter 
see note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further discussion 
the results presented in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations for the fiscal years ended march    and  include activity relating to the perry ellis brand as discontinued operations in fiscal years and for comparison purposes  prior period financial information has been restated accordingly 
our discussions below exclude perry ellis activities  which are addressed separately in the discussion of discontinued operations 
we did business with fragrance distributors owned operated by individuals related to our former chairman and ceo 
through june   these sales were included as related party sales in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations 
as of june   our former chairman and ceo s beneficial ownership interest in our company was approximately 
during the fiscal year ended march   his beneficial ownership declined to less than at march  
accordingly  the company s management determined that  effective as of july   transactions with such parties will no longer be reported as related party transactions 
our gross margins may not be comparable to other entities that include all of the costs related to their distribution network in costs of goods sold  since we allocate a portion of these distribution costs to costs of goods sold and include the remaining unallocated amounts as selling and distribution expenses 
selling and distribution expenses for the years ended march    and  included million  million and million  respectively  relating to the cost of warehouse operations not allocated to inventories and other related distribution expenses excluding shipping expenses which are recorded as cost of goods sold 
a portion of these costs is allocated to inventory in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 
comparisons of the year ended march  to march   and of the year ended march  to march  net sales for the years ended march  change change in millions domestic sales international sales unrelated customer sales related sales total net sales change is based on unrounded numbers during fiscal year  net sales from continuing operations decreased to million  as compared to million for the prior year 
the decrease in net sales was primarily due to an increase of million in our sales returns and allowance  as compared to the prior year  resulting from the recent holiday season and the current global economic environment 
during the recent holiday season  us department store retailers experienced a major reduction in consumer traffic  resulting in lower sales  a decrease in retail re orders  and an increase in subsequent returns 
in addition  delays in obtaining critical components  particularly glass and plastics  negatively impacted our first quarter of fiscal year our guess brand fragrances gross sales increased million during the current year to million  as compared to million in the prior year  primarily due the lifting of the distribution restriction placed by guess  in fiscal year  on international shipments and to the launch of guess by marciano for women in february and guess by marciano for men in february  which generated gross sales of million and million  respectively 
in august  we launched our new jessica simpson fragrance  fancy  resulting in an increase in gross sales of million 
our paris hilton fragrances gross sales of million decreased million in the current year  as compared to million in the prior year  primarily due to a decrease in international sales 
the decrease in paris hilton fragrances gross sales was partially offset by the launch  in late september  of our new paris hilton fragrance  fairy dust  resulting in an increase in gross sales of million  primarily in our domestic market 
net sales to unrelated customers  which represented of our total net sales for fiscal year  increased to million  as compared to million for prior year  mainly as a result of an increase in gross sales of million to unrelated customers of our guess brand fragrances and the launch of our new jessica simpson and paris hilton fragrances sold primarily in our domestic market 
net sales to the us department store sector increased to million for fiscal year  as compared to million for the prior year  while net sales to international distributors decreased to million  as compared to million for the prior year 
the increase in domestic sales is primarily due to the launch of our new jessica simpson fragrance  fancy  and the launch of our new paris hilton fragrance  fairy dust  noted above 
additionally  in the domestic market we benefited from ou r investments in promotional activities and our domestic sales force  coupled with higher levels of sell through in difficult economic conditions

however  certain individual components of our operating expenses discussed below experienced more significant changes than others 
advertising and promotional expenses advertising and promotional expenses increased to million for the year ended march   as compared to million for the prior year  increasing as a percentage of net sales to from  primarily due to the launches and advertising campaigns for our new jessica simpson and paris hilton fragrances in the fall of  the launch of guess by marciano for men in february  and the investments we made with our promotional activities in our domestic markets 
during the prior year  we incurred advertising and promotional costs in connection with the launch of our paris hilton can can fragrance 
during the third quarter of fiscal year  we anticipated significantly higher sales and we committed our spending accordingly 
however  during the last five weeks of the third quarter  retailers experienced a significant drop in consumer business and re orders were negatively affected

selling and distribution costs selling and distribution costs increased to million for the year ended march   as compared to million for the prior year  increasing as a percentage of net sales to from

additionally  selling expenses were incurred with the launch of our new jessica simpson brand 
selling and distribution costs decreased to million for the year ended march   as compared to million in the prior year  decreasing as a percentage of net sales to from 
the decrease was mainly attributable to the centralization of all distribution activities in our new jersey facility  resulting in a decrease of staff in our florida warehouse facility 
the prior year period also included approximately for inventory relocation costs in connection with our shifting of distribution activities to new jersey 
royalties royalties increased by to million for the year ended march   as compared to million for the prior year  increasing as a percentage of net sales to from 
the increase is the result of the current sales mix  and reflects contractual royalty rates on actual sales coupled with minimum royalty requirements  most notably for paris hilton cosmetics  sunglasses  and handbags  for which minimum sales levels were not achieved 
during the year ended march   we sublicensed the international rights for the handbags 
we generated million in fiscal year and million in fiscal year in sublicense revenue  which has been recorded as a reduction in royalty expense

the decrease was also attributable to decreases in legal fees  and settlement costs and other expenses  of approximately million  in connection with various litigation and the february consent solicitation s ee notes and to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further discussion 
additional expenses of million were incurred in the prior year period for professional fees relating to the special audit committee investigation as a result of allegations made in certain litigation and the sarbanes oxley act of remediation and maintenance  coupled with increases in property insurance costs and personnel additions in accounting  package development  quality assurance and production planning 
depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization decreased to million for the year ended march   as compared to million for the prior year  remaining constant at of net sales

net interest income expense net interest income was million for the year ended march   as compared to net interest expense of million for the prior year  as we did not utilize our line of credit during fiscal year net interest expense was million for the year march   as compared to million for the prior year  as we used our line of credit less to finance our receivables and inventory during fiscal year income loss from continuing operations before income taxes  income taxes  discontinued operations and net loss income for the years ended march  change change in millions loss income from continuing operations before income taxes as a of net sales income tax benefit provision n a n a as a of net sales loss income from continuing operations as a of net sales income from discontinued operations n a n a as a of net sales net loss income as a of net sales change is based on unrounded numbers loss from continuing operations before taxes for the year ended march   was million  as compared to income from continuing operations before taxes of million for the prior year 
our tax benefit for fiscal year reflects an estimated effective tax rate of and includes a carryback of approximately million in tax operating losses generated during the current year to offset us federal income taxes paid during fiscal year  in the amount of approximately million 
income from continuing operations before income taxes for the year ended march   was million  as compared to a loss of million for the prior year 
our tax provision for fiscal year reflects an estimated effective rate of from continuing operations 
the effective rate in fiscal year of from continuing operations results from a limitation on the estimated deferred tax benefit that was expected to result from the share based compensation charge related to the warrant modification and the million loss for income tax purposes resulting from the sale of the e com ventures  inc ecmv  currently known as perfumania holdings  inc  shares due to a difference in basis see note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further discussion 
the benefit from the share based compensation charge was limited by the maximum allowable annual compensatio n deduction for certain corporate officers under section m of the internal revenue code 
consequently  the benefit recorded in fiscal year reflected management s best estimate at that time based upon assumptions regarding the timing and market value of our common stock upon exercise of the warrants and the amount and nature of other forms of compensation to be paid to the holders of the warrants using the method in which cash compensation salary and bonus of the related individuals takes priority over the share based compensation in determining the annual limitation 
in february  our former chairman and ceo resigned 
the estimated limitation on the deferred tax benefit that was expected to result from the share based compensation charge related to the warrant modification was reviewed and adjusted accordingly at the time we reported our results of operations for the year ended march  as a result  we incurred a loss from continuing operations of million in fiscal year  as compared to earning income from continuing operations of million in fiscal year  and incurring a loss of million in fiscal year income from discontinued operations see note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further discussion  net of the tax effect  was million in fiscal year as a result  we incurred a net loss of million in fiscal year  earned net income of million and million in fiscal year and  respectively 
liquidity and capital resources working capital was million as of march   as compared to million at march   and million as of march  the decrease in fiscal year  as compared to fiscal year was primarily due to the use of current assets to support the net loss reported for the year ended march  the increase in fiscal year  as compared to fiscal year  was primarily due to net income in fiscal year  excluding the effect of the non cash compensation charges  the reduction of our credit facility  the increase in cash on hand and the reduction of our inventory levels 
cash flows cash and cash equivalents decreased by million during fiscal year  increased by million during fiscal year  and decreased by million during fiscal year cash flows from operating activities during the year ended march   net cash used in operating activities was million  as compared to net cash provided by operating activities of million during the prior year 
the current year activity reflects an increase in inventories  prepaid expenses and other current assets  accounts payable due to the launch of our new jessica simpson and paris hilton fragrances in the current year and the anticipated launches planned for our next fiscal year 
cash flows from operating activities were negatively affected by the current downturn in global economic conditions 
during the year ended march   net cash provided by operating activities was million  as compared to cash used in operating activities of million during fiscal year in fiscal year  the increase in cash provided by operating activities  as compared to fiscal year  was mainly attributable to a decrease in inventories  prepaid expenses and income tax receivable  offset by increases in trade receivables from both related and unrelated customers 
in fiscal year  the decrease in cash was mainly attributable to a decrease in accounts payable and an increase in inventory to support the increased sales of the paris hilton and guess brands  partially offset by a decrease in trade accounts receivable 
in addition  during fiscal year  we paid approximately million toward estimated income taxes  due to the sale of the perry ellis fragrance license and other related assets 
cash flows from investing activities net cash used in investing activities was million in fiscal year  as compared to net cash provided by investing activities of million in fiscal year  and net cash provided by investing activities of million in fiscal year the current year activity reflects lower purchases of equipment and trademarks  as compared to the prior year  and no restricted cash  while the prior year investing activities primarily resulted from a decrease in restricted cash and the collection of the final balance due from the sale of the perry ellis brand 
fiscal year included the net proceeds from the sales of the perry ellis brand  the sunrise facility and our investment in affiliate  partially offset by the increased purchase of equipment and leasehold improvements 
cash flows from financing activities net cash used in financing activities was million  as compared to million in fiscal year and million in fiscal year the current year activity reflects million of cash payments for the repurchase of shares of our common stock and continued repayments of capital leases  while the prior year financing activities was mainly attributable to million in repayments of the gmaccc credit facility  offset by an increase of million in proceeds from the issuance of common stock and exercise of warrants 
fiscal year included the repayment of the million balance of the mortgage concurrently with the sale of the sunrise facility 
our ratios and other matters as of march   and  our ratios of the number of days sales in accounts receivable and number of days cost of sales in inventory  on an annualized basis  were as follows march  trade accounts receivable unrelated related perfumania total receivables inventories calculated on gross trade receivables excluding allowances for doubtful accounts  sales returns and advertising allowances of million and million in fiscal years and  respectively 
the decrease in the number of days in trade account receivables from to for unrelated customers was mainly attributable to improved collections from our international distributors in fiscal year due to restrictions on sales of guess products and delays in receiving guess products  in the prior year  certain international distributors had exceeded their payment terms in fiscal year during this past holiday season  us department store retailers experienced a major reduction in consumer traffic  resulting in decreased sales 
in addition  the current volatility in the us dollar has affected the purchasing power and cash flow of many of our international customers 
management closely monitors the company s activities with all customers  however  if one or more of our major customers were to default on their payables to the company  it would have a material adverse affect on our overall sales and liquidity 
the number of days sales in trade receivables from perfumania continues to exceed those of unrelated customers  due mainly to their seasonal cash flow see note to the accompanying consolidated financial statements for further discussion of our relationship with perfumania 
however  due to the limited amount of sales to perfumania during the year ended march   and the reclassification of certain distributors previously classified as related parties in the prior year  the calculated number of days sales in accounts receivable from perfumania is not indicative of a true aging 
the number of days  based upon the actual aging as of march   would be days days at march  
on january   perfumania filed a form k with the sec disclosing that it was not in compliance with a certain debt covenant under its senior credit facility triggering an event of default 
perfumania reported that it has requested a waiver from their senior creditor  but there are no guarantees that the waiver will be received 
if perfumania is unable to obtain a waiver or to refinance its credit facility  its operations and financial condition would be materially adversely effected 
any significant reduction in business with perfumania as a customer of the company would have a material adverse effect on our overall net sales 
perfumania s inability to pay its account balance due to us at a time when it has a substantial accounts payable balance could have an adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
management closely monitors the company s activity with perfumania and holds periodic discussions with perfumania in order to review their anticipated payments for each quarter 
perfumania is currently performing under the terms of its credit arrangements 
no allowance for credit loss has been recorded as of march  management will continue to closely monitor all developments with respect to its extension of credit to perfumania 
the lead time for certain of our raw materials and components inventory up to days requires us to maintain at least a three to six month supply of some items in order to ensure production schedules 
in addition  when we launch a new brand or stock keeping unit sku  we frequently produce a six to nine month supply to ensure adequate inventories if the new products exceed our forecasted expectations 
we believe that the gross margins on our products outweigh the additional carrying costs 
however  if future sales do not reach forecasted levels  it could result in excess inventories and may cause us to decrease prices to reduce inventory levels 
during the current year  the number of days sales in inventory increased to days from days  mainly the result of the current economic conditions  as sales during the last four months did not meet forecasted expectations 
we have adjusted our production forecasts in light of the current global economic conditions 
at the end of the current year the increase in our inventory balances were due to the new product launches in fiscal year and in preparation of new products launches scheduled for fiscal year  and the forecasted sales increases for these products 
we anticipate that  as new licenses are signed  and new products are launched  our inventory levels will increase in relation to anticipated sales for our existing products  as well as any new products 
we believe that the carrying value of our inventory at march   based on current conditions  is stated at the lower of cost or market 
share repurchases during the fiscal year ended march   we had repurchased  under all phases of our common stock buy back program  a total of  shares at a cost of million

the new loan agreement also contains certain financial covenants relating to fixed charge coverage  and the ratio of funded debt to ebitda 
as of december   we were not in compliance with our debt covenants 
on february   we were granted a waiver from the bank  with respect to our compliance covenants as of december  on march   we entered into the first amendment and ratification of loan and security agreement and other loan documents the amendment to the new loan agreement  dated as of july   with the bank 
the amendment changes certain terms of the new loan agreement 
under the amendment  the interest rate for any borrowings is libor rate plus the applicable margin 
the applicable margin for any borrowings is calculated on a sliding scale basis and is tied to our fixed charge coverage ratio  with rates calculated between and  with an initial rate starting of 
prior to december   the borrowing base amount is the lesser of the sum of an amount equal to of the net amount after deduction of such reserves and allowances as the bank deems reasonably proper and necessary of all eligible accounts plus an amount equal to the lesser of million or of the lower of cost or market valu e after deduction of such reserves and allowances as the bank deems reasonably proper and necessary of all eligible inventory or the product of two times the sum of ebitda measured from january   to the date of measurement  minus non cash expenses related to the issuance of options and warrants  minus other non cash expenses 
after december   the borrowing base amount is the sum of an amount equal to of the net amount after deduction of such reserves and allowances as the bank deems reasonably proper and necessary of all eligible accounts plus an amount equal to the lesser of million or of the lower of cost or market value after deduction of such reserves and allowances as the bank deems reasonably proper and necessary of all eligible inventory 
in addition  receivables due from perfumania  inc  a related party  are not considered an eligible account 
a tangible net worth covenant has been added  requiring us to maintain a tangible net worth of not less than million at all times 
we are required to obtain written consent from the bank prior to repurchasing shares of our common stock  including repurchases which have been previously authorized under our existing stock buy back program 
we are no longer required to pay a non utilization fee 
our new loan agreement requires us to maintain compliance with various financial covenants 
the calculation of our fixed charge coverage ratio is measured on a trailing twelve months basis  at the end of each fiscal quarter 
we calculate the ratio as follows a the sum of ebitda  less any non cash gains  less cash taxes paid  less any dividends and distributions if any  to b the sum of the current portion of long term debt cpltd paid during the period plus lease and interest expense 
if our rolling twelve months ebitda a to the sum of the debt b is less than the minimum coverage ratio we fail the ratio requirements 
we are required to maintain a minimum ratio of to the calculation of our funded debt to ebitda ratio is measured at the end of each fiscal quarter  based on our indebtedness to ebitda 
we are required to maintain a ratio of no greater than to for each fiscal quarter 
the amendment defers the fixed charge coverage ratio and the funded debt to ebitda requirements until december   and has added the tangible net worth covenant  requiring us to maintain a tangible net worth of not less than million at all times 
our new loan agreement defines ebitda  a non gaap financial measure  as net income before interest  taxes  depreciation  amortization and non cash expenses related to the issuance of options and warrants 
tangible net worth is the sum of our total assets  less intangible assets  minus our total liabilities

failure to comply with our covenants in our new loan agreement and amendment will result in our inability to borrow additional funds under the facility  which would require us to obtain replacement financing  of which there is no assurance 
our ability to meet these covenants can be affected by events beyond our control  and therefore  we may be unable to meet our covenants 
if our actual results deviate significantly from our projections  we may not remain in compliance with the covenants and would not be allowed to borrow under our new loan agreement 
if we are not able to borrow under our new loan agreement  we would be required to develop an alternative source of liquidity  or to sell additional securities which would result in dilution to existing stockholders 
we may be unable to obtain replacement credit facilities on favorable terms or at all 
without a source of financing  we could experience cash flow difficulties and disruptions in our supply chain 
we believe that funds from operations and our existing financing will be sufficient to meet our current operating and seasonal needs 
however  if we were to expand operations through acquisitions  new licensing arrangements or both  we may need to obtain financing 
there is no assurance that we could obtain such financing or what the terms of such financing  if available  would be 
in addition  the current business environment may increase the difficulty of obtaining new financing  if necessary 
if the economy were to significantly decline further  or if one or more of our major customers were to default on payments due to us  our liquidity could be negatively affected and our current credit facility could be affected  as we may not meet our debt covenant requirements  and we would need to obtain additional financing 
there is no assurance that we could obtain such financing or what the terms of such financing  if available  would be
