item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
approximately of this backlog is expected to be filled during the company s fiscal year ending april  included in the backlog at april  is approximately million under cost plus fee contracts which the company believes represent firm commitments from its customers for which the company has not received full funding to date 
the backlog is subject to change by reason of several factors including possible cancellation of orders  change orders  terms of the contracts and other factors beyond the company s control 
accordingly  the backlog is not necessarily indicative of the revenues or profits losses which may be realized when the results of such contracts are reported 
customers and suppliers the company markets its products both directly and through approximately independent sales representative organizations located in the united states  europe and asia 
sales to non us end users  including the revenues of its overseas subsidiaries  totaled approximately and of net revenues in fiscal years and  respectively 
the company s products are sold to both commercial and governmental customers 
for the years ended april  and  approximately and  respectively  of the company s sales were made under contracts to the us government or subcontracts for us government end use 
during fiscal year  none of the company s customers accounted for more than of consolidated revenues 
in fiscal year  none of the customers in the gillam fei or fei zyfer segments accounted for more than of consolidated revenues 
motorola corp 
motorola  boeing corporation boeing  lockheed martin corporation lockheed and northrop grumman corporation northrop were major customers of the fei ny segment  accounting for an aggregate of of that segment s revenues for the year ended april  the company s consolidated revenues for the year ended april  included sales to boeing  motorola  and space systems loral ss l  each of which accounted for greater than of consolidated sales 
in the aggregate  for fiscal year these three customers accounted for of consolidated sales and of the revenues of the company s fei ny segment 
during fiscal years and  france telecom and belgacom were major customers of the gillam fei segment 
these european telecommunication companies accounted for an aggregate of and  respectively  of the segment s revenues in those fiscal years 
in the fei zyfer segment  during fiscal year  northrop and raytheon company accounted for an aggregate of of the segment s revenue  while in fiscal year  the orange county sheriff s department accounted for of the segment s revenue 
the loss by the company of any one of these customers could have a material adverse effect on the company s business 
the company believes its relationship with these companies to be mutually satisfactory and is not aware of any prospect for the cancellation or significant reduction of any of its commercial or existing us government contracts 
the company purchases a variety of components such as transistors  resistors  capacitors  connectors and diodes for use in the manufacture of its products 
the company is not dependent upon any one supplier or source of supply for any of its component part purchases and maintains alternative sources of supply for all of its purchased components 
the company has found its suppliers generally to be reliable and price competitive 
research and development the company s technological expertise continues to be an important factor to support future growth in revenues and earnings 
the company has focused its internal research and development efforts on improving the core physics and electronic packages in its time and frequency products  conducting research to develop new time and frequency technologies  improving product manufacturability by seeking to reduce its production costs through product redesign and process improvements and other measures to take advantage of lower cost components 
the company continues to focus a significant portion of its own resources and efforts on developing hardware for satellite commercial and us government and terrestrial commercial communications systems  including wireless  wireline and gps related systems 
during fiscal years and  the company expended million and million of its own funds  respectively  on such research and development activity 
see also item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
during fiscal year  many of the company s development resources were applied to certain cost plus fee satellite payload programs 
as a result  some of the company s development efforts were customer funded and the costs appear in cost of revenues resulting in reduced internal research and development spending 
the customer funded programs will continue into fiscal year  thus the company is targeting to spend between million and million on internal research and development projects 
the actual amount spent in fiscal year will depend on market conditions and identification of new opportunities 
patents and licenses the company believes that its business is generally not dependent on patent or license protection 
rather  it is primarily dependent upon the company s technical competence  the quality of its products and its prompt and responsible contract performance 
however  employees working for the company assign all rights to inventions to the company and the company presently holds such patents and licenses 
in certain limited circumstances  the us government may use or permit the use by the company s competitors of certain patents or licenses the government has funded 
during fiscal year  the company received a broad and significant patent for new  proprietary quartz oscillator technology which the company intends to exploit in both legacy and new applications 
in  the company obtained a basic patent for its low g technology 
competition the company experiences competition in all areas of its business 
the company competes primarily on the basis of the accuracy  performance and reliability of its products  the ability of its products to function under severe conditions  such as in space or other extreme hostile environments  prompt and responsive contract performance  technical competence and price 
the company has a unique and broad product line which includes quartz  rubidium  and cesium based timing references and specialized rf microwave technology 
because of the very high precision of certain of its products  the company has few competitors 
for lower precision components there is significant competition from a number of suppliers 
in recent years  the company has successfully outsourced certain component manufacturing processes to third parties and more recently to its wholly owned subsidiary  fei asia in tianjin  china and to russian based morion  inc  in which the company is a minority shareholder 
the company expects this outsourcing to enhance its competitive position on cost while maintaining its high quality standards 
the company believes its ability to obtain raw materials  manufacture finished products  integrate them into systems and sub systems and interface these systems with end user applications provides a strong competitive advantage 
certain of the company s competitors are larger  have greater financial resources and have larger research and development and marketing staffs 
the company has a strong history of competing successfully in this environment due to the quality  reliability and outstanding record of performance its products have achieved 
with respect to its instruments and systems for timing and synchronization  the company competes with agilent technologies  symmetricom  inc  e 
g 
and g  inc  vectron  inc 
and others 
systems for the wireline industry produced by the gillam fei segment compete with symmetricom  inc and oscilloquartz  a division of swatch 
the company s principal competition for space products is the in house capability of its major customers 
employees the company employs approximately full time persons worldwide 
none of the us employees are represented by labor unions  in europe approximately five employees in one facility are represented by a french labor union

critical accounting policies and estimates the company s significant accounting policies are described in note to the consolidated financial statements 
the company believes its most critical accounting policies to be the recognition of revenue and costs on production contracts and the valuation of inventory 
each of these areas requires the company to make use of reasonable estimates including estimating the cost to complete a contract  the realizable value of its inventory or the market value of its products 
changes in estimates can have a material impact on the company s financial position and results of operations 
revenue recognition revenues under larger  long term contracts which generally require billings based on achievement of milestones rather than delivery of product  are reported in operating results using the percentage of completion method 
on fixed price contracts  which are typical for commercial and us government satellite programs and other long term us government projects  and which require initial design and development of the product  revenue is recognized on the cost to cost method 
under this method  revenue is recorded based upon the ratio that incurred costs bear to total estimated contract costs with related cost of sales recorded as the costs are incurred 
each month management reviews estimated contract costs through a process of aggregating actual costs incurred and estimating additional costs to completion based upon the current available information and status of the contract 
the effect of any change in the estimated gross margin percentage for a contract is reflected in revenues in the period in which the change is known 
provisions for anticipated losses on contracts are made in the period in which they become determinable 
see significant matters below on production type orders  revenue is recorded as units are delivered with the related cost of sales recognized on each shipment based upon a percentage of estimated final program costs 
changes in job performance may result in revisions to costs and income and are recognized in the period in which revisions are determined to be required 
provisions for anticipated losses on customer orders are made in the period in which they become determinable 
for customer orders in the company s gillam fei and fei zyfer segments or smaller contracts or orders in the fei ny segment  sales of products and services to customers are reported in operating results based upon i shipment of the product or ii performance of the services pursuant to terms of the customer order 
when payment is contingent upon customer acceptance of the installed system  revenue is deferred until such acceptance is received and installation completed 
costs and expenses contract costs include all direct material  direct labor costs  manufacturing overhead and other direct costs related to contract performance 
selling  general and administrative costs are charged to expense as incurred 
inventory in accordance with industry practice  inventoried costs contain amounts relating to contracts and programs with long production cycles  a portion of which will not be realized within one year 
inventory reserves are established for slow moving and obsolete items and are based upon management s experience and expectations for future business 
any changes in reserves arising from revised expectations are reflected in cost of sales in the period the revision is made 
results of operations the table below sets forth for the fiscal years ended april  and  the percentage of consolidated net sales represented by certain items in the company s consolidated statements of operations revenues fei ny gillam fei fei zyfer less intersegment revenues cost of revenues gross margin selling and administrative expenses research and development expenses operating loss other income  net provision for income taxes net loss income significant matters cost of sales and operating results for fiscal year were impacted by an increase in the allowance for inventory obsolescence by million as a result of recent deterioration in the company s wireless telecommunications market 
the present outlook for future revenues in the wireless telecommunications infrastructure market is unclear  which also creates doubt that the company will be able to realize the full value of its inventory of parts and subassemblies for this market 
operating results for the first half of fiscal year and fiscal year were impacted by activities on several major satellite payload programs 
higher than anticipated engineering and manufacturing costs incurred as a result of testing failures encountered in the fourth quarter of fiscal year resulted in lower gross margin on certain contracts 
such costs continued to be incurred in early fiscal year resulting in operating losses 
the combination of higher manufacturing costs and inventory reserves yielded a low gross margin rate of and an operating loss of million 
since the fiscal year operating loss follows two previous fiscal years of operating losses  in accordance with authoritative accounting guidance  the company recorded a million valuation allowance against its deferred tax assets 
this non cash valuation allowance is added to the company s provision for income taxes and increased the net loss by the same amount 
during the first quarter of fiscal year  the company completed the sale of of the outstanding shares of morion  reducing its interest in morion from to of morion s outstanding shares 
the company received approximately million from the sale and recognized a pre tax gain of approximately million 
revenues fiscal years ended april  in millions change fei ny gillam fei fei zyfer intersegment sales revenues in fiscal year were less than fiscal year revenues in the company s two major business areas  telecommunications infrastructure and satellite payloads  declined year over year by and  respectively 
these revenue declines affected results primarily for the fei ny segment 
as indicated previously  future revenues for wireless telecommunications products are uncertain as oems slow installation of new network equipment or migrate to different technologies supporting shorter independent timing capabilities or reduced quality of service which do not require the precision timing devices that the company supplies 
satellite payload revenue was particularly impacted by a decline in commercial satellite projects reflecting current economic conditions which were partially offset by a rise in us government satellite revenues 
revenues for the fei zyfer segment increased by over the prior year due to sales of the company s new wireline telecommunication synchronization equipment 
revenues from non satellite us government customers  which are recorded in both the fei ny and fei zyfer segments  were lower in fiscal year compared to fiscal year for the year ended april   revenue increased in the fei ny segment by and by in the fei zyfer segment as a result of increased business levels in two primary market areas satellite payloads both commercial and us government programs and other us government  non space programs 
revenues from these sources each increased by over from year ago levels 
satellite payload programs are managed by the fei ny segment and both fei ny and fei zyfer provide products to non space us government programs 
telecommunication network revenues  generated by all three segments  was lower by less than from the fiscal year levels as customer demand softened 
gillam fei revenues also benefited from the increased value of the euro compared to the us dollar 
in euro denominated terms and excluding intersegment sales  gillam fei fiscal year revenues declined by from the prior year 
during fiscal year  based on current backlog and prospects for future bookings  the company expects to realize significant revenues from commercial and us government satellite programs 
in addition  the company s recent work on us government sponsored development contracts and current proposal activity should generate revenues from us government programs such as secure radios  unmanned aerial vehicles  weapons guidance systems and secure communications 
the timing and magnitude of revenues from these sources is dependent on the us government s procurement and budgeting process 
us government spending during fiscal year is expected to benefit the company s fei ny and fei zyfer segments 
during fiscal year  the company expects to see increased bookings and revenues for its new  state of the art wireline synchronization systems which would benefit both the fei zyfer and gillam fei segments 
gross margin rates fiscal years ended april  in thousands change gm rate for the year ended april   gross margin declined both in total and as a percentage of revenues as compared to the prior year 
the decrease in revenues also reduced gross margin but the gross margin rate was mostly impacted by higher costs 
during fiscal year  the company continued to incur higher levels of engineering and manufacturing costs on certain satellite payload programs that it began to experience in late fiscal year also as noted above  the company increased by million its reserves against certain of its inventory for the wireless telecommunication market  which reduced the gross margin rate for the year by 
the challenging satellite programs were completed in the first half of the year and gross margin rates  exclusive of inventory reserves  began to improve in the last half of the year 
with the current mix of programs and orders in its backlog  the company expects to realize gross margin rates in excess of during fiscal year for the year ended april   total gross margin increased as a result of the increase in revenues but declined as a percentage of revenues 
the rate decrease is primarily the result of higher than anticipated engineering and manufacturing costs on certain satellite payload programs 
throughout fiscal year  the company s satellite payload business continued to reconfigure its manufacturing processes to provide increased production capacity for the higher demand for space related assemblies 
late in the year  the company also experienced higher than expected costs on two late stage programs in final assembly and test of flight hardware 
these expenses not only increased cost of sales but also delayed the recognition of revenue on the contracts  which are accounted for on the percentage of completion method  further reducing gross margins 
the two late stage programs were completed in the first half of fiscal year the gross margin rates in the telecommunications and non space us government business areas met the company s targets for these areas  which range from to 
selling and administrative expenses fiscal years ended april  in thousands change for the year ended april   selling and administrative costs declined due to decreases in personnel costs including reduced incentive compensation  lower deferred compensation expense and decreased employee benefits resulting from a reduction in personnel 
for the years ended april  and  selling and administrative expenses include stock compensation expense of  and  respectively 
fiscal year selling and administrative costs increased over fiscal year principally from higher medical expenses  normal salary increases  higher deferred compensation expense  increased marketing expenses for new products and the cost of moving the company s california facility to larger leased space and the related increased rent expense 
also  in euro denominated terms  selling and administrative expenses at gillam fei were comparable to the prior year but when denominated in us dollars  increased by in fiscal year due to the declining value of the dollar 
as a percentage of sales  selling and administrative expenses were and in fiscal years and  respectively 
the company targets selling and administrative expenses not to exceed of consolidated sales 
for fiscal year  the company expects to incur selling and administrative expenses at approximately the same rate as fiscal year research and development expenses fiscal years ended april  in thousands change research and development expenditures represent investments intended to keep the company s products at the leading edge of time and frequency technology and enhance competitiveness for future sales 
for the fiscal year ended april   r d spending decreased as a result of many of the company s development resources being applied to certain cost plus fee satellite payload programs with an aggregate contract value exceeding million 
as a consequence  some of the company s development expenditures will be customer funded and the costs will appear in cost of revenues  thus reducing the level of internal research and development spending 
in the prior fiscal year ended april   the company incurred exceptional levels of engineering spending and development work on its satellite payload products  an effort which began in fiscal year r d spending was and of consolidated revenues in fiscal years and  respectively  approximately in line with the company s target of of revenues for such efforts 
the company will continue to focus its research and development activities on those products which it expects will provide the best return on investment and greatest prospects for the future growth of the company 
for fiscal year  the company will continue to make investments in improved satellite payload products  develop and improve miniaturized rubidium atomic clocks  develop new gps based synchronization products and further enhance the capabilities of its line of low g oscillators 
the company will also be engaged in development efforts that are funded by its customers  the results of which will enhance its own product offerings 
thus  the company s target for fiscal year is to spend less than of revenues on research and development activities  although the actual level of spending is dependent on new opportunites and the rate at which it succeeds in bringing new products to market 
internally generated cash and cash reserves will be adequate to fund these development efforts 
operating loss fiscal years ended april  in thousands change as discussed above  the operating loss incurred in fiscal year includes the million reserve for wireless telecommunications inventory 
without this charge  the operating loss would have been approximately million and comparable to the operating loss of fiscal year but on lower revenues 
both fiscal years also experienced lower gross margins due to higher than anticipated engineering and manufacturing costs incurred in connection with the company s satellite payload products and programs 
the company expects to realize substantially improved operating results in fiscal year as the higher cost satellite programs have been completed and current larger satellite programs are performed under cost plus contracts for which the company receives reimbursement of its direct and indirect costs plus a fee 
based on recent and expected satellite and wireline telecommunication bookings  the company expects to report improved gross margins while maintaining other operating expenses within their targeted amounts 
other income expense fiscal years ended april  in thousands change investment income equity loss interest expense other income  net during the fiscal year ended april   the company reduced its investment in morion  inc from to by selling shares to a russian government majority owned bank 
the company received proceeds of approximately million and realized a book gain of approximately million 
such gain was included in investment income in fiscal year in addition  investment income in fiscal year included net gains on sales of other investments in the amount of approximately  comparable gains were not recorded during fiscal year investment income also includes interest and dividend income on marketable securities and such amounts were similar in both fiscal years 
during fiscal year  the company will realize investment income primarily from interest on its bond portfolio and anticipates that the amount earned will be approximately the same as that earned in fiscal year in fiscal years and  the company recorded equity losses from its interest in elcom 
in fiscal years and  interest expense was incurred on borrowings under short term credit obligations  on certain deferred compensation obligations and a capital lease for equipment which was entered into in last fiscal year for the year ended april   interest expense decreased from the prior year primarily due to the reduction of its bank line of credit resulting from improved operating cash flow 
the company anticipates that interest expense in fiscal year will decrease as a result of lower interest rates  lower levels of debt and improved cash flow from operating activities 
during fiscal years and  the company recognized  and  respectively  of income from amortization of the deferred gain from the sale of its corporate headquarters building in new york  which income is included in the caption other income  net 
the deferred gain was amortized over the remaining life of the original eleven year lease 
also  in fiscal years and  other income included realized gains of approximately  and  respectively  from the excess of proceeds over the cash values of life insurance policies on the lives of three former employees 
other income is partially offset by certain nonrecurring expenses 
the company anticipates that in future years other items in this category will not be significant to pretax earnings 
income taxes the company recorded an operating loss in the fiscal year which  along with the current challenging economic environment  has reduced the likelihood that the company will be able to realize the benefits of its deferred tax assets 
based on the restrictive accounting measurement criterion  the company recorded a valuation allowance in the amount of million during the year ended april  if in future periods the company records pre tax profits and is able to assess the realizability of its deferred tax assets as more likely than not  the need for all or some of such valuation allowance could be overcome based on a careful consideration of all available evidence 
such valuation allowance reductions would reduce future income tax provisions 
the company is subject to taxation in several countries 
the statutory federal rates are in the united states  in europe and in china 
in fiscal year  the valuation allowance created a net tax provision rather than a tax benefit from the year s tax loss 
the fiscal year tax gain on the partial sale of the morion investment is greater than the gain recorded for financial reporting purposes  resulting in a higher than expected effective tax rate of 
the effective rate is also impacted by the income or loss of certain of the company s european and asian subsidiaries which are currently not taxed 
the company may commence tax payments in china during calendar based on the operating profits of its subsidiary  fei asia 
the company utilizes the availability of research and development tax credits in the united states to lower its tax rate 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
the company s european subsidiaries have available net operating loss carryforwards of approximately million to offset future taxable income 
these loss carryforwards have no expiration date 
the fiscal year federal income tax operating loss carryforward of approximately million for the us subsidiaries of the company will be used to offset taxable income in future years 
these loss carryforwards and related tax credits begin to expire in for state income tax purposes  the tax operating loss carryforward is million 
liquidity and capital resources the company s balance sheet continues to reflect a highly liquid position with working capital of million at april  included in working capital at april  is million consisting of cash  cash equivalents and short term investments offset by million in borrowings under its bank line of credit 
the company s current ratio at april  is to compared to to at the end of the prior fiscal year 
net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended april   was million compared to million used in operations in fiscal year the primary source for the increased positive cash flow was the billing and collection of unbilled receivables on certain long term contracts during fiscal year such collections were partially offset by the operating loss generated by higher operating expenses 
unbilled receivables arise when the company recognizes revenues at different intervals than the related milestone billings under long term contracts  primarily related to satellite payload programs 
the timing for such billings is determined by the contract terms which the company must meet in order to invoice its customers 
under long term contract accounting the company recognizes revenues on the percentage of completion basis as measured by the ratio of actual costs to estimated program costs 
such revenue recognition often results in recording receivables for costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings or unbilled receivables 
see note to the accompanying financial statements
