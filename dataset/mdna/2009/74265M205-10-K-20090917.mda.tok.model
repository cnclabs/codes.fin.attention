item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis provides information that management believes is relevant to an assessment and understanding of the company s results of operations and financial condition for each of the two years ended june  and  respectively 
this discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto included elsewhere in this report 
this report contains certain forward looking statements and information 
the cautionary statements included herein should be read as being applicable to all related forward looking statements wherever they may appear 
our actual future results could differ materially from those discussed herein 
critical accounting estimates and judgments our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states gaap 
the preparation of our financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues  expenses and related disclosures 
we base our estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates 
the significant accounting policies that are believed to be the most critical to fully understanding and evaluating the reported financial results include revenue recognition  warranty reserve  inventory valuations for slow moving items  impairment of goodwill  and the recovery of deferred income tax assets 
we recognize sales and associated cost of sales  upon shipment  fob origin 
there have been minimal returns for credit  so no reserve for product returns has been established 
we determine our inventory value at the lower of cost first in  first out method or market value 
we determine a reduced market value of our inventory based on the age of inventory on hand 
we define aging of inventory as inventory that exceeds an estimated months of usage and exceeds orders on hand 
we determine the reserve for our accounts receivable by examining the aging of the receivables 
we define aging of receivables as time passed since the sale was completed  revenue was recognized and the receivable was established 
if the receivable is aged over days old  or has a known collection risk  it is reserved from of its value up to 
the actual amount reserved may vary depending on account credit and collection history 
the warranty accrual is determined by reviewing the return rates and warranty repair costs for warranty eligible products 
we accrue an amount of expected repair cost based on these factors projected for the remaining applicable warranty period 
if actual return rates or repair costs differ from our estimates  warranty expense could vary from the projected accrual 
the repair return rates and cost assumptions are reviewed quarterly 
the potential return amount is based on historical return and repair cost data 
at june  we had  in accrued warranty reserves  as compared to  in accrued warranty reserves at june  the decrease is due to lower shipment levels in the warranty eligible product line in as compared to  coupled with lower assumed return rates and lower assumed costs to repair returned product 
in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas  sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal for long lived assets sfas long lived assets and intangible assets with definite lives are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
impairment indicators include  among other conditions  cash flow deficits  historic or anticipated declines in revenue or operating profit and adverse legal or regulatory developments 
if it is determined that such indicators are present and the review indicates that the assets will not be fully recoverable  based on undiscounted estimated cash flow over the remaining amortization periods  their carrying values are reduced to estimated fair market value 
estimated fair market value is determined primarily using the anticipated cash flow discounted at a rate commensurate with the risk involved 
for the purposes of identifying and measuring impairment  long lived assets are grouped with other assets and liabilities at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flow are largely independent of the cash flow of other assets and liabilities 
the triggering event is explained in further detail in note of the notes to the financial statements 
our standard annual impairment testing is done april of each year 
we monitor current market conditions and review for potential triggering events quarterly to determine if there is a need for interim impairment testing 
we did not determine that a triggering event for the astromec and micro motors goodwill occurred in the past months 
we did however  determine that a triggering event occurred with the patent intangible asset 
in determining if a triggering event has occurred  we consider not only expectations for growth in the entire us economy  but also expectations for regional growth specific to our sales markets and specific to our industry and product lines 
while our operating units are influenced by changes in the general economic outlook of the united states  they are most heavily influenced by changes specific to the medical device industry 
furthermore  the magnitude of economic changes within the industry is viewed alongside the outlooks and forecasts specific to the reporting units to obtain a better sense of the likelihood that goodwill may be impaired 
declines within the industry s outlook are reflected in the unit s revenue projections 
we identify two reporting units for purposes of our annual goodwill impairment testing arising from its acquisitions of micro motors and astromec 
in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill is not amortized and is assessed annually for impairment as of april or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of such assets may not be recoverable 
our carson city reporting unit corresponds to the operations resulting from the astromec acquisition  while our irvine reporting unit corresponds to the operations resulting from the micro motors acquisition 
our intangible asset is related to the interosseous patents associated with the intraflow acquisition 
goodwill and intangible assets are tested for impairment using a discounted cash flow analysis 
the discounted cash flow analysis relies upon estimates of the entity s future revenue and expenses to ultimately project the future cash flows resulting from the business activity of each entity 
the projected future cash flows are discounted to present value at an appropriate discount rate 
an appropriate discount rate is reached by calculating the weighted average cost of capital wacc  which is determined by the assumptions underlying the capital asset pricing model capm and is considered to reflect the view of market participants  as required under sfas the inputs used in calculating the wacc are described below 
a 
the assumed capital structure is based upon the company s actual capital structure and debt to equity ratio at the time of analysis 
b 
the cost of debt is based on the company s actual contracted rates 
c 
the cost of equity is equal to the risk free rate represented by the year treasury note  plus the company s historical correlation to market movement beta times the historical equity risk premium  plus an additional small stock premium 
d 
in valuing the company s patents  an additional risk premium is added to reflect the increased risk inherent in intangible assets 
e 
also in valuing the patents  an expected value calculation was performed that weighted the values of different scenarios based on their expected probability of occurrence 
we performed separate calculations to determine the sensitivity of our intangible asset impairment conclusions to increases in the assumed discount rates 
in the case of astromec  the goodwill impairment test is not failed until the discount rate is increased to percent 
in the case of micro motors  the goodwill impairment test is not failed until the discount rate is increased to percent 
additionally  the material assumptions relied upon in the discounted cash flow analysis used to value the company s intraflow patents are shown below 
a 
the patent is valued from the perspective of market participants  which are believed to possess sales and marketing expertise in the dental and medical device field 
management s financial analysis of the intangible asset was performed from the perspective of a potential acquirer and estimates what a market participant would be willing to pay for the asset 
this methodology is consistent with fas requirements for fair value estimates to be estimates of the price that would be received to sell an asset  or an exit price 
in these scenarios  the patents value is based on the assumed greater distribution capabilities and lower incremental costs that would be held by market participants 
b 
the patent was also valued as a ongoing product line without any additional distribution partner or market participant value 
c 
a premium for the increased riskiness of intangible assets was included in the asset s discount rate 
d 
we performed separate calculations to determine the sensitivity of the asset s impairment conclusion to variances in sales growth  gross margin  and discount rate 
sales growth forecasts ranged from growth of times to times levels 
e 
there were transaction and or start up costs associated with the market participants valuation 
the material assumptions relied upon in the discounted cash flow analysis used to value the goodwill held in the carson city reporting unit are shown below 
a 
goodwill resulting from the company s acquisition of astromec is tested for impairment under its carson city motor manufacturing operations 
b 
motor sales of existing products are assumed to decline as products age  but are more than replaced by revenue growth from new products and increased intercompany sales for medical hand piece products 
c 
the existing fixed cost structure of the motor manufacturing operations will be better absorbed by the higher forecasted volume of production  resulting in increased profit margins 
d 
in addition to the value of the goodwill held in the carson city reporting unit as if it stands alone  an additional analysis is performed to estimate a value to pro dex of having an in house motor manufacturer for the medical device product line 
this captive capability enables development speed and focus  which produces revenue in other operating units 
e 
the value of the carson city manufacturing operation is added to the value of the additional capability provided to pro dex for the total value of the goodwill 
the material assumptions relied upon in the discounted cash flow analysis used to value the goodwill held in the micro motors reporting unit are shown below 
a 
goodwill resulting from the company s acquisition of micro motors is tested for impairment under its irvine reporting unit  which houses the operations resulting from the base technology acquired from micro motors 
b 
sales to existing customers are assumed to decline  but are more than replaced by revenue growth from new customers 
the existing fixed cost structure of the irvine operations will be better absorbed by the higher forecasted volume of medical products  resulting in increased profit margins 
given the company s lack of a direct dental distribution channel  it has stopped actively promoting the product based on the intangible asset resulting from the purchase of certain assets from intravantage  inc in october any substantial future value therefore stems from the possibility that a company with a direct dental distribution channel a market participant might be interested in access to the technology through product purchases  licenses  acquisition  joint venture  or other means 
given the current economic environment  the general lack of investment in new products  the limited number of market participants to whom this technology relates  the time and expense necessary to consummate a transaction  and other factors considered by management  there is also a significant possibility that no distribution partner will be found  resulting in effectively no value of the asset 
given this change in circumstance  in accordance with fas accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  management tested the carrying amount of the intangible asset for recoverability as of march  the result of management s analysis based on several scenarios with varying probability of occurring was that the asset s expected value at that date was  and  accordingly a charge of  was taken in the fiscal third quarter 
the asset continued to amortize its remaining value over the remaining patent s life 
as to june   the patent s intangible carrying value was  management remains committed to optimizing the value of this technology for our shareholders  and will continue to pursue any opportunity to accomplish that end 
for the astromec reporting unit s impairment testing there was an assumption of decreased external sales growth compared to  which was more than offset by an increased sales growth rate of motors for internal pro dex use 
in addition to the value of the reporting unit as an internal supplier and stand alone business  the unit has additional strategic value by enabling pro dex to gain additional customers under other reporting units that is considered in the valuation 
it should be noted that the unit passes its goodwill impairment test without the inclusion of this additional enablement value 
for the micro motors reporting unit s impairment testing  there was an assumption of a slower than historical sales growth rate than in the previous valuation 
the total year growth rate in the valuation was equal to the historical year growth rate of the company  but the growth rate was reduced by for the valuation 
the reason for the reduced sales growth is the current and forecast near and medium term market conditions 
the effect of this sales growth decrease was to decrease the unit s calculated value  but not to an extent that it fails the goodwill impairment test 
the computed reporting unit value exceeds the carrying value of the unit by more than percent 
we are subject to the revised requirements of the statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
r accounting for stock based compensation as revised december this standard establishes the accounting standards for equity compensation  and applies to us in the recognition of the cost of stock options awarded based on the grant date fair value of those awards as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements  we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process involves estimating the actual current tax liabilities together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included within the consolidated balance sheet 
the most significant tax assets are future deductions from the amortization of intangibles over the next ten years  inventory reserves and net operating loss carry forwards 
tax assets also result from net operating losses and research and development tax credits 
we must then assess the likelihood that the deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and  to the extent we believe that recovery is not likely  a valuation allowance must be established 
to the extent we establish a valuation allowance or increase or decrease this allowance in a period  the impact will be included in the tax provision in the statement of operations 
significant management judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes and the recoverability of our deferred tax asset 
such determination is based primarily on our historical taxable income  with some consideration given to our estimates of future taxable income by jurisdictions in which we operate and the period over which our deferred tax assets will be recoverable 
due to cumulative taxable losses during the past three years  we recorded  valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets in the year ended june  this reduction in deferred tax assets is adjusted through income tax expense 
as a company with a very small market capitalization and a limited shareholder base  our market capitalization has been negatively affected by the very unusual economic and market environment of late 
we believe our market capitalization may not reflect the true value of the company and or be indicative of the true economic value of our assets 
some of the indications of disproportionate effect on our company include studies that show a strong difference in the valuations of the companies based on total market capitalization  with the small caps being most adversely affected 
one recent study 
the bi weekly fusion orthopedic company update by smh capital  for the two weeks ended february  examined valuation metrics for orthopedic and medical device companies 
the companies classified as large cap are trading at of their week high  times revenues and times ebitda 
the companies classified as mid caps were as expected  in the middle of the trading multiple  trading at of their week high  times revenues and times ebitda  small cap companies are trading at of their week high  times revenues and times ebidta 
the ebitda multiple can be misleading for the small caps as of the companies in the sample size  only four had a positive ebitda  of which pro dex was one 
of the large caps  all seven companies exhibited a positive ebitda 
in an updated study 
the bi weekly fusion orthopedic company update by smh capital  for the two weeks ended june   large caps and mid caps were trading at of their week high and small caps were trading at of their all time high 
we feel these analyses confirm that the current market environment exhibits a significant disproportionately unfavorable effect against small public companies in general  including pro dex 
year in review fiscal year was a difficult year for the world s economy and pro dex was not immune to its effects 
our consolidated sales for declined by as compared to  and approximately even with sales levels 
over the longer term  we maintained a cumulative average growth rate of almost year since fiscal year the motion control business was particularly adversely affected as our high margin products associated with this business are used by capital equipment providers  and these orders came to a sudden standstill in our third quarter jan march 
this part of the business remained low in the subsequent quarter  and there are no indications yet for a strong structural resumption of business to previous levels 
in response to the adverse environment for these products  we sensed an opportunity to gain market share and added additional sales resources in january to aggressively pursue new customers and new sales channels 
the medical products also had a year over year decline  as the sales were high due to two major product launches that were not repeated in as the economy stalled  so did our customers appetite for new projects 
we continued the work on two of the major development projects initiated last year  and expect to see new revenue from them in fiscal year and beyond 
in spite of the sales decline  our backlog of orders remains relatively flat  down by compared to the end of last year 
we initiated strong responses to the top line sales decline  and reduced our associate headcount by since the end of fiscal year our efforts to improve our product quality began to show benefits in fiscal year and warranty cost was reduced by over from million in fiscal year to thousand in fiscal year our operating costs in fiscal year including a non cash impairment expense of  were million up over the prior year s expenses of million 
in addition  we consolidated the management and business development efforts of our carson city operations with those at irvine 
the cost savings introduced by this move allowed for additional investment in developing new motor technology and accelerate the improvements in this part of the business 
there were one time costs associated with these transitional actions  and the actions were phased through the year  but our basic cost structure was improved to better match the lower sales levels 
the new facilities for both our beaverton and the southern california operations have met our expectations 
they are providing for more conducive facilities for engineering  development  and production efforts and contributing to efficiencies gained through collaborative workspaces 
the irvine space has allowed us to in source much of our previously outsourced machining work  which in addition to providing better utilization of the facility  has proven to add to our competitive advantage in responding quickly to our customer s needs 
combined with the lower sales levels  our net income was negatively affected by two large non cash charges realized in our third quarter that resulted in a large loss for the year 
first  due to our inability to find a distribution partner for our intraflow products  we realized a thousand pre tax impairment loss from writing down the value of the associated patent 
we are not actively marketing the product  but continue the search for a distribution partner to help realize the product s full potential 
the second charge was a million tax allowance reducing the book value of our deferred tax assets 
we decided to take this allowance as the recent history of the company s taxable income  especially in consideration of the intangible write off  made the near term realization of the deferred tax assets less assured 
we maintained the company s strong financial position by generating over million in operating cash for the fiscal year  in addition to the million generated the prior year 
our net debt was reduced by over to million from million at the end of due to the reported gaap losses  the terms of our credit facility were reduced to allow for million of borrowing on our credit line 
this is a significant reduction in availability  but we have not had any amounts borrowed under the facility since early in calendar and ended the year with over million in cash on hand  so the reduction has had no effect on operations to date 
entering  we have a lower cost structure  greatly improved legacy product performance  two major product launches in the pipeline and a stable backlog 
we remain committed to return the company to profitable operations and providing a higher level of earnings in the coming years 
we continue to drive costs out of the business and reliably design products that exceed our customers expectations 
as the economy becomes stronger  we anticipate that more customers will be launching new products again and we will participate in some of those launches 
we also look forward to the markets for capital equipment products improving and our motion control top line returning to more normal levels 
results of operations results of operations for fiscal year ended june   compared to fiscal year ended june  the following table sets forth financial data and the percentage of net revenues regarding the company s financial position and operating results 
in thousands fiscal year ended june  net sales cost of sales gross profit selling  general and administrative expenses intangible impairment research and development costs income loss from operations net interest expense and net other income benefit provision for income taxes allowance for deferred tax asset net income loss net sales 
consolidated sales decreased or  to  from  for as compared to medical sales were lower by  or  due to lower sales to our two largest customers by  driven by a return to stable shipping levels to these two customers after their previous year s inventory build 
shipments to dental customers decreased by  or as we strategically reduced sales of certain low profit products 
sales to industrial customers decreased by  or reflecting a slowdown in our motion control business 
sales related to government research related products and product repairs were up with a year over year increase of  due primarily to an increase in repair and upgrade work for products that were not warranty eligible which offset the decline in government agency related work 
aerospace sales were up  or due to higher commercial aircraft motor shipments 
although selective price increases and decreases were implemented in response to market conditions  the majority of the sales growth and declines for each product line is due primarily to changes in sales volume  not the effect of price changes 
the amount of pro dex total sales to each customer type and the year to year change is noted in the table below fiscal year ended june  increase sales by customer type decrease dental medical industrial aerospace government research and other total sales gross profit and gross profit percentage of sales 
our consolidated gross profit for decreased  or compared to the gross profit in the previous year due to the lower medical  dental and industrial product sales volume 
gross profit as a percentage of sales decreased to for the year ended june  compared to for the year ended june  gross margin as a percentage of sales was negatively impacted as a less favorable sales mix that included a lower amount of high margin industrial motion control and medical products that did not completely offset the favorable effect of reduced warranty costs 
gross profit and gross profit as a percentage of sales were as follows fiscal year ended june  decrease gross profit gross profit percentage of sales selling  general and administrative costs s  g a 
s  g a expenses including a  intangible impairment charge increased to  for the year ended june  from  for year ended june  we had a decrease in selling expense mainly due to reduced labor expenditures  advertising and tradeshow activity 
general and administrative costs were lower by due to labor cost reductions associated with reduced headcount 
the increase in total g a costs was due to the impairment cost of the patent related intangible 
the impairment loss is more fully described in note of the accompanying consolidated financial statements

our consolidated operating loss for the year ended june  was  compared to an operating profit of  for the year ended june  operating profit as a percentage of sales decreased to for the year ended june  compared to for the year ended june  operating profit and margin were as follows fiscal year ended june  decrease operating profit loss n a operating profit loss as a percentage of sales royalties and other income 
we earned and received  in royalty payments in fiscal year  compared to  in royalty payments in we had no other expense during the year ended june  compared to  in other expense for asset abandonment associated with the move during the year ended june  net interest income expense 
net interest expense was  in the year ended june   which included  in interest expense offset by  in interest income  compared to  which included  in interest expense offset by  in interest income  in the prior year 
the increase in interest expense is due to higher borrowing requirements  due to a full year of interest expense associated with the irvine facility tenant improvement loan

our estimated effective combined federal and state tax rate on loss from operations for the year ended june  resulted in a provision of the loss before tax compared to a provision of earnings before tax for the year ended june  the difference in the rate is due to a  valuation allowance against our current and long term deferred tax assets 
the deferred tax valuation allowance is more fully described in note of the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
during the year ended june   the internal revenue service settled its audit of our federal income tax returns for the fiscal years ended june  through june  this settlement resulted in the reversal of  of unrecognized tax benefits associated with section a costs we previously reported  which reduced our tax expense by  during the year ended june  we filed amended state returns for the fiscal years ended june  through june  to report the related changes to the section a costs 
the filing of the amended state tax returns resulted in the reversal of  of unrecognized tax benefits associated with the section a costs we reported  which reduced our tax expense by  our remaining liability for uncertain tax positions  related to the fiscal years ended june  through june   is  as of june  we have not identified any new unrecognized tax benefits 
as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements  we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process involves estimating our actual current tax liabilities together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included within our consolidated balance sheet 
the deferred tax assets result primarily from tax basis of intangible assets in excess of book basis 
we must then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and to the extent management believes that recovery is not likely  we must establish a valuation allowance 
to the extent a valuation allowance is either increased or decreased in a period  the impact will be included in the tax provision in the statement of operations 
significant management judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes and the recoverability of our deferred tax asset 
such determination is based primarily on our historical taxable income  with some consideration given to our estimates of future taxable income by jurisdictions in which we operate and the period over which our deferred tax assets will be recoverable 
due to cumulative losses during the past three years  we established a  valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets in the year ended june  the valuation allowance is recorded through income tax expense and included in the tax provision in the statement of operations 
net loss income 
we had a net loss of  or per share  basic for the year ended june  compared to net income of  or per share  basic  and per share  diluted  for the year ended june  liquidity and capital resources the following table presents selected financial statistics and information for the periods indicated as of june  june  cash and cash equivalents working capital credit line outstanding balance tangible book value common share number of days of sales outstanding dso in accounts receivable at end of quarter year ended june  june  net cash provided by operations working capital ending current assets balance ending current liabilities balance tangible book value common share total shareholders equity net intangible asset patents goodwill basic outstanding shares dso ending net accounts receivable balance previous quarter sales our working capital at june  decreased  to approximately million compared to approximately million at june  the reduced working capital is due to normal fluctuations 
cash flow provided by operations was  for the year ended june  compared to  for the year ended june  fiscal year cash was provided largely through a decrease in inventory  reduction in accounts receivable  and a recovery of state and federal tax payments from prior years  offset by a reduction in accounts payable  that occurred in the first part of the fiscal year 
management believes that our working capital needs over the next twelve months can be adequately supported by current operations 
issues related to credit facilities as of june   the wells fargo credit facility had two components a revolving credit line note line of credit of up to  in borrowing availability  and a five year term note the ti loan with an initial balance of  of which  was outstanding as of june  the line of credit borrowing availability is a maximum of  if borrowings under the credit line exceed  the maximum amount of borrowing would be limited to of the eligible accounts receivable plus of the eligible inventory 
its terms require monthly interest payments at either i the prime rate of interest at june  plus  or ii three month libor 
at june  plus  at our discretion  based on outstanding borrowings 
the credit facility expires on november  we are charged an unused credit line fee of per annum payable quarterly on the average balance of the line of credit that is not used 
there was no outstanding balance under the credit line as of june  and there continues to be no borrowing under such credit line as of september  therefore  the total eligible additional borrowing capacity under the line of credit as of june  and as of september  was  the ti loan had an initial balance of  the borrowings from this term commitment were used for construction of tenant improvements for our irvine  california facility 
its terms require monthly principal and interest payments over the month life of the loan  based on outstanding borrowings 
the interest rate is fixed at over the life of the loan 
there was a  outstanding balance under the ti loan as of june  all assets of the company except our carson city land and building secure the outstanding borrowings under the wells fargo credit facility 
in march  we entered into a ten year mortgage with union bank for  the principal balance of the mortgage bears interest at a fixed annual rate of 
payments on the mortgage are  per month based on a year amortization  with the balance of  in principal due on april  the mortgage is secured by our carson city land and building 
there was  in principal outstanding under the mortgage as of june  there are certain financial and non financial covenants that the company must meet to be in compliance with the terms of the wells fargo credit facility and mortgage with union bank 
as of the year ended june   we were in compliance with the wells fargo covenants  however  we were in violation of the cash flow coverage covenant with union bank  with the violation resulting in an event of default under the facility 
on august   we entered into a letter agreement with union bank pursuant to which union bank agreed to waive the covenant violation 
at june   we had cash and cash equivalents of  we believe that our cash and cash equivalents on hand  together with cash flows from operations  if any  and amounts available under the credit facilities will be sufficient to meet our working capital and capital expenditure requirements for this and the next year 
in september  our board of directors authorized the repurchase on the open market of up to  shares of our outstanding common stock at a share price no greater than  subject to compliance with applicable laws and regulations 
there is no requirement that we repurchase all or any portion of such shares 
the maximum total value of the repurchase is not to exceed  from the inception of the repurchase authorization through the fiscal year end date of june   we repurchased  shares of common stock for  at an average price of per share 
no additional shares were repurchased in fiscal years through during the fiscal year  we repurchased  shares of common stock for  at an average price of per share 
since the initiation of the buyback program in through june   we have repurchased  shares for  at an average price of per share 
our board suspended the buyback authorization in may and has not set a reinitiation date for the purchase of our shares pursuant to this program 
impact of possible nasdaq delisting the minimum bid price for our publicly traded common stock has remained below for a significant period of time during late and throughout although nasdaq had suspended its minimum bid requirement in october  nasdaq lifted that suspension on august  and we again face a delisting deadline date of january  if the minimum bid price for our stock does not rise above for the requisite number of days prior to such deadline or if we fail to meet any other listing requirement of the nasdaq capital market  our common stock may be delisted from the nasdaq capital market  which could negatively affect the value of our common stock 
on january   our shareholders authorized us to engage in a reverse split of our common stock which may  as a result of increasing our per share price above  provide us the means to avoid delisting 
as the delisting deadline approaches and if the market price of our shares remains below  our board of directors will continue to review the advisability of proceeding with a reverse split of our common stock or other actions 
impact of inflation and changing prices the industries in which we compete are labor intensive  often involving personnel with high level technical or sales skills 
wages and other expenses increase during periods of inflation and when shortages in the marketplace occur 
in addition  suppliers pass along rising costs to us in the form of higher prices 
to some extent  we have been able to offset increases in operating costs by increasing charges  expanding services and implementing cost control measures 
nevertheless  our ability to increase prices is limited by market conditions  including international competition in many of our markets 
recent accounting pronouncements the fasb has issued fasb statement no 
 subsequent events 
the objective of sfas is to establish general standards of accounting for  and disclosure of events that occur after the balance sheet date but before financial statements are issued or are available to be issued 
in particular  sfas sets forth the period after the balance sheet date during which management of a reporting entity should evaluate events or transactions that may occur for potential recognition or disclosure in the financial statements 
the circumstances under which an entity should recognize events or transactions occurring after the balance sheet date in its financial statements 
the disclosures that an entity should make about events or transactions that occurred after the balance sheet date 
on april   fasb issued fsp fas  determining fair value when the volume and level of activity for the asset or liability have significantly decreased and identifying transactions that are not orderly 
the purpose of this fsp is to provide additional guidance in the application of fasb statement no 
 it supersedes fsp fas  determining the fair value of a financial asset when the market for that asset is not active 
among other points  the fsp affirms that the objective of fair value when the market for an asset is not active is the price that would be received to sell the asset in an orderly transaction that is  not a forced liquidation or distressed sale between market participants at the measurement date under current market conditions that is  in the inactive market  clarifies and includes additional factors for determining whether there has been a significant decrease in market activity for an asset when the market for that asset is not active  eliminates the proposed presumption that all transactions are distressed not orderly unless proven otherwise 
the fsp will instead require an entity to base its conclusion about whether a transaction was not orderly on the weight of the evidence  includes an example that provides additional explanation on estimating fair value when the market activity for an asset has declined significantly  requires an entity to disclose a change in valuation technique and the related inputs resulting from the application of the fsp and to quantify its effects  if practicable  by major category  and applies to all fair value measurements when appropriate
