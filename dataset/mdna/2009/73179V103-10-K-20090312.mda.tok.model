item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report 
some of the information contained in this discussion and analysis or included elsewhere in this report  including information with respect to our plans and strategy for our business  includes forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
please see forward looking statements for more information 
you should review the risk factors for a discussion of important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the results described in or implied by the forward looking statements 
overview we are a leading global high technology filtration company that develops  manufactures and markets specialized microporous membranes used in separation and filtration processes 
in fiscal  we generated total net sales of million 
we operate in two business segments i the energy storage segment  which accounted for approximately of our fiscal net sales  and ii the separations media segment  which accounted for approximately of our fiscal net sales 
we manufacture our products at facilities in north america  europe and asia 
net sales from foreign locations were million for fiscal energy storage segment in the energy storage segment  our membrane separators are a critical performance component in lithium batteries  which are primarily used in consumer electronic applications  and lead acid batteries  which are used globally in transportation and industrial applications 
although the short term economic outlook is uncertain  especially for the more economically sensitive consumer electronics portion of our business  we believe that the energy storage segment will continue to benefit from continued growth in demand by consumers for mobile power 
lithium batteries are the power source in a wide variety of electronics applications ranging from notebook computers and mobile phones to cordless power tools 
in addition  many new and developing applications such as electric and hybrid electric vehicles incorporate large format batteries that will require much greater membrane separator volume per battery 
as a result  we believe that membrane separator growth will exceed battery unit sales growth 
in the third quarter of  we completed a lithium battery separator capacity expansion at our charlotte  north carolina facility and in the fourth quarter of  began ramping up production 
in may  we acquired yurie wide corporation  a south korean company  which we subsequently renamed celgard korea  inc celgard korea 
the acquisition broadens our participation in the lithium battery separator market  adds to our membrane technology portfolio and product breadth and adds cost effective production capacity 
after the acquisition  we discontinued celgard korea sales and made significant operational changes to align celgard korea s operations with our global standards 
celgard korea will not generate any revenues until their manufacturing processes and products meet our higher quality standards  which we expect to occur during in the motor vehicle battery market  the high proportion of aftermarket sales and the steady growth of the worldwide fleet of motor vehicles provide us with a growing  recurring revenue base in lead acid battery membrane separators 
we believe we will also benefit from the worldwide conversion of alternative separator materials to the higher performance polyethylene based membrane separators such as those we produce 
growth is strongest in the asia pacific region as a result of increasing per capita penetration of automobiles  growth in the industrial and manufacturing sectors  and a high rate of conversion to polyethylene based membrane separators 
we have positioned ourselves to benefit from this growth by expanding capacity at our prachinburi  thailand facility  acquiring a production facility in tianjin  china and establishing an asian technical center in thailand 
in february  we purchased of the stock of microporous holding corporation  the parent company of microporous products lp microporous 
the acquisition of microporous adds rubber based battery separator technology to our product line 
this acquisition broadens our participation in the deep cycle industrial battery market eg  forklift and stationary batteries  adds to our membrane technology portfolio and product breadth  enhances service to common customers and adds cost effective production capacity 
on april   we acquired the battery separator manufacturing assets of super tech battery components pvt 
ltd  located in bangalore  india 
a supply contract between our lead acid battery separator business and johnson controls  inc jci expired on december  in response  we implemented a restructuring plan in our energy storage segment to align lead acid battery separator production capacity with demand  reduce costs and position ourselves to meet future growth opportunities 
the initial plan includes closing our facility in potenza  italy  streamlining production at our facility in owensboro  kentucky and reducing selling  general and administrative resources associated with the lead acid separator business 
the total estimated cost of the plan is expected to be approximately million  including cash charges of million for severance  environmental  and other exit costs and a non cash impairment charge of million 
we began implementing the restructuring plan during the fourth quarter and recorded a restructuring charge of million 
separations media segment in the separations media segment  our filtration membranes and modules are used in healthcare and high performance filtration and specialty applications 
the healthcare business and a portion of the filtration and specialty business have historically been relatively unaffected by the economy  and we believe that the separations media segment will continue to benefit from continued growth in demand for higher levels of purity in a growing number of applications 
healthcare applications include hemodialysis  blood oxygenation  and plasmapheresis 
growth in demand for hemodialysis membranes is driven by the increasing worldwide population of end stage renal disease patients 
we estimate that conversion to single use dialyzers and increasing treatment frequency will result in additional dialyzer market growth 
we produce a wide range of membranes and membrane based elements for micro  ultra and nanofiltration and gasification degasification of liquids 
micro  ultra and nanofiltration membrane element market growth is being driven by several factors  including end market growth in applications such as water treatment and pharmaceutical processing  displacement of conventional filtration media by membrane filtration due to membranes superior cost and performance attributes and increasing purity requirements in industrial and other applications 
issuance of common stock in may  we completed a follow on public offering of  shares of common stock at per share  pursuant to which  shares were sold by us and  shares were sold by certain selling shareholders  including certain of our executive officers 
we received net proceeds from the offering of million  net of underwriting fees of million and other offering related costs 
the net proceeds were used to repay outstanding borrowings under our revolving credit facility and for general corporate purposes 
critical accounting policies critical accounting policies are those accounting policies that can have a significant impact on the presentation of our financial condition and results of operations  and that require the use of complex and subjective estimates based on past experience and management s judgment 
because of uncertainty inherent in such estimates  actual results may differ from these estimates 
below are those policies that we believe are critical to the understanding of our operating results and financial condition 
management has discussed the development and selection of these critical accounting policies with the audit committee of our board of directors 
for additional accounting policies  see note of the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
allowance for doubtful accounts accounts receivable are primarily composed of amounts owed to us through our operating activities and are presented net of an allowance for doubtful accounts 
we establish an allowance for doubtful accounts based upon factors surrounding the credit risk of specific customers  historical trends and other information 
we charge accounts receivables off against our allowance for doubtful accounts when we deem them to be uncollectible on a specific identification basis 
the determination of the amount of the allowance for doubtful accounts is subject to judgment and estimated by management 
if circumstances or economic conditions deteriorate  we may need to increase the allowance for doubtful accounts 
impairment of intangibles and goodwill identified intangible assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable 
in accordance with fasb statement no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets are not amortized  but are subject to an annual impairment test unless circumstances dictate more frequent assessments 
goodwill impairment testing is a two step process performed at the reporting unit level 
the company s reporting units are at the operating segment level 
step one compares the fair value of the company s reporting units to their carrying amount 
the fair value of the reporting unit is determined using the income approach  corroborated by a comparison to market capitalization and key multiples of comparable companies 
under the income approach  the company determines fair value based on estimated future cash flows of each reporting unit  discounted by an estimated weighted average cost of capital 
if the fair value of the reporting unit is greater than its carrying amount  there is no impairment 
if the reporting unit s carrying amount exceeds its fair value  then the second step must be completed to measure the amount of impairment  if any 
step two of the goodwill impairment test calculates the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill with the carrying value of its goodwill 
if the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of goodwill  an impairment loss will be recognized in an amount equal to the excess 
determining the fair value of a reporting unit is judgmental in nature and requires the use of significant estimates and assumptions  including revenue growth rates  operating margins  discount rates  strategic plans and future market conditions  among others 
given the current economic environment and the uncertainties regarding the impact on the company s business  there can be no assurance that the company s estimates and assumptions made for purposes of the company s goodwill impairment testing will prove to be accurate predictions of the future 
if the company s assumptions regarding forecasted revenue or margin growth rates of certain reporting units are not achieved  or changes in strategy or market conditions occur  the company may be required to record goodwill impairment charges in future periods 
it is not possible at this time to determine if any such future impairment charge would result or  if it does  whether such charge would be material 
a decrease in the estimated free cash flow assumptions would have resulted in a reduction in fair values of approximately million for our energy storage segment and million for our separations media segment  but would not have resulted in an impairment charge to goodwill or intangible assets 
a decrease in the estimated free cash flow assumptions would have resulted in a reduction in fair values of approximately million for our energy storage segment and million for our separations media segment 
for the energy storage segment  the decrease would have resulted in the carrying value of the lead acid battery separator reporting unit exceeding its fair value by million and would require a step two analysis to determine the amount of goodwill impairment  if any 
a increase in the discount rate would have resulted in a reduction in fair values of million for our energy storage segment and million for our separations media segment 
for the energy storage segment  the increase in the discount rate would have resulted in the carrying value of the lead acid battery separator reporting unit exceeding its fair value by million and would require a step two analysis to determine the amount of goodwill impairment  if any 
pension and other postretirement benefits certain assumptions are used in the calculation of the actuarial valuation of our defined benefit pension plans and other postretirement benefits 
two critical assumptions  discount rate and expected return on assets  are important elements of plan expense and or liability measurement and differences between actual results and these two actuarial assumptions can materially affect our projected benefit obligation or the valuation of our plan assets 
other assumptions involve demographic factors such as retirement  expected increases in compensation  mortality and turnover 
the discount rate enables us to state expected future cash flows at a present value on the measurement date 
the discount rate assumptions are based on the market rate for high quality fixed income investments  and are thus subject to change each year 
at january   a decrease in the discount rate would increase our projected benefit obligations and the unfunded status of our pension plans by million 
the expected rates of return on our pension plans assets are based on the asset allocation of each plan and the long term projected return of those assets 
at january   if the expected rate of return on pension plan assets were reduced by  the result would have increased our net periodic benefit expense for fiscal by million dollars 
at january   if the actual plan assets were reduced by  the unfunded status of our pension plans would increase by million 
environmental matters we account for environmental liabilities in accordance with aicpa statement of position  environmental remediation liabilities 
environmental obligations are accrued when such expenditures are probable and reasonably estimable 
the amount of liability recorded is based on currently available information  including the progress of remedial investigations  current status of discussions with regulatory authorities regarding the method and extent of remediation  presently enacted laws and existing technology 
accruals for estimated losses from environmental obligations are adjusted as further information develops or circumstances change 
we do not currently anticipate any material loss in excess of the amounts accrued 
future remediation expenses may be affected by a number of uncertainties including  but not limited to  the difficulty in estimating the extent and method of remediation  the evolving nature of environmental regulations  and the availability and application of technology 
if actual results are less favorable than those projected by management  we may be required to recognize additional expense and liabilities 
in connection with the acquisition of membrana gmbh membrana in  we recorded a reserve for costs to remediate known environmental issues and operational upgrades at the wuppertal  germany facility 
in  we identified and accrued for potential environmental contamination at our manufacturing facility in potenza  italy 
in december  we implemented a restructuring plan which included the closure of this manufacturing facility and increased the environmental reserve for the estimated additional costs of environmental remediation and monitoring activities that will be required after closing the facility 
we have indemnification agreements for certain environmental matters from acordis ag acordis and akzo nobel ag akzo  the prior owners of membrana 
recoveries of environmental costs from other parties are recognized as assets when their receipt is deemed probable 
we have recorded a receivable with regard to the akzo indemnification agreement 
if indemnification claims cannot be enforced against acordis and akzo  we may be required to reduce the amount of indemnification receivable recorded

net sales for fiscal were million  an increase of million  or  from fiscal energy storage sales for fiscal were million  an increase of million  or 
the increase in energy storage sales was due to higher lead acid and lithium battery separator sales and the positive impact of dollar euro exchange rate fluctuations of million 
lead acid battery separator sales increased by  due primarily to the acquisition of microporous  as well as the positive impact of dollar euro exchange rate fluctuations and price increases earlier in to partially offset the escalation in raw material and energy costs 
the expiration of a lead acid separator supply contract with jci will impact our sales for fiscal sales of automotive lead acid battery separators covered by the expired contract were approximately of fiscal consolidated net sales 
in response  we implemented a restructuring plan to align lead acid battery separator production capacity with demand  reduce costs and position us to meet future growth opportunities 
lithium battery separator sales increased by due to increasing demand for mobile power and the penetration of lithium ion batteries in an increasing number of electronic devices and into new applications for large format cells 
separations media sales for fiscal were million  an increase of million  or from fiscal the increase in separations media sales was due to higher sales of industrial and filtration specialty products and the positive impact of dollar euro exchange rate fluctuations of million 
healthcare sales were consistent with the prior year as growth in sales of synthetic hemodialysis membranes and the positive impact of dollar euro exchange rate fluctuations offset the impact of discontinued sales of cellulosic membranes 
industrial and filtration specialty product sales increased by  driven by continued demand for high performance filtration applications and the positive impact of dollar euro exchange rate fluctuations 
gross profit 
gross profit as a percent of net sales was for fiscal as compared to for fiscal energy storage gross profit as a percent of net sales was as compared to for fiscal the decline was primarily attributable to the acquisition of microporous  which has lower gross profit margins than our other lead acid battery separator production facilities  increased raw material and energy costs  and costs associated with the strike at our owensboro  kentucky facility 
separations media gross profit as a percent of net sales increased to for fiscal from for fiscal the increase was due primarily to increased hemodialysis membrane production volumes and investments to enhance production efficiencies 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses as a percent of net sales were for fiscal  which is comparable to for fiscal interest expense 
interest expense for fiscal decreased by million from fiscal the decrease in interest expense was primarily driven by the purchase of our senior discount notes in july and lower interest rates under our senior credit facilities 
income taxes 
income taxes as a percentage of pre tax income from continuing operations for fiscal were as compared to for fiscal the income tax expense recorded in the financial statements fluctuates between years due to a variety of factors  including state income taxes  the mix of income between us and foreign jurisdictions taxed at varying rates  changes in estimates of permanent differences and valuation allowances and the relative size of our consolidated income before income taxes 
the mix of earnings between the tax jurisdictions has a significant impact on our effective tax rate 
each tax jurisdiction has its own set of tax laws and tax rates and income earned by our subsidiaries is taxed independently by these various jurisdictions 
currently  the applicable statutory income tax rates in the jurisdictions in which we operate range from to 
therefore  the amount of income tax expense in each jurisdiction as compared to our consolidated income loss before income taxes has a significant impact on our annual effective tax rate 
in fiscal  the effective tax rate was also impacted by the restructuring charge in potenza  italy 
net operating losses generated in italy as a result of the restructuring charge were offset by a valuation allowance because the benefit of these net operating losses may never be realized since the company will no longer have operations in italy 
the effect of each of these items on our effective tax rate on continuing operations is quantified in the table below fiscal fiscal us federal statutory rate state income taxes mix of income in taxing jurisdictions other permanent differences and valuation allowances purchase of senior discount notes and write off of loan acquisition costs associated with refinancing of senior secured credit facility impact of restructuring other impact of italian tax reform legislation impact of german tax reform legislation total effective tax rate on continuing operations fiscal compared with fiscal net sales 
net sales for fiscal were million  an increase of million  or  from fiscal energy storage net sales for fiscal were million  an increase of million  or  from fiscal the increase in energy storage sales was primarily due to higher lead acid and lithium battery separator sales volume  higher average sales prices for lead acid battery separators and the million positive impact of dollar euro exchange rate fluctuations 
lead acid separator sales growth of was driven by the increasing size of the automotive market and the trend of conversion from alternative separator materials to superior performing polyethylene based separators  particularly in asia 
average sales prices increased due to global price increases implemented to offset higher raw material and energy costs 
lithium battery separator sales increased by due to increased demand for consumer electronic products and expanding applications for lithium batteries 
separations media net sales for fiscal were million  an increase of million  or  from fiscal due to higher sales of industrial and specialty filtration products and hemodialysis membranes 
included in this increase was a million positive impact of dollar euro exchange rate fluctuations 
healthcare product sales increased by due to strong growth in sales of synthetic hemodialysis membranes combined with the positive impact of dollar euro exchange rate fluctuations  offset by the expected decline in sales of cellulosic hemodialysis membranes due to our exit of this product line 
filtration and specialty product sales increased by  driven by continued strong demand for high performance filtration applications and the positive impact of dollar euro exchange rate fluctuations 
gross profit 
gross profit as a percent of net sales was for fiscal  as compared to for fiscal energy storage gross profit as a percent of net sales was for the fiscal  which was comparable to the prior year percentage of 
separations media gross profit as a percent of net sales increased to for fiscal from for fiscal the increase in separations media gross profit percentage is due primarily to the successful transformation of our hemodialysis membrane business from cellulosic to synthetic products  investments to enhance production efficiencies and growth in our high performance filtration business 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses as a percent of net sales were for fiscal  as compared to for fiscal the increase in selling  general and administrative expenses is due to increased costs strategically aimed at driving growth  including selling and marketing costs and personnel costs 
interest expense 
interest expense for fiscal decreased by million from fiscal the decrease in interest expense was primarily driven by the purchase of our senior discount notes in july and lower interest rates under our refinanced senior credit facilities 
income taxes  net 
income taxes as a percentage of income before income taxes for fiscal were as compared to for fiscal the income tax expense recorded in the financial statements fluctuates between years due to a variety of factors  including state income taxes  the mix of income between us and foreign jurisdictions taxed at varying rates  certain export sales which are excluded from taxable income  various changes in estimates of permanent differences and valuation allowances  and the relative size of our consolidated income or loss before income taxes 
the primary factor impacting our effective tax rate is the mix of earnings between the various tax jurisdictions in which we do business 
each tax jurisdiction has its own set of tax laws and tax rates 
the income earned by our subsidiaries in each jurisdiction is taxed independently by these various jurisdictions 
currently  the applicable statutory income tax rates in the jurisdictions that we operate in range from to 
therefore  the amount of income tax expense in each jurisdiction as compared to our consolidated income loss before income taxes has a significant impact on our annual effective tax rate 
in  our effective tax rate was also impacted by significant events related to financing activities and tax reforms that occurred during fiscal these events resulted in an increase in our income tax benefit of million 
in july  we purchased the senior discount notes and refinanced our senior secured credit facilities 
the cost of these transactions was million  consisting of redemption and tender premiums and the write off of unamortized loan acquisition costs  and resulted in an income tax benefit of million in fiscal on august   the german government enacted the tax reform act legislation 
this comprehensive german tax reform legislation reduces corporate tax rates for and beyond and also fundamentally changes the calculation of taxable income in germany 
while the corporate income tax and trade tax regime within germany have remained  the act reduces the maximum corporate income tax rate from to and the maximum trade tax rate from approximately to 
additional provisions of the legislation include the disallowance of deductions of the trade tax and certain interest expense from taxable income 
as a result of the act  our german deferred tax liabilities existing as of january  will reverse in future years at a lower effective tax rate 
we recognized the effect of the new tax legislation  which resulted in an increase in the income tax benefit of million in fiscal on december   the italian parliament approved the finance bill  which affected taxation of corporations doing business in italy 
the most significant change was the reduction of the corporate income tax rate from to and a reduction of the local income tax rate from to 
as a result  our italian deferred tax liabilities existing as of january  will reverse in future years at a lower effective tax rate 
we recognized the effect of the new tax legislation  which resulted in an increase in the income tax benefit of million in fiscal the effect of each of these items on our effective tax rate is quantified in the table below fiscal fiscal us federal statutory rate state income taxes mix of income in taxing jurisdictions export sales excluded from taxable income other permanent differences and valuation allowances purchase of senior discount notes and write off of loan acquisition costs associated with refinancing of senior secured credit facility impact of italian tax reform legislation impact of german tax reform legislation total effective tax rate on continuing operations business restructuring the pre tax components of restructuring activity in were as follows in millions balance at december  restructuring charges asset writedown cash payments foreign currency translation balance at january  restructuring plan severance and benefit costs impairment other restructuring plan severance and benefit costs other restructuring plan severance and benefit costs total in addition to the amounts in the table above  the restructuring charge included million in environmental costs

we expect to make payments against the restructuring reserve of million in fiscal restructuring plan 
a supply contract between our lead acid battery separator business and jci expired on december  in response  we implemented a restructuring plan in our energy storage segment to align lead acid battery separator production capacity with demand  reduce costs and position ourselves to meet future growth opportunities 
the initial plan includes closing our facility in potenza  italy  streamlining production at our facility in owensboro  kentucky and reducing selling  general and administrative resources associated with the lead acid separator business 
the total estimated cost of the plan is expected to be approximately million  including cash charges of million for severance  environmental  and other exit costs and a non cash impairment charge of million 
we began implementing the restructuring plan during the fourth quarter and recorded a restructuring charge of million 
cash payments for severance and other exit costs associated with the plan are expected to be paid over the next three years 
the timing  scope and costs of these restructuring measures are subject to change we implement the plan and continue to evaluate our business needs and costs 
restructuring plan 
in december  our separations media segment exited the production of cellulosic membranes and we realigned the cost structure at our wuppertal  germany facility 
the total cost of the plan is expected to be approximately million  consisting of a million non cash impairment charge for buildings and equipment  million for employee layoffs and million for other costs related to the shutdown of portions of the wuppertal facility 
the other costs included in the restructuring plan are related to local regulations surrounding complete or partial shutdowns of a facility 
during fiscal  the reserve for severance and benefit costs was reduced as a result of lower actual severance expenses than originally estimated 
restructuring plan 
in order to better accommodate customer growth and related demand for both lead acid and lithium battery separators in the greater asian market  our energy storage segment transferred certain assets from europe and the united states to our facilities in thailand and china 
the total cost of the realignment plan was million  including a non cash impairment charge of million 
foreign operations at january   we manufacture our products at strategically located facilities in north america  europe and asia 
net sales from the foreign locations were million for fiscal  million for fiscal and million for fiscal typically  we sell our products in the currency of the country where the manufacturing facility that produces the product is located 
sales to foreign customers are subject to numerous additional risks  including the impact of foreign government regulations  currency fluctuations  political uncertainties and differences in business practices 
there can be no assurance that foreign governments will not adopt regulations or take other action that would have a direct or indirect adverse impact on our business or market opportunities within such governments countries 
furthermore  there can be no assurance that the political  cultural and economic climate outside the united states will be favorable to our operations and growth strategy 
seasonality operations at our european production facilities are traditionally subject to shutdowns for approximately one month during the third quarter of each year for employee vacations 
as a result  operating income during the third quarter of fiscal years  and were  and during the third quarter of any fiscal year in the future may be  lower than operating income in other quarters during the same fiscal year 
in view of the seasonal fluctuations  we believe that comparisons of our operating results for the third quarter of any fiscal year with those of the other quarters during the same fiscal year may be of limited relevance in predicting our future financial performance 
liquidity and capital resources cash and cash equivalents increased to million at january  from million at december  the million increase consists of cash flow from operations of million and cash from financing activities of million  offset by cash used in investing activities of million and the negative impact of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents of million 
operating activities 
net cash provided by operating activities was million in fiscal  as compared to million in fiscal cash provided by operating activities in fiscal consisted of cash flows from operations partially offset by an increase in working capital of million  excluding the impact of foreign exchange rate fluctuations 
accounts receivable decreased by million excluding the million decrease due to movements in foreign exchange rates due to the normal fluctuations in the timing of sales in the quarter 
days sales outstanding at january  were comparable to the prior year 
inventories increased million excluding the million decrease due to movements in foreign exchange rates due to timing of sales and production 
accounts payable and accrued liabilities decreased by million excluding the million decrease due to movements in foreign exchange rates primarily due to timing of payments on accounts payable and accrued liabilities 
net cash provided by operating activities was million in fiscal  as compared to million in fiscal cash provided by operating activities in fiscal consisted of cash flows from operations partially offset by an increase in working capital of million  excluding the impact of foreign exchange rate fluctuations 
accounts receivable increased by million excluding the million increase due to movements in foreign exchange rates due to the increase in sales during the fourth quarter of as compared to the same period last year 
days sales outstanding decreased by approximately at december  and were impacted by normal fluctuations in the mix of sales by country and customer 
inventories decreased million excluding the million increase due to movements in foreign exchange rates due to the reduction of cellulosic hemodialysis membrane inventories as we made final shipments out of inventory to our customers 
accounts payable and accrued liabilities decreased by million excluding the million increase due to movements in foreign exchange rates primarily due to restructuring payments 
investing activities 
cash used in investing activities was million  consisting of capital expenditures and acquisitions  partially offset by million in proceeds from the sale of a non core synthetic paper business 
capital expenditures in fiscal were million 
included in this amount were expenditures for the completion of the lithium capacity expansion in charlotte  north carolina and the lead acid capacity expansion in prachinburi  thailand 
for  we expect to spend approximately million to million to maintain our existing facilities 
because of current economic conditions  the timing and amounts of capital expenditures in excess of normal maintenance requirements will be intensely scrutinized and approved on a case by case basis 
in fiscal  we completed three acquisitions in our energy storage segment for an aggregate purchase price of million 
financing activities 
cash provided by financing activities was million in fiscal in may  we completed a follow on public offering with net proceeds of million 
the proceeds were used to repay outstanding borrowings under our revolving credit facility and for general corporate purposes 
we made debt payments of million  including the repayment of the million of debt assumed in the microporous acquisition 
we intend to fund our ongoing operations with cash on hand  cash generated by operations and availability under the senior secured credit facility 
on july   we refinanced polypore s senior secured credit facility with a new senior secured credit facility that provides improved financial flexibility and lower interest rate spreads 
the new credit facility provides for a million term loan facility million outstanding at january  and a million term loan facility million at january  and a million revolving credit facility 
at january   we had million of borrowings available under the revolving credit facility million revolving credit facility less million of undrawn standby letters of credit 
the term loans mature in july and the revolving credit facility matures in july interest rates under the senior secured credit facility are  at our option  equal to either an alternate base rate plus a margin or the eurocurrency base rate plus a margin 
at january   the interest rates on the us dollar term loan and eurodollar term loan were and  respectively 
when loans are outstanding under the revolving credit facility  we are required to maintain a senior leverage ratio of indebtedness to adjusted ebitda of less than to 
at january   our senior leverage ratio was  and the entire amount of the revolving credit facility was available for borrowing 
adjusted ebitda  as defined under the senior secured credit facility  for fiscal was as follows in millions fiscal net loss add subtract depreciation and amortization interest expense  net income taxes stock based compensation expense foreign currency gain loss on disposal of property  plant  and equipment business restructuring pro forma results for acquisitions costs related to the strike at our owensboro  kentucky facility costs related to the ftc complaint discontinued operations other non cash or non recurring charges adjusted ebitda the calculation of the senior leverage ratio as defined under the senior credit facility as of january  is as follows in millions fiscal indebtedness adjusted ebitda actual leverage ratio x calculated as the sum of outstanding borrowings under the term loan facility plus the capital lease obligation  less the amount of cash on hand not to exceed million 
the senior secured credit agreement contains certain restrictive covenants which  among other things  limit capital spending  the incurrence of additional indebtedness  investments  dividends  transactions with affiliates  asset sales  acquisitions  mergers and consolidations  prepayments of other indebtedness  liens and encumbrances  and other matters customarily restricted in such agreements 
the facilities also contain certain customary events of default  subject to grace periods  as appropriate 
we believe that annual capital expenditure limitations imposed by the senior credit facilities will not significantly inhibit us from meeting our ongoing capital expenditure needs 
in january  the company entered into interest rate swap agreements that effectively fix the interest rate on million of the company s term loans 
the interest rate swap agreement which terminates on june  fixes the interest rate on million of the term loans at 
the interest rate swap agreement which terminates on december  fixes the interest rate on million of the term loans at 
future principal debt payments are expected to be paid out of cash flows from operations  borrowings on our revolving credit facility and future refinancing of our debt 
our cash interest requirements for the next twelve months are estimated to be million 
the senior subordinated notes million outstanding at january  will mature in and are guaranteed by most of our existing and future domestic restricted subsidiaries  subject to certain exceptions 
except under certain circumstances  the senior subordinated notes do not require principal payments prior to their maturity in interest on the senior subordinated notes is payable semi annually in cash 
the senior subordinated notes contain customary covenants and events of default  including covenants that limit our ability to incur debt  pay dividends and make investments 
as stated in the credit agreement  the term loans mature in july and the revolving credit facility matures in july the senior subordinated notes mature on may  because the senior subordinated notes are subordinated to the senior secured credit facility  if any amounts are outstanding under the senior subordinated notes at february   the maturity dates for the term loans and the revolving credit facility will be accelerated to february  we believe we have sufficient liquidity to meet our cash requirements over both the short next twelve months and long term in relation to our debt service requirements 
in evaluating the sufficiency of our liquidity for both the shorter and longer term  we considered cash on hand  the expected cash flow to be generated by our operations and the available borrowings under our senior secured credit facility compared to our anticipated cash requirements for debt service  working capital  cash taxes and capital expenditures and funding requirements for long term liabilities 
we anticipate that our cash on hand and operating cash flow  together with borrowings under the revolving credit facility  will be sufficient to meet our anticipated future operating expenses  capital expenditures and debt service obligations as they become due for at least the next twelve months 
however  our ability to make scheduled payments of principal  to pay interest on or to refinance our indebtedness and to satisfy our other debt obligations will depend upon our future operating performance  which will be affected by general economic  financial  competitive  legislative  regulatory  business and other factors beyond our control 
see item a 
risk factors in this annual report on form k 
from time to time  we may explore additional financing methods and other means to lower our cost of capital  which could include stock issuance or debt financing and the application of the proceeds therefrom to the repayment of bank debt or other indebtedness 
in addition  in connection with any future acquisitions  we may require additional funding which may be provided in the form of additional debt or equity financing or a combination thereof 
there can be no assurance that any additional financing will be available to us on acceptable terms 
environmental matters we account for environmental liabilities in accordance with aicpa statement of position  environmental remediation liabilities 
environmental obligations are accrued when such expenditures are probable and reasonably estimable 
the amount of liability recorded is based on currently available information  including the progress of remedial investigations  current status of discussions with regulatory authorities regarding the method and extent of remediation  presently enacted laws and existing technology 
accruals for estimated losses from environmental obligations are adjusted as further information develops or circumstances change 
costs of future expenditures for environmental obligations are not discounted to their present value 
we do not currently anticipate any material loss in excess of the amounts accrued 
however  future remediation expenses may be affected by a number of uncertainties including  but not limited to  the difficulty in estimating the extent and method of remediation  the evolving nature of environmental regulations  and the availability and application of technology 
we do not expect the resolution of such uncertainties to have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position or liquidity 
recoveries of environmental costs from other parties are recognized as assets when their receipt is deemed probable

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to various market risks  which are potential losses arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices  such as interest rates and foreign exchange fluctuations 
we do not enter into derivatives or other financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
interest rate risk at january   we had fixed rate debt of million and variable rate debt of million 
in january  we entered into interest rate swap agreements that effectively fix the interest rate on million of our variable rate debt 
the pre tax earnings and cash flow impact resulting from a basis point increase in interest rates on our variable rate debt  giving effect to the interest rate swap agreements and holding other variables constant  would be million per year 
currency risk outside of the united states  we maintain assets and operations in europe and asia 
the results of operations and financial position of our foreign operations are principally measured in their respective currency and translated into us dollars 
as a result  exposure to foreign currency gains and losses exists 
the reported income of these subsidiaries will be higher or lower depending on a weakening or strengthening of the us dollar against the respective foreign currency 
our subsidiaries and affiliates also purchase and sell products and services in various currencies 
as a result  we may be exposed to cost increases relative to the local currencies in the markets in which we sell 
because a different percentage of our sales are in a foreign currency than our costs  a change in the relative value of the us dollar could have a disproportionate impact on our sales compared to our costs  which could impact our margins 
a portion of our assets are based in our foreign locations and are translated into us dollars at foreign currency exchange rates in effect as of the end of each period  with the effect of such translation reflected in other comprehensive income loss 
we have a euro denominated term loan and senior subordinated notes that effectively hedge our net investment in foreign subsidiaries 
therefore  foreign currency gains and losses resulting from the translation of the euro denominated debt are included in accumulated other comprehensive income loss 
accordingly  our consolidated shareholders equity will fluctuate depending upon the weakening or strengthening of the us dollar against the respective foreign currency  primarily the euro 
the dollar euro exchange rates used in our financial statements for the fiscal years ended as set forth below were as follows period end rate period average rate our strategy for management of currency risk relies primarily on conducting our operations in a country s respective currency and may  from time to time  involve foreign currency derivatives 
as of january   we did not have any foreign currency derivatives outstanding
