item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview our business with more than million subscribers  we are the largest online movie rental subscription service in the united states 
we offer a variety of subscription plans  with no due dates  no late fees  no shipping fees and no pay per view fees 
we provide subscribers access to over  dvd and blu ray titles plus more than  streaming content choices 
subscribers select titles at our web site aided by our proprietary recommendation service and merchandising tools 
subscribers can receive dvds by us mail and return them to us at their convenience using our prepaid mailers 
after a dvd has been returned  we mail the next available dvd in a subscriber s queue 
watch streaming content without commercial interruption on personal computers pcs  intel based macintosh computers macs and televisions tvs 
the viewing experience is enabled by netflix controlled software that can run on a variety of devices 
these devices include pcs  macs  internet connected blu ray players  such as those manufactured by lg electronics and samsung  set top boxes  such as tivo and the netflix player by roku  game consoles  such as microsoft s xbox  and planned for later this year  tvs from vizio and lg electronics 
our core strategy is to grow a large subscription business consisting of dvd by mail and streaming content 
we offer over  titles on dvd 
in comparison  the  content choices available for streaming are relatively limited 
we expect to substantially broaden the content choices as more content becomes available to us 
until such time  by bundling dvd and streaming as part of the netflix subscription  we are able to offer subscribers a uniquely comprehensive selection of movies for one low monthly price 
we believe this creates a competitive advantage as compared to a streaming only subscription service 
this advantage will diminish over time as more content becomes available over the internet from competing services  by which time we expect to have further developed our other advantages such as brand  distribution  and our proprietary merchandising platform 
despite the growing popularity of internet delivered content  we expect that dvd will continue to be the primary means by which most netflix subscribers view content for the foreseeable future 
however  at some point in the future  we expect that internet delivery of content directly to the home will surpass dvd 
key business metrics management periodically reviews certain key business metrics within the context of our articulated performance goals in order to evaluate the effectiveness of our operational strategies  allocate resources and maximize the financial performance of our business 
the key business metrics include the following churn churn is a monthly measure defined as customer cancellations in the quarter divided by the sum of beginning subscribers and gross subscriber additions  then divided by three months 
management reviews this metric to evaluate whether we are retaining our existing subscribers in accordance with our business plans 
subscriber acquisition cost subscriber acquisition cost is defined as total marketing expense divided by total gross subscriber additions 
management reviews this metric to evaluate how effective our marketing programs are in acquiring new subscribers on an economical basis in the context of estimated subscriber lifetime value 
gross margin management reviews gross margin to monitor variable costs and operating efficiency 
management believes it is useful to monitor these metrics together and not individually as it does not make business decisions based upon any single metric 
please see results of operations below for further discussion on these key business metrics

critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements  and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reported periods 
the securities and exchange commission sec has defined a company s critical accounting policies as the ones that are most important to the portrayal of a company s financial condition and results of operations  and which require a company to make its most difficult and subjective judgments 
based on this definition  we have identified the critical accounting policies and judgments addressed below 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that the company believes to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates 
content accounting we obtain content from studios and distributors through direct purchases  revenue sharing agreements or license agreements 
we acquire dvd content for the purpose of rental to our subscribers and earning subscription rental revenues  and  as such  we consider our dvd library to be a productive asset 
accordingly  we classify our dvd library as a non current asset on our consolidated balance sheets 
additionally  in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 statement of cash flows  sfas cash outflows for the acquisition of the dvd library  net of changes in related accounts payable  are classified as cash flows from investing activities on our consolidated statements of cash flows 
this is inclusive of any upfront non refundable payments required under revenue sharing agreements 
we amortize our dvds  less estimated salvage value  on a sum of the months accelerated basis over their estimated useful lives 
the useful life of the new release dvds and back catalog dvds is estimated to be one year and three years  respectively 
in estimating the useful life of our dvds  we take into account library utilization as well as an estimate for lost or damaged dvds 

table of contents for those direct purchase dvds that we estimate we will sell at the end of their useful lives  a salvage value of per dvd has been provided 
for those dvds that we do not expect to sell  no salvage value is provided 
we periodically evaluate the useful lives and salvage values of our dvds 
we also obtain content distribution rights in order to stream movies and tv episodes without commercial interruption to subscribers 
we account for streaming content in accordance with sfas no 
 reporting by broadcasters sfas  which requires classification of streaming content as either a current or non current asset in the consolidated balance sheets based on the estimated time of usage after certain criteria have been met  including availability of the streaming content for its first showing 
we amortize our streaming content on a straight line basis generally over the term of the related license agreements or the title s window of availability 
cash outflows associated with the streaming content are classified as cash flows from operating activities on our consolidated statements of cash flows 
we also obtain dvd and streaming content through revenue sharing agreements with studios and distributors 
we generally obtain titles for low initial cost in exchange for a commitment to share a percentage of our subscription revenues or a fee  based on utilization  over a fixed period  or the title term  which typically ranges from six to twelve months for each title 
the initial cost may be in the form of an upfront non refundable payment 
this payment is capitalized in the content library in accordance with our dvd and streaming content policies as applicable 
the initial cost may also be in the form of a prepayment of future revenue sharing obligations which is classified as prepaid revenue sharing expense 
the terms of some revenue sharing agreements with studios obligate us to make minimum revenue sharing payments for certain titles 
we amortize minimum revenue sharing prepayments or accrete an amount payable to studios if the payment is due in arrears as revenue sharing obligations are incurred 
a provision for estimated shortfall  if any  on minimum revenue sharing payments is made in the period in which the shortfall becomes probable and can be reasonably estimated 
under the revenue sharing agreements for our dvd library  at the end of the title term  we generally have the option of returning the dvd to the studio  destroying the dvd or purchasing the dvd 
additionally  the terms of certain dvd direct purchase agreements with studios provide for volume purchase discounts or rebates based on achieving specified performance levels 
volume purchase discounts are recorded as a reduction of dvd library when earned 
we accrue for rebates as earned based on historical title performance and estimates of demand for the titles over the remainder of the title term 
stock based compensation we adopted the provisions of sfas no 
r  share based payment sfas r  on january  under the fair value recognition provisions of this statement  stock based compensation cost is estimated at the grant date based on the fair value of the awards expected to vest and is recognized as expense ratably over the requisite service period  which is the vesting period 
we changed our method of calculating the fair value of new stock based compensation awards under our stock plans from a black scholes model to a lattice binomial model on january  we continue to use a black scholes option model to determine the fair value of employee stock purchase plan shares 
the lattice binomial model has been applied prospectively to options granted subsequent to january  the lattice binomial model requires the input of highly subjective assumptions  including the option s price volatility of the underlying stock 
changes in the subjective input assumptions can materially affect the estimate of fair value of options granted and our results of operations could be materially impacted 
expected volatility our computation of expected volatility is based on a blend of historical volatility of our common stock and implied volatility of tradable forward call options to purchase shares of our common stock 
our decision to incorporate implied volatility was based on our assessment that implied volatility of publicly traded options in our common stock is more reflective of market conditions and  therefore  can reasonably be expected to be a better indicator of expected volatility than historical volatility of our common stock 

table of contents suboptimal exercise factor our computation of the suboptimal exercise factor is based on historical option exercise behavior and the terms and vesting periods of the options granted  and is determined for both executives and non executives 
we grant stock options to our employees on a monthly basis 
we have elected to grant all options as non qualified stock options which vest immediately 
as a result of immediate vesting  stock based compensation expense determined under sfas no 
r is fully recognized on the grant date and no estimate is required for post vesting option forfeitures 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for further information regarding sfas no 
r 
income taxes we record a tax provision for the anticipated tax consequences of our reported results of operations using the asset and liability method 
deferred income taxes are recognized by applying the enacted tax rates applicable to future years to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards 
the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date 
the measurement of deferred tax assets is reduced  if necessary  by a valuation allowance for any tax benefits for which future realization is uncertain 
as of december   our deferred tax asset balance was million 
as of december   our deferred tax asset balance was million 
there was no valuation allowance as of december  or during  we adopted the financial accounting standard board s fasb financial interpretation no 
fin  accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
fin 
fin changes the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes by creating a new framework for how companies should recognize  measure  present and disclose uncertain tax positions in their financial statements 
under fin  we may recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not the tax position will be sustained on examination by the taxing authorities  based on the technical merits of the position 
the tax benefits recognized in the financial statements from such positions are then measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than likelihood of being realized upon settlement 
we recognize interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions in income tax expense 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for further information regarding income taxes 
in evaluating our ability to recover our deferred tax assets  in full or in part  we consider all available positive and negative evidence  including our past operating results  and our forecast of future market growth  forecasted earnings  future taxable income and prudent and feasible tax planning strategies 
the assumptions utilized in determining future taxable income require significant judgment and are consistent with the plans and estimates we are using to manage the underlying businesses 
we believe that the deferred tax assets recorded on our balance sheet will ultimately be realized 
in the event we were to determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax assets in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax assets would be charged to earnings in the period in which we make such determination
