introduction this management s discussion and analysis  or md a  is provided in addition to the accompanying consolidated financial statements and footnotes to assist the reader in understanding our results of operations  financial condition and cash flows 
we have organized the md a as follows overview this section provides a summary of our business  our performance during the year ended december   our strategic initiatives and certain key risks that could cause our actual results to differ materially from the results that we expect 
results of operations this section provides a review of our results of operations for the years ended december   and liquidity and capital resources this section provides a summary of our financial condition  including our sources and uses of cash  capital resources  commitments and liquidity 
critical accounting policies and estimates this section describes our critical accounting policies and the significant judgments and estimates that we have made in preparing our consolidated financial statements 
overview we are a biopharmaceutical company headquartered in lexington  massachusetts  focused on the research  development and commercialization of pharmaceutical products that address unmet medical needs in the acute care environment 
such products are used primarily in hospitals but also may be used in acute care settings including home infusion and hospital outpatient clinics 
we have been profitable for ten consecutive quarters and had a total of million in cash and cash equivalents and long term investments as of december   as compared to million in cash and cash equivalents and long term investments as of december  our net income for the twelve months ended december   was million  or and per basic and diluted share  respectively 
our net income for the twelve months ended december   was million  or and per basic and diluted share  respectively 
our net income for the full year was significantly impacted by a tax benefit related to a reversal of our valuation allowance for a significant portion of our deferred tax assets  which resulted in a benefit to income tax expense of approximately million  and an other than temporary impairment charge of million related to our investment in auction rate securities 
since our inception  we incurred net losses in every fiscal period until the third quarter of as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of million 
cubicin 
we derive substantially all of our revenues from cubicin  which we developed and launched in the us in november and currently commercialize on our own in the us cubicin is currently the only marketed once daily  bactericidal  intravenous  or iv  antibiotic with activity against methicillin resistant s 
aureus  or mrsa 
cubicin is approved in the us for the treatment of complicated skin and skin structure infections  or csssi  caused by staphylococcus aureus  or s 
aureus  
table of contents and certain other gram positive bacteria  and for s 
aureus bloodstream infections bacteremia  including those with right sided infective endocarditis  or rie  caused by methicillin susceptible and methicillin resistant isolates 
in the european union  or eu  cubicin is approved for the treatment of complicated skin and soft tissue infections  or cssti  where the presence of susceptible gram positive bacteria is confirmed or suspected and for rie due to s 
aureus bacteremia and s 
aureus bacteremia associated with rie or cssti 
our net product revenues from worldwide product sales of cubicin for the twelve months ended december   were million  as compared to million for the twelve months ended december  we expect both net product sales of cubicin in the us and our revenues from cubicin sales outside the us to continue to increase due primarily to increased vial sales  market penetration into a large and growing market  and price increases 
future sales of cubicin are  to a large extent  dependent upon our ability to compete successfully with the products of current and future competitors  our ability to secure sufficient quantities of cubicin to meet demand and our ability to obtain  maintain and protect us and foreign patent protection for cubicin 
on february   we received a paragraph iv certification notice letter from teva parenteral medicines  inc  or teva  notifying us that it has submitted an abbreviated new drug application  or anda  to the us food and drug administration  or fda  for approval to market a generic version of cubicin 
teva s notice letter advised that it is seeking fda approval to market daptomycin for injection prior to the expiration of us patent nos 
 and  which expire on september   and us patent no 
re  which expires on june  each of these patents are listed in the fda s list of approved drug products with therapeutic equivalence evaluations  also known as the orange book 
the notice letter further stated that teva is asserting that claims in the referenced patents are not infringed and or invalid 
we plan to file a patent infringement lawsuit against teva in response to the anda filing 
by statute  if we initiate such a lawsuit against teva within days of receiving the notice letter  then the fda would be automatically precluded from approving teva s anda for months or such shorter or longer period as ordered by the court because either party failed to expedite the lawsuit  or until a district court decision finding the patents invalid or not infringed  whichever occurs earlier 
once the lawsuit is filed  the month stay period will begin as of february   the date we were notified of the filing 
we are confident in our intellectual property portfolio protecting cubicin  including the patents listed in the orange book 
it is possible that additional third parties may seek to market generic versions of cubicin in the us by filing an anda 
merrem iv in july  we entered into an exclusive agreement with astrazeneca pharmaceuticals  lp  or astrazeneca  to promote and provide other support in the us for merrem us  an established broad spectrum carbapenem class iv antibiotic 
under the agreement  we will promote and support merrem iv using our existing us acute care sales and medical affairs organizations 
astrazeneca will continue to provide marketing and commercial support for merrem iv we recognize revenues from this agreement as service revenues 
the agreement establishes a baseline annual payment by astrazeneca to us of million which was prorated for  to be adjusted up or down based on actual us sales of merrem us exceeding or falling short of an established annual baseline sales amount 
we recognize revenues related to this agreement over each annual period of performance based on the estimated minimum annual payment amount that we can receive under the agreement 
we assess the amount of revenue we recognize at the end of each quarterly period to reflect our actual performance against the annual baseline sales amount 
in  our sales of merrem iv in the iv exceeded the annual baseline sales amount 
our service revenues from merrem iv for the twelve months ended december   were million  which represents the annual payment earned by us in we are also entitled to earn a percentage of the gross profit on sales exceeding the annual baseline sales amount 
we will recognize the payment for any such sales over the baseline amount in the quarter in which astrazeneca provides us with its annual sales report 
the service revenues that we have recorded in do not reflect the percentage 
table of contents of gross profit that we expect to receive for sales exceeding target revenues 
we expect to recognize an additional million in service revenues from astrazeneca  which represents our percentage of the gross profit on the sales exceeding the annual baseline sales amount for we will record this additional revenue in our financial statements as service revenue in the quarter ending on march   during which time we expect to receive the annual sales report and payment from astrazeneca 
product pipeline 
we are building a pipeline of acute care therapies through licensing and collaboration agreements as well as by progressing compounds that we have developed into clinical development 
in april  we entered into a license and collaboration agreement with dyax corp  or dyax  pursuant to which we obtained an exclusive license for the development and commercialization of the iv formulation of dyax s ecallantide compound for the prevention of blood loss during surgery in north america and europe 
we initially are studying ecallantide as a potential treatment for the prevention of blood loss during on pump cardiothoracic surgery  or cts  which includes coronary artery bypass graft  or cabg  and heart valve and replacement procedures 
we recently have begun a phase dose ranging trial  assessing three different doses of ecallantide in cts patients at relatively low risk of bleeding  as well as a phase trial using the highest of these three doses in cts patients at higher risk of bleeding 
in october  we announced positive top line results from the ecallantide on pump cts phase clinical trial known as kalahari we terminated the kalahari trial in june prior to its completion in order to focus our resources on the design and initiation of a dose ranging phase clinical trial now underway 
we recently began this phase dose ranging trial  which we have named conserv  assessing three different doses of ecallantide  in cts patients at relatively low risk of bleeding 
we also expect soon to begin a phase trial  conserv  assessing a high dose in cts patients undergoing procedures associated with a higher risk of bleeding 
in january  we entered into a collaboration agreement with alnylam pharmaceuticals  inc  or alnylam  for the development and commercialization of alnylam s rna interference  or rnai  inhibitors as potential therapy for the treatment of respiratory syncytial virus  or rsv  infection  an area of high unmet medical need 
the rsv specific rnai therapeutic program includes aln rsv  which is currently in phase clinical development for the treatment of rsv infection in adult lung transplant patients  as well as several other potent and specific second generation rnai based rsv inhibitors in pre clinical studies 
in december  we submitted an investigational new drug application  or ind  with the fda for each of the following two drug candidates cb  in development as iv antibiotic therapy for multi drug resistant  or mdr  gram negative infections  and cb  in development as oral antibiotic therapy for clostridium difficile associated diarrhea  or cdad 
an ind is the filing stage preparatory to clinical trials 
in late january  we were notified by the fda that we could proceed to clinical trials for both candidates 
in february  we began dosing humans in phase clinical trials with cb  and cb  in addition  among our programs in preclinical evaluation is cb  a compound that we are studying as a potential therapy for the treatment of infections caused by the hepatitis c virus  or hcv 
we expect to decide by mid year if we will progress this program to ind filing

the increase in net product revenues is primarily due to an increase in us product revenues  net  which increased million  or 
the increase in us product revenues  net  is due to an increase in us gross product revenues  partially offset by an increase in allowances and reserves against product revenues 
gross us revenues from sales of cubicin totaled million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the increase in gross us revenues was primarily due to increased vial sales of cubicin in the us  which resulted in higher gross revenues of million  as well as an and a price increases for cubicin in january and october  respectively  which resulted in million of additional gross us revenues 
gross us product revenues are offset by million and million  for the years ended december  and  respectively  of allowances for sales returns  medicaid rebates  chargebacks  discounts and wholesaler management fees  an increase of million or 
the increase in allowances against gross product revenue was primarily driven by increases in chargebacks and pricing discounts due to increased us sales of cubicin  as well as the price increases described above 
international product revenues of million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively  consisted primarily of cubicin product sales to  and royalty payments based on cubicin net sales from  novartis 
we generally do not allow wholesalers to stock cubicin 
we have a drop ship program in place through which orders are processed through wholesalers  but shipments are sent directly to our end users 
this results in sales trends closely tracking actual hospital and out patient administration location purchases of our product 
we pay certain wholesalers various fees for data supply and administration services 
net product revenue is reduced by any such fees 
service revenues service revenues for the year ended december   were million versus zero for the year ended december  service revenues relate to our exclusive agreement with astrazeneca to promote and provide other support in the us for merrem us we began promoting merrem iv in the third quarter of our agreement with astrazeneca establishes a baseline annual payment to us of million which was prorated for  to be adjusted up or down based on actual us sales of merrem us exceeding or falling short of an established annual baseline sales amount 
we assess the amount of revenue that we recognize at the end of each quarterly period to 
table of contents reflect our actual performance against the annual baseline sales amount 
in  our sales of merrem iv in the iv exceeded the annual baseline sales amount 
we also earn a percentage of the gross profit earned by astrazeneca on sales exceeding the annual baseline sales amount 
the payment for any such sales over the baseline amount will be recorded in the quarter in which astrazeneca provides us with its annual sales report 
the service revenues that we have recorded in do not reflect the percentage of gross profit that we expect to receive for sales exceeding target revenues 
we currently expect these additional service revenues for sales to be approximately million  which will be recorded in our financial statements for the quarter ending on march   the time period in which we expect to receive the annual report and payment from astrazeneca 
other revenues other revenues for the year ended december   were million as compared to million for the year ended december  the decrease of million  or  is the result of a million payment received and recognized as incremental license fees within other revenues for the year ended december   as a result of regulatory approvals for an expanded cubicin label in the eu under our license agreement with novartis subsidiary 
this decrease is offset by i million relating to a full year of amortization in of license fees and other revenues received from astrazeneca ab  merck co  or merck  and tty biopharm  or tty  three of our international distribution partners for cubicin  versus a partial year of amortization of such fees in  and ii the amortization of milestone payments received during the year ended december   of million relating to achieving certain development milestones in costs and expenses the following table sets forth costs and expenses for the years ended december  and december  change in millions cost of product revenues research and development sales and marketing general and administrative total costs and expenses cost of product revenues cost of product revenues were million and million in the years ended december  and  respectively 
included in our cost of product revenues are royalties owed on net sales of cubicin under our license agreement with eli lilly  costs to procure  manufacture and distribute cubicin  and the amortization expense related to certain intangible assets 
to the extent that we incur incremental costs related to service revenues  these amounts would also be included in the cost of product revenues 
our gross margin for the year ended december   was as compared to for the year ended december  the increase in our gross margin is primarily due to an and a cubicin price increase in the us in january and october  respectively  which positively impacted gross margin by approximately 
this increase was partially offset by million in additional royalties owed to eli lilly on net sales of cubicin due to higher cubicin sales  which negatively impacted our gross margin by approximately 

table of contents we expect our gross margin in to be similar to our gross margin in as our production volumes increase  there is the potential for our gross margin to increase as we work to develop manufacturing process improvements 
however  as our sales volume increases  the royalties we owe to eli lilly on net sales of cubicin will also increase 
whether we can increase our gross margin and the extent to which we can do so are uncertain 
research and development expense total research and development expense in the year ended december   was million as compared to million in the year ended december   an increase of million or 
the increase in research and development expenses was due primarily to i an increase of million in clinical and non clinical studies due to the higher number of studies underway  ii an increase of million in the cost of material to advance our programs currently under development and to test and improve our current manufacturing processes  iii an increase of million in laboratory supplies and services also due to the increased number of studies underway  iv an increase of million in payroll  benefits  travel and other employee related expenses due to an increase in headcount  v an increase of million in facilities expense related to additional laboratory space  vi an increase of million in license and collaboration expenses primarily due to million of upfront and milestone payments related to the dyax license and collaboration agreement which we entered into in april  compared to the year ended december   which included million of in process research and development expense  or ipr d  related to the illumigen biosciences  inc acquisition in december  vii a one time charge of million in expense related to the write off of property that was demolished at our main building at hayden avenue in lexington  massachusetts  to support the build out of the new laboratory space  and viii an increase of million in depreciation expense 
we expect research and development expenses to continue to increase in primarily due to increases in expenditures related to i phase and phase clinical trials for cubicin  ii clinical testing of ecallantide  aln rsv  our gram negative and cdad programs  iii pre clinical testing of the other compounds included in our collaboration with alnylam and our hcv preclinical compound  iv regulatory matters  and v medical affairs activities 
sales and marketing expense sales and marketing expense in the year ended december   was million as compared to million in the year ended december   an increase of million or 
the increase in sales and marketing expense is primarily related to i an increase of million in payroll including incentive compensation  benefits  travel  and other employee related expenses  due to the hiring of additional field sales personnel in the first quarter of  and ii an increase of million in professional services expense 
we expect our sales and marketing expense in to be similar to our sales and marketing expense in general and administrative expense general and administrative expense in the year ended december   was million as compared to million in the year ended december   an increase of million or 
this increase is primarily due to i an increase of million in payroll  benefits  travel and other employee related expenses due to an increase in headcount  ii an increase of million in rent expense due to the leasing of additional space at and hayden avenue in lexington  massachusetts  iii an increase of million in professional services due to an increase in consulting and legal expenses  iv an increase of million in depreciation and amortization expense  and v a one time charge of million in facilities expense due to the write off of property being demolished at hayden avenue in lexington  massachusetts  to support the build out of new laboratory space 

table of contents we expect general and administrative expense in to increase primarily due to i the legal costs associated with reviewing the paragraph iv certification notice letter that we received from teva in february  and the patent infringement litigation that we intend to file against teva  and ii an increase in salaries and benefits due to the addition of headcount both in and other income expense  net the following table sets forth other income expense  net for the years ended december  and december  change in millions interest income interest expense other income expense n a total other income expense  net interest income and expense interest income in the year ended december   was million as compared to million in the year ended december   a decrease of million or

the decrease in interest expense is due to a lower debt balance in the year ended december   as a result of the repurchase of million of our convertible subordinated notes due june  or the notes  in february  offset by the write off of approximately million of debt issuance costs related to the repurchase of the notes 
we expect that annual interest expense in will increase by approximately million  which will be a non cash charge  as a result of our adoption of financial accounting standards board  or fasb  staff position no 
apb  accounting for convertible debt instruments that may be settled in cash upon conversion including partial cash settlement 
other income expense for the year ended december   was a loss of million  and primarily consists of the write off of million of our investment in auction rate securities that we determined to be other than temporarily impaired 
more information can be found in the liquidity and capital resources section below 
this loss was offset by a million gross gain resulting from the difference between the purchase price and face value of the million of our notes that we repurchased in february provision for income taxes our effective tax rates for the years ended december  and  were and  respectively 
the effective tax rate for the years ended december  and  relates to federal alternative minimum tax expense and state tax expense and for is offset by the tax benefit relating to the reversal of the valuation allowance for a significant portion of our deferred tax assets 
cubist and its subsidiaries file income tax returns with the us federal government and with multiple state and local jurisdictions in the us prior to the fourth quarter  all of our deferred tax assets had a full valuation allowance recorded against them 
based on our historical tax position and operational results  the realization of these deferred tax assets did not meet the more likely than not standard 
table of contents under statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for income taxes  or sfas in the fourth quarter of  upon reviewing factors such as consistent profitability  our ability to utilize net operating loss carryforwards and forecasts of future profitability  we determined that there was sufficient positive evidence that it was more likely than not that we would be able to realize a significant portion of our deferred tax assets 
as a result  we determined that a full valuation allowance on these assets was no longer required 
we recorded a tax benefit of million during the year ended december   as a result of the reversal of a significant portion of the valuation allowance  which resulted in a net income tax benefit of million as compared to a provision of million for the year ended december  beginning in  we expect to record a provision equal to our statutory federal tax rate  adjusted for permanent differences such as research and development credits  state taxes and other related items 
we expect our tax rate to be approximately for the year ended december   which is comprised of the federal statutory income tax rate of and a state income tax rate of  net of federal benefit  before giving effect to income tax credits  if any  and other adjustments

interest expense in the year ended december   was million as compared to million in the year ended december   a decrease million or 
the decrease in interest expense is primarily due to the early repayment of our million aggregate principal amount of our notes 
we used a portion of the proceeds from our notes to repay the principal and outstanding interest of the million aggregate principal amount of notes 
this early prepayment in resulted in one time charges to interest expense of the prepayment penalty of million as well as the write off of the remaining unamortized balance of related debt issuance costs of million 
provision for income taxes our effective tax rates for the years ended december  and  were and  respectively 
the effective tax rate for the year ended december   relates to federal alternative minimum tax expense and state tax expense

table of contents liquidity and capital resources currently  we require cash to fund our working capital needs  to purchase capital assets  and to pay our debt service  including principal and interest 
we fund our cash requirements through the following methods sales of cubicin in the us  payments from astrazeneca for our promotion of merrem iv in the u 
s  payments from our strategic collaborators and international cubicin partners  including payments related to product sales  license fees  royalty and milestone payments and sponsored research funding  equity and debt financings  and interest earned on invested capital 
we incurred net losses from our inception through the third quarter of as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of million 
we expect to incur significant expenses in the future for the continued development and commercialization of cubicin  the development of our other drug candidates  as well as investments in other product opportunities and to enforce our intellectual property rights 
our total cash  cash equivalents and long term investments at december   was million as compared to million at december  based on our current business plan  we believe that our available cash  cash equivalents and projected cash flows from revenues will be sufficient to fund our operating expenses  debt obligation and capital requirements for the foreseeable future 
certain economic or strategic factors may require that we seek to raise additional cash by selling debt or equity securities 
however  such funds may not be available when needed or we may not be able to obtain funding on favorable terms  or at all  particularly if the credit and financial markets continue to be distressed 
operating activities net cash provided by operating activities was million in  compared to million in  an increase of million 
the million increase in net cash provided by operating activities is related to a million increase in net income  net of adjustments for non cash items  offset by a million decrease in net cash provided by working capital  which primarily consists of i an increase of million related to the increase in accounts payable and accrued expenses  primarily as a result of the timing of royalties paid to eli lilly on sales of cubicin  ii a decrease of million related to the increase in accounts receivable resulting from increased sales of cubicin  iii a decrease of million related to an increase in prepaid and other current assets primarily as a result of amounts receivable under our agreement with astrazeneca  and iv a decrease of million related to changes in deferred revenue primarily resulting from the receipt of million in payments from merck and astrazeneca ab relating to the achievement of certain development milestones in  compared to the receipt of a million upfront payment from merck in investing activities net cash used in investing activities in was million  compared to million provided by investing activities in and million used in investing activities in cash used in investing activities in consisted of the payment of million of closing cash consideration to

purchases of property and equipment during the year ended december   were million and include million of assets related to the construction of approximately  square feet of additional laboratory space at our main building at hayden avenue in lexington  massachusetts  as well as approximately million of assets related to building out additional leased space at the and hayden avenue building in lexington  massachusetts 
the remaining property and equipment additions during consisted of expenses related to lab equipment and computer software 
cash provided by investing activities in consisted of a net cash inflow of million related to maturities and purchases of securities  as well as cash outflows from purchases of property and equipment of million  and million for the acquisition of illumigen  net of cash acquired 
cash used in investing activities in includes a net cash outflow of million related to purchases and maturities of securities  as well as cash outflows for purchases of property and equipment of million 
net cash used in investing activities may fluctuate significantly from period to period due to the timing of our capital expenditures and other investments 
we anticipate that our capital expenditures for will total approximately million  primarily driven by additional purchases of laboratory equipment 
financing activities net cash of million was used in financing activities in the year ended december   as compared to million and million provided by financing activities in the years ended december  and cash used in financing activities in primarily consisted of million of cash used to repurchase million of our notes  offset by million of cash received from employees exercise of stock options and purchases of common stock through our employee stock purchase plan 
cash provided by financing activities in primarily consisted of million of cash received from employees exercise of stock options and purchases of common stock through our employee stock purchase plan 
cash provided by financing activities in primarily consisted of net proceeds of million from our public offering of our notes as well as million from employees exercise of stock options and purchases of common stock through our employee stock purchase plan 
these proceeds were offset by the early repayment of our million aggregate principal amount of notes with an original maturity date of november long term investments at december  and  we held auction rate securities with an original par value of million  all of which mature in these auction rate securities  which consist of private placement  synthetic collateralized debt obligations  are classified as available for sale and carried at fair market value 
due to repeated failed auctions since august  we no longer consider these securities to be liquid and have therefore classified them as long term investments for the years ended december  and a severe decline in and continued deterioration of the financial markets have impacted the fair value of our auction rate securities 
as of december   we estimate the fair value of the auction rate securities to be million 
during the fourth quarter of  we recorded an other than temporary impairment charge of million on these securities based on our assessment that it is unlikely that the fair value of the auction rate securities will fully recover in the foreseeable future 
in making the determination that the decline in fair value was other than temporary  we considered various factors  including but not limited to the severity of the decline in fair value  the duration of the failed auctions  the continued instability in the financial markets  the negative outlook for this type of security  the lack of a trading market for the auction rate securities  further deterioration in the auction rate securities credit ratings and the increased probability of default 
in addition  we cannot foresee any liquidity in the auction rate securities marketplace that would allow us to liquidate our auction rate securities position in the near 
table of contents future 
the estimated fair value of the auction rate securities could change significantly based on future financial market conditions 
we will continue to monitor the securities and the financial markets  and if there is continued deterioration  the fair value of these securities could decline further resulting in additional other than temporary impairment charges 
any recovery of the fair market value would not be recognized in our financial statements until the gain is realized upon sale of the auction rate securities 
the million other than temporary impairment charge does not have a material impact on our liquidity or our financial flexibility and stability 
based on our ability to access our cash  our bank line of credit  our expected operating cash flows  and other sources of cash  we do not anticipate the lack of liquidity on these investments will affect our ability to execute our current business plan 
credit facility in december  we entered into a million revolving credit facility with rbs citizens  national association  or rbs citizens  for general corporate purposes 
under the revolving credit facility  we may request to borrow at any time a minimum of million 
the facility will be secured by the pledge of a certificate of deposit issued by rbs citizens and or an rbs citizens money market account equal to an aggregate of of the outstanding principal amount of the loans  so long as such loans are outstanding 
interest on the borrowings can be calculated  at our option  based on libor plus a margin or the prime rate 
any borrowings under the facility are due on demand or upon termination of the revolving credit agreement 
there were no outstanding borrowings under the credit facility as of december  repurchases of common stock or convertible subordinated notes outstanding from time to time  our board of directors may consider authorizing us to repurchase shares of our common stock or our outstanding convertible subordinated notes in privately negotiated transactions  or publicly announced programs 
if and when our board of directors should determine to authorize any such action  it would be on terms and under market conditions the board of directors determines are in the best interest of our company 
any such repurchases could deplete some of our cash resources 
business agreements we have committed to make potential future milestone payments to third parties as part of our various business agreements  including license  collaboration and commercialization agreements 
payments under these agreements typically become due and payable only upon achievement of certain development  regulatory  or commercial milestones 
additional information regarding these business agreements can be found in note c 
in the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements 
contractual obligations contractual obligations represent future cash commitments and liabilities under agreements with third parties and exclude contingent liabilities  such as royalties on future sales above the contractual minimums or known accrued royalty balance  for which we cannot reasonably predict future payment 
reserves for unrecognized tax benefits of million have also been excluded from the table below due to the inability to predict the timing of tax audit resolutions 
the following summarizes our 
table of contents significant contractual obligations at december   and the effects such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flows in future periods 
payments due by period year or less years years more than years total in millions subordinated convertible notes interest on subordinated convertible notes operating leases  net of sublease income inventory purchase obligations royalty payments due upfront payment due to alnylam capital purchase obligations other purchase obligations total contractual cash obligations the subordinated convertible notes consist of a remaining million aggregate principal amount of our notes  due in june these notes require semi annual interest payments through maturity 
in february  we repurchased million of the original principal amount of the notes 
more information can be found in note k 
in the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements 
our operating leases consist of approximately  square feet of office and data center space at and hayden avenue in lexington  massachusetts  pursuant to a term lease that expires in september  for approximately  square feet and april  for approximately  square feet as well as  square feet of commercial space at sidney street in cambridge  massachusetts  pursuant to a term lease that expires in december we have subleased the space located at sidney street through october the inventory purchase obligations listed above represent minimum volumes that we are required to purchase from our contract manufacturers 
the royalty payments listed above represent amounts expected to be owed to eli lilly on sales of cubicin product 
the upfront payment to alnylam represents the payment due upon signing our collaboration agreement with alnylam for the development and commercialization of alnylam s rnai therapeutics as potential therapy for the treatment of rsv infection 
this payment was made in january  and will be included in research and development expense for the three months ending march  the capital purchase obligations listed above represent capital purchase commitments related to construction at our main building in hayden avenue in lexington  massachusetts 
the other purchase obligations listed above primarily represent expected future payments for clinical trial expenses  as well as payments pursuant to collaboration agreements 
critical accounting policies and estimates we prepare our consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
we are required to make certain estimates  judgments and assumptions that affect certain reported amounts and disclosures  actual amounts may differ 
we believe that the following critical accounting policies affect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements revenue recognition  
table of contents inventories  accrued clinical research costs  investments  long lived assets  income taxes  and stock based compensation 
i 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue in accordance with sec staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition  and emerging issues task force  or eitf  issue no 
 revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables  or eitf our principal sources of revenue are sales of cubicin in the us  revenues derived from sales of cubicin by our international distribution partners  license fees and milestone payments that are derived from collaboration  license and distribution agreements with other pharmaceutical and biopharmaceutical companies  and service revenues derived from our promotion and support of merrem iv in all instances  revenue is recognized only when the price is fixed or determinable  persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  collectibility of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured and cubist has no further performance obligations 
us product revenues  net all revenues from product sales are recorded net of applicable provisions for returns  chargebacks  discounts  wholesaler management fees and rebates in the same period the related sales are recorded 
we generally do not allow wholesalers to stock cubicin 
instead  we maintain a drop ship program under which orders are processed through wholesalers  but shipments are sent directly to our end users  who are generally hospitals and acute care settings 
this results in sales trends closely tracking actual hospital and acute care settings purchases of our product  and also prevents unusual purchasing patterns since it closely tracks end user demand 
we maintain a return policy that allows our customers to return product within a specified period prior to and subsequent to the expiration date 
our estimate of the provision for returns is analyzed quarterly and is based upon many factors  including industry data of product return rates  historical experience of actual returns  analysis of the level of inventory in the distribution channel  if any  and reorder rates of end users 
if the history of our product returns changes  the reserve will be adjusted 
if we discontinue the drop ship program and allow wholesalers to stock cubicin  our net product sales may be impacted by the timing of wholesaler inventory stocking and activity and provisions for returns which will be based on estimated product in the distribution channel that may not sell through to end users 
we analyze our estimates and assumptions for chargebacks and medicaid rebate reserves quarterly 
our medicaid and chargeback reserves have two components i an estimate of outstanding claims for known end user rebate eligible sales that have occurred  but for which related claim submissions have not been received  and ii an estimate of chargebacks and medicaid rebates based on an analysis of customer sales mix data to determine which sales may flow through to a rebate or chargeback eligible customer 
because the second component is calculated based on the amount of inventory in the distribution channel  if any  our assessment of distribution channel inventory levels impacts our estimated reserve requirements 
we accrue for the expected liability at the time we record the sale  however  the time lag between sale and payment of rebate can be lengthy 
due to the time lag  in any particular period our rebate adjustments may incorporate revisions of accruals for several periods 

table of contents reserves for medicaid rebate programs are included in accrued liabilities and were million and million at december  and  respectively 
reserves for returns  discounts  chargebacks and wholesaler management fees are offset against accounts receivable and were million and million at december  and  respectively 
in the years ended december   and  provisions for sales returns  chargebacks  rebates  wholesaler management fees and discounts that were offset against product revenues totaled million  million and million  respectively 
we believe that the reserves we have established are reasonable and appropriate based upon current facts and circumstances 
applying different judgments to the same facts and circumstances would result in the estimated amounts for sales returns  chargebacks and medicaid rebate reserves to vary 
however  due to the drop ship model in which we currently operate  the low level of actual product returns and chargebacks and medicaid rebate claims experienced to date  we do not expect that the differences would be material 
international product revenues under agreements with international distribution partners  we sell our product to international distribution partners based upon a transfer price arrangement 
the transfer price is generally established annually 
once our distribution partner sells the product to a third party  we may be owed an additional payment or royalty based on a percentage of the net selling price to the third party  less the initial transfer price previously paid on such product 
under no circumstances would the subsequent adjustment result in a refund to the distribution partner of the initial transfer price 
service revenues we promote and provide other support for merrem iv in the us under our commercial services agreement with astrazeneca 
the agreement includes a baseline annual payment to us to be adjusted up or down based on actual sales 
we recognize revenues related to this agreement over each annual period of performance based on the estimated minimum annual payment amount that we can receive under the agreement 
the amount of revenue recognized is assessed at the end of each quarterly period to reflect actual performance against the annual baseline sales amount 
we also earn a percentage of the gross profit on sales exceeding the annual baseline sales amount 
the payment for any such sales will be recognized upon our receipt of an annual report from astrazeneca  which is expected to be received annually one quarter in arrears 
other revenues other revenues include revenue related to upfront license payments and milestone payments received through our license  collaboration and commercialization agreements 
we analyze our multiple element arrangements to determine whether the elements can be separated and accounted for individually as separate units of accounting in accordance with eitf license revenues non refundable license fees are recognized depending on the provisions of each agreement 
we recognize non refundable up front license payments as revenue upon receipt if the license has standalone value and the fair value of the undelivered items can be determined 
if the license is considered to have standalone value but the fair value on any of the undelivered items cannot be determined  the license payments are recognized as revenue over the period of performance for such undelivered items or services 
license fees with ongoing involvement or performance obligations are recorded as deferred revenue once received and are generally recognized ratably over the period of such performance obligation only after both the license period has commenced and the technology has 
table of contents been delivered 
our assessment of our obligations and related performance periods requires significant management judgment 
if an agreement contains product development services  the relevant time period for the product development phase is based on management estimates and could vary depending on the outcome of clinical trials and the regulatory approval process 
such changes could materially impact the revenue recognized  and  as a result  management reviews the estimates related to the relevant time period of product development quarterly 
milestones revenues from milestone payments related to arrangements under which we have continuing performance obligations are recognized as revenue upon achievement of the milestone only if all of the following conditions are met the milestone payments are non refundable  achievement of the milestone was not reasonably assured at the inception of the arrangement  substantive effort is involved in achieving the milestone  and the amount of the milestone is reasonable in relation to the effort expended or the risk associated with the achievement of the milestone 
if any of these conditions are not met  the milestone payments are deferred and recognized as revenue over the term of the arrangement as we complete our performance obligations 
contingent payments under license agreements that do not involve substantial effort on our part are not considered substantive milestones 
such payments are recognized as revenue when the contingency is met only if there are no remaining performance obligations or any remaining performance obligations are priced at fair value 
otherwise  the contingent payment is recognized as we complete our performance obligations under the arrangement 
ii 
inventories inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market with cost determined under the first in  first out  or fifo  basis 
included in the cost of inventories are employee stock based compensation costs capitalized under sfas no 
r  share based payment  or sfas r 
on a quarterly basis  we analyze our inventory levels  and write down inventory that is expected to expire prior to being sold  inventory that has a cost basis in excess of its expected net realizable value  inventory in excess of expected sales requirements  or inventory that fails to meet commercial sale specifications through a charge to cost of product revenues 
expired inventory is disposed of and the related costs are written off to cost of product revenues 
charges for inventory write downs are not reversed if it is later determined that the product is saleable 
therefore  any such inventory would be sold at significantly higher margin 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional inventory write downs may be required 
iii 
accrued clinical research costs we utilize external entities such as cros  independent clinical investigators  and other third party service providers to assist us with the execution of our clinical studies 
we record costs for clinical study activities based upon the estimated amount of services provided but not yet invoiced for each study  and include these costs in accrued liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets and within research and development expense in our consolidated statements of operations 
contracts and studies vary significantly in length  and are generally composed of a fixed management fee  variable indirect reimbursable costs that have a dollar limit cap  and amounts owed on a per patient enrollment basis 
we monitor the activity levels and patient enrollment levels of the studies to the extent possible through communication with the service providers  detailed invoice and task completion review  analysis of actual expenses against budget  pre approval of any changes in scope  and review of contractual terms 
these estimates may or may not match the actual services performed by the service providers as determined by actual patient enrollment levels and other variable activity costs 
clinical trial expenses totaled million  million and million for the years ended december   and 
table of contents  respectively 
the level of clinical study expense may vary from period to period based on the number of studies that are in process  the duration of the study  the required level of patient enrollment  and the number of sites involved in the study 
clinical trials that bear the greatest risk of change in estimates are typically those with a significant number of sites  require a large number of patients  have complex patient screening requirements and that span multiple years 
if we receive incomplete or inaccurate information from our third party service providers  we may under or over estimate activity levels associated with various studies at a given point in time 
in this event  we could record adjustments to prior period accruals that increase or reverse research and development expenses in future periods when the actual activity level becomes known 
on january   we adopted eitf issue no 
 accounting for nonrefundable advance payments for goods or services received for use in future research and development activities  or eitf  using a prospective method 
pursuant to eitf  we defer and capitalize nonrefundable advance payments made by us for research and development activities  including clinical research activities  until the related goods are delivered or the related services are performed 
the adoption of eitf did not have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements upon the adoption 
iv 
investments our investments consist of auction rate securities  which are private placement  synthetic collateralized debt obligations that mature in the auction rate securities have long term nominal maturities of approximately nine years for which the interest rates are reset at intervals of less than days 
these investments are accounted for and reviewed for impairment in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities  and related guidance issued by the fasb and the sec 
accordingly  our investments are classified as available for sale and are carried at fair market value 
the appropriateness of all investment classifications is reviewed at each financial reporting date 
as of december  and  we held auction rate securities with an original cost of million 
these securities are classified as long term investments as we no longer consider them liquid given the repeated failed auctions occurring since august a severe decline in and continued deterioration of the financial markets have significantly impacted the fair market value of our investment in auction rate securities 
we estimate the fair value of the auction rate securities to be million and million as of december  and  respectively 
in accordance with sfas no 
 fair value measurements  or sfas  we have classified our financial assets and liabilities as level  or within the fair value hierarchy 
fair values determined by level inputs utilize quoted prices unadjusted in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that we have the ability to access 
fair values determined by level inputs utilize data points that are observable such as quoted prices  interest rates and yield curves for similar assets or liabilities 
fair values determined by level inputs utilize unobservable data points for the asset or liability 
the fair value of the auction rate securities was determined using level inputs  and was based on a third party valuation model  market bids received from the issuer of the securities  combined with management s assessment of the factors that market participants would use to value these securities 
due to the fact that there is no active market for auction rate securities  we utilized other sources of information in order to develop our fair value estimates 
given the complex structure of the auction rate securities  we engaged houlihan smith company inc  or houlihan smith  to assist us with our valuation 
we used both the third party valuation model from houlihan smith and market bids received from deutsche bank ag  or db  the issuer and sole market maker for all five of our auction rate securities 
we weighted these sources equally when developing the final fair value  given our conclusion that both data points have equal relevance in estimating fair value 

table of contents the first data point used  houlihan smith s valuation model and their resulting fair value assessment  incorporates the structure of each auction rate security  the entity reference pool of credit default swap  or cds  spreads per security  the collateral underlying the securities  the cash flow characteristics of the securities and the current trading environment of such securities 
this third party valuation considers various components of risk  including market based bond and cds pricing and corresponding assessment of default risk and recovery expectations 
the valuation process results in an assessment of the fair value an investor would expect to pay for a similar risk profiled portfolio 
we validated the underlying assumptions used in the model  including but not limited to bond default rates  bond recovery rates  credit ratings  cash flow streams  and discount rates 
the model incorporates market data and cds prices as of december  the houlihan smith valuation model includes the following ranges for key assumptions as of december  cds spreads of to basis points and recovery rates on the auction rate securities between and 
the second data point used to calculate fair value are actual market bids from db 
although we receive indicative bids from db  and we have no knowledge of any of the auction rate securities being traded at these prices  we have considered these bids as a relevant data point given db s role as the sole market maker for these securities 
our investment in auction rate securities are the only assets measured using level inputs as of december   and represents approximately of the total financial assets measured at fair value in accordance with sfas during the fourth quarter of  we recorded an other than temporary impairment charge of million on these securities based on our assessment that it is unlikely that the fair value of the auction rate securities will fully recover in the foreseeable future 
in addition  we cannot foresee any liquidity in the auction rate securities marketplace that would allow us to liquidate our auction rate securities position in the near future 
the other than temporary impairment charge of million was recorded as other income expense from continuing operations for the year ended december   and includes the reclassification of an unrealized loss of million relating to these securities included in accumulated other comprehensive loss on our consolidated balance sheet as of december  this loss was reclassified to other income expense in the fourth quarter of upon the determination that the loss was other than temporary 
in making the determination that the decline in fair value was other than temporary  we considered various factors  including but not limited to the severity of the decline in fair value  the duration of the failed auctions  the continued instability in the financial markets  the negative outlook for this type of security  the lack of a trading market for the auction rate securities  further deterioration in the auction rate securities credit ratings and the increased probability of default 
the estimated fair value of the auction rate securities could change significantly based on future financial market conditions 
consistent with our investment policy guidelines  all five of the auction rate securities we hold had aaa credit ratings at the time of purchase 
during the fourth quarter of  all five auction rate securities we hold were downgraded by standard poor s and one security experienced an additional downgrade in february  with the lowest rating now at bbb 
additionally  during the fourth quarter of  fitch ratings downgraded three of the securities with the lowest of the five ratings now at bb  below investment grade 
the underlying risk components of the auction rate securities are pools of cdss  collateral notes and exposure to the security issuer 
there is no underlying exposure to any mortgage backed securities 
the credit ratings on the underlying reference entities range from aaa to d 
the riskiness of each underlying component of the auction rate securities was assessed and factored into the fair value of the securities 
the credit and capital markets deteriorated significantly during and the future outlook is uncertain 
we will continue to monitor the securities and the financial markets  and if there is continued deterioration  the fair value of these securities could decline further resulting in additional other than temporary impairment charges 
any recovery of the fair market value would not be recognized in our financial statements 
table of contents until the gain is realized upon sale of the securities 
in evaluating the fair value information  considerable judgment is required to interpret the market data used to develop the estimates 
the use of different market assumptions and or different valuation techniques may have a material effect on the estimated fair value amounts 
v 
long lived assets our long lived assets include property and equipment and other intangible assets 
in the ordinary course of our business  we incur substantial costs to purchase and construct property  plant and equipment 
the treatment of costs to purchase or construct these assets depends on the nature of the costs and the stage of construction 
we generally depreciate plant and equipment using the straight line method over the asset s estimated economic life  which ranges from years to years 
determining the economic lives of plant and equipment requires us to make significant judgments that can materially impact our operating results 
property and equipment primarily consists of our corporate headquarters building located at hayden avenue in lexington  massachusetts 
as of december   there were approximately million of net other intangible assets on our consolidated balance sheet  which consisted of patents  intellectual property  acquired technology rights  manufacturing rights  and other intangibles 
we amortize our intangible assets using the straight line method over their estimated economic lives  which range from four years to years 
determining the economic lives of intangible assets requires us to make significant judgment and estimates  and can materially impact our operating results 
property and equipment and intangible assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable 
judgments regarding the existence of impairment indicators are based on historical and projected future operating results  changes in the manner of use of the acquired assets  overall business strategy  and market and economic trends 
future events could cause management to conclude that impairment indicators exist and that certain long lived assets are impaired 
vi 
income taxes we record deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the net tax effects of tax credits  operating loss carryforwards  and temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes 
we then assess the likelihood that deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and  to the extent that we determine that recovery is not likely  a valuation allowance is established 
the valuation allowance is based on estimates of taxable income by jurisdiction in which we operate and the period over which deferred tax assets will be recoverable 
prior to the fourth quarter of the year ended december   all of our deferred tax assets had a full valuation allowance recorded against them 
until that time  we determined that based on our historical tax position and operational results  realization of our deferred tax assets did not meet the more likely than not standard under sfas in the fourth quarter of  upon reviewing factors such as achieving consistent profitability  our ability to utilize net operating loss carryforwards and forecasts of future profitability  we determined that there was sufficient positive evidence that it was more likely than not that we would be able to realize a significant portion of our deferred tax assets 
as a result  we determined that a full valuation allowance on these assets was no longer required and we reversed a significant portion of the valuation allowance  which resulted in a tax benefit of million during the year ended december  vii 
stock based compensation effective january   our accounting policy related to stock option accounting changed upon our adoption of sfas r 
sfas r requires us to expense the fair value of employee stock 
table of contents options and other forms of stock based compensation 
under the fair value recognition provisions of sfas r  stock based compensation cost is estimated at the grant date based on the value of the award and is recognized as expense ratably over the requisite service period of the award generally the vesting period of the equity award 
determining the appropriate fair value model and calculating the fair value of stock based awards requires judgment  including estimating the expected life of the stock based award  the expected stock price volatility over the expected life of the stock based award and forfeiture rates 
the fair value of each stock based award is expensed under the accelerated method for option grants prior to the first quarter of and under the straight line method for option grants commencing in the first quarter of in order to determine the fair value of stock based awards on the date of grant  we use the black scholes option pricing model 
inherent in this model are assumptions related to expected stock price volatility  estimated option life  risk free interest rate and dividend yield 
the risk free interest rate is a less subjective assumption as it is based on factual data derived from public sources 
we use a dividend yield of zero as we have never paid cash dividends and have no intention to pay cash dividends in the foreseeable future 
the expected stock price volatility and option life assumptions require a greater level of judgment  which makes them critical accounting estimates 
estimating forfeitures also requires significant judgment 
our expected stock price volatility assumption is based on both current and historical volatilities of our stock  which are obtained from public data sources 
the expected life represents the weighted average period of time that stock based awards are expected to be outstanding giving consideration to vesting schedules and our historical exercise patterns 
we determine the expected life assumption based on the exercise behavior and post vesting behavior that has been exhibited historically  adjusted for specific factors that may influence future exercise patterns 
we estimate forfeitures based on our historical experience of stock based pre vesting cancellations 
we believe that our estimates are based on outcomes that are reasonably likely to occur 
to the extent actual forfeitures differ from our estimates  such amounts will be recorded as a cumulative adjustment in the period estimates are revised 
during the years ended december   and  we incurred compensation cost under sfas r of million  million and million  respectively 
recent accounting pronouncements effective january   we implemented sfas for our financial assets and liabilities that are re measured and reported at fair value at each reporting period  and non financial assets and liabilities that are re measured and reported at fair value at least annually 
in accordance with the provisions of fasb staff position no 
 effective date of fasb statement no 
 or fsp fas  we deferred the implementation of sfas as it relates to our non financial assets and non financial liabilities that are recognized and disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a nonrecurring basis until january  we do not expect that the adoption of fsp fas will have a material impact on our results of operations or financial condition 
in november  the fasb issued eitf issue no 
 accounting for defensive intangible assets  or eitf eitf seeks to clarify how to account for defensive intangible assets  or those intangible assets acquired in a business combination that an entity does not intend to actively use but does intend to prevent others from using  subsequent to initial measurement 
eitf is effective for all intangible assets acquired during the first fiscal year beginning on or after december  early adoption is not permitted 
the impact of the adoption of eitf will be dependent upon the type and structure of any acquisition that we may make in the future 
in june  the fasb issued fasb staff position no 
eitf  determining whether instruments granted in share based payment transactions are participating securities  or fsp eitf fsp eitf addresses whether instruments granted in share based payment 
table of contents transactions are participating securities prior to vesting and  therefore need to be included in the earnings allocation in computing earnings per share  or eps  under the two class method described in paragraphs and of fasb statement no 
 earnings per share  or sfas fsp eitf applies to the calculation of eps under sfas for share based payment awards with rights to dividends or dividend equivalents 
fsp eitf clarifies that unvested share based payment awards that contain nonforfeitable rights to dividends or dividend equivalents whether paid or unpaid are participating securities and must be included in the computation of eps pursuant to the two class method 
fsp eitf is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after december   and interim periods within those years 
all prior period eps data presented must be adjusted retrospectively including interim financial statements  summaries of earnings and selected financial data to conform with the provisions of fsp eitf early adoption is not permitted 
we do not expect that the adoption of eitf will have a material impact on our results of operations or financial condition

sfas is effective days following the sec s approval of the public company accounting oversight board amendments to au section  the meaning of present fairly in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles 
we do not expect that the adoption of sfas will have a material impact on our results of operations or financial condition 
in may  the fasb issued fasb staff position no 
apb  accounting for convertible debt instruments that may be settled in cash upon conversion including partial cash settlement  or fsp apb fsp apb requires the issuers of certain convertible debt instruments that may be settled in cash upon conversion to separately account for the liability debt and equity conversion option components in a manner that reflects the issuer s non convertible debt borrowing rate when interest cost is recognized in subsequent periods 
fsp abp is effective for cubist beginning january  prior periods will be restated as if the new rule had been in effect in prior periods 
early adoption is not permitted 
while our cash payments for interest will not be affected  based on current debt outstanding  the adoption of fsp apb will increase our reported interest expense in a manner that reflects interest rates of similar non convertible debt 
we expect that annual interest expense will increase by approximately million  which will be a non cash charge  for the year ending december   as a result of adoption 
fsp apb requires retrospective application 
as a result  interest expense for the years ended december  and  will be restated in future filings to include additional  non cash interest expense of million and million  respectively 
in april  the fasb issued fasb staff position no

fsp fas is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after december   and interim periods within those fiscal years 
early adoption is not permitted 
fsp fas must be applied prospectively to intangible assets acquired after the effective date 
we do not expect that the adoption of fsp fas will have a material impact on our results of operations or financial condition 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
revised  business combinations  or sfas r  which is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning on or after december  sfas r establishes principles and requirements for how an acquirer 
table of contents recognizes and measures in its financial statements the identifiable assets acquired  the liabilities assumed  any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree  and the goodwill acquired in the business combination 
sfas r also establishes disclosure requirements to enable the evaluation of the nature and financial effects of the business combination 
sfas r will be applied prospectively to business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after january  we expect sfas r will have an impact on our accounting for future business combinations once adopted  but the effect is dependent upon the type and structure of any acquisition that we may make in the future 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
 noncontrolling interests in consolidated financial statements  an amendment of arb no 
 or sfas sfas changes the accounting and reporting for minority interests  which will be recharacterized as noncontrolling interests  and classified as a component of equity 
sfas also requires that entities provide sufficient disclosures that clearly identify and distinguish between the interests of the parent and the interests of the noncontrolling owners 
sfas is effective for fiscal years  and interim periods within those fiscal years  beginning on or after december  earlier adoption is prohibited 
sfas must be applied prospectively as of the beginning of the fiscal year in which this statement is initially applied  except for the presentation and disclosure requirements 
the presentation and disclosure requirements shall be applied retrospectively for all periods presented 
we do not expect that the adoption of sfas will have a material impact on our results of operations or financial condition 
in november  the eitf reached a consensus on eitf issue no 
 accounting for collaborative arrangements  or eitf eitf defines collaborative agreements and establishes reporting requirements for transactions between participants in a collaborative arrangement and between participants in the arrangement and third parties 
eitf is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after december   and interim periods within those fiscal years 
eitf must be applied retrospectively to all prior periods presented for all collaborative arrangements existing as of the effective date 
we do not expect that the adoption of eitf will have a material impact on our results of operations or financial condition 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we invest our cash in a variety of financial instruments  which may include money market instruments  securities issued by the us government and its agencies  investment grade corporate bonds and notes and auction rate securities 
these investments are denominated in us dollars 
all of our interest bearing securities are subject to interest rate risk  and could decline in value if interest rates fluctuate 
in addition  we have experienced liquidity issues related to our investments in auction rate securities 
we currently own securities that are sensitive to market risks as part of our investment portfolio 
the primary objective in managing our cash is to preserve capital and provide adequate liquidity to fund operations 
none of these market risk sensitive securities are held for trading purposes 
we currently hold auction rate securities with an original par value of million  consisting of private placement  synthetic collateralized debt obligations 
we classified the auction rate securities  which mature in  as long term investments for the years ended december  and  as we no longer consider them liquid given repeated failed auctions since august we classify these securities as available for sale and carry them at fair market value 
a severe decline in  and continued deterioration of the financial markets have impacted the fair value of our auction rate securities 
we estimate the fair value of the auction rate securities to be million as of december  during the fourth quarter of  we recorded an other than temporary impairment charge of million on the auction rate securities based on our assessment that it is unlikely that the fair market value of the auction rate securities will fully recover in the foreseeable future 
in addition  we 
table of contents cannot foresee any liquidity in the auction rate securities marketplace that would allow us to liquidate our auction rate securities position in the near future 
the other than temporary impairment charge of million was recorded as other income expense in our consolidated statement of operations and does not have a material impact on our financial flexibility or stability 
the potential change in fair value for our auction rate securities has been assessed on a hypothetical basis point adverse movement across all maturities 
we estimate that such hypothetical adverse basis point movement would result in no additional loss in fair value due to the fact that our investment return is based on a floating libor rate 
in addition to interest risk  we are subject to liquidity and credit risk as it relates to these investments 
our fixed rate notes are carried at cost on our consolidated balance sheet 
as of december   the fair market value of the notes was estimated by us to be million 
we determined the estimated fair value of the notes by using quoted market rates 
if interest rates were to increase by basis points  the fair value of our long term debt would decrease approximately million
