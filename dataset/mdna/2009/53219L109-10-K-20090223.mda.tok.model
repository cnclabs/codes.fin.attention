item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
any factor described in this report could by itself  or together with one or more factors  adversely affect our business  results of operations and or financial condition 
there may be factors not described in this report that could also cause results to differ from our expectations 
if we do not effectively attract  recruit and retain qualified physicians  nurses  medical technicians and other healthcare professionals  our ability to deliver healthcare services efficiently will be adversely affected 
as a general matter  only physicians on our medical staffs may direct hospital admissions and the services ordered once a patient is admitted to a hospital 
as a result  our success depends significantly on the efforts  abilities and experience of the physicians on the medical staffs of our hospitals most of whom have no long term contractual relationship with us  having an appropriate number of physicians on our hospitals medical staffs  the admissions practices of these physicians and the maintenance of good relations with these physicians 
the primary method we use to add or expand medical services is the recruitment of new physicians into our communities 
the success of our recruiting efforts will depend on several factors 
in general  there is a shortage of specialty care physicians 
we face intense competition in the recruitment and retention of specialists because of the difficulty in convincing these individuals of the benefits of practicing or remaining in practice in non urban communities 
if the growth rate slows more significantly in the non urban communities where our hospitals operate  then we could experience difficulty attracting and retaining physicians to practice in our communities 
we also employed more physicians during than in prior years 
we believe that physician employment by acute care hospitals has become more common in recent periods and that our experience in employing physicians is consistent with industry trends 
employed physicians could present more direct risks to us than those presented by independent members of our hospitals medical staffs 
for example  it is more likely that we could be found liable if an employed physician commits malpractice 
in light of the competition for a limited number of physicians  some are able to command significant although fair market value salaries 
the combined costs of these salaries is significant and  if this trend continues  could have an adverse effect on our results of operations 

table of contents further  our ability to recruit physicians is closely regulated 
for example  the types  amount  and duration of assistance we can provide to recruited physicians are limited by the federal stark physician self referral law  federal and state anti kickback statutes  and related regulations 
the stark law requires  among other things  that assistance can only be provided to physicians who meet certain geographic and practice requirements  that the amount of assistance cannot be changed during the term  and that the recruitment payments cannot generally benefit physicians currently in practice in the community beyond costs actually incurred by them in the recruitment 
in addition to these legal requirements  there is competition from other communities and facilities for these physicians  and this competition continues after the physician is practicing in one of our communities 
we also compete with other healthcare providers in recruiting and retaining qualified management and staff personnel responsible for the day to day operations of each of our hospitals  including nurses and other non physician healthcare professionals 
in some markets  the scarce availability of nurses and other medical support personnel presents a significant operating issue 
this shortage may require us to enhance wages and benefits to recruit and retain nurses and other medical support personnel  recruit personnel from foreign countries  and hire more expensive temporary personnel 
we also depend on the available labor pool of semi skilled and unskilled employees in each of the markets in which we operate 
because a significant percentage of our revenue consists of fixed  prospective payments  our ability to pass along increased labor costs is constrained 
our failure to recruit and retain qualified management  nurses and other medical support personnel  or to control our labor costs could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations 
the loss of certain physicians can have a disproportionate impact on certain of our hospitals 
generally  the top ten attending physicians within each of our facilities represent a large share of our inpatient revenues and admissions 
the loss of one or more of these physicians even if temporary could cause a material reduction in our revenues  which could take significant time to replace given the difficulty and cost associated with recruiting and retaining physicians 
we may not be able to recruit all of the physicians we have targeted 
in addition  we may incur increased malpractice expense if the quality of such physicians does not meet our expectations 
we believe physician attrition is one of the reasons for our recent volume declines 
if we are unable to reverse this trend we expect these volume declines to continue 
the failure of certain employers  or the closure of certain manufacturing and other facilities  can have a disproportionate impact on our hospitals 
the economies in the non urban communities in which our hospitals operate are often dependant on a small number of large employers  especially manufacturing or other facilities 
these employers often provide income and health insurance for a disproportionately large number of community residents who may depend on our hospitals for care 
the failure of one or more large employers  or the closure or substantial reduction in the number of individuals employed at manufacturing or other facilities located in or near many of the non urban communities in which our hospitals operate  could cause affected employees to move elsewhere for employment or lose insurance coverage that was otherwise available to them 
the occurrence of these events may cause a material reduction in our revenues and results of operations or impede our business strategies intended to generate organic growth and improve operating results at our hospitals 
we may continue to see the growth of uninsured and patient due accounts  deterioration in the collectability of these accounts could adversely affect our results of operations and cash flows 
the primary collection risks associated with our accounts receivable relate to the uninsured patient accounts and patient accounts for which the primary insurance carrier has paid the amounts covered by the applicable agreement  but patient responsibility amounts deductibles and co payments remain outstanding 
the provision for doubtful accounts relates primarily to amounts due directly from patients 
this risk has increased  and will likely continue to increase  as more individuals enroll in high deductible insurance plans or those with high co payments or who have no insurance coverage 
these trends will likely be exacerbated if general economic conditions remain challenging 
these trends will also likely be exacerbated as unemployment levels in the communities in which we operate rise 
as unemployment rates increase  our business strategies that intend to generate organic growth  and to improve admissions and adjusted admissions at our hospitals could become more difficult to accomplish 
the amount of our provision for doubtful accounts is based on our assessments of historical collection trends  business and economic conditions  trends in federal and state governmental and private employer health coverage and other collection indicators 
a continuation in trends that results in increasing the proportion of accounts receivable being comprised of uninsured accounts and deterioration in the collectability of these accounts could adversely affect our collections of accounts receivable  cash flows and results of operations 

table of contents the current economic recession  along with difficult and volatile conditions in the capital and credit markets  could materially adversely affect our financial position  results of operations or cash flows  and we are unsure whether these conditions will improve in the near future 
the united states economy is currently in a period of recession and global credit markets remain volatile 
declining consumer confidence and increased unemployment have increased concerns of prolonged economic weakness 
while certain healthcare spending is considered non discretionary and may not be significantly impacted by economic downturns  other types of healthcare spending may be adversely impacted by such conditions 
when patients are experiencing personal financial difficulties or have concerns about general economic conditions  they may choose to defer or forego elective surgeries and other non emergent procedures  which are generally more profitable lines of business for hospitals 
moreover  a greater number of uninsured patients may seek care in our emergency rooms 
we are unable to determine the specific impact of the current economic conditions on our business at this time  but we believe that further deterioration or a prolonged period of recession will have an adverse impact on our operations and could impact not only the healthcare decisions of our patients  but also the solvency of managed care providers and other counterparties to transactions with us 
our revenues will decline if federal or state programs reduce our medicare or medicaid payments or if managed care companies reduce reimbursement amounts 
in addition  the financial condition of payors and healthcare cost containment initiatives may limit our revenues and profitability 
in  we derived of our revenues from the medicare and medicaid programs 
the medicare and medicaid programs are subject to statutory and regulatory changes  administrative rulings  interpretations and determinations concerning patient eligibility requirements  funding levels and the method of calculating payments or reimbursements  among other things  requirements for utilization review  and federal and state funding restrictions  all of which could materially increase or decrease payments from these government programs in the future  as well as affect the timing of payments to our facilities 
we are unable to predict the effect of future government health care funding policy changes on our operations 
if the rates paid by governmental payers are reduced  if the scope of services covered by governmental payers is limited or if we  or one or more of our subsidiaries hospitals  are excluded from participation in the medicare or medicaid program or any other government health care program  there could be a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
during the past several years  healthcare payors  such as federal and state governments  insurance companies and employers  have undertaken initiatives to revise payment methodologies and monitor healthcare costs 
as part of their efforts to contain healthcare costs  payors increasingly are demanding discounted fee structures or the assumption by healthcare providers of all or a portion of the financial risk relating to paying for care provided  often in exchange for exclusive or preferred participation in their benefit plans 
we expect efforts to impose greater discounts and more stringent cost controls by government and other payors to continue  thereby reducing the payments we receive for our services 
in addition  these payors have instituted policies and procedures to substantially reduce or limit the use of inpatient services 
all of our hospitals are certified as providers of medicaid services 
medicaid programs are jointly funded by federal and state governments and are administered by states under an approved plan that provides hospital and other healthcare benefits to qualifying individuals who are unable to afford care 
a number of states  however  are experiencing budget problems and have adopted or are considering legislation designed to reduce their medicaid expenditures or to provide universal coverage and additional care  including enrolling medicaid recipients in managed care programs and imposing additional taxes on hospitals to help finance or expand states medicaid systems 
the arra includes increased federal funding for medicaid 
however  we are unable to predict at this time how this will impact states ability to provide medicaid coverage in the future 
it is possible that  despite congress actions  budgetary pressures will force states to resort to some of the cost saving measures mentioned above 
these efforts could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 

table of contents for example  one of our hospitals  memorial medical center of las cruces  new mexico mmc  received approximately million during under the new mexico sole community provider program the scpp 
while the funds made available to mmc and other new mexico hospitals that participate in the scpp are not tied directly to the cost of actual services provided  mmc is required to provide an annual report of its costs to dona ana county the county primarily served by mmc 
once desired funding levels were established by dona ana county for  the county submitted funds to the new mexico human services department the nmhsd  which in turn were combined with funds sent by other new mexico counties and then used by the nmhsd to request matching funds from the federal government 
once the federal matching dollars were made available to the state  the resulting sole community provider payment was made under the scpp directly to mmc and other hospitals participating in the scpp by the nmhsd 
the payments made by the nmhsd to hospitals pursuant to the scpp are based on formulas established with respect to each participating hospital 
the scpp was created in and has resulted in significant payments to mmc in prior years 
like many other states  there is a general concern in new mexico that the scpp cannot be sustained at current funding levels due to budget concerns and other factors 
it seems likely  as a result  that the scpp will soon be reconstituted 
we are not able to predict what changes may be made to the scpp  but any change in the scpp is likely to reduce payments made to mmc 
we are subject to increasingly stringent governmental regulation  and may be subjected to allegations that we have failed to comply with governmental regulations which could result in sanctions and even greater scrutiny that reduce our revenues and profitability 
all participants in the healthcare industry are required to comply with many laws and regulations at the federal state and local government levels 
these laws and regulations require that hospitals meet various requirements  including those relating to hospitals relationships with physicians and other referral sources  the adequacy and quality of medical care  equipment  personnel  operating policies and procedures  billing and cost reports  payment for services and supplies  maintenance of adequate records  privacy  compliance with building codes and environmental protection  among other matters 
the hospital industry has seen a number of ongoing investigations related to referrals  physician recruiting practices  cost reporting and billing practices  laboratory and home healthcare services and physician ownership and joint ventures involving hospitals 
federal and state government agencies have announced heightened and coordinated civil and criminal enforcement efforts 
in addition  the oig which is responsible for investigating fraud and abuse activities in government programs and the us department of justice periodically establish enforcement initiatives that focus on specific billing practices or other suspected areas of abuse 
in january  the oig issued supplemental compliance program guidance for hospitals that focuses on hospital compliance risk areas 
some of the risk areas highlighted by the oig include correct outpatient procedure coding  revising admission and discharge policies to reflect current cms rules  submitting appropriate claims for supplemental payments such as pass through costs and outlier payments and a general discussion of the fraud and abuse risks related to financial relationships with referral sources 
hospitals continue to be one of the primary focal areas of oig investigations 
the oig reported savings and expected recoveries for federal health care programs of more than billion for fy  which includes one of the largest civil fraud recoveries ever against an individual hospital 
it is likely that the introduction of racs in signals additional government scrutiny of hospitals 
the claims review strategies used by the racs include review of high dollar claims  including inpatient hospital claims 
during the three year rac demonstration program  a large majority of the total amounts recovered by racs came from hospitals 
in public statements  governmental authorities have taken positions on issues for which little official interpretation was previously available 
some of these positions appear to be inconsistent with common practices within the industry but have not previously been challenged 
moreover  some government investigations that have in the past been conducted under the civil provisions of federal law are now being conducted as criminal investigations under the medicare fraud and abuse laws 

table of contents in a series of notices in  cms indicated its intent to require a group of hospitals to submit a disclosure of financial relationships report to cms 
although final omb approval of the dfrr is still pending  the deadline for public comment was january   therefore  it could be distributed at any time 
if the dfrr is distributed  we expect that a number of our facilities may be included among those required to respond 
cms intends to use this data to monitor compliance with the stark law  and cms has indicated that it may share the information with other government agencies 
many of these agencies have not previously analyzed this information and have the authority to bring enforcement actions against us 
once a hospital receives this request  the hospital will have a limited amount of time to compile a significant amount of information relating to its financial relationships with physicians  including any ownership by physicians 
the hospital may be subject to substantial penalties if it is unable to assemble and report this information within the required timeframe or if cms or any other government agency determines that the submission is inaccurate or incomplete 
the hospital may be the subject of investigations or enforcement actions if a government agency determines that any of the information indicates a potential violation of law 
any such investigation or enforcement action could materially adversely affect the results of our operations 
these activities reflect the general trend of increasing governmental scrutiny of the financial relationships between hospitals and referring physicians under the fraud and abuse laws 
the laws and regulations with which we must comply are complex and subject to change 
in the future  different interpretations or enforcement of these laws and regulations could subject our practices to allegations of impropriety or illegality or could require us to make changes in our facilities  equipment  personnel  services  capital expenditure programs and operating expenses 
if we fail to comply with applicable laws and regulations  we could suffer civil or criminal penalties  including the loss of our licenses to operate our hospitals and our ability to participate in the medicare  medicaid and other federal and state healthcare programs 
finally  we are subject to various federal  state and local statutes and ordinances regulating the discharge of materials into the environment 
our healthcare operations generate medical waste  such as pharmaceuticals  biological materials and disposable medical instruments that must be disposed of in compliance with federal  state and local environmental laws  rules and regulations 
our operations are also subject to various other environmental laws  rules and regulations 
environmental regulations also may apply when we renovate or refurbish hospitals  particularly older facilities 
other hospitals and outpatient facilities provide services similar to those which we offer 
in addition  physicians provide services in their offices that could be provided in our hospitals 
these factors increase the level of competition we face and may therefore adversely affect our revenues  profitability and market share 
competition among hospitals and other healthcare service providers  including outpatient facilities  has intensified in recent years 
we compete with other hospitals  including larger tertiary care centers located in larger metropolitan areas  and with physicians who provide services in their offices which could otherwise be provided in our hospitals 
although the hospitals with which we compete may be a significant distance away from our facilities  patients in our markets may migrate on their own to  may be referred by local physicians to  or may be encouraged by their health plan to travel to these hospitals 
furthermore  some of the hospitals with which we compete may offer more or different services than those available at our hospitals  may have more advanced equipment or a medical staff that is thought to be better qualified 
also  some of the hospitals that compete with our facilities are owned by tax supported governmental agencies or not for profit entities supported by endowments and charitable contributions 
these hospitals  in most instances  are also exempt from paying sales  property and income taxes 
we also face very significant and increasing competitions from services offered by physicians including physicians on our medical staffs in their offices and from other specialized care providers  including outpatient surgery  oncology  physical therapy and diagnostic centers including many in which physicians may have and ownership interest 
some of our hospitals have and will seek to develop outpatient facilities where necessary to compete effectively 
however  to the extent that other providers are successful in developing outpatient facilities or physicians are able to offer additional  advanced services in their offices  our market share for these services will likely decrease in the future 

table of contents in  cms began making public performance data relating to ten quality measures that hospitals submit in connection with their medicare reimbursement 
since that time  cms has on several occasions increased the number of quality measures hospitals are required to report 
if these measures become a primary factor in where patients choose to receive care  and if competing hospitals have better results than our hospitals on the measures  we would expect that our patient volumes would decline 
in the future  other trends toward clinical transparency may have an unanticipated impact on our competitive position and patient volume 
our revenues are especially concentrated in a small number of states which will make us particularly sensitive to regulatory and economic changes in those states 
our revenues are particularly sensitive to regulatory and economic changes in kentucky  virginia  new mexico  west virginia  tennessee  alabama  louisiana  arizona and texas 
the following table contains our revenues and revenues as a percentage of our total revenues by state for each of these states for the years presented dollars in millions revenue concentration by state amount of total revenues kentucky virginia new mexico west virginia tennessee alabama louisiana arizona texas accordingly  any change in the current demographic  economic  competitive or regulatory conditions in the above mentioned states could have an adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations and or prospects 
medicaid changes in these states could also have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
if our access to licensed information systems is interrupted or restricted  or if we are not able to integrate changes to our existing information systems or information systems of acquired hospitals  our operations could suffer 
our business depends significantly on effective information systems to process clinical and financial information 
information systems require an ongoing commitment of significant resources to maintain and enhance existing systems and develop new systems in order to keep pace with continuing changes in information processing technology 
we rely heavily on hca information technology and services  inc  hca it  for information systems 
hca it provides us with financial  clinical  patient accounting and network information services 
we do not control hca it s systems  and if these systems fail or are interrupted  if our access to these systems is limited in the future or if hca it develops systems more appropriate for the urban healthcare market and not suited for our hospitals  our operations could suffer 
our contract with hca it  as amended  expires on december  including a wind down period unless extended by the parties 
hca s primary business is to own and operate hospitals  not to provide information systems 
in addition  hca was taken private in a leveraged buyout in november the additional debt incurred by hca in this transaction could impact its ability to provide information systems and related support to us 
during late  hca announced layoffs which included over employees of hca it 
at this time  it remains uncertain whether these staffing reductions will impact the performance of hca it under our agreements 
system conversions are costly  time consuming and disruptive for physicians and employees 
should we decide or be required to convert away from systems provided by hca it  such implementation would be very costly and could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 

table of contents in addition  as new information systems are developed in the future  we will need to integrate them into our existing systems 
evolving industry and regulatory standards  such as hipaa regulations  may require changes to our information systems in the future 
we may not be able to integrate new systems or changes required to our existing systems or systems of acquired hospitals in the future effectively or on a cost efficient basis 
an element of our long term business strategy is growth through the acquisition of additional acute care hospitals 
our acquisition activity requires transitions from  and the integration of  various information systems that are used by the hospitals we acquire 
if we experience difficulties with the integration of the information systems of acquired hospitals  we could suffer  among other things  operational disruptions and increases in administrative expenses 
we have substantial indebtedness and we may incur significant amounts of additional indebtedness in the future which could affect our ability to finance operations and capital expenditures  pursue desirable business opportunities or successfully operate our business in the future 
as of december   our consolidated debt was approximately  million 
we also have the ability to incur significant amounts of additional indebtedness  subject to the conditions imposed by the terms of our credit agreements an the agreements or indentures governing any additional indebtedness that we incur in the future 
our credit facility contains an uncommitted accordion feature that permits us to borrow at a later date additional aggregate principal amounts of up to million under the term a and the term b loan components and up to million under the revolving loan component  subject to the receipt of commitments and the satisfaction of other conditions 
our ability to repay or refinance our indebtedness will depend upon our future ability to monetize our interests in our hospital assets and our operating performance  which may be affected by general economic  financial  competitive  regulatory  business and other factors beyond our control 
although we believe that our future operating cash flow  together with available financing arrangements  will be sufficient to fund our operating requirements  our leverage and debt service obligations could have important consequences  including the following under our credit facility  we are required to satisfy and maintain specified financial ratios and tests 
failure to comply with these obligations may cause an event of default which  if not cured or waived  could required us to repay substantial indebtedness immediately 
moreover  if debt repayment is accelerated  we will be subject to higher interest rates on our debt obligations as a result of these covenants and our credit ratings may be adversely impacted 
we may be vulnerable in the event of downturns and adverse changes in the general economy or our industry 
specific examples of industry changes that could have an adverse impact on our cash flow include the implementation by the government of further limitations on reimbursement under medicare and medicaid 
we may have difficulty obtaining additional financing at favorable interest rates to meet our requirements for working capital  capital expenditures  acquisitions  general corporate or other purposes 
we will be required to dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow to the payment of principal and interest on indebtedness  which will reduce the amount of funds available for operations  capital expenditures and future acquisitions 
any borrowings we incur at variable interest rates expose us to increases in interest rates generally 
a breach of any of the restrictions or covenants in our debt agreements could cause a cross default under other debt agreements 
we may be required to pay our indebtedness immediately if we default on any of the numerous financial or other restrictive covenants contained in the debt agreements 
it is not certain whether we will have  or will be able to obtain  sufficient funds to make these accelerated payments 
if any senior debt is accelerated  our assets may not be sufficient to repay such indebtedness and our other indebtedness 

table of contents in the event of a default  we may be forced to pursue one or more alternative strategies  such as restructuring or refinancing our indebtedness  selling assets  reducing or delaying capital expenditures or seeking additional equity capital 
there can be no assurances that any of these strategies could be effected on satisfactory terms  if at all  or that sufficient funds could be obtained to make these accelerated payments 
we may be subject to liabilities because of malpractice and related legal claims brought against our hospitals 
if we become subject to these claims  we could be required to pay significant damages  which may not be covered by insurance 
we may be subject to medical malpractice lawsuits and other legal actions arising out of the operations of our owned and leased hospitals 
these actions may involve large claims and significant defense costs 
in an effort to resolve one or more of these matters  we may choose to negotiate a settlement 
amounts we pay to settle any of these matters may be material 
to mitigate a portion of this risk  we maintain professional malpractice liability and general liability insurance coverage for these potential claims in amounts above our sir level that we believe to be appropriate for our operations 
however  some of these claims could exceed the scope of the coverage in effect  or coverage of particular claims could be denied 
we maintain professional and general liability insurance with unrelated commercial insurance carriers to provide for losses in excess of our sir amount 
as a result  one or more successful claims against us that are within our sir amounts could have an adverse effect on our results of operations  cash flows  financial condition or liquidity 
in addition  we operate a wholly owned captive insurance company under the name point of life indemnity  ltd  which  issues malpractice insurance policies to our employed physicians and certain voluntary attending physicians 
additionally  we experienced unfavorable claims development results recently  which are reflected in our professional and general liability costs 
insurance coverage in the future may not continue to be available at a cost allowing us to maintain adequate levels of insurance with acceptable sir level amounts 
one or more of our insurance carriers may become insolvent and unable to fulfill its obligation to defend  pay or reimburse us when that obligation becomes due 
in addition  physicians using our hospitals may be unable to obtain insurance on acceptable terms 
our revenues and volume trends may be adversely affected by certain factors over which we have no control 
our revenues and volume trends are dependent on many factors  including physicians clinical decisions and availability  payor programs shifting to a more outpatient based environment  whether or not certain services are offered  seasonal and severe weather conditions  including the effects of extreme low temperatures  hurricanes and tornados  earthquakes  current local economic and demographic changes  the intensity and timing of yearly flu outbreaks 
in addition  technological developments and pharmaceutical improvements may reduce the demand for healthcare services or the profitability of the services we offer 
if our fair value declines  a material non cash charge to earnings from impairment of our goodwill could result 
at december   we had approximately  million of goodwill on our consolidated balance sheet 
we expect to recover the carrying value of this goodwill through our future cash flows 
we evaluate annually  based on our fair value  whether the carrying value of our goodwill is impaired 
if the carrying value of our goodwill is impaired  we may incur a material non cash charge to earnings 

table of contents we may have difficulty acquiring hospitals on favorable terms and  because of regulatory scrutiny  acquiring not for profit entities 
one element of our business strategy is expansion through the acquisition of acute care hospitals in non urban markets 
we face significant competition to acquire other attractive non urban hospitals  and we may not find suitable acquisitions on favorable terms 
our primary competitors for acquisitions have included for profit and tax exempt hospitals and hospital systems  and privately capitalized start up companies 
buyers with a strategic desire for any particular hospital for example  a hospital located near existing hospitals or those who will realize economic synergies have demonstrated an ability and willingness to pay premium prices for hospitals 
strategic buyers  as a result  can present a competitive barrier to our acquisition efforts 
even if we are able to identify an attractive candidate  we may not be able to obtain financing  if necessary  for any acquisitions or joint ventures that we might make or may be required to borrow at higher rates and on less favorable terms 
we may incur or assume additional indebtedness as a result of acquisitions 
our failure to acquire non urban hospitals consistent with our growth plans could prevent us from increasing our revenues 
the cost of an acquisition could result in a dilutive effect on our results of operations  depending on various factors  including the amount paid for the acquisition  the acquired hospital s results of operations  allocation of purchase price  effects of subsequent legislation and limitations on rate increases 
in the past  we have occasionally experienced temporary delays in improving the operating margins or effectively integrating the operations of our acquired hospitals 
in the future  if we are unable to improve the operating margins of acquired hospitals  operate them profitably or effectively integrate their operations  we may be unable to achieve our growth strategy 
in recent years  the legislatures and attorneys general of several states have become more interested in sales of hospitals by tax exempt entities 
this heightened scrutiny may increase the cost and difficulty  or prevent the completion  of transactions with tax exempt organizations in the future 
we may encounter numerous business risks in acquiring additional hospitals and may have difficulty operating and integrating those hospitals 
as a result  we may be unable to achieve our growth strategy 
we may be unable to timely and effectively integrate any hospitals that we acquire with our ongoing operations 
we may experience delays in implementing operating procedures and systems in newly acquired hospitals 
integrating an acquired hospital could be expensive and time consuming and could disrupt our ongoing business  negatively affect cash flow and distract management and other key personnel 
in addition  acquisition activity requires transitions from  and the integration of  operations and  usually  information systems that are used by acquired hospitals 
we will rely heavily on hca it for information systems integration as part of a contractual arrangement for information technology services 
we may not be successful in causing hca it to convert our newly acquired hospitals information systems in a timely manner 
in addition  businesses we have acquired  or businesses we may acquire may have unknown or contingent liabilities for past activities of acquired businesses  including liabilities for failure to comply with healthcare laws and regulations  medical and general professional liabilities  worker s compensation liabilities  previous tax liabilities and unacceptable business practices 
although we have historically obtained  and we intend to continue to obtain  contractual indemnification from sellers covering these matters  any indemnification obtained from sellers may be insufficient to cover material claims or liabilities for past activities of acquired businesses 
if we do not continually enhance our hospitals with the most recent technological advances in diagnostic and surgical equipment  our ability to maintain and expand our markets may be adversely affected 
technological advances  including with respect to computer assisted tomography scanner cts  magnetic resonance imaging mris and positron emission tomography scanner pets equipment continue to evolve 
in addition  the manufacturers of such equipment often provide incentives to try to increase their sales  including providing favorable financing to higher credit risk organizations 
in an effort to compete  we must continually assess our equipment needs and upgrade our equipment as a result of technological improvements 
we believe that the direction of the patient flow correlates directly to the level and intensity of such diagnostic equipment 

table of contents we may be subjected to actions brought by the government under anti fraud and abuse provisions or by individuals on the government s behalf under the false claims act s qui tam or whistleblower provisions 
we are subject to the anti kickback statute  which prohibits some business practices and relationships related to items or services reimbursable under medicare  medicaid and other federal healthcare programs 
for example  the anti kickback statute prohibits healthcare service providers from paying or receiving remuneration to induce or arrange for the referral of patients or purchase of items or services covered by a federal or state healthcare program 
if regulatory authorities determine that any of our hospitals arrangements violate the anti kickback statute  we could be subject to liabilities under the social security act  including criminal penalties  civil monetary penalties  and or exclusion from participation in medicare  medicaid or other federal healthcare programs  any of which could impair our ability to operate one or more of our hospitals profitably 
whistleblower provisions allow private individuals to bring actions on behalf of the government alleging that the defendant has defrauded the federal government 
defendants found to be liable under the false claims act may be required to pay three times the actual damages sustained by the government  plus mandatory civil penalties ranging between  and  for each separate false claim 
there are many potential bases for liability under the false claims act 
liability often arises when an entity knowingly submits a false claim for reimbursement to the federal government 
the false claims act defines the term knowingly broadly 
although simple negligence will not give rise to liability under the false claims act  submitting a claim with reckless disregard for its truth or falsity constitutes a knowing submission under the false claims act and  therefore  will give rise to liability 
in some cases  whistleblowers or the federal government have taken the position that providers who allegedly have violated other statutes  such as the anti kickback statute and the stark law  have thereby submitted false claims under the false claims act 
in addition  a number of states have adopted their own false claims provisions as well as their own whistleblower provisions whereby a private party may file a civil lawsuit in state court 
we are required to provide information to our employees and certain contractors about state and federal false claims laws and whistleblower provisions and protections 
although we intend and will endeavor to conduct our business in compliance with all applicable federal and state fraud and abuse laws  many of these laws are broadly worded and may be interpreted or applied in ways that cannot be predicted 
therefore  we cannot assure you that our arrangements or business practices will not be subject to government scrutiny or be found to be in compliance with applicable fraud and abuse laws 
certificate of need laws and regulations regarding licenses  ownership and operation may impair our future expansion in some states 
some states require prior approval for the purchase  construction and expansion of healthcare facilities  based on the state s determination of need for additional or expanded healthcare facilities or services 
ten states in which we operate hospitals  including the recently acquired rockdale medical center in georgia  require a certificate of need for capital expenditures exceeding a prescribed amount  changes in bed capacity or services  and for certain other planned activities 
we may not be able to obtain certificates of need required for expansion activities in the future 
in addition  all of the states in which we operate facilities require hospitals and most healthcare providers to maintain one or more licenses 
if we fail to obtain any required certificate of need or license  our ability to operate or expand operations in those states could be impaired 

table of contents in states without certificate of need laws  competing providers of healthcare services are able to expand and construct facilities without the need for significant regulatory approval 
in the nine states in which we operate that do not require certificates of need for the purchase  construction and expansion of healthcare facilities or services  competing healthcare providers face low barriers to entry and expansion 
if competing providers of healthcare services are able to purchase  construct or expand healthcare facilities without the need for regulatory approval  we may face decreased market share and revenues in those markets 
different interpretations of accounting principles could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition 
generally accepted accounting principles are complex  continually evolving and may be subject to varied interpretation by us  our independent registered public accounting firm and the sec 
such varied interpretations could result from differing views related to specific facts and circumstances 
differences in interpretation of generally accepted accounting principles could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations or financial condition 
our stock price has been and may continue to be volatile  any significant decline may result in litigation 
the trading price of our common stock has been and may continue to be subject to wide fluctuations 
this may result in stockholder lawsuits  which could divert management s time away from operations and could result in higher legal fees and proxy costs 
our stock price may fluctuate in response to the results or our operations and to a number of events and factors  including actual or anticipated quarterly variations in operating results  particularly if they differ from investors expectations  changes in financial estimates and recommendations by securities analysts  changes in government regulations including those relating to reimbursement and operational policies and procedures  the operating and stock price performance of other companies that investors may deem comparable  changes in overall economic factors in our markets  news reports relating to trends or events in our markets  and issues associated with integration of the hospitals that we acquire 
broad market and industry fluctuations may adversely affect the price of our common stock  regardless of our operating performance 
as a result of the above factors  we could be subjected to potential stockholder lawsuits 
such lawsuits are time consuming and expensive 
among other things  such lawsuits divert management s time and attention from operations 
such lawsuits also force us to incur substantial legal fees and proxy costs in defending our position

overview we operate general acute care hospitals in non urban communities in the united states 
at december   we owned or leased through subsidiaries hospitals  having a total of  licensed beds  and serving communities in states 
two of these hospitals were held for sale and classified as discontinued operations in our consolidated financial statements  and seven were owned by third parties and leased by our subsidiaries 
effective february   we acquired rockdale medical center rmc  a bed acute care hospital located in conyers  georgia approximately miles outside of atlanta  georgia 
the financial results of rmc are not included in our financial statements or results of operations for the periods described in this report 

table of contents we generate revenues primarily through hospital services offered at our facilities 
we generated  million   million and  million in revenues from continuing operations during  and  respectively 
in  we derived of our revenues from the medicare and medicaid programs 
payments made to our hospitals pursuant to the medicare and medicaid programs for services rendered rarely exceed our costs for such services 
as a result  we rely largely on payments made by private or commercial payors  together with certain limited services provided to medicare recipients  to generate an operating profit 
our hospitals typically provide the range of medical and surgical services commonly available in hospitals in non urban markets  although the services provided at any specific hospital depend on factors such as community need for the service  whether physicians necessary to operate the service line safely are members of the medical staff of that hospital  whether the service might be economically viable  and any contractual or con obligations that might exist 
competitive and regulatory environment the environment in which our hospitals operate is extremely competitive 
we face competition from other acute care hospitals  including larger tertiary hospitals located in larger markets and or affiliated with universities  specialty hospitals that focus on one or a small number of very lucrative service lines but that are not required to operate emergency departments  stand alone centers at which surgeries or diagnostic tests can be performed  and physicians on the medical staffs of our hospitals 
in many cases  our competitors focus on the service lines that offer the highest margins 
by doing so  our competitors can potentially draw the best paying business out of our hospitals 
this  in turn  can reduce the overall operating profit of our hospitals as we are often obligated to offer service lines that operate at a loss or that have much lower profit margins 
we continue to see growth in this general shift of lower acuity procedures to outpatient settings 
we have also seen the shift of increasingly complex procedures from the inpatient to the outpatient setting 
the competition from physicians on the medical staffs of our hospitals can be especially challenging 
within their offices  physicians may provide a vast range of services that would otherwise be provided by acute care hospitals 
physicians also have a high level of influence with respect to where their patients receive healthcare services and have the sole authority to order tests 
as a result of declining reimbursements to physicians  and as a result of these unique competitive advantages  we believe that physicians often provide high margin services in their offices to patients whose insurance plans pay reimbursement rates much higher than those set by medicare or medicaid 
this trend has likely offset to some extent our efforts to improve equivalent admission rates at many of our hospitals 
our hospitals also face extreme competition in their efforts to recruit and retain physicians on their medical staffs 
it is widely recognized that the us has a shortage of physicians in certain practice areas  including specialists such as cardiologists and orthopedists  in various areas of the country 
the environment in which our hospitals operate is very highly regulated and the penalties for noncompliance are severe 
we are required to comply with extensive  extremely complicated and overlapping government regulations at the federal  state and local levels 
these regulate every aspect of how our hospitals conduct their operations  from what service lines must be offered in order to be licensed as an acute care hospital  to whether our hospitals may employ physicians to how and whether our hospitals may receive payments pursuant to the medicare and medicaid programs 
the failure to comply with these laws and regulations can result in severe penalties including criminal penalties and civil sanctions  and the loss of our ability to receive reimbursements through the medicare and medicaid programs 
not only are our hospitals heavily regulated  the rules  regulations and laws to which they are subject often change  with little or no notice  and they are often interpreted and applied differently by various regulatory agencies with authority to enforce such requirements 
each change or conflicting interpretation may require our hospitals to make changes in their facilities  equipment  personnel or services  and may also require that standard operating policies and procedures be re written and re implemented 
the cost of complying with such laws is a very significant component of our overall expenses 
further  this expense has grown in recent periods due to the requirements of new regulations and the severity of the penalties associated with non compliance and management believes compliance expenses will continue to grow in the foreseeable future 

table of contents the hospital industry is also enduring a period where the costs of providing care are rising faster than reimbursement rates 
this places a premium on efficient operation  the ability to reduce or control costs and the need to leverage the benefits of our organization across all of our hospitals 
the regulatory  enforcement and reimbursement environment could change substantially during although president obama has said that healthcare reform is among his administration s highest priorities  the details and timing of any such reform are unknown 
business strategy we seek to fulfill our mission of making communities healthier by striving to improve the quality and types of healthcare services available in our communities  provide physicians with a positive environment in which to practice medicine  with access to necessary equipment and resources  develop and provide a positive work environment for employees  expand each hospital s role as a community asset  and improve each hospital s financial performance 
we expect our hospitals to be the place where patients want to come for care  where physicians want to practice medicine and where employees want to work 
in many of our markets  a portion of patients who require the services available at acute care hospitals leave our markets to receive such care 
this fact presents an opportunity for growth  and we are working with the hospitals in communities where this phenomenon exists to implement new  or better implement existing strategies 
we believe that growth opportunities remain in our existing markets 
growth at our hospitals is dependent in part on how successful our hospitals are in their efforts to recruit physicians to their respective medical staffs  whether such physicians are active members of such medical staffs over a long period of time and whether and to what extent members of our hospitals medical staffs admit patients to our hospitals 
during  we refined our recruiting process in an effort to better identify and focus on those physicians most likely to desire to practice in our communities  to better tailor our communications to the physicians who want to practice in non urban communities 
during  we will continue to strive to improve our recruiting and retention efforts including centralizing at our corporate office many of the recruiting functions and efforts that have in the past been performed by vendors on a contract basis 
the quality of healthcare services provided at our hospitals  and the perceived quality of such services  is an increasingly important factor to patients when deciding where to seek care and to physicians when deciding where to practice 
because in virtually every case the core measure scores ascribed to our hospitals are determined based on the practice behaviors of the physicians on our medical staffs  we have implemented new strategies to work with medical staff members to improve these scores 
management believes that our efforts in this regard during were  on average  successful 
the core measure scores at some of our largest hospitals continue to be below our company average and our expectations 
we will continue to work with our medical staff members to seek to improve our the core measure scores of our hospitals 
we also believe that growth can also be achieved as we add new service lines in our existing markets  invest in new technologies desired by physicians and patients  and demonstrate the quality of the care provided in our facilities 
for the past two years  we have undertaken redesigned operating reviews of our hospitals to pinpoint new service lines or technologies that could reduce the outmigration of patients leaving our markets to receive health care services 
where needed service lines have been identified  we have focused on recruiting the physicians necessary to correctly operate such service lines 
physicians affiliated with our hospitals also seem to be interested in admitting patients to hospitals with active hospitalist programs 
as a result  our hospitals have responded by introducing or strengthening hospitalists programs where appropriate 
our hospitals have taken other steps  such as structured efforts to solicit input from medical staff members and to promptly respond to legitimate unmet physicians needs  to limit or offset the impact of outmigration and to grow 

table of contents while responsibly managing our operating expenses  we have also made significant  targeted investments at our hospitals to add new technologies  modernize facilities and expand the services available 
these investments should assist in our efforts to attract and retain physicians  to offset outmigration of patients and to make our hospitals more desirable to our employees and potential patients 
we also continue to strive to improve our operating performance by improving on our revenue cycle processes  making an even higher level of purchases through our group purchasing organization  operating more efficiently and effectively  and working to appropriately standardize our policies  procedures and practices across all of our affiliated hospitals 
we also believe that being positioned as the sole acute care hospital in virtually all of our communities has allowed us  and will continue to allow us  in many cases to negotiate preferred reimbursement rates with commercial insurance payors 
additional growth effective february   we acquired rmc  a bed acute care hospital located in conyers  georgia approximately miles outside of atlanta  georgia 
during  rmc generated net revenues of approximately million  which are not included in our financial results 
we believe that  through group purchasing efforts and the implementation of other initiatives  rmc s operating performance will improve during and subsequent years 
the acquisition of rmc is consistent with our stated goal of seeking to acquire one to three complimentary hospitals a year 
our intention is to acquire well positioned hospitals in growing areas of the us that we believe are fairly priced and that could benefit from our management and strategic initiatives 
we believe that this growth by strategic acquisition can supplement the growth we believe we can generate organically in our existing markets 
revenue sources our hospitals generate revenues by providing healthcare services to our patients 
depending upon the patient s medical insurance coverage  we are paid for these services by governmental medicare and medicaid programs  commercial insurance  including managed care organizations  and directly by the patient 
the amounts we are paid for providing healthcare services to our patients vary depending upon the payor 
governmental payors generally pay significantly less than the hospital s customary charges for the services provided 
revenues from governmental payors  such as medicare and medicaid  are controlled by complex rules and regulations that stipulate the amount a hospital is paid for providing healthcare services 
our compliance with these rules and regulations requires an extensive effort to ensure we remain eligible to participate in these governmental programs 
in addition  these rules and regulations are subject to frequent changes as a result of legislative and administrative action on both the federal and the state levels 
for these reasons  revenues from governmental programs change frequently and require us to monitor regularly the environment in which these governmental programs operate 
revenues from hmos  ppos and other private insurers are subject to contracts and other arrangements that require us to discount the amounts we customarily charge for healthcare services 
these discounted arrangements often limit our ability to increase charges in response to increasing costs 
we actively negotiate with these payors to seek to maintain or increase the pricing of our healthcare services 
insured patients are generally not responsible for any difference between customary hospital charges and the amounts received from commercial insurance payors 
however  insured patients are responsible for payments not covered by insurance  such as exclusions  deductibles and co payments 
self pay revenues are primarily generated through the treatment of uninsured patients 
our hospitals experienced an increase in self pay revenues during recent years 

table of contents results of operations the following definitions apply throughout the remaining portion of management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations admissions 
represents the total number of patients admitted in the facility for a period in excess of hours to our hospitals and used by management and investors as a general measure of inpatient volume 
bps 
basis point change 
continuing operations 
continuing operations information excludes the operations of hospitals that are held for sale and disposed of 
emergency room visits 
represents the total number of hospital based emergency room visits 
equivalent admissions 
management and investors use equivalent admissions as a general measure of combined inpatient and outpatient volume 
we compute equivalent admissions by multiplying admissions inpatient volume by the outpatient factor the sum of gross inpatient revenue and gross outpatient revenue and then dividing the resulting amount by gross inpatient revenue 
the equivalent admissions computation equates outpatient revenue to the volume measure admissions used to measure inpatient volume resulting in a general measure of combined inpatient and outpatient volume 
net revenue days outstanding 
we compute net revenue days outstanding by dividing our accounts receivable net of allowance for doubtful accounts  by our revenue per day 
our revenue per day is calculated by dividing our quarterly revenues  including revenues for held for sale disposed of hospitals  by the number of calendar days in the quarter 
esop

table of contents for the three months ended december  and revenues the increase in our revenues for the three months ended december   compared to the same period last year  was primarily the result of an increase in our revenues per equivalent admission 
revenues per equivalent admission increased to  during the three months ended december   compared to  during the same period last year 
this increase is largely a result of changes in the acuity of our patients  service mix changes related to volume growth in higher reimbursement outpatient diagnostic services  including cts  mris and cardiac catheterization  the impact of favorable commercial pricing  inclusive of improvements in third party payor contracting  and benefits associated with medicare s hospital market basket updates 
revenues during the three months ended december   were negatively impacted by declines in equivalent admissions 
equivalent admissions of  for the three months ended december   declined as compared to the same period last year  as a result of fewer admissions and overall declines in our inpatient surgeries and emergency room visits 
during the year ended december   we experienced a shift from inpatient admissions to outpatient observations for a portion of our patient population  which contributed to our decline in equivalent admissions 
although we experienced equivalent admission declines  our volume improved in certain aspects of our business  such as in outpatient diagnostic services  including ct imaging and laboratory services 
the following table shows the key drivers of our revenues for the periods presented three months ended december  increase increase decrease decrease admissions equivalent admissions revenues per equivalent admission medicare case mix index average length of stay days inpatient surgeries outpatient surgeries emergency room visits outpatient factor the following table shows the sources of our revenues by payor for the periods presented  expressed as a percentage of total revenues  including adjustments to estimated reimbursement amounts three months ended december  medicare medicaid hmos  ppos and other private insurers self pay other the table above is inclusive of certain changes we have made to our historical practices regarding sources of revenues 
specifically  we previously classified uninsured discounts as revenue deductions for hmos  ppos and other private insurers 
we changed the classification of uninsured discounts to revenue deductions for self pay revenues effective in our june  quarterly report on form q for all periods previously reported 
this change had no impact on our historical results of operations 
generally  these reclassifications reduced self pay as a percentage of total revenues and increased hmos  ppos  and other private insurers as a percentage of total revenues 
we have determined that it is more appropriate to apply uninsured discounts as revenue deductions against self pay revenues rather than against hmos  ppos and other private insurers revenues 

table of contents expenses salaries and benefits the following table summarizes our salaries and benefits expenses for the periods presented dollars in millions  except for salaries and benefits per equivalent admission three months ended december  of of increase increase revenues revenues decrease decrease salaries and benefits salaries  wages  benefits and contract labor stock based compensation man hours per equivalent admission n a n a salaries and benefits per equivalent admission  n a  n a for the three months ended december   our salaries and benefits expense of million increased to as a percentage of revenues as compared to in the same period last year 
this increase was a result of annual compensation increases for our employees  plus the impact of an increasing number of employed physicians within our hospitals 
additionally  we experienced an overall increase in our benefit costs  most notably within our medical benefit component 
these increases were partially offset by improvements in our contract labor costs as well as a slight decline in our stock based compensation expense during the period 
our stock based compensation expense decline for the three months ended december   was due to the absence of a forfeiture rate methodology change that was recorded in the same period last year 
as we continue to employ an increasing number of medical professionals including physicians  we expect that salaries and benefits as a percentage of revenues will also increase 
supplies the following table summarizes our supplies expense for the periods presented dollars in millions  except for supplies per equivalent admission three months ended december  of of increase increase revenues revenues decrease decrease supplies supplies per equivalent admission n a  n a for the three months ended december   supplies expense of million increased  as compared to million in the same period last year 
similarly  our supplies per equivalent admission increased to  as compared to in the same period last year 
supplies per equivalent admission increased as a result of a higher utilization of more expensive supplies in areas such as orthopedics  cardiac devices and spine and bone 
in addition  our pharmacy and laboratory supply expenses increased over the period as we experienced an increased utilization of more expensive drugs and blood products 
additionally  our other general supplies costs incurred price increases resulting in an increase in our overall supply costs 

table of contents other operating expenses the following table summarizes our other operating expenses for the periods presented dollars in millions three months ended december  of of increase increase revenues revenues decrease decrease professional fees utilities repairs and maintenance rents and leases insurance physician recruiting contract services non income taxes other for the three months ended december   our other operating expenses of million increased by million or  as compared to million in the same period last year 
the million increase in other operating expenses for the three months ended december   was primarily the result of increases in professional fees  utilities  insurance  physician recruiting and non income taxes 
our expense for professional fees paid to hospital based physicians increased million or to million during the three months ended december  as a shortage of physicians continues to become more acute  we have experienced increasing professional fees in areas such as anesthesiology and emergency room physician coverage 
also  an increasing number of physicians are demanding that our hospitals retain hospitalists and that they be paid for call coverage in excess of what they are obligated to provide in order to maintain active staff status at our hospitals 
we expect these trends to continue and that professional fees as a percentage of revenue will climb in future periods 
our utilities expense increased for the three months ended december  as compared to the same period last year as a result of higher energy costs experienced nationally 
we anticipate a moderation in the overall level of increase in our utility costs during the increase in our insurance expense during the three months ended december   as compared to the same period last year  was the result of a change in our professional and general liability claims accrual  as we reduced the discount factor from to during the three months ended december  as a result of the decrease in the discount factor  our professional and general liability claims expense increased by approximately million for the three months ended december  physician recruiting expense increased to million in the three months ended december   as compared to the same period last year 
the increase is primarily the result of an increase in the amortization expense associated with a greater number of physician minimum revenue guarantees outstanding and an increase in recruiting fees paid 
to attract and retain qualified physicians  hospitals in small communities are increasingly required to guarantee that these physicians will meet or exceed negotiated minimum income levels 
we expect to experience an increasing number of physician minimum revenue guarantee arrangements and  accordingly  we anticipate higher recruiting fees and increases to the amortization expense associated with the physician minimum revenue guarantee intangible asset during non income taxes increased during the three months ended december   as compared to the same period last year  as a result of the absence of certain sale  use and property tax credits recorded in the period 

table of contents provision for doubtful accounts the following table summarizes our provision for doubtful accounts and related key indicators for the periods presented dollars in millions three months ended december  of of increase increase revenues revenues decrease decrease provision for doubtful accounts related key indicators charity care write offs self pay revenues  net of charity care write offs and uninsured discounts net revenue days outstanding at end of period n a n a our provision for doubtful accounts of million  or of revenues  for the three months ended december   decreased slightly from million  or of revenues  as recognized in same period last year 
the bps improvement as a percentage of revenues is due to our strategic efforts leading to improved cash collections 
specifically  we experienced an increase in both up front cash collections and collections related to insured receivables for the three months ended december   as compared to the same period last year 
the decrease in our provision for doubtful accounts was partially offset by an increase in our charity care write offs that were primarily attributable to an increase in our self pay revenues 
we do not report charity care in our revenues or in our provision for doubtful accounts as it is our policy not to pursue collections of amounts related to these patients 
overall  net revenue days outstanding remained unchanged at days as of december  as compared to december  the provision and allowance for doubtful accounts are critical accounting estimates and are further discussed in critical accounting estimates 
depreciation and amortization our depreciation and amortization expense increased million for the three months ended december  to million  or of revenues  as compared to million  or of revenues  in the same period last year 
the increase in our depreciation and amortization expense is largely a result of capital improvement projects completed during  normal replacement costs of facilities and equipment and the amortization of separately identifiable intangible assets such as non compete agreements 
interest expense our interest expense of million or of revenues  for the three months ended december  was comparable to million  or of revenues  for the same period last year

table of contents provision for income taxes the provision for income taxes was million  or of revenues for the three months ended december   as compared to million  or of revenue for the same period last year 
the decline in the tax provision was primarily the result of reductions in our long term income tax liability as certain statutes of limitation lapses occurred during for the three months ended december  this reduction was partially offset by significant increases in our deferred tax valuation allowance during the same period 
for the years ended december  and revenues the increase in our revenues for as compared to  was primarily the result of an increase in our revenues per equivalent admission 
revenues per equivalent admission increased to  as compared to  in this increase is largely a result of changes in the acuity of our patients  service mix changes related to volume growth in higher reimbursement outpatient diagnostic services  including cts  mris and cardiac catheterization  the impact of favorable commercial pricing  inclusive of improvements in third party payor contracting and benefits associated with medicare s hospital market basket updates 
additionally  we experienced favorable adjustments to our estimated reimbursement settlements that increased revenues by million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
revenues during were negatively impacted by declines in our equivalent admissions 
equivalent admissions of  for declined  as compared to  for  as a result of fewer admissions and overall declines in our inpatient surgeries 
although many of our hospitals experienced widespread flu outbreaks in february and march of  the resulting increase in our emergency room visits did not fully offset our total decline in equivalent admissions for the year 
during  our volumes were negatively impacted by the temporary closure of three of our hospitals in louisiana  as a result of hurricane gustav  as well as the permanent closure of certain unprofitable service lines at a few of our hospitals 
additionally  during we experienced a shift from inpatient admissions to outpatient observations for a portion of our patient population  which further contributed to the decline in equivalent admissions 
although we experienced equivalent admission declines  our volume improved in certain aspects of our business  such as in outpatient diagnostic services  including ct imaging and laboratory services

table of contents the following table shows the sources of our revenues by payor for the periods presented  expressed as a percentage of total revenues  including adjustments to estimated reimbursement amounts years ended december  medicare medicaid hmos  ppos and other private insurers self pay other the table above is inclusive of certain changes we have made to our historical practices regarding sources of revenues 
specifically  we previously classified uninsured discounts as revenue deductions for hmos  ppos and other private insurers 
we changed the classification of uninsured discounts to revenue deductions for self pay revenues effective in our june  quarterly report on form q for all periods previously reported 
this change had no impact on our historical results of operations 
generally  these reclassifications reduced self pay as a percentage of total revenues and increased hmos  ppos  and other private insurers as a percentage of total revenues 
we have determined that it is more appropriate to apply uninsured discounts as revenue deductions against self pay revenues rather than against hmos  ppos and other private insurers revenues

additionally  we experienced an overall increase in our benefit costs  most notably within our medical benefit component 
these increases were partially offset by improvements in our contract labor costs during our stock based compensation increased in  as compared to  as a result of an increase in the number of outstanding unvested stock options and nonvested stock during as we continue to employ an increasing number of medical professionals including physicians  we expect that salaries and benefits as a percentage of revenues will also increase

our expense for professional fees paid to hospital based physicians increased million or  to million during as a shortage of physicians continues to become more acute  we have experienced increasing professional fees in areas such as anesthesiology and emergency room physician coverage 
also  an increasing number of physicians are demanding that our hospitals retain hospitalists and that they be paid for call coverage in excess of what they are obligated to provide in order to maintain active staff status at our hospitals 
we expect these trends to continue and that professional fees as a percentage of revenue will climb in future periods 
our utilities expense increased during as compared to  as a result of higher energy costs experienced nationally 
we anticipate a moderation in the overall level of increase in our utility costs during 
table of contents our insurance expense increased million  or  to million  during as compared to this increase in insurance expense during was the result of an increase in our reserves for professional and general liability claims as a result of higher anticipated settlements for certain claims and an increase in our professional and general liability claims accrual  as we reduced the discount factor from to 
as a result of the decrease in the discount factor  our professional and general liability claims expense increased by approximately million for physician recruiting expense increased to million during as compared to the increase is primarily the result of an increase in the amortization expense associated with a greater number of physician minimum revenue guarantees outstanding and an increase in recruiting fees paid 
to attract and retain qualified physicians  hospitals in small communities are increasingly required to guarantee that these physicians will meet or exceed negotiated minimum income levels 
we expect to experience an increasing number of physician minimum revenue guarantee arrangements and  accordingly  we anticipate higher recruiting fees and increases to the amortization expense associated with the physician minimum revenue guarantee intangible asset

our weighted average monthly interest bearing debt balance  excluding capital leases  decreased from  million during to  million during this decrease was partially offset by an increase in interest expense related to our interest rate swap 
the increase in our interest rate swap interest expense during  as compared to  was the result of an increase in the spread between our payment rate  which is based on an annual fixed rate of and our receipt rate  which is based on the prevailing three month libor floating rate

we made million of discretionary cash contributions to the esop during and million of discretionary cash contributions to the esop during the increase in our stock based compensation expense is the result of an increase in the number of outstanding unvested stock options and nonvested stock and a change in our forfeiture rate methodology 
we changed from a static forfeiture rate methodology to a dynamic forfeiture rate methodology during the dynamic forfeiture rate methodology incorporates the lapse of time into the resulting stock based compensation expense calculation and results in a forfeiture rate that diminishes as the granted awards approach their vest dates 
accordingly  the dynamic forfeiture rate methodology results in a more consistent stock based compensation expense calculation over the vesting period of the award

liquidity and capital resources liquidity our primary sources of liquidity are cash flows provided by our operations and our debt borrowings

our computation of free operating cash flow consists of net cash flows provided by continuing operations less cash flows used for purchase of property and equipment

computations of free operating cash flow may differ from company to company 
therefore  free operating cash flow should be used as a complement to  and in conjunction with  our consolidated statements of cash flows presented in our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report

we assess the effectiveness of this cash flow hedge instrument on a quarterly basis 
we completed an assessment of the cash flow hedge instrument at december   and determined the hedge to be highly effective in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities sfas no 

we completed our quarterly assessments during the years ended december  and  and determined its cash flow hedge was partially ineffective 
because the notional amount of the interest rate swap in effect at certain of the quarterly assessment intervals exceeded our outstanding borrowings under our variable rate debt credit agreement  a portion of the cash flow hedge instrument was determined to be ineffective 
we recognized an increase in interest expense of approximately million and million related to the ineffective portion of our cash flow hedge during the years ended december  and  respectively 
the interest rate swap agreement exposes us to credit risk in the event of non performance by citibank 
however  we do not anticipate non performance by citibank

we estimate that this new accounting standard will increase our interest expense by million and adversely affect our diluted earnings per share by approximately per share during critical accounting estimates the preparation of financial statements in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts and related disclosures 
we consider an accounting estimate to be critical if it requires assumptions to be made that were uncertain at the time the estimate was made  and changes in the estimate or different estimates that could have been made could have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations or financial condition 
our management has discussed the development and selection of these critical accounting estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors and with our independent registered public accounting firm  and they both have reviewed the disclosure presented below relating to our critical accounting estimates 
our critical accounting estimates include the following areas revenue recognition allowance for contractual discounts  allowance for doubtful accounts and provision for doubtful accounts  goodwill impairment analysis  professional and general liability claims  accounting for stock based compensation  and accounting for income taxes 
the following discussion of critical accounting estimates is not intended to be a comprehensive list of all of our accounting policies that require estimates 
we believe that of our significant accounting policies  as discussed in note of our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report  the estimates discussed below involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity 
we believe the current assumptions and other considerations used to estimate amounts reflected in our consolidated financial statements are appropriate 
however  if actual experience differs from the assumptions and other considerations used in estimating amounts reflected in our consolidated financial statements  the resulting changes could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations and our financial condition 

table of contents the discussion that follows presents information about our critical accounting estimates  as well as the effects of hypothetical changes in the material assumptions used to develop each estimate revenue recognition allowance for contractual discounts we recognize revenues in the period in which services are provided 
accounts receivable primarily consist of amounts due from third party payors and patients 
amounts we receive for treatment of patients covered by governmental programs  such as medicare and medicaid  and other third party payors such as hmos  ppos and other private insurers  are generally less than our established billing rates 
accordingly  our gross revenues and accounts receivable are reduced to net realizable value through an allowance for contractual discounts 
approximately  and of our revenues during the years ended december   and  respectively  relate to discounted charges  which were comprised of the following sources as a percentage of total revenues medicare medicaid hmos  ppos and other private insurers revenues are recorded at estimated net amounts due from patients  third party payors and others for healthcare services provided 
for certain payors  such as medicare  medicaid  as well as some managed care payors with which we have contractual arrangements  the contractual allowances are calculated by computerized logging systems based on defined payment terms 
for other payors  the contractual allowances are determined based on historical data by insurance plan 
all contractual adjustments  regardless of type of payor or method of calculation  are reviewed and compared to actual experience 
we monitor our processes for calculating contractual allowances through review of payment discrepancy reports for logged payors  analysis of historical contractual allowance trends based on actual claims paid by hmos  ppos and other private insurers  review of contractual allowance information reflecting current contract terms  consideration and analysis of changes in charge rates and payor mix reimbursement levels  and other issues that may impact contractual allowances 
medicare and medicaid the majority of services performed on medicare and medicaid patients are reimbursed at predetermined reimbursement rates 
the differences between the established billing rates ie  gross charges and the predetermined reimbursement rates are recorded as contractual discounts and deducted from gross charges 
under this prospective reimbursement system  there is no adjustment or settlement of the difference between the actual cost to provide the service and the predetermined reimbursement rates 
discounts for retrospectively cost based revenues are estimated based on historical and current factors and are adjusted in future periods when settlements of filed cost reports are received 
final settlements under these programs are subject to adjustment based on administrative review and audit by third party intermediaries  which can take several years to resolve completely 
adjustments related to final settlements increased our revenues by million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
because the laws and regulations governing the medicare and medicaid programs are complex and subject to change  the estimates of contractual discounts we record could change by material amounts 
a significant increase in our estimate of contractual discounts for medicare and medicaid would lower our earnings 
this would adversely affect our results of operations  financial condition  liquidity and future access to capital 

table of contents hmos  ppos and other private insurers amounts we receive for the treatment of patients covered by hmos  ppos and other private insurers collectively managed care plans are generally less than our established billing rates 
we include contractual allowances as a reduction to revenues in our financial statements based on payor specific identification and payor specific factors for rate increases and denials 
for most managed care plans  estimated contractual allowances are adjusted to actual contractual allowances as cash is received and claims are reconciled 
if our overall estimated contractual discount percentage on our managed care program revenues for the year ended december  were changed by  our after tax income from continuing operations would change by approximately million  or diluted earnings per share of 
this is only one example of reasonably possible sensitivity scenarios 
the process of determining the allowance requires us to estimate the amount expected to be received based on payor contract provisions  historical collection data as well as other factors and requires a high degree of judgment 
it is impacted by changes in managed care contracts and other related factors 
a significant increase in our estimate of contractual discounts for managed care plans would lower our earnings 
this would adversely affect our results of operations  financial condition  liquidity and future access to capital 
allowance for doubtful accounts and provision for doubtful accounts accounts receivable primarily consist of amounts due from third party payors and patients 
our ability to collect outstanding receivables is critical to our results of operations and cash flows 
to provide for accounts receivable that could become uncollectible in the future  we establish an allowance for doubtful accounts to reduce the carrying value of such receivables to their estimated net realizable value 
the primary uncertainty lies with uninsured patient receivables and deductibles  co payments or other amounts due from individual patients 
our allowance for doubtful accounts  included in our consolidated balance sheets as of december  and was million and million  respectively 
our provision for doubtful accounts  included in our consolidated results of operations for the years ended december   and  was million  million and million  respectively 
the largest component of our allowance for doubtful accounts relates to accounts for which patients are responsible  which we refer to as patient responsibility accounts or self pay accounts 
these accounts include both amounts payable by uninsured patients and co payments and deductibles payable by insured patients 
in general  we attempt to collect deductibles  co payments and self pay accounts prior to the time of service for non emergency care 
if we do not collect these patient responsibility accounts prior to the delivery of care  the accounts are handled through our billing and collections processes 
the approximate amounts and percentages of billed insured and uninsured including self pay  co payments  deductibles and medicaid pending gross accounts receivable prior to allowance for contractual discounts and allowance for doubtful accounts in summarized aging categories are as follows for the periods presented in millions december  insured receivables uninsured receivables combined percent of percent of percent of amount receivables amount receivables amount receivables to days to days to days over 
table of contents december  insured receivables uninsured receivables combined percent of percent of percent of amount receivables amount receivables amount receivables to days to days to days over we verify each patient s insurance coverage as early as possible before a scheduled admission or procedure  including with respect to eligibility  benefits and authorization pre certification requirements  in order to notify patients of the amounts for which they will be responsible 
we attempt to verify insurance coverage within a reasonable amount of time for all emergency room visits and urgent admissions in compliance with emtala 
in general  we perform the following steps in collecting accounts receivable if possible  cash collection of deductibles  co payments and self pay accounts prior to or at the time service is provided  billing and follow up with third party payors  collection calls  utilization of collection agencies  and if collection efforts are unsuccessful  write off of the accounts 
our policy is to write off accounts after all collection efforts have failed  which is generally one year after the date of discharge of the patient 
patient responsibility accounts represent the majority of our write offs 
all of our hospitals retain third party collection agencies for billing and collection of delinquent accounts 
at most of our hospitals  more than one collection agency is used to promote competition and improve performance results 
the selection of collection agencies and the timing of referral of an account to a collection agency vary among our hospitals 
we determine the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts utilizing a number of analytical tools and benchmarks 
no single statistic or measurement alone determines the adequacy of the allowance 
specifically  we monitor the revenue trends by payor classification on a month by month basis along with the composition of our accounts receivable agings 
this review is focused primarily on trends in self pay revenues  accounts receivable  co payment receivables and historic payment patterns 
in addition  we analyze other factors such as revenue days in accounts receivable and we review admissions and charges by physicians  primarily focusing on recently recruited physicians 
the process of determining our allowance for doubtful accounts requires us to estimate uncollectible self pay accounts 
our estimate of uncollectible self pay accounts is primarily based on our collection history  adjusted for anticipated changes in collection trends  if significant 
our estimate may be impacted by changes in regional economic conditions  business office operations  payor mix and trends in federal or state governmental healthcare coverage or other third party payors 
if the actual self pay collection percentage would change by from our estimated self pay collection percentage for the year ended december   our after tax income from continuing operations would change by approximately million  or diluted earnings per share of  and our net accounts receivable would change by million at december  the resulting change in this analytical tool is considered to be a reasonably likely change that would affect our overall assessment of this critical accounting estimate 

table of contents goodwill impairment analysis goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net assets of acquired businesses 
our goodwill included in our consolidated balance sheets as of december  and was  and  million  respectively 
please refer to note to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report for a detailed rollforward of our goodwill 
under sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  sfas no 
 goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives are reviewed by us at least annually for impairment 
our business comprises a single operating reporting unit for impairment test purposes 
for the purposes of these analyses  our estimate of fair value are based on a combination of the income approach  which estimates the fair value of us based on our future discounted cash flows  and the market approach  which estimates the fair value of us based on comparable market prices 
our estimate of future discounted cash flows is based on assumptions and projections we believe to be currently reasonable and supportable 
our assumptions take into account revenue and expense growth rates  patient volumes  changes in payor mix  and changes in legislation and other payor payment patterns 
if we determine the carrying value of goodwill is impaired  or if the carrying value of a business that is to be sold or otherwise disposed of exceeds its fair value  then we reduce the carrying value  including any allocated goodwill  to fair value 
during the years ended december  and  we performed our annual impairment tests as of october  and  and did not incur an impairment charge 
during the year ended december   as a result of recent economic events and the decline in our stock price  we performed goodwill impairment testing as of september  and december  we determined that no goodwill impairment charge was required as a result of either analysis and will continue to monitor the relationship of our fair value to its book value as economic events and changes to its stock price occur 
if actual future results are not consistent with our assumptions and estimates  we may be required to record goodwill impairment charges in the future 
professional and general liability claims we are subject to potential medical malpractice lawsuits and other claims 
to mitigate a portion of this risk  we maintain insurance for individual malpractice claims exceeding a self insured retention amount 
for through  our self insured retention levels ranged from million to million  with the exception of certain facilities we operate in states having state specific medical malpractice programs 
each year  we obtain quotes from various malpractice insurers with respect to the cost of obtaining medical malpractice insurance coverage 
we compare these quotes to our most recent actuarially determined estimates of losses at various self insured retention levels 
accordingly  changes in insurance costs affect the self insurance retention level we choose each year 
as insurance costs have increased in recent years  we have accepted a higher level of risk in self insured retention levels 
our reserve for professional and general liability claims reflects the current estimate of all outstanding losses  including incurred but not reported losses  based upon actuarial calculations as of the balance sheet date 
the loss estimates included in the actuarial calculations may change in the future based upon updated facts and circumstances 
our expense for professional and general liability coverage each year includes the actuarially determined estimate of losses for the current year  including claims incurred but not reported  the change in the estimate of losses for prior years based upon actual claims development experience as compared to prior actuarial projections  the insurance premiums for losses in excess of our self insured retention levels  the administrative costs of the insurance program  and interest expense related to the discounted portion of the liability 

table of contents during  we modified our quarterly process for estimating our reserve for professional and general liability claims by reducing the number of actuarial calculations upon which the reserve is determined from the average of two calculations to one 
our reserve calculations consider historical claims data  demographic considerations  severity factors and other actuarial assumptions  which are discounted to present value 
we have discounted our professional and general liability claims reserves to their present value using a discount rate of at december  and at december  as a result of this decrease in discount rate  our professional and general liability claims expense increased by approximately million  which decreased our net income by approximately million and decreased our diluted earnings per share by 
we select a discount rate by considering a risk free interest rate that corresponds to the period when the professional and general liability claims are incurred and projected to be paid 
the following table provides information regarding our reserve for professional and general liability claims at december  and in millions december  december  undiscounted discounted as reported the following table presents the changes in our professional and general liability claims reserve for the years ended december   and in millions reserve at the beginning of the period increase for the provision of current year claims  including discontinued operations increase decrease for the provision of prior year claims  including discontinued operations payments related to current year claims payments related to prior year claims provision for the change in discount rate reserve at the end of the period as of december  and  approximately of our professional and general liability claims reserves represent reserves for settled and unpaid claims 
our average lag time between the settlement and payment of a professional and general liability claim ranges from to weeks 
our estimated reserve for professional and general liability claims will be significantly affected if current and future claims differ from historical trends 
while we monitor reported claims closely and consider potential outcomes when determining our professional and general liability reserves  the complexity of the claims  the extended period of time to settle the claims and the wide range of potential outcomes complicates the estimation process 
in addition  certain states have passed varying forms of tort reform which attempt to limit the amount of medical malpractice awards 
if such laws are passed in the states where our hospitals are located  our loss estimates could decrease 
our estimate of professional and general liability claim reserves are based upon actuarial calculations that are completed quarterly and are significantly influenced by key assumptions and other factors 
these factors include  but are not limited to historical paid claims  trending of loss development factors  trends in the frequency and severity of claims  which can differ significantly by jurisdiction as a result of the legislative and judicial climate in such jurisdictions  coverage limits of third party insurance and actuarial determined statistical confidence levels 
given the number of assumptions and characteristics of each assumption considered in establishing the reserves for professional and general liability claims  it is difficult to compute the individual financial impact of each assumption or groups of assumptions 
some of the assumptions are dependent upon the quantitative measurement of other assumptions  and therefore are not accurately evaluated in isolation 
for example  a change in the frequency of claims assumption is also affected by the estimated severity of these claims resulting in an inability to properly isolate and quantify the impact of a change in this assumption 
professional and general liability claims are typically resolved over an extended period of time  often as long as five years or more 
our professional and general liability claim reserves are comprised of estimated indemnity and expense payments related to reported events and incurred but not reported events as of the end of the period 
we have the ability to reliably determine the amount and timing of payments based on sufficient history of our claims development  the use of external actuarial expertise and our rigorous review process 
actuarial payment patterns are based on our individual hospital historical data both prior to and after our inception in the processes  performed by both external actuaries and our management  enable us to reliably determine the amount of our ultimate losses as well as the timing of the loss settlements such that discounting of the professional and general liability claims reserve is appropriate 
given the number of factors considered in establishing the reserves for professional and general liability claims  it is neither practical nor meaningful to isolate a particular assumption or parameter of the process and calculate the impact of changing that single item 
ultimately  from an actuarial standpoint  the sensitivity in the estimates of professional and general liability claim reserves is reflected in the various actuarial confidence levels 
our best estimate of our professional and general liability claim reserves utilizes a statistical confidence level that is 
higher statistical confidence levels  while not representative of our best estimate  reflect reasonably likely outcomes upon the ultimate resolution of related claims 
using a higher statistical confidence level would increase the estimated professional and general liability claims reserve 
changes in our estimates of professional and general liability claims reserves are non cash charges and accordingly  do not impact our liquidity or capital resources 
the assumptions included in the table below are presented for the sensitivity analysis in millions december  reserve as reported with confidence level with confidence level with confidence level 
table of contents december  reserve as reported with confidence level with confidence level with confidence level favorable trending in our development factors actuarial value of our accuracy in predicting ultimate losses and favorable underlying loss experience within the industry were key factors that resulted in reductions to our prior year reserve levels of professional and general liability claims during we became independent and publicly traded on may  when hca inc distributed all outstanding shares of our stock to our stockholders 
we were indemnified by hca for losses related to insured risks prior to may  during the early period of our spin off from hca  we established initial professional and general liability claims reserves based on our limited operating experience as a stand alone company 
as our professional and general liability claims reserves matured and consistency in the loss development factors occurred  actuarial results required reductions to our prior year reserve levels of professional and general liability claims for state medical malpractice tort law reform legislation also contributed to the improving loss experience throughout the professional and general liability insurance industry during this time period 
this reform favorably affected both the frequency and severity of claims paid throughout the industry 
professional and general liability claims are typically resolved over an extended period of time  often as long as five years or more 
the combination of changing conditions and the extended time required for claim resolution results in a loss estimation process that requires actuarial skill and the application of judgment  and such estimates require periodic revision 
as a result of the variety of factors that must be considered  there is a risk that actual incurred losses may develop differently from estimates 
the results of our quarterly completed actuarial calculations resulted in changes to our reserve levels of professional and general liability claims for prior years 
as a result  this reduced our related professional and general liability insurance expense continuing operations by million for for and  this increased our related professional and general liability insurance expense continuing operations by million and million  respectively 
changes in our initial estimates of professional and general liability claims are non cash charges and accordingly  there would be no material impact on our liquidity or capital resources 
accounting for stock based compensation we issue stock options and other stock based awards nonvested stock  restricted stock and deferred stock units to key employees and directors under our various stockholder approved stock based compensation plans 
we account for our stock based awards in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
r  share based payment sfas no 
r 
in accordance with sfas no 
r  we recognize compensation expense based on the estimated grant date fair value of each stock based award 
our stock based compensation from continuing operations  included in our consolidated results of operations  was million  million and million for  and  respectively 
the fair value of other stock based awards nonvested stock and restricted stock units are determined based on the closing price of our common stock on the day prior to the grant date 
the nonvested stock requires no payment from employees and directors  and stock based compensation expense is recorded equally over the vesting periods ranging from six months to five years 
we estimate the fair value of stock options granted using the hull white ii valuation model hw ii lattice option valuation model and a single option award approach 
we use the hw ii because it considers characteristics of fair value option pricing  such as an option s contractual term and the probability of exercise before the end of the contractual term 
in addition  the complications surrounding the expected term of an option are material  as clarified by the sec focus on the matter in sab no 
given our reasonably large pool of unexercised options  we believe a lattice model that specifically addresses this fact and models a full term of exercises is the most appropriate and reliable means of valuing our stock options 
we are amortizing the fair value on a straight line basis over the requisite service periods of the awards  which are the vesting periods of three years 
the stock options vest on each grant anniversary date over three years of continued employment 

table of contents the following table shows the weighted average assumptions we used to develop the fair value estimates under our hw ii option valuation model and the resulting estimates of weighted average fair value per share of stock options granted during  and expected volatility risk free interest rate range expected dividends average expected term years fair value per share of stock options granted population stratification under sfas no 
r  a company should aggregate individual awards into relatively homogeneous groups with respect to exercise and post vesting employment behaviors for the purpose of refining the expected term assumption  regardless of the valuation technique used to estimate the fair value 
in addition  sab no 
clarifies that a company may generally make a reasonable fair value estimate with as few as one or two groupings 
prior to january   we stratified our employee population into two groups i insiders  who were the section filers under sec rules  and ii non insiders  who were the rest of the employee population 
effective january   we determined that a single employee population group was more appropriate 
we derived our two group stratification prior to january  and post january  single employee grouping based on an analysis of our historical exercise patterns 
expected volatility volatility is a measure of the tendency of investment returns to vary around a long term average rate 
historical volatility is an appropriate starting point for setting this assumption under sfas no 
r 
according to sfas no 
r  companies should also consider how future experience may differ from the past 
this may require using other factors to adjust historical volatility  such as implied volatility  peer group volatility and the range and mean reversion of volatility estimates over various historical periods 
sfas no 
r and sab no 
acknowledge that there is likely to be a range of reasonable estimates for volatility 
in addition  sfas no 
r requires that if a best estimate cannot be made  management should use the mid point in the range of reasonable estimates for volatility 
we estimate the volatility of our common stock at the date of grant based on both historical volatility and implied volatility from traded options of our common stock  consistent with sfas no 
r and sab no 
risk free interest rate lattice models require risk free interest rates for all potential times of exercise obtained by using a grant date yield curve 
a lattice model would  therefore  require the yield curve for the entire time period during which employees might exercise their options 
we base the risk free rate on the implied yield in effect at the time of option grant on united states treasury zero coupon issues with equivalent remaining terms 
expected dividends we have never paid any cash dividends on our common stock and do not anticipate paying any cash dividends in the foreseeable future 
consequently  we use an expected dividend yield of zero 
pre vesting forfeitures pre vesting forfeitures do not affect the fair value calculation  but they affect the expense calculation 
sfas no 
r requires us to estimate pre vesting forfeitures at the time of grant and revise those estimates in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates 
we use historical data to estimate pre vesting forfeitures and record share based compensation expense only for those awards that are expected to vest 

table of contents during  we changed from a static forfeiture rate methodology to a dynamic forfeiture rate methodology 
the dynamic forfeiture rate methodology incorporates the lapse of time into the resulting expense calculation and results in a forfeiture rate that diminishes as the granted awards approach its vest date 
accordingly  the dynamic forfeiture rate methodology results in a more consistent stock compensation expense calculation over the vesting period of the award 
additionally  during  we performed an analysis of our initial pre vesting forfeiture rate percentage and increased our initial pre vesting forfeiture rate ranging from to  up to an initial pre vesting forfeiture rate of 
the increase in our initial pre vesting forfeiture rate reflects the recent forfeiture trends that we experienced and expectations of future forfeitures 
as previously discussed  we utilize the dynamic forfeiture rate methodology  this rate is updated and is reduced accordingly as time lapses until it ultimately reaches zero on the vesting date  contingent upon the continued employment of the grantee 
post vesting cancellations post vesting cancellations include vested options that are cancelled  exercised or expire unexercised 
lattice models treat post vesting cancellations and voluntary early exercise behavior as two separate assumptions 
we use historical data to estimate post vesting cancellations 
expected term sfas no 
r calls for an extinguishment calculation  dependent upon how long a granted option remains outstanding before it is fully extinguished 
while extinguishment may result from exercise  it can also result from post vesting cancellation or expiration at the contractual term 
expected term is an output in lattice models so we do not have to determine this amount 
the fair value calculations of our stock option grants are affected by assumptions that are believed to be reasonable based upon the facts and circumstances at the time of grant 
changes in our volatility estimates can materially affect the fair values of our stock option grants 
if our estimated weighted average volatility for were higher  our after tax income from continuing operations would decrease by approximately million  or per diluted share 
accounting for income taxes deferred tax assets generally represent items that will result in a tax deduction in future years for which we have already recorded the tax benefit in our income statement 
we assess the likelihood that deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income 
to the extent we believe that recovery is not probable  a valuation allowance is established 
to the extent we establish a valuation allowance or increase this allowance  we must include an expense as part of the income tax provision in our results of operations 
our deferred tax asset balances in our consolidated balance sheets were million and million as of december  and  respectively 
our valuation allowances for deferred tax assets in our consolidated balance sheets were million and million as of december  and  respectively 
in addition  significant judgment is required in determining and assessing the impact of certain tax related contingencies 
we establish accruals when  despite our belief that our tax return positions are fully supportable  it is probable that we have incurred a loss related to tax contingencies and the loss or range of loss can be reasonably estimated 
we adjust the accruals related to tax contingencies as part of our provision for income taxes in our results of operations based upon changing facts and circumstances  such as progress of a tax audit  development of industry related examination issues  as well as legislative  regulatory or judicial developments 
a number of years may elapse before a particular matter  for which we have established an accrual  is audited and resolved 
the first step in determining the deferred tax asset valuation allowance is identifying reporting jurisdictions where we have a history of tax and operating losses or are projected to have losses in future periods as a result of changes in operational performance 
we then determine if a valuation allowance should be established against the deferred tax assets for that reporting jurisdiction 

table of contents the second step is to determine the amount of the valuation allowance 
we will generally establish a valuation allowance equal to the net deferred tax asset deferred tax assets less deferred tax liabilities related to the jurisdiction identified in step one of the analysis 
in certain cases  we may not reduce the valuation allowance by the amount of the deferred tax liabilities depending on the nature and timing of future taxable income attributable to deferred tax liabilities 
in assessing tax contingencies  we apply the provisions of fin  which we adopted on january  we apply the recognition threshold and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return and follow the guidance on various matters such as derecognition  interest  penalties and disclosure 
we elected to continue our historical practice of classifying interest and penalties as a component of income tax expense 
during each reporting period  we assess the facts and circumstances related to recorded tax contingencies 
if tax contingencies are no longer deemed probable based upon new facts and circumstances  the contingency is reflected as a reduction of the provision for income taxes in the current period 
our deferred tax assets exceeded our deferred tax liabilities by million as of december   excluding the impact of valuation allowances 
historically  we have produced federal taxable income 
therefore  we believe that the likelihood of our not realizing the federal tax benefit of our deferred tax assets is remote 
however  we do have subsidiaries with a history of tax losses in certain state jurisdictions and  based upon those historical tax losses  we assumed that the subsidiaries would not be profitable in the future for those state s tax purposes 
if our assertion regarding the future profitability of those subsidiaries were incorrect  then our deferred tax assets would be understated by the amount of the valuation allowance of million at december  the irs may propose adjustments for items we have failed to identify as tax contingencies 
if the irs were to propose and sustain assessments equal to of our taxable income for  we would incur million of additional tax payments for plus applicable penalties and interest 
segment reporting we have six operating divisions as of december  each of these six operating divisions has similar economic characteristics consisting of acute care hospitals in non urban communities 
we realign these operating divisions frequently based upon changing circumstances  including acquisition and divestiture activity 
we consider these six operating divisions as one operating segment  healthcare services  for segment reporting purposes and for goodwill impairment testing in accordance with sfas no 
 disclosures about segments of an enterprise and related information sfas no 
 and sfas no 
we have determined that our six operating divisions comprise one segment because of their similar economic characteristics in accordance with paragraph of sfas no 
for the following reasons the treatment of patients in a hospital setting is the only material source of revenues for each of our six operating divisions  the healthcare services provided by each of our operating divisions are generally the same  the healthcare services provided by each of our operating divisions are generally provided to similar types of patients  which is patients in a hospital setting  the healthcare services are primarily provided by the direction of affiliated or employed physicians and by the nurses  lab technicians  and others employed or contracted at each of our hospitals  and the healthcare regulatory environment is generally similar for each of our six operating divisions 

table of contents additionally  as discussed in emerging issues task force eitf topic d  clarification of reporting unit guidance in paragraph of fasb statement no 
eitf d  we determined that our six operating divisions comprise one reporting unit because of their similar economic characteristics in each of the following areas the way we manage our operations and extent to which our acquired facilities are integrated into our existing operations as a single reporting unit  our goodwill is recoverable from the collective operations of our six operating divisions and not individually from one single operating division  our operating divisions are frequently realigned based upon changing circumstances  including acquisition and divestiture activity  and because of the collective size of its six operating divisions  each division benefits from its participation in a group purchasing organization 
inflation the healthcare industry is labor intensive 
wages and other expenses increase during periods of inflation and when labor shortages in marketplaces occur 
in addition  suppliers pass along rising costs to us in the form of higher prices 
private insurers pass along their rising costs in the form of lower reimbursement to us 
our ability to pass on these increased costs in increased rates is limited because of increasing regulatory and competitive pressures and the fact that the majority of our revenues are fee based 
accordingly  inflationary pressures could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the following discussion relates to our exposure to market risk based on changes in interest rates outstanding debt we have an interest rate swap to manage our exposure to changes in interest rates 
the interest rate swap converts a portion of our indebtedness to a fixed rate with a notional amount of million at december  and at an annual fixed rate of 
accordingly  we are slightly exposed to market risk related to fluctuations in interest rates 
the notional amount of the swap agreement represents a balance used to calculate the exchange of cash flows and is not an asset or liability 
any market risk or opportunity associated with this swap agreement is offset by the opposite market impact on the related debt 
our interest rate swap agreement exposes us to credit risk in the event of non performance by citibank 
however  we do not anticipate non performance by citibank 
as of december   we had outstanding debt of  million   or million  of which was subject to variable rates of interest 
however  our interest rate swap decreases our variable rate debt as a percentage of our outstanding debt from to as of december  our term b loans  notes and debentures were the only long term debt instruments where the carrying amounts differed from their fair value as of december  and the carrying amount and fair value of these instruments as of december  and were as follows in millions carrying amount fair value term b loans notes debentures the fair values of our term b loans  debentures and notes were based on the quoted prices at december  and cash balances certain of our outstanding cash balances are invested overnight with high credit quality financial institutions 
we do not hold direct investments in auction rate securities  collateralized debt obligations  structured investment vehicles or mortgage backed securities 
we do not have significant exposure to changing interest rates on invested cash at december  as a result  the interest rate market risk implicit in these investments at december   if any  is low
