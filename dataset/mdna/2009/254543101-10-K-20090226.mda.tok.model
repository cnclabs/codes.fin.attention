business outlook for we expect to see a further slowdown in global economic activity and a decrease in global demand for our products  in particular in the consumer  computer and automotive markets 
the success of our business depends  among other factors  on the strength of the global economy and the stability of the financial markets  which in term affect our customers demand for our products  the ability of our customers to meet their payment obligations  the likelihood of customers canceling or deferring existing orders and end user consumers demand for items containing our products in the end markets we serve 
we believe the long term outlook for our business remains generally favorable despite the recent volatility in the equity and credit markets as we continue to execute on the strategy that has proven successful for us over the years 
although the economy creates a more challenging environment for all businesses  we believe that over the long term we are well positioned for future growth 
we are confident that our acquisition of zetex will continue to add significant value to our business as we further capitalize on the cross selling opportunities and diversification benefits that the transaction offers our company 
see risk factors global economic weakness and the current financial market uncertainty has had  and is expected to continue to have through at least  a material adverse effect on our business 
in part i  item a of this annual report 
cost reduction initiative looking forward  we expect the weakness and uncertainty in the economy to continue into the coming quarters  and therefore we have taken  or intend to take  the following steps to optimize our cost structure shut down of zetex inch wafer fabrication line in oldham  england  consolidate our wafer output lines  currently  our shanghai facilities are under loaded  therefore  we are transferring the production of products acquired in our purchase of zetex into our shanghai packaging facilities sooner than originally planned and thereby reducing our dependence on subcontractors and maximizing the utilization of our internal capacity  as part of our manufacturing strategy  we plan to reduce inventory and will continue to evaluate our raw material costs in order to reduce our gold consumption while protecting and maintaining product performance  reduce capital expenditures from our previous to percent model to less than until such time that the market recovers and additional manufacturing capacity is needed  restructure our product development organization and consolidate the acquired zetex design teams  headcount reductions across the entire organization  primarily at our wafer fabrication facilities in kansas city and oldham  temporary site shut downs and mandatory time off  and implement a hiring and compensation freeze  and from an overall expense perspective  implement strict controls over discretionary spending in order to conserve cash 
overview we are currently experiencing a global decrease in demand for our products and expect the decrease in demand to continue until economic conditions improve 
even as we are experiencing a decrease in product demand  our strategy is to continue to enhance our position as a leading global manufacturer and supplier of high quality semiconductor products  and to continue to add other product lines  such as power management products  using our packaging technology capability 
as described in business our strategy in part i  item of this annual report  the principal elements of our strategy include the following continue to rapidly introduce innovative discrete and analog semiconductor products  expand our available market opportunities  maintain intense customer focus  enhance cost competitiveness  and pursue selective strategic acquisitions 
in implementing this strategy  the following factors have affected  and  we believe  will continue to affect  our results of operations the current economic downturn has resulted in a decrease in demand for our products  which we expect to continue until economic conditions improve 
as a result  for  we do not expect to sustain our historical growth rate 
in addition  our net sales for reflect the impact of the overall weakening economy  in particular on key targeted end equipment in the consumer and computing markets  as well as our foundry and subcontracting business  which showed greater weakness than our core revenue drivers 
we have experienced substantial pressure from our customers and competitors to reduce the selling price of our products 
see risk factors we are and will continue to be under continuous pressure from our customers and competitors to reduce the price of our products  which could adversely affect our growth and profit margins in part i  item a of this annual report 
although we do not expect to sustain our historical growth rate in  we expect any future improvements in net income to result primarily from increases in sales volume and improvements in product mix  which will continue to improve the average selling prices of our products 
sales of new products products that have been sold for three years or less for the years ended december   and amounted to  and of total sales  respectively  including the contribution of recent acquisitions 
new products generally have gross profit margins that are higher than the margins of our standard products 
we believe the sales from new products is an important measure given the short life cycles of some of our products 
see risk factors our business may be adversely affected by obsolete inventories as a result of changes in demand for our products and change in life cycles of our products in part i  item a of this annual report for additional information about product life cycles 
our gross profit margin was in  compared to in and in our gross profit margin decrease in was affected by lower capacity utilization at our manufacturing operations primarily due to current economic conditions along with the one time non cash expense of million incurred during the third quarter of for the increase in inventory for reasonable profit allowance in accordance with financial accounting standards board fasb statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 business combinations and depreciation expense of fixed assets in connection with the zetex acquisition 
in  we completed the move of our analog product from taiwan to our shanghai manufacturing facilities to increase the gross margin on this product line 
future gross profit margins will depend primarily on our utilization  product mix  cost savings  and the demand for our products 
we expect gross profit margins to continue to remain under significant pressure until economic conditions improve 
for  the percentage of our net sales derived from our asian subsidiaries was  compared to in and in we expect our net sales to the asian market to increase as a percentage of our total net sales as a result of our customers continuing to shift their manufacturing of electronic products to asia 
as a result of the zetex acquisition we have added significant revenue in europe 
as such  europe accounted for approximately of our revenues in as of december   we had invested approximately million in our manufacturing facilities in china 
during  we invested approximately million in these manufacturing facilities  and we expect to continue to invest in our manufacturing facilities  although the amount to be invested will depend on product demand and new product developments 
for  our capital expenditures were approximately of annual revenue 
given the current economic conditions and our efforts to reduce costs  we expect capital expenditures to be less than of revenue for or until economic conditions improve and additional manufacturing capacity is needed 
we increased our investment in research and development from million in to million in  primarily as a result of the zetex acquisition 
in  research and development expenses were approximately of net sales 
although research and development increased in  we expect the investment to decrease for as we are planning to restructure our product development organization and consolidate our design teams and to reduce costs  but to increase as a percentage of net sales due to the lower expected net sales 
convertible senior notes on october   we issued and sold convertible senior notes with an aggregate principal amount of million due notes  which pay interest per annum on the principal amount of the notes  payable semi annually in arrears on april and october of each year  beginning on april  the notes will be convertible into cash or  at our option  cash and shares of our common stock based on an initial conversion rate  subject to adjustment  of shares split adjusted per  principal amount of notes which represents an initial conversion price of per share  split adjusted  in certain circumstances 
in addition  following a make whole fundamental change that occurs prior to october   we will  at our option  increase the conversion rate for a holder who elects to convert its notes in connection with such make whole fundamental change  in certain circumstances 
during the fourth quarter of and the first quarter of  we repurchased million and million principle amount of the notes for approximately million and million in cash  respectively

the apd acquisition further strengthens our technology leadership in the standard semiconductor market and expand our product capabilities across important segments of our end markets 
on june   the company completed the acquisition of all the outstanding ordinary capital stock of zetex  a company incorporated under the laws of england and wales 
the zetex shareholders received pence in cash per zetex ordinary share  valuing the fully diluted share capital of zetex at approximately us million based on a usd gbp exchange rate of  excluding acquisition costs  fees and expenses 
in addition  in order to finance the acquisition  the company entered into a loan agreement for million that was later replaced with a no net cost loan

the following discussion explains in greater detail our consolidated operating results and financial condition 
this discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto appearing elsewhere in this annual report in thousands 
year compared to year net sales net sales for increased million to million from million for the increase was due primarily to a increase in units sold and a increase in average selling prices asp 
the revenue increase was attributable to sales increases in all industry segments mainly due to the zetex acquisition  partially offset by an overall weakening of global demand due to the global economic downturn  as well as our foundry and subcontracting businesses  which showed greater weakness than our core revenue drivers 
significant price pressure and an unfavorable commodity based product mix also negatively affected sales in the following table sets forth the geographic breakdown of our net sales for the periods indicated based on the country to which the product is billed net sales for the year percentage of ended december net sales china taiwan united states korea germany singapore england all others total cost of goods sold gross profit gross profit margin cost of goods sold increased million  or  for compared to million for as a percent of sales  cost of goods sold increased from for to for our average unit cost aup for discrete devices decreased approximately from  aups for analog products decreased approximately  and aups for wafer products increased approximately 
the increase in cost of goods sold and the percentage of sales increase were negatively affected by the one time non cash expense of million incurred during the third quarter of for the increase of inventory for reasonable profit allowance and depreciation expense related to fixed assets in connection with the zetex acquisition along with lower capacity utilization in our manufacturing operations due primarily to market conditions 
as per sfas r  included in cost of goods sold for and were million and million  respectively  of non cash  share based compensation expenses associated with our manufacturing facilities 
gross profit for increased to million from million for gross profit margin as a percentage of net sales was for  compared to for the decreased gross margin was primarily due to the increase of inventory for reasonable profit allowance and depreciation expense of fixed assets in connection with the zetex acquisition and lower capacity utilization in our manufacturing operations 
selling  general and administrative sg a sg a for increased approximately million  or  to million  compared to million for  due primarily to additional sg a expenses related to the zetex operations

the following expense categories increased  mainly due to additional zetex r d expenses i million increase in wages and related benefits and ii million increase in operating expenses  depreciation  building maintenance and operating expense 
as per sfas no 
r  included in r d for and were million and million  respectively  of non cash  share based compensation expenses 
amortization of acquisition related intangible assets amortization of acquisition related intangibles for increased million to million from million for the increase was due primarily to approximately million of non cash amortization expense associated with the preliminary identification of intangible assets in connection with the acquisition of zetex 
the charge related to seven months of amortization expense and we estimate this charge to be approximately million per quarter for based on preliminary projections 
in process research and development ipr d during the third quarter of fiscal  per sfas no 
 we recorded an approximately million one time  non cash expense associated with the preliminary identification of acquired intangible ipr d in connection with the acquisition of zetex  which had not yet reached technological feasibility and had no alternative future use as of the zetex acquisition date 
restructuring charge in the years ended december  and  we recorded approximately million and million in restructuring charges  respectively 
we have recorded various restructuring charges to reduce our cost structure to enhance operating effectiveness and improve future profitability 
these restructuring activities impacted several functional areas of our operations in different locations and were undertaken to meet specific business objectives in light of the facts and circumstances at the time of each restructuring event 
for  these charges included costs to reduce the headcount in our uk operations along with additional headcount reductions in our worldwide workforce 
for  these charges include costs related to the consolidation of our analog wafer probe and final test operations from hsinchu  taiwan to our manufacturing facilities in shanghai  china  which primarily consisted of termination and severance costs  and impairment of fixed assets 
interest income interest income for was million  compared to million for  due primarily to a decrease in interest income earned on our ars 
interest income for on our ars has been impacted by the continued turmoil in the credit markets 
interest expense interest expense for was million  compared to million for the million increase is due primarily to interest expense related to the million loan used to finance the june zetex acquisition 
interest expense related to the convertible senior notes was approximately million in both and beginning january   we are required to adopt fsp apb  which will require us to separately account for a liability and equity component of the convertible senior notes 
the liability portion of the notes will reflect an estimated non convertible borrowing rate 
we therefore expect to record an additional pre tax  non cash interest expense of approximately to million for other income expense other income for was million  compared to other expense of million for the million increase was due primarily to a gain from extinguishments of debt in the fourth quarter of  we repurchased million of our million convertible senior notes for approximately million in cash  which reduces our convertible debt to million and million foreign currency transaction gains due primarily to favorable taiwan currency and china currency exchange rate changes during the year  offset by approximately million of loss from forward contract hedging related to hedging the zetex acquisition purchase price  and million foreign currency transaction losses due primarily to strengthening of the us dollar versus the british pound negatively affecting foreign currency hedges entered into by zetex prior to our acquisition 
income tax provision we recognized income tax expense of million for  resulting in an effective tax rate of  as compared to for our lower effective tax rate compared with the same period last year was the result of income tax refunds in china and the favorable settlement of income tax audits in taiwan  partially offset by the purchase accounting adjustments from the zetex acquisition and the repatriation of earnings from our hong kong subsidiary 
for  we anticipate our full year effective tax rate to be in the mid teen range as we continue to take advantage of available strategies to optimize our tax rate across the jurisdictions in which we operate 
minority interest in consolidated subsidiaries minority interest in consolidated subsidiaries primarily represented the minority investor s share of the earnings of our china and taiwan subsidiaries for the year 
the joint venture investments were eliminated in the consolidations of our financial statements  and the activities of our china and taiwan subsidiaries were included therein

net income net income decreased to million or basic earnings per share and diluted earnings per share for  compared to million or basic earnings per share and diluted earnings per share for  due primarily to increasing pressure on asp and lower gross profit margin  deteriorating global economy and approximately million in purchase price adjustments related to the zetex acquisition 
year compared to year net sales net sales for increased million to million from million for the increase was due primarily to a increase in units sold  offset by a decrease in asp 
the decrease in asp was due to the price pressure on our product lines

net income net income increased to million or basic earnings per share and diluted earnings per share for  compared to million or basic earnings per share and diluted earnings per share for  due primarily to increased revenue  higher net interest income from short term investments and a lower effective tax rate 
financial condition liquidity and capital resources due to the weakness of the global economy and recent changes to our organizational structure to maximize efficiencies and reduce costs  we have engaged in an in depth review of our cash requirements  current cash balances  future cash availability and our borrowing costs 
as part of this review  we have sought to reduce our interest expense by taking the following steps in january  we borrowed an additional million against our no net cost loan facility with ubs bank usa  bringing the total outstanding balance to million 
see below for additional information about our no net cost loan facility 
due to the lower interest rate earned on cash balances by one of our foreign subsidiaries and higher interest rate charged to borrow cash in the us  we transferred approximately million from that foreign subsidiary into our us bank account during the first quarter of in february  we paid in full the outstanding balance on our revolving credit commitment and our term loan facility and terminated our amended and restated credit agreement and covenant agreement with union bank 
we have no current plans to replace these credit facilities  however  should future business needs arise and the credit markets permit  we may seek to obtain additional credit facilities 
our primary sources of liquidity are cash  funds from operations and borrowings under our credit facilities 
our primary liquidity requirements have been to meet our inventory and capital expenditure needs 
for  and  our working capital was million  million  and million  respectively 
our working capital decreased in mainly due to the re classification of our ars portfolio from current assets to long term assets as a result of the their lack of liquidity 
we expect cash generated by our us and international operations  together with existing cash  cash equivalents  and available credit facilities to be sufficient to cover cash needs for working capital and capital expenditures for at least the next months 
cash and cash equivalents  the conversion of other working capital items and borrowings are expected to be sufficient to fund on going operations 
on october   we issued and sold convertible senior notes with an aggregate principal amount of million due notes  which pay interest per annum on the principal amount of the notes  payable semi annually in arrears on april and october of each year  beginning on april  in connection with the issuance of the notes  we incurred approximately million of issuance costs  which primarily consisted of investment banker fees  legal and accounting fees 
these costs are classified within other assets and are being amortized as a component of interest expense using the straight line method over the life of the notes from issuance through october  during the fourth quarter of and the first quarter of  we repurchased million and million principal amount of the notes for approximately million and million in cash  respectively 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements of this annual report for additional information about the notes and the repurchase 
in  and  our capital expenditures were million  million and million  respectively 
our capital expenditures for these periods were primarily related to manufacturing expansion in our facilities in china and  to a lesser extent  our wafer fabrication facility in the us  and an office building in taiwan 
capital expenditures for were approximately of revenue 
until economic conditions improve  we expect capital expenditures to be approximately of revenue for as of december   we had million invested in ars  which are classified as long term  trading securities 
with the liquidity issues experienced in the global credit and capital markets  our ars have experienced multiple failed auctions 
while we continue to earn and receive interest on these investments at the maximum contractual rate  the estimated fair values of these ars no longer approximates par value 
on october   we reached a settlement with ubs ag and affiliates ubs ag  in regard to our ars portfolio  which gives us the option to put the million ars portfolio back to ubs ag at any time from june  through july  at par value in exchange for cash 
upon entering into this settlement  we elected the fair value option and recorded the put right at its fair value and a related gain 
in addition  we transferred our ars portfolio from an available for sale category to a trading category of investments 
upon transferring the ars portfolio to a trading category  all of the previously unrealized holding losses included in comprehensive income were recognized in earnings 
as a result of categorizing the ars as trading investments and the election of the fair value option for the put right  all future changes in fair value for both of these financial instruments will be recognized in earnings and are expected to offset  thereby creating accounting symmetry at inception of the settlement and during each period until we exercise our put option 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements and risk factors our auction rate securities ars are currently illiquid and we cancelled our bank credit facility in the us  therefore  we must rely solely upon existing cash reserves  available foreign credit facilities and funds from existing operations to finance future operations in part i  item a of this annual report for additional information about our settlement with ubs ag 
on march   in connection with the acquisition of zetex  we entered into a million margin loan with ubs financial services  inc  which accrued interest and was secured by our ars portfolio 
on november   we accepted an offer of a no net cost loan  which replaced the margin loan  from ubs bank usa ubs bank  an affiliate of ubs ag and is collateralized by our ars portfolio 
the no net cost loan allows us to draw up to of the stated value of our ars portfolio  as determined by the ubs bank  and is subject to collateral maintenance requirements 
under the no net cost loan  the interest rate we pay on the no net cost loan will not exceed the interest rate earned on the pledged ars portfolio 
subsequent to the agreement  we drew up to the stated value limit  or million of our ars portfolio  as determined by ubs bank 
as of december   the balance of the no net cost loan was million and classified as long term debt 
since we have drawn up to the limit and the stated value of the ars has decreased  we cannot draw additional funds from the no net cost loan until of the stated value of the ars exceeds million  at which time we can draw additional funds 
although we cannot currently draw additional funds  we are not required to repay any part of the no net cost loan that exceeds of the stated value of the ars portfolio 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements of this annual report for additional information about our no net cost loan 
discussion of cash flows cash and short term investments have increased from million at december   to million at december   then decreased to million at december  the increase from to was primarily due to the short term investments purchased with proceeds from the million convertible senior notes 
the decrease during was mainly due to the reclassification of our ars portfolio from short term to long term investments

debt instruments on march   we entered into a fourth amendment to our us credit agreement with union bank of california  us union bank fourth amended credit agreement or revolving credit agreement 
under the fourth amended credit agreement the company had available a revolving credit commitment of up to million increased from million  including a million letter of credit sub facility and a term loan facility of million 
as of december   there were no amounts outstanding under the revolving credit commitment and approximately million was outstanding under the term loan 
on february   we paid in full the outstanding balance of approximately million on our revolving credit commitment with union bank and terminated the amended and restated credit agreement that governed the revolving credit commitment 
on february   we paid in full the outstanding balance of approximately million on our union bank term loan facility and terminated the covenant agreement that governed that facility  which was scheduled to mature on august  on march   we obtained from ubs a letter of credit in favor of diodes fabtech inc  in an aggregate amount of million the letter of credit 
in connection with the acquisition of zetex  we drew million on the letter of credit  which accrued interest and was secured by our ars portfolio 
on november   we accepted an offer of no net cost loan  which replaced the letter of credit  from ubs bank and is collateralized by our ars portfolio 
the no net cost loan allows us to draw up to of the stated value of our ars portfolio  as determined by ubs bank 
under the no net cost loan  the interest rate we pay on the no net cost loan will not exceed the interest rate earned on the pledged ars portfolio 
as of december   the balance of the no net cost loan was million and it was classified as long term debt 
see liquidity and capital resources above and see note of notes to consolidated financial statements in this annual report for additional information about our no net cost loan 
as of december   our asia and europe subsidiaries have available lines of credit of up to an aggregate of million  with several financial institutions 
these lines of credit  except for one taiwanese credit facility  are collateralized by each subsidiary s premises  are unsecured  uncommitted and  in some instances  may be repayable on demand 
loans under these lines of credit bear interest at libor or similar indices plus a specified margin 
at december   million was outstanding on these lines of credit  and the interest rates ranged from to 
in october   we issued and sold convertible senior notes with an aggregate principal amount of million due  which pay interest per annum on the principal amount of the notes  payable semi annually in arrears on april and october of each year  beginning on april  interest will accrue on the notes from and including october  or from and including the last date in respect of which interest has been paid or provided for  as the case may be  to  but excluding  the next interest payment date or maturity date  as the case may be 
commencing with the six month period beginning october   and for each six month period thereafter  we will  on the interest payment date for such interest period  pay contingent interest to the holders of the notes under certain circumstances and in amounts described in the indenture 
for us federal income tax purposes  we treat  and each holder of the notes agreed under the indenture to treat  the notes as contingent payment debt instruments governed by special tax rules and to be bound by our application of those rules to the notes 
during the fourth quarter of and the first quarter of  we repurchased million and million principal amount of the notes for approximately million and million in cash  respectively 
beginning january   we will adopt fsp apb  which will change how we account for our notes and will significantly increase our non cash interest expense 
see recently issued accounting pronouncements below for additional information about fsp apb and see note of notes to consolidated financial statements in this annual report for additional information about the notes and the repurchase 
we may from time to time seek to repurchase our outstanding debt in the open market  in privately negotiated transactions or otherwise 
such repurchases  if any  will depend on prevailing market conditions  our liquidity requirements  contractual restrictions and other factors 
the amounts involved may be material 
off balance sheet arrangements we do not have any transactions  arrangements and other relationships with unconsolidated entities that will affect our liquidity or capital resources 
we have no special purpose entities that provided off balance sheet financing  liquidity or market or credit risk support  nor do we engage in leasing  hedging or research and development services  that could expose us to liability that is not reflected on the face of our financial statements 
contractual obligations the following table represents our contractual obligations as of december  payments due by period in thousands less than more than total year years years years long term debt capital leases operating leases defined benefit obligations purchase obligations total obligations on each of october   october  and october   holders of our convertible senior notes may require the company to purchase all or a portion of their notes at a purchase price in cash equal to of the principal amount of the notes to be purchased  plus any accrued and unpaid interest to  but excluding  the purchase date 
per fasb interpretation fin no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes fin  liabilities are not included in the above contractual obligations as we can not make reasonable estimates of the amount and period in which those tax liabilities would be paid 
see accounting for income taxes below and note of notes to consolidated financial statements of this annual report for additional information regarding fin critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states of america gaap requires that management make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  which are based upon historical experiences  market trends and financial forecasts and projections  and upon various other assumptions that management believes to be reasonable under the circumstances at that certain point in time 
actual results may differ  significantly at times  from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies and estimates affect the significant estimates and judgments we use in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements  and may involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity than others 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue when there is persuasive evidence that an arrangement exists  when delivery has occurred  when our price to the buyer is fixed or determinable and when collectability of the receivable is reasonably assured 
these elements are met when title to the products is passed to the buyers  which is generally when our product is shipped to our customers 
we reduce revenue in the period of sale for estimates of product returns  distributor price adjustments and other allowances  the majority of which are related to our us operations 
our reserve estimates are based upon historical data as well as projections of revenues  distributor inventories  price adjustments  average selling prices and market conditions 
actual returns and adjustments could be significantly different from our estimates and provisions  resulting in an adjustment to revenues 
inventories inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market value 
cost is determined principally by the first in  first out method 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our inventory  both finished goods and raw material  for obsolescence and slow moving items 
this evaluation includes analysis of sales levels  sales projections  and purchases by item  as well as raw material usage related to our manufacturing facilities 
if our review indicates a reduction in utility below carrying value  we reduce our inventory to a new cost basis 
if future demand or market conditions are different than our current estimates  an inventory adjustment may be required  and would be reflected in cost of goods sold in the period the revision is made 
accounting for income taxes as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements  we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the tax jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process involves using an asset and liability approach whereby deferred tax assets and liabilities are recorded for differences in the financial reporting bases and tax bases of our assets and liabilities 
deferred tax accounting requires that we evaluate net deferred tax assets by jurisdiction to determine if these assets will more likely than not be realized in the foreseeable future 
this test requires the consideration of the reversal of temporary differences between book and tax basis  the projection of our taxable income into future years and the use of tax planning strategies to determine if it is more likely than not that we will realize the tax assets 
this analysis requires considerable judgment and is subject to change to reflect future events and changes in the tax laws 
we are involved in various tax matters  some of whose outcome is uncertain 
for purposes of evaluating whether or not a tax position is uncertain i we presume the tax position will be examined by the relevant taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information  ii technical merits of a tax position are derived from authorities such as legislation and statutes  legislative intent  regulations  rulings and case law and their applicability to the facts and circumstances of the tax position  and iii each tax position is evaluated without consideration of the possibility of offset or aggregation with other tax positions taken 
a tax benefit from an uncertain position may be recognized only if it is more likely than not that the position is sustainable  based on its technical merits  and the tax benefit of a qualifying position is the largest amount of tax benefits that is greater than likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement with a taxing authority having full knowledge of all relevant information 
we adopted the provisions of fin  effective january  as a result of the implementation of fin  we recorded an approximate million increase in the liability for unrecognized tax benefits  primarily related to our foreign subsidiaries  which was accounted for as a reduction to the january  retained earnings balance 
allowance for doubtful accounts we evaluate the collectability of our accounts receivable based upon a combination of factors  including the current business environment and historical experience 
if we are aware of a customer s inability to meet its financial obligations to us  we record an allowance to reduce the receivable to the amount we reasonably believe we will be able to collect from the customer 
for all other customers  we record an allowance based upon the amount of time the receivables are past due 
if actual accounts receivable collections differ from these estimates  an adjustment to the allowance may be necessary with a resulting effect on operating expense 
goodwill and long lived assets goodwill is the cost of an acquisition less the fair value of the net assets of the acquired business 
as of december   goodwill was million 
we account for goodwill in accordance with sfas no 
goodwill and other intangible assets  for which goodwill is tested for impairment at least annually and between annual tests if indicators of potential impairment exist 
in  we changed the timing of our annual goodwill impairment testing from december to october to allow us to complete the testing in advance of our year end closing 
the fair value of the reporting units was calculated using the income approach and the market approach 
under the income approach  the fair value of the reporting units was calculated by estimating the present value of associated future cash flows 
under the market approach  the fair value was calculated using the guideline public company method and the mergers and acquisitions method 
we determined that the fair value of the reporting units exceeds the carrying value of units  thus indicating that the goodwill was not impaired as of the testing date 
we assess the impairment of certain long lived assets at least annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
we assess the recoverability of our long lived and intangible assets by determining whether the unamortized balances can be recovered through undiscounted future net cash flows of the related assets 
if such asset is considered to be impaired  the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its fair market value using a discounted cash flow analysis 
share based compensation we account for share based compensation in accordance with sfas no 
r  share based payments 
we use the black scholes merton model  consistent with prior period valuations under sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  to determine the fair value of stock options on the date of grant 
restricted stock grants are measured based on the fair market value of the underlying stock on the date of grant 
the amount of compensation expense recognized using the black scholes merton model requires us to exercise judgment and make assumptions relating to the factors that determine the fair value of our stock option grants 
the fair value calculated by this model is a function of several factors  including the grant price  the expected future volatility  the expected term of the option and the risk free interest rate of the option 
the expected term and expected future volatility of the options require our judgment 
in addition  we are required to estimate the expected forfeiture rate and only recognize expense for those stock options expected to vest 
we estimate the forfeiture rate based on historical experience and to the extent our actual forfeiture rate is different from our estimate  share based compensation expense is adjusted accordingly 
fair value measurements on january   we adopted the methods of fair value as described in sfas no 
 fair value measurements  to value our ars portfolio 
sfas no 
 among other things  defines fair value  establishes a consistent framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosures for each major asset and liability category measured at fair value on either a recurring or nonrecurring basis 
sfas no 
clarifies that fair value is an exit price  representing the amount that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants 
as such  fair value is market based measurement that should be determined based on the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an assets or liability 
sfas no 
establishes a three tier fair value hierarchy  which prioritizes the inputs used in measuring fair value as following level observable inputs such as quoted prices inactive market 
level inputs other than the quoted prices in active markets that are observable either directly or indirectly 
level unobservable inputs in which there is little or no market data  which requires the reporting entity to develop its own assumptions 
due to lack of observable market quotes on our ars portfolio and put option  we utilized a valuation model that relies exclusively on level inputs including those that are based on factors that reflect assumptions market participants would use in pricing  including  among others relevant future market conditions including those that are based on the expected cash flow streams  the underlying financial condition and credit quality of the issuer and bond insurer  the percent of the federal family education loan program ffelp guaranty  and the maturity of the securities  as well as the market activity of similar securities 
the valuation of our ars investment portfolio is subject to uncertainties that are difficult to predict 
factors that may impact our valuation include changes to credit rating of the securities as well as to the underlying assets supporting those securities  rates of default of the underlying assets  underlying collateral value  discount rates  counterpart risk and ongoing strength and quality of market credit and liquidity 
defined benefit plan we maintain pension plans covering certain of our employees in the united kingdom uk and germany 
for financial reporting purposes  the net pension and supplemental retirement benefit obligations and the related periodic pension costs are calculated based upon  among other things  assumptions of the discount rate for plan obligations  estimated return on pension plan assets and mortality rates 
these obligations and related periodic costs are measured using actuarial techniques and assumptions 
the projected unit credit method is the actuarial cost method used to compute the pension liabilities and related expenses 
asset retirement obligations we recognize assets retirement obligations aro s when incurred  with the initial measurement at fair value 
these liabilities are accreted to full value over time through charges to income 
in addition  asset retirement costs are capitalized as part of the related asset s carrying value and are depreciated over the assets respective useful life 
our aro s consist primarily of estimated costs to return leased property to its original condition 
the liabilities of million for aro s are included in our consolidated balance sheet as other long term liabilities 
investment in joint venture investment in joint ventures over which we have the ability to exercise significant influence and that  in general  are at least percent owned are stated at cost plus equity in undistributed net income loss of the joint venture 
these investments are evaluated for impairment in accordance with the requirements of accounting principles board opinion no 
 the equity method of accounting for investments in common stock 
an impairment loss would be recorded whenever a decline in the value of an equity investment below its carrying amount is determined to be other than temporary 
in judging other than temporary  we would consider the length of time and extent to which the fair value of the investment has been less than the carrying amount of the investment  the near term and longer term operating and financial prospects of the investee  and our long term intent of retaining the investment in the investee 
the value of our investment in joint venture of million is included in our consolidated balance sheet as other assets 
contingencies from time to time  we are involved in a variety of legal matters that arise in the normal course of business 
based on information available  we evaluate the likelihood of potential outcomes 
in accordance with sfas no  accounting for contingencies  we record the appropriate liability when the amount is deemed probable and reasonably estimable 
in addition  we do not accrue for estimated legal fees and other directly related costs as they are expensed as incurred

 accounting for convertible debt and debt issued with stock purchase warrants 
fsp apb also specifies that issuers of such instruments should separately account for the liability and equity components in a manner that will reflect the entity s nonconvertible debt borrowing rate 
previous guidance provided for accounting of this type of convertible debt instruments entirely as debt 
fsp apb is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after december  we have considered the future impacts and required disclosures of this pronouncement and believe it will result in material adjustments in accounting for our originally issued million convertible senior notes issued in october furthermore  all adjustments are required to be made retrospectively as of the date of issuance of the convertible senior notes and therefore  will be treated as if convertible senior notes have always been accounted for in accordance with this pronouncement 
this retrospective treatment will require us to restate the amounts included in previously issued financial statements in future filings 
preliminarily  when we restate our consolidated statements of income for the years and  we expect to increase our non cash interest expense and decrease its deferred tax expense by approximately million and approximately million for each year  respectively 
also  our million pre tax gain on extinguishment of debt and deferred tax expense for will be reduced by approximately million non cash and approximately million  respectively 
in addition  when we restate our december  balance sheet we expect to reduce our long term debt from million to approximately million 
the deferred tax liability associated with the convertible debt instrument will also decrease by approximately million 
for  we expect to record an additional non cash interest expense of approximately to million 
this amount is less than in and due to the extinguishment of million and million par value convertible senior notes in december and january  respectively

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk foreign currency risk 
we face exposure to adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates  primarily in asia and europe 
our foreign currency risk may change over time as the level of activity in foreign markets grows and could have a material adverse impact upon our financial results 
certain of our assets  including certain bank accounts and accounts receivable  and liabilities exist in non us dollar denominated currencies  which are sensitive to foreign currency exchange fluctuations 
these currencies are principally the chinese yuan  the taiwanese dollar and the british pound sterling and  to a lesser extent  the japanese yen  the euro and the hong kong dollar 
historically  because of the relatively small size and nature of each individual currency exposure  we did not regularly employ hedging techniques designed to mitigate foreign currency exposures 
during the second quarter of  with the acquisition of zetex  we adopted forward exchange contracts  designated as foreign currency cash flow hedges  to reduce the potentially adverse effects of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations that occur in the normal course of business 
we use forward exchange contracts to hedge  thereby attempting to reduce our overall exposure to the effects of currency fluctuations on cash flows 
we do not permit speculation in financial instruments for profit on the exchange rate price fluctuation  trading in currencies for which there are no underlying exposures  or entering into trades for any currency to intentionally increase the underlying exposure 
as part of our overall strategy to manage the level of exposure to the risk of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations  primarily to changes in the value of the euro and the british pound sterling  we hedge a portion of our foreign currency exposures anticipated over the ensuing twelve months to two year periods 
in doing so  we use foreign currency exchange contracts that generally have maturities of three months to two years to provide continuing coverage throughout the hedging period 
as of december   we have forward contracts  primarily relating to the operations acquired from zetex  of approximately million that mature monthly over the next twelve months 
currently we do not intend to enter into additional forward contracts 
if the chinese yuan  the taiwanese dollar  the euro and the british pound sterling were to strengthen or weaken by against the us dollar  we would experience currency gain of approximately million and currency loss of approximately million  respectively 
in the future  we may enter into hedging arrangements designed to mitigate foreign currency fluctuations 
the chinese government has begun to permit the chinese yuan to float more freely compared to other world currencies 
should the chinese government allow a significant chinese yuan appreciation  and we do not take appropriate means to offset this exposure  the effect could have a material adverse impact upon our financial results 
during the second quarter of  with the acquisition of zetex  we adopted a contributory defined benefit plan that covers certain employees in the united kingdom and germany 
the defined benefit plan is closed to new entrants and frozen with respect to future benefit accruals 
the retirement benefit is based on the final average compensation and service of each eligible employee 
on the acquisition date  we determined the fair value of the defined benefit plan assets and utilize an annual measurement date of december at subsequent measurement dates  defined benefit plan assets will be determined based on fair value 
defined benefit plan assets consist primarily of high quality corporate bonds that are denominated in the currency in which the benefits will be paid and that have terms to maturity approximating to the terms of the related pension liability 
the net pension and supplemental retirement benefit obligations and the related periodic costs are based on  among other things  assumptions of the discount rate  estimated return on plan assets and mortality rates 
these obligations and related periodic costs are measured using actuarial techniques and assumptions 
the projected unit credit method is the actuarial cost method used to compute the pension liabilities and related expenses 
as of december   the plan is underfunded and a liability of million is reflected in our consolidated financial statements as noncurrent liabilities 
the amount recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income was a net loss of million and the weighted average discount rate assumption used to determine benefit obligations as of december  was 
the asset value of the defined benefit plan has been volatile in recent months due primarily to wide fluctuations in the united kingdom s equity markets and bond markets 
see risk factors due to the recent and ongoing fluctuations in the united kingdom s equity markets and bond markets  changes in actuarial assumptions for our company s defined benefit plan could increase the volatility of the plan s asset value  require us to increase cash contributions to the plan and could have a negative impact on our results of operations and profitability 
in part i  item a of this annual report for further information 
interest rate risk 
we have credit facilities with financial institutions in asia and europe as well as other debt instruments with interest rates equal to libor or similar indices plus a negotiated margin 
on february   we terminated our credit facilities with union bank 
a rise in interest rates could have an adverse impact upon our cost of working capital and our interest expense 
as a matter of policy  we do not enter into derivative transactions for speculative purposes 
as of december   our outstanding debt under our interest bearing credit agreements was million  including million convertible notes with a fixed interest rate of and million under our no net cost loan 
based on an increase or decrease in interest rates by for the year  our annual interest rate expense would increase or decrease by approximately million due to the fact that any increase in interest expense related to our no net cost loan will be offset by interest earned on our ars portfolio 
political risk 
we have a significant portion of our assets in mainland china  taiwan and the united kingdom 
the possibility of political conflict between the any of these countries or with the us could have a material adverse impact upon our ability to transact business through these important business channels and to generate profits 
see risk factors risks related to our international operations in part i  item a of this annual report for further information 
liquidity risk 
as of december   we had million invested in ars  which are instruments that historically provided liquidity through a dutch auction process that resets the applicable interest rate at pre determined calendar intervals 
these mechanisms historically have allowed existing investors to roll over their holdings and continue to own the respective securities or to liquidate their holdings by selling their securities at par value 
on october   we reached a settlement with ubs ag and affiliates ubs ag  in regard to our ars portfolio  which gives us the option to put the million ars portfolio back to ubs ag at any time from june  through july  at par value in exchange for cash 
upon entering into this settlement  we elected the fair value option and recorded the put right at its fair value and a related gain 
in addition  we transferred our ars portfolio from an available for sale category to a trading category of investments 
upon transferring the ars portfolio to a trading category  all of the previously unrealized holding losses included in comprehensive income were recognized in earnings 
as a result of categorizing the ars as trading investments and the election of the fair value option for the put right  all future changes in fair value for both of these financial instruments will be recognized in earnings and are expected to offset  thereby creating accounting symmetry at inception of the settlement and during each period until we exercise our put option 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements and risk factors our auction rate securities ars are currently illiquid and we cancelled our bank credit facility in the us  therefore  we must rely solely upon existing cash reserves  available foreign credit facilities and funds from existing operations to finance future operations in part i  item a of this annual report for additional information about our settlement with ubs ag 
inflation risk 
inflation did not have a material effect on net sales or net income in fiscal year during the third and fourth quarter of  we were affected by the recent global economic weakness and financial market uncertainty  which have negatively affected our net sales and operating results 
the success of our business depends  among other factors  on the strength of the global economy and the stability of the financial markets  which in turn affect our customers demand for our products  the ability of our customers to meet their payment obligations  the likelihood of customers canceling or deferring existing orders and end user consumers demand for items containing our products in the end markets we serve
