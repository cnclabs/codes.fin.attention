item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the selected financial data  our consolidated financial statements and the related notes included elsewhere in this report 
industry overview the solid waste industry is a local and highly competitive business  requiring substantial labor and capital resources 
the participants compete for collection accounts primarily on the basis of price and  to a lesser extent  the quality of service  and compete for landfill business on the basis of tipping fees  geographic location and quality of operations 
the solid waste industry has been consolidating and continues to consolidate as a result of a number of factors  including the increasing costs and complexity associated with waste management operations and regulatory compliance 
many small independent operators and municipalities lack the capital resources  management  operating skills and technical expertise necessary to operate effectively in such an environment 
the consolidation trend has caused solid waste companies to operate larger landfills that have complementary collection routes that can use company owned disposal capacity 
controlling the point of transfer from haulers to landfills has become increasingly important as landfills continue to close and disposal capacity moves further from collection markets 
generally  the most profitable industry operators are those companies that are vertically integrated or enter into long term collection contracts 
a vertically integrated operator will benefit from the internalization of waste  which is bringing waste to a company owned landfill  the ability to charge third party haulers tipping fees either at landfills or at transfer stations  and the efficiencies gained by being able to aggregate and process waste at a transfer station prior to landfilling 
executive overview we are an integrated solid waste services company that provides solid waste collection  transfer  disposal and recycling services in mostly secondary markets in the western and southern us we also provide intermodal services for the rail haul movement of cargo and solid waste containers in the pacific northwest through a network of intermodal facilities 
we seek to avoid highly competitive  large urban markets and instead target markets where we can provide either solid waste services under exclusive arrangements  or markets where we can be integrated and attain high market share 
in markets where waste collection services are provided under exclusive arrangements  or where waste disposal is municipally funded or available at multiple municipal sources  we believe that controlling the waste stream by providing collection services under exclusive arrangements is often more important to our growth and profitability than owning or operating landfills 
operating results revenue in grew as internal growth from operations owned at least months was  and acquisitions contributed an additional growth in revenue 
as shown in the table below  internal growth decreased from in  to in price volume intermodal  recycling and other internal growth in  the pricing component of our internal growth increased to as a result of broad based pricing initiatives to offset or recover significant cost increases  primarily in fuel and related items 
volume growth was a negative for the full year  but volume declines accelerated throughout as the economic recession worsened 
volume losses for the year peaked in the fourth quarter at 
recycling  intermodal and other negatively impacted internal growth by approximately in primarily due to a significant drop in recycled commodity prices during the fourth quarter 
operating margins decreased from in  to in this percentage point decrease was primarily attributable to higher fuel prices  which increased fuel costs as a percentage of revenue by approximately percentage points  partially offset by a reduction in insurance expense 
we remain intensely focused on reducing our cost structure and controlling capital expenditures given the continuing deterioration in the overall economy 
free cash flow net cash provided by operating activities increased to million in from million in free cash flow  a non gaap financial measure refer to page of this report for a definition and reconciliation of free cash flow  increased to million in  from million in free cash flow increased as a percentage of revenue to in  from in  primarily due to increased earnings  improved accounts receivable turnover  a decrease in tax payments  and a reduction in capital expenditures in light of volume losses due to the weakening economy 
we believe our growth in free cash flow reflects the resiliency of our strategy during difficult economic times 
capital position despite the significant deterioration in the credit and equity markets during  we were able to expand our credit facility by million  issue million of new senior notes  and complete a common stock offering raising approximately million in net proceeds 
the successful execution of our financing plan in positioned us with a strong balance sheet with over million of available capital at year end to fund additional growth opportunities 
on february   we and some of our subsidiaries entered into an asset purchase agreement with republic services  inc and some of its subsidiaries and other affiliates sellers pursuant to which we agreed to purchase from the sellers assets principally used by the sellers in connection with their solid waste collection and disposal business 
the purchase price for the assets is approximately million  subject to pre and post closing pro rations and other adjustments 
we anticipate paying for the transaction with available cash and equivalents  together with borrowings on our senior revolving credit facility 
for additional information  see part ii  item b of this annual report on form k 
we maintain a targeted leverage ratio  as defined in our credit facility  between x and x of total debt to earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization  or ebitda 
we deployed million during for acquisitions  million for capital expenditures  and million for common stock repurchases 
as a result of our free cash flow and previously discussed financings and outlays  our leverage ratio remained below our targeted range at year end while cash and equivalents increased million over the prior year 
critical accounting estimates and assumptions the preparation of financial statements in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles requires estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  revenues and expenses and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities in the consolidated financial statements 
as described by the sec  critical accounting estimates and assumptions are those that may be material due to the levels of subjectivity and judgment necessary to account for highly uncertain matters or the susceptibility of such matters to change  and that have a material impact on the financial condition or operating performance of a company 
based on this definition  we believe the following are our critical accounting estimates 
insurance liabilities 
we maintain insurance policies for automobile  general  employer s  environmental and directors and officers liability as well as for employee group health insurance  property insurance and workers compensation 
our insurance accruals are based on claims filed and estimates of claims incurred but not reported and are developed by our management with assistance from our third party actuary and third party claims administrator 
the insurance accruals are influenced by our past claims experience factors  which have a limited history  and by published industry development factors 
if we experience insurance claims or costs above or below our historically evaluated levels  our estimates could be materially affected 
the frequency and amount of claims or incidents could vary significantly over time  which could materially affect our self insurance liabilities 
additionally  the actual costs to settle the self insurance liabilities could materially differ from the original estimates and cause us to incur additional costs in future periods associated with prior year claims 
income taxes 
we use the liability method to account for income taxes 
accordingly  deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on differences between financial reporting and income tax bases of assets and liabilities and are measured using the enacted tax rates and laws that are expected to be in effect when the differences are expected to reverse 
if our judgment and estimates concerning assumptions made in calculating our expected future income tax rates are incorrect  our deferred tax assets and liabilities would change 
based on our net deferred tax liability balance at december   each percentage point change to our expected future income tax rate would change our net deferred tax liability balance and income tax expense by approximately million 
effective january  we adopted the provisions of fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
 or fin fin clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprise s financial statements in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
fin requires a company to evaluate whether the tax position taken by a company will more likely than not be sustained upon examination by the appropriate taxing authority 
it also provides guidance on how a company should measure the amount of benefit that the company is to recognize in its financial statements 
fin also provides guidance on derecognition  classification  interest and penalties  accounting in interim periods  disclosure and transition 
our reassessment of our tax positions in accordance with fin did not have a material impact on our results of operations  financial condition or liquidity 
for additional information regarding fin  see note  income taxes  of the notes to consolidated financial statements in item of this annual report on form k 
accounting for landfills 
we recognize landfill depletion expense as airspace of a landfill is consumed 
our landfill depletion rates are based on the remaining disposal capacity at our landfills  considering both permitted and expansion airspace 
landfill final capping  closure and post closure liabilities are calculated by estimating the total obligation in current dollars  inflating the obligation based upon the expected date of the expenditure and discounting the inflated total to its present value using a credit adjusted  risk free rate 
the resulting final capping  closure and post closure obligation is recorded on the balance sheet as an addition to site costs and amortized as depletion expense as the landfill s total airspace is consumed 
the accounting methods discussed below require us to make certain estimates and assumptions 
changes to these estimates and assumptions could have a material effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
any changes to our estimates are applied prospectively 
landfill development costs 
landfill development costs include the costs of acquisition  construction associated with excavation  liners  site berms  groundwater monitoring wells and leachate collection systems 
we estimate the total costs associated with developing each landfill site to its final capacity 
total landfill costs include the development costs associated with expansion airspace 
expansion airspace is described below 
landfill development costs depend on future events and thus actual costs could vary significantly from our estimates 
material differences between estimated and actual development costs may affect our cash flows by increasing our capital expenditures and thus affect our results of operations by increasing our landfill depletion expense 
final capping  closure and post closure obligations 
we accrue for estimated final capping  closure and post closure maintenance obligations at the landfills we own  and the landfills that we operate  but do not own  under life of site agreements 
we could have additional material financial obligations relating to final capping  closure and post closure costs at other disposal facilities that we currently own or operate or that we may own or operate in the future 
in  we calculated the net present value of our final capping  closure and post closure commitments assuming a inflation rate and a discount rate 
the resulting final capping  closure and post closure obligation is recorded on the balance sheet as an addition to site costs and amortized as depletion expense as the landfill s total airspace is consumed 
significant reductions in our estimates of the remaining lives of our landfills or significant increases in our estimates of the landfill final capping  closure and post closure maintenance costs could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
additionally  changes in regulatory or legislative requirements could increase our costs related to our landfills  resulting in a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
we own two landfills for which the prior owners are obligated to reimburse us for certain costs we incur for final capping  closure and post closure activities on the portion of the landfill utilized by the prior owners 
we accrue the prior owner s portion of the final capping  closure and post closure obligation within the balance sheet classification of other long term liabilities  and a corresponding receivable from the prior owner in long term other assets 
disposal capacity 
our internal and third party engineers perform surveys at least annually to estimate the remaining disposal capacity at our landfills 
our landfill depletion rates are based on the remaining disposal capacity  considering both permitted and expansion airspace  at the landfills that we own and at the landfills that we operate  but do not own  under life of site agreements 
our landfill depletion rates are based on the term of the operating agreement at our operated landfills that have capitalized expenditures 
expansion airspace consists of additional disposal capacity being pursued through means of expansion but is not actually permitted 
expansion airspace that meets certain internal criteria is included in our estimate of total landfill airspace 
the internal criteria we use to determine when expansion airspace may be included as disposal capacity are as follows the land where the expansion is being sought is contiguous to the current disposal site  and we either own the expansion property or it is under an option  purchase  operating or other similar agreement  total development costs  final capping costs  and closure post closure costs have been determined  internal personnel have performed a financial analysis of the proposed expansion site and have determined that it has a positive financial and operational impact  internal personnel or external consultants are actively working to obtain the necessary approvals to obtain the landfill expansion permit  and we consider it probable that we will achieve the expansion for a pursued expansion to be considered probable  there must be no significant known technical  legal  community  business or political restrictions or similar issues existing that could impair the success of the expansion 
we may be unsuccessful in obtaining permits for expansion disposal capacity at our landfills 
in such cases  we will charge the previously capitalized development costs to expense 
this will adversely affect our operating results and cash flows and could result in greater landfill depletion expense being recognized on a prospective basis 
we periodically evaluate our landfill sites for potential impairment indicators 
our judgments regarding the existence of impairment indicators are based on regulatory factors  market conditions and operational performance of our landfills 
future events could cause us to conclude that impairment indicators exist and that our landfill carrying costs are impaired 
any resulting impairment loss could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
goodwill and indefinite lived intangible testing 
goodwill and indefinite lived intangibles are tested for impairment on at least an annual basis in the fourth quarter of the year 
in the first step of testing for goodwill impairment  we estimate the fair value of each reporting unit  which we have determined to be our geographic operating segments  and compare the fair value with the carrying value of the net assets assigned to each reporting unit 
if the fair value of a reporting unit is greater than the carrying value of the net assets assigned to the reporting unit  then no impairment results 
if the fair value is less than its carrying value  then we would perform a second step and determine the fair value of the goodwill 
in this second step  the fair value of goodwill is determined by deducting the fair value of a reporting unit s identifiable assets and liabilities from the fair value of the reporting unit as a whole  as if that reporting unit had just been acquired and the purchase price were being initially allocated 
if the fair value of the goodwill is less than its carrying value for a reporting unit  an impairment charge would be recorded to earnings in our consolidated statement of income 
in testing indefinite lived intangibles for impairment  we compare the estimated fair value of each indefinite lived intangible to its carrying value 
if the fair value of the indefinite lived intangible is less than its carrying value  an impairment charge would be recorded to earnings in our consolidated statement of income 
to determine the fair value of each of our reporting units as a whole and each indefinite lived intangible asset  we use discounted cash flow analyses  which require significant assumptions and estimates about the future operations of each reporting unit and the future discrete cash flows related to each indefinite lived intangible asset 
significant judgments inherent in these analyses include the determination of appropriate discount rates  the amount and timing of expected future cash flows and growth rates 
the cash flows employed in our discounted cash flow analyses were based on ten year financial forecasts  which in turn were based on the annual budget developed internally by management 
these forecasts reflect perpetual revenue growth rates of and operating profit margins that were consistent with results 
our discount rate assumptions are based on an assessment of the company s weighted average cost of capital 
in assessing the reasonableness of our determined fair values of our reporting units  we evaluate our results against our current market capitalization 
in addition  we would evaluate a reporting unit for impairment if events or circumstances change between annual tests indicating a possible impairment 
examples of such events or circumstances include the following a significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate  an adverse action or assessment by a regulator  a more likely than not expectation that a segment or a significant portion thereof will be sold  or the testing for recoverability under statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  of a significant asset group within the segment 
we did not record an impairment charge as a result of our goodwill and indefinite lived intangibles impairment test in however  there can be no assurance that goodwill and indefinite lived intangibles will not be impaired at any time in the future 
allocation of acquisition purchase price 
we allocate acquisition purchase prices to identified intangible assets and tangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values at the dates of acquisition  with any residual amounts allocated to goodwill 
from time to time  we consummate acquisitions in which we exchange operations we own for operations owned by another solid waste company 
these exchange transactions require us to estimate the fair market value of either the operations we receive or the operations we dispose of  whichever is more clearly evident 
to the extent that the fair market value of the operations we dispose of differs from the fair market value of the operations we obtain  cash is either paid or received to offset the difference in fair market values 
one method we use to estimate the fair value of solid waste companies is based on a multiple of ebitda 
we determine the appropriate ebitda multiple to be used in the valuation of exchange transactions based on factors such as the size of the transaction  the type and location of markets serviced  the existence of long term contracts and the ebitda multiples we have paid in other similar cash based transactions 
stock based compensation 
effective january  we adopted the provisions of sfas r  share based payment  for our share based compensation plans 
we previously accounted for these plans under the recognition and measurement principles of apb and related interpretations and disclosure requirements established by sfas  accounting for stock based compensation 
we adopted sfas r using the modified prospective method 
under this method  all share based compensation cost is measured at the grant date  based on the estimated fair value of the award  and is recognized as expense over the employee s requisite service period 
prior periods are not restated 
consistent with prior years  we used the black scholes option pricing model which requires extensive use of accounting judgment and financial estimation  including estimates of the expected term option holders will retain their vested stock options before exercising them  the estimated volatility of our common stock price over the expected term  and the number of options that will be forfeited prior to the completion of their vesting requirements 
application of alternative assumptions could produce significantly different estimates of the fair value of stock based compensation and  consequently  the related amounts recognized for the year ended december   in the consolidated statements of income within this report 
general our solid waste revenues consist mainly of fees we charge customers for collection  transfer  disposal and recycling services 
our collection business also generates revenues from the sale of recyclable commodities  which have significant variability 
a large part of our collection revenues comes from providing residential  commercial and industrial services 
we frequently perform these services under service agreements  municipal contracts or franchise agreements with governmental entities 
our existing franchise agreements and all of our existing municipal contracts give us the exclusive right to provide specified waste services in the specified territory during the contract term 
these exclusive arrangements are awarded  at least initially  on a competitive bid basis and subsequently on a bid or negotiated basis 
we also provide residential collection services on a subscription basis with individual households 
we charge transfer station and landfill customers a tipping fee on a per ton and or per yard basis for disposing their solid waste at our transfer stations and landfill facilities 
many of our transfer station and landfill customers have entered into one to ten year disposal contracts with us  most of which provide for annual indexed price increases 
we typically determine the prices of our solid waste services by the collection frequency and level of service  route density  volume  weight and type of waste collected  type of equipment and containers furnished  the distance to the disposal or processing facility  the cost of disposal or processing and prices charged by competitors for similar services 
the terms of our contracts sometimes limit our ability to pass on price increases 
long term solid waste collection contracts often contain a formula  generally based on a published price index  that automatically adjusts fees to cover increases in some  but not all  operating costs  or that limit increases to less than of the increase in the applicable price index 
our revenues from intermodal services consist mainly of fees we charge customers for the movement of cargo containers between our intermodal facilities 
we also generate revenue from the storage  maintenance and repair of cargo and solid waste containers and the sale or lease of containers and chassis 
the table below shows for the periods indicated our total reported revenues attributable to services provided in thousands and as percentages of revenues 
years ended december  collection disposal and transfer recycling and other total intercompany elimination cost of operations includes labor and benefits  tipping fees paid to third party disposal facilities  vehicle and equipment maintenance  workers compensation  vehicle and equipment insurance  insurance and employee group health claims expense  third party transportation expense  fuel  the cost of materials we purchase for recycling  district and state taxes and host community fees and royalties 
our significant costs of operations in were labor  third party disposal and transportation  cost of vehicle and equipment maintenance  taxes and fees  insurance and fuel 
we use a number of programs to reduce overall cost of operations  including increasing the use of automated routes to reduce labor and workers compensation exposure  utilizing comprehensive maintenance and health and safety programs  and increasing the use of transfer stations to further enhance internalization rates 
we carry high deductible insurance for automobile liability  property  general liability  workers compensation  employer s liability and employer group health claims 
if we experience insurance claims or costs above or below our historically evaluated levels  our estimates could be materially affected 
selling  general and administrative  or sg a  expenses include management  sales force  clerical and administrative employee compensation and benefits  legal  accounting and other professional services  bad debt expense and rent expense for our corporate headquarters 
depreciation expense includes depreciation of equipment and fixed assets over their estimated useful lives using the straight line method 
depletion expense includes depletion of landfill site costs and total future development costs as remaining airspace of the landfill is consumed 
remaining airspace at our landfills includes both permitted and expansion airspace 
amortization expense includes the amortization of definite lived intangible assets  consisting primarily of long term franchise agreements and contracts and non competition agreements  over their estimated useful lives using the straight line method 
goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets  consisting primarily of certain perpetual rights to provide solid waste collection and transportation services in specified territories  are not amortized 
we capitalize some third party expenditures related to pending acquisitions or development projects  such as legal  engineering and interest expenses 
we expense indirect acquisition costs  such as executive and corporate overhead  public relations and other corporate services  as we incur them 
we charge against net income any unamortized capitalized expenditures and advances net of any portion that we believe we may recover  through sale or otherwise that may become impaired  such as those that relate to any operation that is permanently shut down and any pending acquisition or landfill development project that we believe will not be completed 
we routinely evaluate all capitalized costs  and expense those related to projects that we believe are not likely to succeed 
during the year ended december   we capitalized less than million of interest related to landfill and facility development projects 
at december   we had less than million in capitalized expenditures relating to pending acquisitions 
at december   we had million in capitalized expenditures for a landfill project in chaparral  new mexico  with respect to which we had obtained a permit to operate the landfill  on july   the supreme court of new mexico ordered the new mexico environment department to conduct an additional limited hearing to consider evidence that landfill opponents claim was wrongfully excluded 
the parties have agreed to postpone the hearing until november at the earliest to allow us time to explore a possible relocation of the landfill 
if we are not ultimately issued a permit to operate the landfill  we will be required to expense in a future period the capitalized expenditures for this project  less the recoverable value of the applicable property and any other amounts recovered  which would likely have a material adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations for that period

total revenues increased million  or  to billion for the year ended december   from million for the year ended december  acquisitions closed during  or subsequent to  the year ended december   increased revenues by approximately million 
during the year ended december   increased prices and surcharges charged to our customers increased revenue by million 
for  we currently estimate that between million to million of price increases charged to customers will be partially offset by an approximate million decrease in surcharges primarily related to declining fuel costs 
during the year ended december   revenues generated from a long term contract that commenced in march resulted in a net revenue increase of approximately million 
volume decreases in our existing business during the year ended december   reduced revenue by approximately million 
the net decrease in volume was primarily attributable to declines in roll off activity and landfill volumes for landfills owned in the comparable periods 
during the first quarter of  our volume growth  net of revenues generated from a long term contract that commenced in march  was million 
during the second  third and fourth quarters of  our volume declined by million  million and million  respectively  from the comparable periods in our volume decline increased throughout as a result of the overall economic recession currently affecting the united states 
we currently estimate that the economic recession will result in our volume declining between approximately and from recyclable commodity revenue was million for the year ended december  reductions in recyclable commodity prices and volumes during the fourth quarter of  partially offset by increased recyclable commodity prices and volume during the first nine months of  reduced revenue by million from during the first  second and third quarters of  our recyclable commodity revenue increased million  million and million  respectively  from the comparable periods in during the fourth quarter of  our recyclable commodity revenue declined million from the comparable period in due to a sharp decline in commodity pricing resulting from decreased overseas demand for recyclable commodities 
we believe this reduction in overseas demand will continue throughout  resulting in our recyclable commodity revenue declining between and from other revenues decreased by million during the year ended december  cost of operations 
total cost of operations increased million  or  to million for the year ended december   from million for the year ended december  the increase was attributable to operating costs associated with acquisitions closed during  or subsequent to  the year ended december   operating costs incurred to support a long term contract that commenced in march  increased diesel fuel expense resulting from higher market prices for fuel and certain operating locations entering into short term  fixed price  fuel purchase agreements in the second quarter of that resulted in the purchase of their remaining fuel volume at prices in excess of market value  increased labor expenses resulting from employee pay rate increases  increased employee medical benefit expenses resulting from an increase in medical claims cost and severity  increased franchise taxes  increased third party trucking and transportation expenses and increased disposal expenses  partially offset by a decrease in major vehicle and equipment repairs  decreases in auto and workers compensation claims under our high deductible insurance program and a reduction in expected development costs recorded in prior years for open auto and workers compensation claims 
this adjustment to claim development costs was based on changes in estimates of actuarially projected losses on open claims determined by our third party administrator s review and a third party actuarial review of our estimated insurance liability 
cost of operations as a percentage of revenues increased percentage points to for the year ended december   from for the year ended december  the increase as a percentage of revenues was primarily attributable to increased diesel fuel expense and increased employee medical benefit expense  partially offset by decreased major vehicle and equipment repairs expense  increased prices charged to our customers being higher  on a percentage basis  than certain expense increases recognized subsequent to december   and decreased auto and workers compensation insurance expense related to current and prior year claims

net income increased million  or  to million for the year ended december   from million for the year ended december  the increase was primarily attributable to increased operating income partially offset by increased interest expense and increased income tax expense 
liquidity and capital resources the following table sets forth certain cash flow information for the years ended december   and in thousands net cash provided by operating activities net cash used in investing activities net cash provided by used in financing activities net increase decrease in cash cash at beginning of year cash at end of year operating activities cash flows for the year ended december   net cash provided by operating activities was million 
for the year ended december   net cash provided by operating activities was million 
the million net increase in cash attributable to operating activities was primarily due to the following an increase in the change in deferred income taxes of million due primarily to an increase in tax deductible timing differences for depreciation expense  amortization expense and landfill closure and post closure expense  an increase in depreciation and amortization expense of million  an increase of million attributable to a decrease in the excess tax benefit associated with equity based compensation  due to a reduction in stock option exercises resulting in reduced taxable income recognized by employees that is tax deductible by us  and an increase in cash flows from operating assets and liabilities  net of effects from acquisitions  of million to million for the year ended december   from million for the year ended december  the significant components of the million in cash flows from changes in operating assets and liabilities include the following a an increase from accounts receivable of million  due to improved accounts receivable turnover in  b a combined increase from accounts payable and accrued liabilities of million  due primarily to an increase in accrued interest due to changes in the payment timing for libor based borrowings and our issuance in of million of senior unsecured notes due october   which pay interest semi annually on april and october  less  c a decrease from other long term liabilities of million due primarily to the expiration of certain accrued tax contingencies and interim capping expenditures at one of our landfills 
for the year ended december   net cash provided by operating activities was million 
for the year ended december   net cash provided by operating activities was million 
the million net increase in cash attributable to operating activities was primarily due to the following an increase in net income of million  an increase in depreciation and amortization expense of million  less a decrease in the change in deferred income taxes of million due primarily due to our receipt in of written approval from the internal revenue service to exclude probable expansion airspace from our calculation of landfill final capping  closure and post closure costs for tax purposes  which resulted in the recording of a million deferred tax liability in  and a decrease of million attributable to an increase in the excess tax benefit associated with equity based compensation  due to an increase in stock option exercises resulting in increased taxable income recognized by employees that is tax deductible by us 
as of december   we had working capital of million  including cash and equivalents of million 
our working capital increased million from a working capital deficit of million at december  to date  we have experienced no loss or lack of access to our invested cash or cash equivalents  however  we can provide no assurances that access to our invested cash and cash equivalents will not be impacted by adverse conditions in the financial markets 
our strategy in managing our working capital is generally to apply the cash generated from our operations that remains after satisfying our working capital and capital expenditure requirements to reduce our indebtedness under our credit facility and to minimize our cash balances 
our increased cash and working capital positions at december   were primarily due to the proceeds received from the september sale of  shares of our common stock in a public offering and issuance in october of million of senior unsecured notes being in excess of cash used to fund acquisitions closed in the later portion of investing activities cash flows net cash used in investing activities increased million to million for the year ended december   from million for the year ended december  the significant components of the increase include the following an increase in payments for acquisitions of million  less a decrease in capital expenditures for property and equipment of million  due primarily to non recurring capital expenditures incurred during the year ended december   associated with a new long term contract in california 
net cash used in investing activities increased million to million for the year ended december   from million for the year ended december  the significant components of the increase include the following an increase in capital expenditures for property and equipment of million  due to the aforementioned expenditures incurred in associated with a new long term contract in california and equipment purchases at other operations to support our growth  and an increase in payments for acquisitions of million 
financing activities cash flows net cash flows from financing activities increased million to a net cash provided by financing activities total of million for the year ended december   from a net cash used in financing activities total of million for the year ended december  the significant components of the increase include the following an increase in proceeds from our common stock offering of million  due to the september sale of  shares of our common stock in a public offering  an increase in proceeds from long term debt  net of principal payments  of million  less a decrease in payments to repurchase common stock of million  due to our election not to repurchase stock after march   and to use our available capital to fund acquisition opportunities  less a change in book overdraft of million resulting from fluctuations in our outstanding cash balances at banks for which outstanding check balances can be offset  less a decrease in proceeds from option and warrant exercises of million due to a decrease in the number of options and warrants exercised in  and a decrease in the excess tax benefit associated with equity based compensation of million  due to the aforementioned decrease in options and warrants exercised in net cash used in financing activities decreased million to million for the year ended december   from million for the year ended december  the significant components of the decrease include the following a change in book overdraft of million resulting from fluctuations in our outstanding cash balances at banks for which outstanding check balances can be offset  an increase in proceeds from long term debt  net of principal repayments  of million  an increase in the excess tax benefit associated with equity based compensation of million  due to an increase in stock option exercises resulting in increased taxable income recognized by employees that is tax deductible by us  a decrease in debt issuance costs of million due to our incurring million of non recurring debt issuance costs in associated with our sale of million of the notes  less an increase in payments to repurchase common stock of million  due to differences in the timing and amount of repurchases 
our business is capital intensive 
our capital requirements include acquisitions and fixed asset purchases 
we expect that we will also make capital expenditures for landfill cell construction  landfill development  landfill closure activities and intermodal facility construction in the future 
our board of directors has authorized a common stock repurchase program for the repurchase of up to million of common stock through december  as of december  and  we had repurchased million and million shares  respectively of our common stock at a cost of million and million  respectively 
as of december   the remaining maximum dollar value of shares available for purchase under the program was approximately million 
we made million in capital expenditures during the year ended december  we expect to make capital expenditures of approximately million in in connection with our existing business 
we intend to fund our planned capital expenditures principally through internally generated funds 
in addition  we may make substantial additional capital expenditures in acquiring solid waste collection and disposal businesses 
if we acquire additional landfill disposal facilities  we may also have to make significant expenditures to bring them into compliance with applicable regulatory requirements  obtain permits or expand our available disposal capacity 
we cannot currently determine the amount of these expenditures because they will depend on the number  nature  condition and permitted status of any acquired landfill disposal facilities 
we believe that our cash and equivalents  credit facility and the funds we expect to generate from operations will provide adequate cash to fund our working capital and other cash needs for the foreseeable future 
however  disruptions in the capital and credit markets  as were experienced during  could adversely affect our ability to draw on our credit facility 
our access to funds under the credit facility is dependent on the ability of the banks that are parties to the facility to meet their funding commitments 
those banks may not be able to meet their funding commitments if they experience shortages of capital and liquidity or if they experience excessive volumes of borrowing requests within a short period of time 
we have an million senior revolving credit facility  or the credit facility  with a syndicate of banks for which bank of america  na acts as agent 
as of december   million was outstanding under our previous credit facility  exclusive of outstanding standby letters of credit of million 
as of december   million was outstanding under our credit facility  exclusive of outstanding standby letters of credit of million 
as of december   million was outstanding under the credit facility  exclusive of outstanding standby letters of credit of million 
the credit facility requires interest payments as outlined in the credit agreement and matures in september under the credit facility  there is no maximum amount of standby letters of credit that can be issued  however  the issuance of standby letters of credit reduces the amount of total borrowings available 
the credit facility requires us to pay a commitment fee ranging from to of the unused portion of the facility 
the borrowings under the credit facility bear interest  at our option  at either the base rate plus the applicable base rate margin on base rate loans  or the eurodollar rate plus the applicable eurodollar margin on eurodollar loans 
the base rate for any day is a fluctuating rate per annum equal to the higher of the federal funds rate plus one half of one percent  and the rate of interest in effect for such day as publicly announced from time to time by bank of america as its prime rate 
the eurodollar rate is determined by the administrative agent pursuant to a formula in the credit agreement governing the credit facility 
the applicable margins under the credit facility vary depending on our leverage ratio  as defined in the credit agreement  and range from to for eurodollar loans and for base rate loans 
the borrowings under the credit facility are not collateralized 
the credit agreement governing the credit facility contains representations and warranties and places certain business  financial and operating restrictions on us relating to  among other things  indebtedness  liens and other encumbrances  investments  mergers and acquisitions  asset sales  sale and leaseback transactions  and dividends  distributions and redemptions of capital stock 
the credit facility requires that we maintain specified financial ratios 
as of december  and  we were in compliance with all applicable covenants in the credit facility 
we use the credit facility for acquisitions  capital expenditures  working capital  standby letters of credit and general corporate purposes 
on july   we entered into a master note purchase agreement with certain accredited institutional investors pursuant to which we issued and sold to the investors at a closing on october   million of senior uncollateralized notes due october  the notes  in a private placement 
the notes bear interest at the fixed rate of per annum with interest payable in arrears semi annually on april and october beginning on april   and with principal payable at the maturity of the notes on october  the notes are uncollateralized obligations and rank equally with obligations under our senior uncollateralized revolving credit facility 
the notes are subject to representations  warranties  covenants and events of default 
upon the occurrence of an event of default  payment of the notes may be accelerated by the holders of the notes 
the notes may also be prepaid by us at any time at par plus a make whole amount determined in respect of the remaining scheduled interest payments on the notes  using a discount rate of the then current market standard for united states treasury bills plus 
in addition  we will be required to offer to prepay the notes upon certain changes in control 
we may issue additional series of senior uncollateralized notes pursuant to the terms and conditions of the agreement  provided that the purchasers of the notes shall not have any obligation to purchase any additional notes issued pursuant to the master note purchase agreement and the aggregate principal amount of the notes and any additional notes issued pursuant to the master note purchase agreement shall not exceed million 
on march   we completed the offering of million aggregate principal amount of our notes pursuant to a private placement 
the terms and conditions of the notes are set forth in the indenture  dated as of march   between us and us bank national association  as trustee 
the notes rank equally in right of payment to all of our other existing and future senior uncollateralized and unsubordinated indebtedness 
the notes rank senior in right of payment to all of our existing and future subordinated indebtedness and are subordinated in right of payment to our collateralized obligations to the extent of the assets collateralizing such obligations 
the notes bear interest at per annum payable semi annually in arrears on april and october of each year  beginning on october   until the maturity date of april  the notes are convertible into cash and  if applicable  shares of common stock based on an initial conversion rate of shares of common stock per  principal amount of notes which is equal to an initial conversion price of approximately per share  subject to adjustment  and only under certain circumstances 
upon a surrender of the notes for conversion  we will deliver cash equal to the lesser of the aggregate principal amount of notes to be converted and our total conversion obligation 
we will deliver shares of our common stock in respect of the remainder  if any  of our conversion obligation 
the holders of the notes who convert their notes in connection with a change in control as defined in the indenture may be entitled to a make whole premium in the form of an increase in the conversion rate 
holders may surrender the notes for conversion into cash and  if applicable  shares of our common stock at any time prior to the close of business on the maturity date  if the closing sale price of our common stock for at least trading days in the period of consecutive trading days ending on the last trading day of the quarter preceding the quarter in which the conversion occurs  is more than of the conversion price per share of our common stock on that th day 
beginning on april   we may redeem in cash all or part of the notes at a price equal to of the principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest  including additional interest  if any  and  if redeemed prior to april   an interest make whole payment 
the holders of the notes can require us to repurchase all or a part of the notes in cash on each of april   and  and in the event of a change of control of waste connections  at a purchase price of of the principal amount of the notes plus any accrued and unpaid interest  including additional interest  if any 
we are amortizing the million debt issuance costs over a five year term through the first put date  or april  as of december   we had the following contractual obligations in thousands payments due by period recorded obligations total less than year to years to years over years long term debt cash interest payments long term debt payments include million in principal payments due related to our credit facility 
our credit facility bears interest  at our option  at either the base rate plus the applicable base rate margin approximately at december  on base rate loans  or the eurodollar rate plus the applicable eurodollar margin approximately at december  on eurodollar loans

million in principal payments due related to our notes 
holders of the notes may require us to purchase their notes in cash at a purchase price of of the principal amount of the notes plus accrued and unpaid interest  if any  upon a change in control  as defined in the master note purchase agreement 
the notes bear interest at a rate of 
million in principal payments related to our tax exempt bonds  of which million bears interest at fixed rates between and and million bears interest at variable rates between to at december  the tax exempt bonds have maturity dates ranging from to million in principal payments related to our notes payable to sellers 
our notes payable to sellers bear interest at rates between and at december   and have maturity dates ranging from to million in principal payments related to our notes payable to third parties 
our notes payable to third parties bear interest at rates between and at december   and have maturity dates ranging from to the following assumptions were made in calculating cash interest payments we calculated cash interest payments on the credit facility using the eurodollar rate plus the applicable eurodollar margin at december  we assumed the credit facility is paid off when the credit facility matures in we calculated cash interest payments on our interest rate swaps using the stated interest rate in the swap agreement less the eurodollar rate through the term of the swap 
we calculated cash interest payments on the tax exempt bonds using the interest rate at december  the total liability for uncertain tax positions under fin at december   is approximately million refer to note to the consolidated financial statements 
we are not able to reasonably estimate the amount by which the liability will increase or decrease over time  however  at this time  we do not expect a significant payment related to these obligations within the next year 
amount of commitment expiration per period unrecorded obligations total less than year to years to years over years operating leases unconditional purchase obligations we are party to operating lease agreements and unconditional purchase obligations as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements 
these lease agreements and purchase obligations are established in the ordinary course of our business and are designed to provide us with access to facilities and products at competitive  market driven prices 
at december   our unconditional purchase obligations consist of multiple fixed price fuel purchase contracts under which we have million gallons remaining to be purchased for a total of million  plus taxes and transportation upon delivery 
the current fuel purchase contracts expire on or before december  these arrangements have not materially affected our financial position  results of operations or liquidity during the year ended december   nor are they expected to have a material impact on our future financial position  results of operations or liquidity 
we have obtained standby letters of credit as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements and financial surety bonds as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements 
these standby letters of credit and financial surety bonds are generally obtained to support our financial assurance needs and landfill operations 
these arrangements have not materially affected our financial position  results of operations or liquidity during the year ended december   nor are they expected to have a material impact on our future financial position  results of operations or liquidity 
from time to time we evaluate our existing operations and their strategic importance to us 
if we determine that a given operating unit does not have future strategic importance  we may sell or otherwise dispose of those operations 
although we believe our operations would not be impaired by such dispositions  we could incur losses on them 
new accounting pronouncements for a description of the new accounting standards that affect us  see note to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form k 
free cash flow we are providing free cash flow  a non gaap financial measure  because it is widely used by investors as a valuation and liquidity measure in the solid waste industry 
this measure should be used in conjunction with gaap financial measures 
management uses free cash flow as one of the principal measures to evaluate and monitor the ongoing financial performance of our operations 
we define free cash flow as net cash provided by operating activities plus proceeds from disposal of assets and excess tax benefit associated with equity based compensation  plus or minus change in book overdraft  less capital expenditures for property and equipment and distributions to minority interest holders 
other companies may calculate free cash flow differently 
our free cash flow for the years ended december  and  is calculated as follows in thousands years ended december  net cash provided by operating activities change in book overdraft plus proceeds from disposal of assets plus excess tax benefit associated with equity based compensation less capital expenditures for property and equipment less distributions to minority interest holders free cash flow inflation other than volatility in fuel prices  inflation has not materially affected our operations 
consistent with industry practice  many of our contracts allow us to pass through certain costs to our customers  including increases in landfill tipping fees and  in some cases  fuel costs 
therefore  we believe that we should be able to increase prices to offset many cost increases that result from inflation in the ordinary course of business 
however  competitive or economic pressures  or delays in the timing of rate increases under our contracts  may require us to absorb at least part of these cost increases  especially if cost increases exceed the average rate of inflation 
management s estimates associated with inflation have an impact on our accounting for landfill liabilities 
seasonality based on historic trends  we expect our operating results to vary seasonally  with revenues typically lowest in the first quarter  higher in the second and third quarters and lower in the fourth quarter than in the second and third quarters 
we expect the fluctuation in our revenues between our highest and lowest quarters to be approximately to 
this seasonality reflects the lower volume of solid waste generated during the late fall  winter and early spring because of decreased construction and demolition activities during winter months in the us in addition  some of our operating costs may be higher in the winter months 
adverse winter weather conditions slow waste collection activities  resulting in higher labor and operational costs 
greater precipitation in the winter increases the weight of collected waste  resulting in higher disposal costs  which are calculated on a per ton basis 
a continuing economic recession could also influence the percent change in revenues associated with seasonal fluctuations 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk in the normal course of business  we are exposed to market risk  including changes in interest rates and prices of certain commodities 
we use hedge agreements to manage a portion of our risks related to interest rates and fuel prices 
while we are exposed to credit risk in the event of non performance by counterparties to our hedge agreements  in all cases such counterparties are highly rated financial institutions and we do not anticipate non performance 
we do not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading purposes 
we monitor our hedge positions by regularly evaluating the positions at market and by performing sensitivity analyses 
at december   our derivative instruments included nine interest rate swap agreements that effectively fix the interest rate on the applicable notional amounts of our variable rate debt as follows dollars in thousands date entered notional amount fixed interest rate paid variable interest rate received effective date expiration date september month libor february february september month libor march march december month libor june june november month libor february february november month libor february february november month libor february february november month libor march march november month libor june june november month libor june june plus applicable margin 
under fasb statement no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities sfas  all the interest rate swap agreements are considered cash flow hedges for a portion of our variable rate debt  and we apply hedge accounting to account for these instruments 
the notional amounts and all other significant terms of the swap agreements are matched to the provisions and terms of the variable rate debt being hedged 
we have performed sensitivity analyses to determine how market rate changes will affect the fair value of our market risk sensitive hedge positions and all other debt 
such an analysis is inherently limited in that it reflects a singular  hypothetical set of assumptions 
actual market movements may vary significantly from our assumptions 
fair value sensitivity is not necessarily indicative of the ultimate cash flow or earnings effect we would recognize from the assumed market rate movements 
we are exposed to cash flow risk due to changes in interest rates with respect to the unhedged floating rate balances owed at december  and  of million and million  respectively  including floating rate debt under our credit facility  various floating rate notes payable to third parties and floating rate municipal bond obligations 
a one percent increase in interest rates on our variable rate debt as of december  and  would decrease our annual pre tax income by approximately million and million  respectively 
all of our remaining debt instruments are at fixed rates  or effectively fixed under the interest rate swap agreements described above  therefore  changes in market interest rates under these instruments would not significantly impact our cash flows or results of operations 
the market price of diesel fuel is unpredictable and can fluctuate significantly 
a significant increase in the price of fuel could adversely affect our business and reduce our operating margins 
to manage a portion of this risk  in the fourth quarter of  we entered into multiple commodity swap agreements related to forecasted diesel fuel purchases fuel hedges 
the following table summarizes the fuel hedges as of december date entered notional amount in gallons per month diesel rate paid fixed diesel rate received variable effective date expiration date october doe diesel fuel index january december october doe diesel fuel index january december october doe diesel fuel index january december december doe diesel fuel index january december december doe diesel fuel index january december december doe diesel fuel index january december december doe diesel fuel index january december december doe diesel fuel index january december december doe diesel fuel index january december if the national us on highway average price for a gallon of diesel fuel average price  as published by the department of energy  exceeds the contract price per gallon  we receive the difference between the average price and the contract price multiplied by the notional gallons from the counterparty 
if the national us on highway average price for a gallon of diesel fuel is less than the contract price per gallon  we pay the difference to the counterparty 
under sfas  all the fuel hedges are considered cash flow hedges for a portion of our forecasted diesel fuel purchases  and we will apply hedge accounting to account for these instruments 
additionally  we purchase a majority of our fuel at market prices  however  in order to mitigate the impact of adverse fuel price changes  we entered into multiple fixed price fuel purchase contracts which expire on or before december  as of december   we had million gallons remaining to be purchased for a total unconditional purchase obligation of million  plus taxes and transportation upon delivery 
we have performed sensitivity analyses to determine how market rate changes will affect the fair value of our market risk sensitive hedge positions and all other diesel fuel purchases 
such an analysis is inherently limited in that it reflects a singular  hypothetical set of assumptions 
actual market movements may vary significantly from our assumptions 
fair value sensitivity is not necessarily indicative of the ultimate cash flow or earnings effect we would recognize from the assumed market rate movements 
we purchase approximately million gallons of diesel fuel per year 
we have entered into fixed price fuel purchase contracts for a total of million gallons of diesel fuel which expire on or before december   and have hedged million gallons of diesel fuel for the year ending december  if we purchased all of our unhedged fuel at market prices  a per gallon increase in the price of fuel over a one year period would decrease our annual pre tax income by approximately million 
we market a variety of recyclable materials  including cardboard  office paper  plastic containers  glass bottles and ferrous and aluminum metals 
we own and operate recycling processing operations and sell other collected recyclable materials to third parties for processing before resale 
certain of our municipal recycling contracts in the state of washington specify benchmark resale prices for recycled commodities 
if the prices we actually receive for the processed recycled commodities collected under the contract exceed the prices specified in the contract  we share the excess with the municipality  after recovering any previous shortfalls resulting from actual market prices falling below the prices specified in the contract 
to reduce our exposure to commodity price risk with respect to recycled materials  we have adopted a pricing strategy of charging collection and processing fees for recycling volume collected from third parties 
in the event of a decline in recycled commodity prices  a decrease in average recycled commodity prices from the average prices that were in effect during the years ending december  and  would have had a million and million impact on revenues for the years ended december  and  respectively
