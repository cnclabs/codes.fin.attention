the sales from the prior year included approximately  in sales to the former radix corporation 
external sales reported at dci no longer include sales made to our radix subsidiary after september  total sales to external customers were approximately  and  for fiscal and  respectively 
the decrease in sales at dci also was caused by lower bookings during the preceding quarters primarily as a result of the widespread economic recession 
due to the severity of the recession and the reduced level of orders from our existing customers  we expect sales volumes to outside customers at dci to decrease from their current levels during the next fiscal quarter 
with the addition of several new customers and the modest improvement in orders from existing customers that we have recently experienced  we expect increased sales in subsequent quarters of the fiscal year 
this expectation is based upon scheduled shipments to customers currently recorded in our backlog  combined with anticipated future bookings from additional sales and marketing investments made at dci 
radix 
sales at radix totaled approximately  for fiscal revenues for the current period were primarily for sales of rugged hand held computer hardware and peripherals that totaled approximately  maintenance contract revenues and repairs were approximately  for fiscal radix sales for the previous year totaled approximately  and only included sales from the acquisition date of september  sales at radix during the first quarter of the fiscal year are expected to be lower than the sales levels that were reported in the preceding quarter as well as the comparable period of the prior fiscal year based on current opportunities and the expected booking of rugged handheld solutions to customers during the first quarter of fiscal year  we expect increased revenues for the subsequent quarters which we believe will raise total sales of radix products and solutions above those recorded in fiscal year ntg 
sales at ntg were  for fiscal a decrease of  or  from  in sales during fiscal sales from the prior year included approximately  of upgrade kits to convert fielded analog units to the new digital standard in advance of the fcc s phase out of analog service in february revenues from upgrade kits in the current year totaled approximately  exclusive of these one time sales of upgrade kits  revenue increased  or from fiscal to fiscal sales at ntg are expected to growing over the next few quarters due to strong demand for our watchdogcp products and our initiative to market our products internationally

the gross margin for fiscal was  or of sales  and only included the period from the acquisition date of september  the change in radix s gross margin was the result of higher margin product sales of handheld computers and maintenance services in the previous year as compared to the current year 
we anticipate radix margins to range between and in future quarters 
ntg 
the gross margin at ntg was approximately  or of sales  for fiscal as compared to approximately  or  for fiscal the slight decrease in gross margin percentage at ntg was mainly due to product mix and the decrease in sales of higher margin upgrade kits sold in comparison to the prior year

elecsys corporation 
corporate expenses were approximately  which was approximately  lower than for the previous fiscal year

we will continue to invest in the growth at dci and will intensify our investment in product development  marketing  and sales at both ntg and radix 
interest expense was  and  for fiscal and  respectively 
this decrease of  was the direct result of the repayment of two long term notes during the current period

fin requires that the company recognize the financial statement benefit  or liability  of a tax position only after determining that the relevant tax authority would more likely than not sustain the position following an audit

we cannot assure you that actual results will not differ from those estimates 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition 
we derive revenue from the manufacture of production units of electronic assemblies  liquid crystal displays  remote monitoring equipment and ultra rugged handheld computers and peripherals 
we also derive revenue from repairs and non warranty services  engineering design services  remote monitoring services and maintenance contracts 
production and repaired units are billed to the customer after they are shipped 
remote monitoring services and maintenance contracts are billed and the revenue recognized at the end of the month after the services or maintenance periods are completed 
for customers that utilize our engineering design services  we bill the customer and recognize revenue after the design services or tooling have been completed 
we require our customers to provide a binding purchase order to verify the manufacturing services to be provided 
typically  we do not have any post shipment obligations that would include customer acceptance requirements  training  installation or other services 
inventory valuation 
our inventories are stated at the lower of cost  using the first in  first out fifo method  or market value 
our industry is characterized by rapid technological change  short term customer commitments and rapid changes in demand  as well as other market considerations 
we make provisions for estimated excess and obsolete inventory based on our quarterly reviews of inventory quantities on hand and the latest forecasts of product demand and production requirements from our customers 
we review our inventory in detail on a quarterly basis utilizing a month time horizon 
individual part numbers that have not had any usage in a month time period are examined by manufacturing personnel for obsolescence  excess and fair value 
parts that are not identified for common use or are unique to a former customer or application are categorized as obsolete and are discarded as part of our quarterly inventory write down 
if actual market conditions or our customers product demands are less favorable than those projected  additional inventory write downs may be required 
the reserve balance is analyzed for adequacy along with the inventory review each quarter 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
accounts receivable are carried at original invoice amount less an estimate made for doubtful receivables based on a review of all outstanding amounts on a monthly basis 
we determine the allowance for doubtful accounts by regularly evaluating individual customer receivables and considering a customer s financial condition and credit history  and current economic conditions 
receivables are written off when deemed uncollectible 
recoveries of receivables previously written off are recorded when received 
the majority of the customer accounts are considered past due after days 
interest is not charged on past due accounts for the majority of our customers 
warranty reserve 
we have established a warranty reserve for rework  product warranties and customer refunds 
we provide a limited warranty for a period of one year from the date of receipt of our products by our customers and our standard warranties require us to repair or replace defective products at no cost to the customer or refund the customer s purchase price 
the warranty reserve is based on historical experience and analysis of specific known and potential warranty issues 
the product warranty liability reflects management s best estimate of probable liability under our product warranties 
goodwill 
goodwill is initially measured as the excess of the cost of an acquired business over the fair value of the identifiable net assets acquired 
we do not amortize goodwill  but rather review its carrying value for impairment annually april  and whenever an impairment indicator is identified 
our annual impairment test is performed at year end 
the goodwill impairment test involves a two step approach 
the first step is to identify if potential impairment of goodwill exists 
if impairment of goodwill is determined to exist  the second step of the goodwill impairment test measures the amount of the impairment using a fair value based approach 
intangible assets 
intangible assets consist of patents  trademarks  copyrights  customer relationships and capitalized software 
intangible assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives using the straight line method 
impairment of long lived intangible assets 
long lived assets  including amortizable intangible assets  are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset or group of assets may not be fully recoverable 
these events or changes in circumstances may include a significant deterioration of operating results  changes in business plans  or changes in anticipated future cash flows 
if an impairment indicator is present  we evaluate recoverability by a comparison of the carrying amount of the assets to future undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the assets 
if the sum of the expected future cash flows is less than the carrying amount  we would recognize an impairment loss 
an impairment loss would be measured by comparing the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the long lived assets and intangibles
