overview we are a biopharmaceutical company focused on the development and commercialization of new oncology therapeutics for the treatment of hematologic and solid tumor cancers 
we have built a highly experienced cancer drug development organization committed to advancing our lead product candidate  voreloxin  in multiple indications to improve lives of people with cancer 
from our incorporation in through  our operations consisted primarily of developing and refining our proprietary methods of discovering drugs in pieces  or fragments 
since through june  we focused on the discovery in licensing and development of novel small molecule drugs 
in june  we announced a corporate realignment to focus on the development of voreloxin 
in conjunction with this strategic restructuring  we expanded our late stage development team  announced the winding down of our internal discovery research activities  ceasing development of an enhanced fragment based discovery platform  and reduced our workforce by approximately percent 
we are currently advancing voreloxin through phase development 
voreloxin is a first in class anticancer quinolone derivative  or aqd  a class of compounds that has not been used previously for the treatment of cancer 
quinolone derivatives have been shown to mediate antitumor activity by targeting mammalian topoisomerase ii  an enzyme critical for replication  and have demonstrated promising preclinical antitumor activity 
we are in the process of conducting three clinical trials of voreloxin a phase clinical trial known as the reveal trial in previously untreated elderly patients with acute myeloid leukemia  or aml  a phase b clinical trial combining voreloxin with cytarabine for the treatment of patients with relapsed refractory aml  and a phase single agent clinical trial in advanced platinum resistant ovarian cancer patients 
we have worldwide development and commercialization rights to voreloxin 
we may enter into partnering arrangements for this product candidate to maximize its commercial potential 
we have taken a number of important steps to focus our resources and efforts on the advancement of voreloxin 
we have discontinued development of our product candidate  sns  a selective inhibitor of cyclin dependent kinases  or cdks   and  which we had in licensed from bristol myers squibb company  or bms 
in december  we notified bms that we were terminating the license agreement for sns in addition  we recently completed enrollment in a phase trial of sns  a potent and selective pan aurora kinase inhibitor discovered internally at sunesis  in patients with advanced solid tumors 
a maximum tolerated dose was not established in that trial  and no responses were observed 
we currently have no plans to conduct further development activities on sns on our own  but we plan to seek a partner to support further development of sns on march   we entered into a securities purchase agreement with accredited investors  including certain members of management  providing for a private placement of our securities of up to million  or the private placement 
the private placement contemplates the sale of up to million of units consisting of series a preferred stock and warrants to purchase common stock in two closings 
million of units would be sold in the initial closing  which is expected to occur in the near term  subject to the satisfaction of customary closing conditions 
subject to the approval of our stockholders  an additional million of units may be sold in the second closing  which closing may occur at our election or at the election of the investors in the private placement 
we may elect to hold the second closing if the achievement of a specified milestone with respect to voreloxin has occurred and our common stock is trading above a specified floor price 
if we have not delivered notice to the investors in the private placement of our election to complete the second closing  or if the conditions for the second closing have not been met  the investors may elect to purchase the units in the second closing by delivering a notice to us of their election to purchase the units 
notice of an election to complete the second closing  either by us or the investors in the private placement  must be delivered on or before the earliest to occur of december   the common equity closing described below or the occurrence of a qualifying alternative common stock financing 
if the second closing occurs  it will be subject to the satisfaction of customary closing conditions 
subject to the approval of our stockholders  the remaining tranche of million of common stock may be sold in the common equity closing 
the common equity closing may be completed at our election prior to the earlier of december  and a qualifying alternative common stock financing  or upon the election of the holders of a majority of the series a preferred stock issued in the private placement prior to a date determined with reference to our cash balance dropping below million at certain future dates 
if we elect to hold the common equity closing  it will be subject to the approval of the purchasers holding a majority of the series a preferred stock issued in the private placement and subject to a condition that we sell at least million of common stock in the common equity closing 
in conjunction with the private placement  the investors have been granted a number of rights  including the right to approve any sale of the company  any issuance of debt or preferred stock and  except if certain conditions are met  any issuance of common stock other than the second closing and the common stock financing described above  and the right to appoint three of eight members of our board of directors following the initial closing and five of nine members of our board of directors following the second closing  if completed 
in march  we announced that we sold our interest in all of our lymphocyte function associated antigen  or lfa  patents and related know how to sarcode corporation  or sarcode  for a total cash consideration of million 
sarcode has been the exclusive licensee of those assets since march and is developing a small molecule lfa inhibitor  sar  for t cell mediated ophthalmic diseases 
we still hold a series of secured convertible notes issued by sarcode having a total principal value of million 
we had discontinued our lfa antagonist program in when we focused our research and development efforts on oncology 
our fragment based discovery approach  called tethering formed the basis of several strategic research and development collaborations entered into between and  including collaborations with biogen idec  inc  or biogen idec  johnson johnson pharmaceutical research development  llc  or j jprd  and merck co  inc  or merck 
we are no longer receiving research funding in any of our current collaborations 
in the first quarter of  j jprd informed us that it has ceased development of the previously selected cathepsin s inhibitor and the parties initiated discussions regarding a proposed mutual termination of the collaboration agreement 
as a result  we do not expect to receive any additional revenues from j jprd under the collaboration agreement 
j jprd is entitled to terminate the collaboration agreement without cause upon days written notice 
we may in the future receive milestones as well as royalty payments based on future sales of products  if any  resulting from the biogen idec or merck collaborations 
we have incurred significant losses in each year since our inception 
as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of million  including a deemed dividend of million recorded in conjunction with our ipo in september we expect our significant net losses to continue for the foreseeable future  as we continue to conduct development of  and seek regulatory approvals for  voreloxin 
critical accounting policies and the use of estimates the accompanying discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial statements and the related disclosures  which have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles 
the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires our management to make estimates  assumptions and judgments that affect the amounts reported in our financial statements and accompanying notes  including reported amounts of assets  liabilities and expenses and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements  as well as revenue and expenses during the reporting periods 
we evaluate our estimates  assumptions and judgments on an ongoing basis 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions we believe are reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
management has discussed the development  selection and disclosure of these estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors 
actual results could differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
our significant accounting policies are more fully described in note to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report 
we believe the following critical accounting policies reflect our more significant estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition in accordance with emerging issues task force  or eitf   accounting for revenue arrangements with multiple deliverable  which we adopted effective july   revenue arrangements with multiple deliverable items are divided into separate units of accounting based on whether certain criteria are met  including whether the delivered item has stand alone value to the customer and whether there is objective and reliable evidence of the fair value of the undelivered items 
we allocate the consideration we receive among the separate units of accounting based on their respective fair value  and we apply the applicable revenue recognition criteria to each of the separate units 
where an item in a revenue arrangement with multiple deliverables does not constitute a separate unit of accounting and for which delivery has not occurred  we defer revenue until the delivery of the item is completed 
we record upfront  non refundable license fees and other fees received in connection with research and development collaborations as deferred revenue and recognize these amounts ratably over the relevant period specified in the agreements  generally the research term 
we recognize research funding related to collaborative research with our collaboration partners as the related research services are performed 
this funding is normally based on a specified amount per full time equivalent employee per year 
we recognize revenue from milestone payments  which are substantially at risk at the time the collaboration agreement is entered into and performance based at the date of the collaboration agreement  upon completion of the applicable milestone events 
we intend to recognize any future royalty revenue  if any  based on reported product sales by third party licensees 
we recognize grant revenue from government agencies and private research foundations as the related qualified research and development costs are incurred  up to the limit of the prior approval funding amounts 
clinical trial accounting we record accruals for estimated clinical trial costs  comprising payments for work performed by contract research organizations and participating clinical trial sites 
these costs may be a significant component of future research and development expense 
we accrue costs for clinical trials performed by contract research organizations based on estimates of work performed under the contracts 
costs of setting up clinical trial sites for participation in trials are expensed immediately 
costs related to patient enrollment are accrued as patients are entered in the trial  reduced by an initial payment made to the hospital when the first patient is enrolled 
these cost estimates may or may not match the actual costs incurred for services performed by the organizations as determined by patient enrollment levels and related activities 
if we have incomplete or inaccurate information  we may underestimate costs associated with various trials at a given point in time 
although our experience in estimating these costs is limited  the difference between accrued expenses based on our estimates and actual expenses have not been material to date 
stock based compensation we grant options to purchase common stock to our employees  directors and consultants under our stock option plans 
eligible employees can also purchase shares of common stock at percent of the lower of the fair market value of the common stock at the beginning of an offering period or at the purchase date under our employee stock purchase plan 
upon adoption of fas r  we retained our method of valuation for share based awards granted using the black scholes option pricing model or black scholes model 
our determination of fair value of share based payment awards on the date of grant using an option pricing model is affected by our stock price as well as assumptions regarding a number of highly complex and subjective variables 
these variables include  but are not limited to  our expected stock price volatility over the term of the awards and actual and projected employee stock option exercise behaviors 
changes in these input variables would affect the amount of expense associated with stock based compensation 
fas r requires the cash flows resulting from the tax benefits related to tax deductions in excess of the compensation costs recognized for these options excess tax benefits to be classified as financing cash flows 
recent accounting pronouncements fair value measurements in september  the fasb issued sfas no 
 fair value measurements  or sfas sfas establishes a common definition for fair value  creates a framework for measuring fair value  and expands disclosure requirements about such fair value measurements 
effective january   we adopted sfas for financial assets and liabilities recognized at fair value on a recurring basis 
the adoption of sfas for financial assets and liabilities did not have a material impact on our financial statements 
see note  fair value measurements  to the notes to consolidated financial statements for information and related disclosures regarding our fair value measurements 
in february  the fasb issued statement of financial position fsp no 
 which delays the effective date of fas for non financial assets and non financial liabilities  except for items that are recognized or disclosed at fair value on a recurring basis items that are remeasured at least annually 
the fsp deferred the effective date of fas for non financial assets and non financial liabilities until our fiscal year beginning on january  we do not expect the adoption of fas for non financial assets and non financial liabilities to have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements 
accounting for advance payments for goods or services to be used in future research and development in june  the emerging issues task force issued eitf issue  accounting for advance payments for goods or services to be used in future research and development  or eitf eitf addresses the diversity which exists with respect to the accounting for the non refundable portion of a payment made by a research and development entity for future research and development activities 
under eitf  an entity would defer and capitalize non refundable advance payments made for research and development activities until the related goods are delivered or the related services are performed 
eitf was effective for fiscal years beginning after december  and interim periods within those years 
the adoption of eitf did not have a material impact on our financial statements 
accounting for collaborative agreements in december  the eitf reached a consensus on eitf issue accounting for collaborative agreements  or eitf eitf defines collaborative arrangements and establishes reporting requirements for transactions between participants and third parties in a collaborative arrangement 
eitf prohibits companies from applying the equity method of accounting to activities performed outside a separate legal entity by a virtual joint venture 
instead  revenues and costs incurred with third parties in connection with the collaborative arrangement should be presented gross or net by the collaborators based on the criteria in eitf issue no 
 reporting revenue gross as a principal versus net as an agent  and other applicable accounting literature 
the consensus should be applied to collaborative arrangements in existence at the date of adoption using a modified retrospective method that requires reclassification in all periods presented for those arrangements still in effect at the transition date  unless that application is impracticable 
the consensus is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  we do not expect the adoption of eitf to have a material impact on our financial statements 
overview of revenues we have not generated any revenue from sales of commercial products and do not expect to generate any product revenue or any other significant revenue for the foreseeable future 
to date  our revenue has consisted of collaboration revenue  license revenue and grant and fellowship revenue 
collaboration revenue 
in the past we have generated revenue primarily through our collaborations consisting principally of research funding and milestones paid by our collaborators  substantially offsetting our related research and development expenses 
we are no longer conducting any research activities in connection with any of our collaborations and are no longer receiving research funding in any collaboration 
as a result of our restructuring and the resulting wind down of our research activities to focus our resources and efforts on the advancement of voreloxin  we do not anticipate conducting any research activities in connection with any future strategic collaboration or receiving any research funding 
we are entitled to receive milestone payments under our collaborations with biogen idec  j jprd and merck if one or more of these collaborators achieve a milestone for which a payment is due to us 
milestone payments earned under collaborations totaled million in  and million in each of and we may in the future receive royalty payments based on future sales of products  if any  resulting from these collaborations 
however  none of the products under these collaborations have yet entered clinical testing in humans 
in addition  in the first quarter of  j jprd informed us that it has ceased development of the previously selected cathepsin s inhibitor and the parties initiated discussions regarding a proposed mutual termination of our collaboration agreement 
as a result  we do not expect to receive any milestone or royalty revenue from j jprd in the future 
the table below sets forth our revenue since january  from each of these collaborators 
year ended december  in thousands biogen idec merck j j prd total our collaboration revenue  if any  will be substantially lower in future years unless  and until  any products that may result from the collaborations advance to a level where significant milestones will be payable to us 
we do not expect to generate royalty revenue from these collaborations in the foreseeable future  if at all 
see note strategic collaborative agreements  to notes to consolidated financial statements for more information regarding our strategic collaborations 
grant and fellowship revenue 
grant and fellowship revenue is recognized as we perform services under the applicable grant 
since inception  we had been awarded an aggregate of million in federal grants  and had recognized million as revenue from such grants and other significantly smaller grants and fellowships 
grant and fellowship revenues for the period ended december  was under million 
there was no grant and fellowship revenue recognized in or and we do not expect to recognize any grant and fellowship revenue in future years 
license revenue 
under our license agreement with sarcode  we recognized total cash payments of million in license fees  million in each of and we also received a series of three secured notes  with a total principal value of million  which are convertible into preferred stock of sarcode 
we did not record these notes which are due in  as revenue due to uncertainty of collectibility 
in march  we announced that we sold our interest in all of the patents and related know how that had been the subject of the license agreement to sarcode for a total cash consideration of million 
as a result  the license with sarcode was terminated and we will not receive any future license fees  milestones or royalties under that license 
overview of operating expenses research and development expense 
most of our operating expenses to date have been for research and development activities 
past research and development expense primarily represents costs incurred in the discovery and development of novel small molecule therapeutics and the advancement of product candidates towards clinical trials  including the phase and phase clinical trial costs for voreloxin and the phase clinical trial costs for sns and sns  in the development of our proprietary fragment based tethering drug discovery approach and other novel fragment based drug discovery methods  in the development of in house research  preclinical study and development capabilities  in connection with in licensing activities  and in the conduct of activities we are required to perform in connection with our strategic collaborations 
we expense all research and development costs as they are incurred 
the table below sets forth our research and development expense annually since january  year ended december  in thousands voreloxin sns sns discovery programs and new technologies other kinase inhibitors raf kinase inhibitors other programs bace inhibitors for alzheimer s disease tnf family and oncology research cathepsin s inhibitors total we have incurred research and development expense associated with both our internal research and development activities and in the conduct of activities we were required to perform in connection with our strategic collaborations 
each of our collaborations involved research funding to us which substantially offset the related research and development expenses 
as a result of our restructuring and the resulting wind down of our research activities  we do not anticipate incurring any significant additional research expenses related to the discovery of additional product candidates  the development or application of our proprietary fragment based drug discovery methods  or the development of in house research capabilities 
in addition  we are no longer conducting any research activities in connection with any of our collaborations 
however  we have incurred and expect to continue to incur substantial research and development expense to conduct clinical trials of voreloxin 
clinical trials are costly  and as we continue to advance voreloxin through clinical development  we expect our related expenses to remain high 
for example  we expect to spend at least million over the next twelve months to advance our voreloxin program to completion of the current phase b combination trial in aml  phase aml clinical trial in the untreated elderly and phase clinical trial in ovarian cancer 
as of the date of this report  due to the risks inherent in the clinical trial process and given the early state of development  we are unable to estimate the additional substantial costs we will incur in the voreloxin development program 
in addition  we are currently focused on trials in voreloxin of targeted indications and patient populations 
based on results of translational research  clinical results  regulatory and competitive concerns and our overall financial resources  we anticipate that we will make determinations as to which indications to pursue and patient populations to treat and how much funding to direct to each indication on an ongoing basis 
this will affect our research and development expense going forward 
we are currently anticipating that development of voreloxin will be our highest priority 
if we engage a development or commercialization partner on our voreloxin program  or if  in the future  we acquire additional product candidates  our research and development expenses could be significantly affected 
we can not predict whether future collaborative or licensing arrangements will be secured  if at all  and to what degree such arrangements would affect our development plans and capital requirements 
under our biogen idec agreement  we have the right to participate in the co development and co promotion of product candidates for up to two targets including  at our option  the raf kinase target  on a worldwide basis excluding japan 
if we were to exercise our option on one or more product candidates  our research and development expense would increase significantly 
general and administrative expense 
our general and administrative expense consists primarily of salaries and other related costs for personnel in finance  human resources  facilities management  legal including intellectual property  management and general administration  as well as non cash stock based compensation 
other significant costs include facilities costs and fees paid to outside legal advisors and independent auditors 
in  we expect general and administrative expenses to be further reduced 
restructuring and impairment expenses 
in the second quarter of  we implemented a corporate realignment to focus on the development of voreloxin 
in conjunction with this strategic restructuring  we expanded our late stage development leadership team  announced the winding down of internal discovery research activities and reduced our workforce by approximately percent 
all terminated employees were awarded severance payments and continuation of benefits  based on length of service  and career transition assistance 
we also consolidated our remaining employees in our leased premises at oyster point boulevard and allerton avenue and vacated our former research and development facility at oyster point boulevard in february on march   the compensation committee of our board of directors  in conjunction with the closing of the private placement  committed to a restructuring plan that will result in a reduction in force affecting six employees  including two executives valerie pierce  senior vice president and general counsel  and dr 
lesley stolz  vice president  business and corporate development 
in addition  dr 
jim young is retiring as executive chairman and will continue to serve on the board of directors as non executive chairman 
employees directly affected by the restructuring plan have received notification and will be provided with severance payments 
we expect to complete the restructuring plan in april as a result of the restructuring plan  we estimate that we will record a one time restructuring charge of approximately million in the first quarter of for severance and other personnel related expenses 
the severance payments will be made during the second quarter of other personnel related expenses such as employee benefits will be substantially paid over the remainder of the restructuring charge that we expect to incur in connection with the restructuring is subject to a number of assumptions  and actual results may materially differ 
we may also incur other material charges not currently contemplated due to events that may occur as a result of  or associated with  the restructuring plan 
results of operations years ended december  and revenue 
total revenue decreased to million in from million in collaboration revenue decreased to million in from million in  primarily due to i a million decrease in collaboration revenue from biogen idec resulting from the june termination of the research phase of our collaboration and ii a million decrease in research revenue from our bace program with merck 
partially offsetting the decrease in collaboration revenue in was a milestone payment from j jprd for the selection of a compound targeting the cathepsin s enzyme using our proprietary tethering technology 
we expect that we will have substantially lower collaboration revenue  if any  in and in future years unless  and until  any products that may result from the collaborations advance to a level where significant milestones will be payable to us 
research and development expense 
research and development expense decreased to million in from million in this decrease is primarily due to i a million decrease in expenses under our raf kinase inhibitors program  ii a million decrease in expenses under our other kinase inhibitors discovery programs  iii a million decrease in clinical trial activity related to sns  iv a million decrease in clinical trial activity related to sns  v a million decrease in expenses under discovery and new technology and vi a million decrease in expenses under other programs 
these decreases were partially offset by a million increase in voreloxin expenses due to increased clinical development activities 
we expect that we will continue to incur significant expenses related to the development of voreloxin in and future years  however research and development expenses may be lower in compared to as a result of our focus on voreloxin 
general and administrative expense 
general and administrative expense decreased to million in from million in the decrease was primarily due to reduced headcount resulting in i a million decrease in employee related expenses  ii a million decrease in office related expenses and iii a million decrease in professional services 
these decreases were partially offset by a million increase in facilities and related expenses 
we expect general and administrative expenses to be further reduced in restructuring and impairment charge 
in  we recorded a million restructuring charge  comprised of million related to the restructuring plan announced and implemented in june and million of facility exit costs related to restructuring  partially offset by a million reversal of the restructuring related to the company s facilities exit costs 
the restructuring charge consists of i million related to employee severance and related benefit costs  including a non cash portion of approximately million related to stock based compensation  and ii million related to asset impairment and facility exit costs 
cash restructuring costs for totaled approximately million  or percent of the million restructuring charge 
in  we recorded a million restructuring charge related to the restructuring plan announced and implemented in august the restructuring charge consisted of i million in severance and related personnel termination costs  ii million related to the extension of option exercise periods to months for terminated employees  iii a million write off of leasehold improvements  and iv a million accrual for lease obligations for the facility located at oyster point boulevard that at the time in we were not utilizing 
cash restructuring costs totaled approximately million  or percent of the million restructuring charge  in interest income and expense 
interest income decreased to million in from million in  primarily due to lower average balances of cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities during  as well as lower average interest rates 
we expect interest income to be significantly lower due to lower average balances of cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities 
interest expense was million for both and interest expense was comparable for both years due to higher interest rates on lower outstanding debt obligation in  compared to lower interest rates on higher outstanding debt obligations in we expect interest expense will be significantly lower compared to because the company s debt obligation was paid off in years ended december  and revenue 
total revenue decreased to million in from million in collaboration revenue decreased to million in from million in  primarily due to a million decrease in collaboration revenue from merck in  offset by a million increase in collaboration revenue from biogen idec in and million in license revenue from sarcode in the decrease in collaboration revenue from merck resulted primarily from the fact that a million milestone payment was made by merck in  as compared to a milestone payment of million in the million increase in collaboration revenue from biogen idec resulted primarily from increased payments for scientific personnel working on the collaboration 
the license revenue from sarcode resulted from the out licensing of our lfa inhibitor program 
research and development expense 
research and development expense increased to million in from million in research and development expense associated with voreloxin increased to million in from million in due to increased clinical trial activity 
the remainder of the increase was due to a million increase in expenses under discovery programs and new technologies due to increased work on our proprietary technologies and discovery programs 
the increases in research and development expense in over were offset by i a decrease of million in sns expenses  primarily because expense included a million non cash license payment  ii a decrease of million in sns expenses due to a reduced number of research employees working on this program  partially offset by increased outside services expense related to clinical studies  iii a million in expenses for all other programs due to a decrease in expenses related to raf and other kinase inhibitor programs 
general and administrative expense 
general and administrative expense increased to million in from million in the increase was primarily due to i a million increase in employee related expenses  ii a million increase in non cash stock based compensation expense  and iii a million increase in office and related expenses  primarily from computer and software expenditures  which were partially offset by a million decrease in professional services expense 
restructuring and impairment charge 
in  we recorded a million restructuring charge related to the restructuring plan announced and implemented in august the restructuring charge consists of i million in severance and related personnel termination costs  ii million related to the extension of option exercise periods to months for terminated employees  iii a million write off of leasehold improvements  and iv a million accrual for lease obligations for a facility that we were not then utilizing 
cash restructuring costs totaled approximately million  or percent of the million restructuring charge 
interest income and expense 
interest income decreased to million in from million in  primarily due to lower average balances of cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities 
the decrease was partially offset by higher interest rates 
interest expense decreased to million in from million in  primarily due to the recognition of million non cash interest expense in related to our venture loan with oxford finance corporation and horizon technology funding company llc in income taxes we apply the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for income taxes or sfas under sfas  deferred tax liabilities or assets arise from a difference between the tax basis of liabilities or assets and the basis for financial reporting 
deferred tax liabilities and assets are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
a valuation allowance is provided for deferred tax assets for more likely than not they will be realized 
since inception  we have incurred operating losses and  accordingly  have not recorded a provision for income taxes for any of the periods presented 
as of december   we had net operating loss carryforwards for federal and state income tax purposes of million and million  respectively 
we also had federal research and development tax credit carryforwards of million and state research and development tax credit carryforwards of million 
if not utilized  the federal net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards will expire at various dates beginning in  and the state net operating loss will expire beginning in the state research and development tax credit carryforwards do not expire 
utilization of the net operating loss and tax credits carryforwards may be subject to a substantial annual limitation due to the ownership change limitations provided by section of the internal revenue code of  as amended  that are applicable if we experience a substantial ownership change  which may occur  for example  as a result of the ipo and other sales of our stock including our march  private placement see note  subsequent events and similar state provisions 
the annual limitation may result in the expiration of net operating losses and credits before utilization 
if a substantial change in our ownership is deemed to have occurred or occurs in the future  our ability to use our net loss carryforwards in any year may be limited 
in january   we adopted fasb financial interpretation no 
 or fin the adoption of fin had no impact to our financial statements 
as of december   we recognized no material adjustment in income taxes payable and unrecognized tax benefits because we have incurred net operating losses and have not been subject to income tax since inception 
liquidity and capital resources sources of liquidity since our inception  we have funded our operations primarily through the issuance of common and preferred stock  research funding technology  access fees and milestone payments from our collaboration partners  research grants  loans from biogen idec and other debt financings 
as of december   we had cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities of million and no outstanding debt 
on march   we entered into a securities purchase agreement with accredited investors  including certain members of management  providing for a private placement of our securities of up to million  or the private placement 
the private placement contemplates the sale of up to million of units consisting of series a preferred stock and warrants to purchase common stock in two closings 
million of units would be sold in the initial closing  which is expected to occur in the near term  subject to the satisfaction of customary closing conditions 
subject to the approval of our stockholders  an additional million of units may be sold in the second closing  which closing may occur at our election or at the election of the investors in the private placement 
we may elect to hold the second closing if the achievement of a specified milestone with respect to voreloxin has occurred and our common stock is trading above a specified floor price 
if we have not delivered notice to the investors in the private placement of our election to complete the second closing  or if the conditions for the second closing have not been met  the investors may elect to purchase the units in the second closing by delivering a notice to us of their election to purchase the units 
notice of an election to complete the second closing  either by us or the investors in the private placement  must be delivered on or before the earliest to occur of december   the common equity closing described below or the occurrence of a qualifying alternative common stock financing 
if the second closing occurs  it will be subject to the satisfaction of customary closing conditions 
subject to the approval of our stockholders  the remaining tranche of million of common stock may be sold in the common equity closing 
the common equity closing may be completed at our election prior to the earlier of december  and a qualifying alternative common stock financing  or upon the election of the holders of a majority of the series a preferred stock issued in the private placement prior to a date determined with reference to our cash balance dropping below million at certain future dates 
if we elect to hold the common equity closing  it will be subject to the approval of the purchasers holding a majority of the series a preferred stock issued in the private placement and subject to a condition that we sell at least million of common stock in the common equity closing 
assuming the initial closing for gross proceeds of million described above  we anticipate that the net proceeds from the initial closing  together with our cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities  will be sufficient to enable us to fund our operations at least through the end of in the event the initial closing in the private placement for million of units does not occur  our current cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities are sufficient to fund our operations only through april cash flows net cash used in operating activities was million in  compared to cash used of million and million in the years ended december  and  respectively

credit and loan arrangements in june  we entered into an equipment financing agreement with general electric capital corporation  or gecc 
various credit lines were issued under the financing agreement since in november  the outstanding balance of approximately million was fully paid off prior to the sale of our held for sale assets and no credit lines remain available under this agreement 
our outstanding debt balance was and million as of december  and  respectively 
our interest rates on the debt balance ranged from percent to percent per annum in and operating capital and capital expenditure requirements we expect to continue to incur substantial operating losses in the future 
we will not receive any product revenue until a product candidate has been approved by the united states food and drug administration or fda  or similar regulatory agency in other countries and has been successfully commercialized 
we need to raise substantial additional funds to complete the development and commercialization of voreloxin 
additionally  we may evaluate in licensing and acquisition opportunities to gain access to new drugs or drug targets that would fit with our strategy 
any such transaction would likely increase our funding needs in the future 
our future funding requirements will depend on many factors  including but not limited to the rate of progress and cost of our clinical trials and other development activities  the economic and other terms and timing of any licensing or other partnering arrangement into which we may enter  the costs associated with building or accessing manufacturing and commercialization capabilities  the costs of acquiring or investing in businesses  product candidates and technologies  if any  the costs of filing  prosecuting  defending and enforcing any patent claims and other intellectual property rights  the costs and timing of seeking and obtaining fda and other regulatory approvals  and the effect of competing technological and market developments 
assuming the initial closing for gross proceeds of million as described above  we anticipate that the net proceeds of the initial closing  together with our cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities  will be sufficient to enable us to fund our operations at least through the end of in the event the initial closing in the private placement for million of units does not occur  our current cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities  are sufficient to fund our operations only through april until we can generate a sufficient amount of product revenue to finance our cash requirements  which we may never do  we expect to finance future cash needs primarily through equity issuances including the possible closings of the sale of units and common stock in the private placement described above and subject to the satisfaction of the conditions described above  debt arrangements and a possible partnership or license of development and or commercialization rights to voreloxin 
we do not know whether additional funding will be available on acceptable terms  or at all 
if we are not able to secure additional funding when needed  we may have to delay  reduce the scope of or eliminate one or more of our clinical trials or scale back our development program or conduct additional workforce or other expense reductions 
in addition  we may have to partner voreloxin at an earlier stage of development than we might otherwise choose to do  which would lower the economic value of that program to us
