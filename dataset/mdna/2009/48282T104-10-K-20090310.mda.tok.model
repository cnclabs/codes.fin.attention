item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations reference is made throughout this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations to notes included in our consolidated financial statements beginning on page f of this report 
overview company overview we are a leading supplier of equipment used in the global papermaking and paper recycling industries and are also a manufacturer of granules made from papermaking byproducts 
our continuing operations are comprised of one reportable operating segment pulp and papermaking systems papermaking systems  and two product lines reported in other businesses  which include fiber based products and  prior to its sale in april  casting products 
through our papermaking systems segment  we develop  manufacture  and market a range of equipment and products for the global papermaking and paper recycling industries 
we have a large  stable customer base that includes most of the world s major paper manufacturers 
we believe our large installed base provides us with a spare parts and consumables business that yields higher margins than our capital equipment business  and which should be less susceptible to the cyclical trends in the paper industry 
through our fiber based products line  we manufacture and sell granules derived from pulp fiber for use as carriers for agricultural  home lawn and garden  and professional lawn  turf and ornamental applications  as well as for oil and grease absorption 
our casting products business manufactured grey and ductile iron castings until its sale on april  in addition  prior to its sale in  our subsidiary  composites llc  operated a composite building products business  which is presented as a discontinued operation in the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
international sales during and  approximately of our sales were to customers outside the united states  principally in china and europe 
we generally seek to charge our customers in the same currency in which our operating costs are incurred 
however  our financial performance and competitive position can be affected by currency exchange rate fluctuations affecting the relationship between the us dollar and foreign currencies 
we seek to reduce our exposure to currency fluctuations through the use of forward currency exchange contracts 
we may enter into forward contracts to hedge certain firm purchase and sale commitments denominated in currencies other than our subsidiaries functional currencies 
these contracts hedge transactions principally denominated in us dollars 
application of critical accounting policies and estimates the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our consolidated financial statements  and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
our actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
critical accounting policies are defined as those that entail significant judgments and uncertainties  and could potentially result in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions 
we believe that our most critical accounting policies upon which our financial position depends  and which involve the most complex or subjective decisions or assessments  are those described below 
for a discussion on the application of these and other accounting policies  see note in the notes to consolidated financial statements 

table of contents kadant inc annual report revenue recognition and accounts receivable 
we enter into arrangements with customers that have multiple deliverables  such as equipment and installation  and we recognize revenues and profits on certain long term contracts using the percentage of completion method of accounting 
percentage of completion 
revenues recorded under the percentage of completion method of accounting pursuant to statement of position no 
 accounting for performance of construction type and certain production type contracts  were million in  million in  and million in the percentage of completion is determined by comparing the actual costs incurred to date to an estimate of total costs to be incurred on each contract 
if a loss is indicated on any contract in process  a provision is made currently for the entire loss 
our contracts generally provide for billing of customers upon the attainment of certain milestones specified in each contract 
revenues earned on contracts in process in excess of billings are classified as unbilled contract costs and fees  and amounts billed in excess of revenues are classified as billings in excess of contract costs and fees 
the estimation process under the percentage of completion method affects the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements 
a number of internal and external factors affect our percentage of completion and cost of sales estimates  including labor rate and efficiency variances  estimates of warranty costs  estimated future material prices from vendors  and customer specification and testing requirements 
in addition  we are exposed to the risk  primarily relating to our orders in china that a customer will not comply with the order s contractual obligations to take delivery of the equipment 
the contractual obligations relating to the order may be difficult to enforce through a foreign country s legal system  which could result in a significant credit exposure in the period or periods that were to be affected by the breach of contract 
although we make every effort to ensure the accuracy of our estimates in the application of this accounting policy  if our actual results differed from our estimates  or if we were to use different assumptions  it is possible that materially different amounts could be reported as revenues in our consolidated financial statements 
sab no 
under sab no 
 revenue recognition  when the terms of sale include customer acceptance provisions  and compliance with those provisions cannot be demonstrated until customer acceptance  revenues are recognized upon such acceptance 
when a sale arrangement involves multiple elements eg  installation  we consider the guidance in emerging issues task force eitf no 
revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables 
such transactions are evaluated to determine whether the deliverables in the arrangement represent separate units of accounting 
if equipment and installation do not meet the separation criteria under eitf no 
 revenues for products sold that require installation  for which the installation is essential to functionality or is not deemed inconsequential or perfunctory  are recognized upon completion of installation 
revenues for products sold where installation is not essential to functionality  and is deemed inconsequential or perfunctory  are recognized upon shipment  with estimated installation costs accrued 
we provide a reserve for the estimated warranty and installation costs at the time revenue is recognized  as applicable 
to the extent that installation becomes a significant component of our business in the future  the judgment associated with the determination of revenue recognition will increase 
the complexity of all issues related to the assumptions  risks  and uncertainties inherent in the application of sab no 
affects the amounts reported as revenues in our consolidated financial statements 
under sab no 
 we may not be able to reliably predict future revenues and profitability due to the difficulty of estimating when installation will be performed or when we will meet the contractually agreed upon performance tests  which can delay or prohibit recognition of revenues 
the determination of when we install the equipment or fulfill the performance guarantees is largely dependent on our customers  their willingness to allow installation of the equipment or performance of the appropriate tests in a timely manner  and their cooperation in addressing possible problems that would impede achievement of the performance guarantee criteria 
unexpected changes in the timing related to the completion of installation or performance guarantees could cause our revenues and earnings to be significantly affected 

table of contents kadant inc annual report we exercise judgment in determining our allowance for bad debts  which is based on our historical collection experience  current trends  credit policies  specific customer collection issues  and accounts receivable aging categories 
in determining this allowance  we look at historical writeoffs of our receivables 
we also look at current trends in the credit quality of our customer base as well as changes in our credit policies 
we perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers and adjust credit limits based upon payment history and each customer s current creditworthiness 
we continuously monitor collections and payments from our customers 
in addition  in some instances we utilize letters of credit as a way to mitigate credit exposure 
while actual bad debts have historically been within our expectations and the provisions established  we cannot guarantee that we will continue to experience the same rate of bad debts that we have had in the past  especially in light of current business conditions in the paper industry 
a significant change in the liquidity or financial position of any of our customers could result in the uncollectibility of the related accounts receivable and could adversely affect our operating results and cash flows in that period 
warranty obligations for continuing operations 
we offer warranties of various durations to our customers depending upon the specific product and terms of the customer purchase agreement 
we typically negotiate terms regarding warranty coverage and length of warranty depending on the products and their applications 
our standard mechanical warranties require us to repair or replace a defective product during the warranty period at no cost to the customer 
we record an estimate for warranty related costs at the time of sale based on our actual historical occurrence rates and repair costs  as well as other analytical tools for estimating future warranty claims 
these estimates are revised for variances between actual and expected claims rates 
while our warranty costs have historically been within our expectations and the provisions established  we cannot guarantee that we will continue to experience the same warranty return rates or repair costs that we have in the past 
a significant increase in warranty occurrence rates or costs to repair our products would lead to an increase in the warranty provision and could have a material adverse impact on our consolidated results for the period or periods in which such returns or additional costs occur 
warranty obligations for discontinued operation 
in  our kadant composites llc subsidiary composites llc sold substantially all of its assets to ldi composites co 
under the terms of the asset purchase agreement  composites llc retained certain liabilities associated with the operation of the business prior to the sale  including warranty obligations related to products manufactured prior to the sale date 
all activity related to this business is classified in the results of the discontinued operation in the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
through the second quarter of  composites llc recorded an estimate for warranty related costs at the time of sale based on its actual historical return rates and repair costs  as well as other analytical tools for estimating future warranty claims 
these estimates were revised for variances between actual and expected claims rates 
composites llc s analysis of expected warranty claims rates included detailed assumptions associated with potential product returns  including the type of product sold  temperatures at the location of installation  density of boards  and other factors 
certain assumptions  such as the effect of weather conditions and high temperatures on the product installed  included inherent uncertainties that contributed to variances between actual and expected claims rates 
during the third quarter of  composites llc concluded that the assumptions noted above were not accurately predicting the actual level of warranty claims  making it no longer possible to calculate a reasonable estimate of the future level of potential warranty claims 
accordingly  as no amount within the total range of loss represents a best estimate of the ultimate loss to be recorded  composites llc is required under sfas to record the minimum amount of the potential range of loss for products under warranty 
as of january   the accrued warranty costs associated with the composites business were million  which represent the low end of the range of potential loss for products under warranty based on the level of claims received through the end of composites llc has calculated that the potential warranty cost ranges from million to approximately million 
the high end of the range represents the estimated maximum level of warranty claims remaining based on the total sales of the products under warranty 

table of contents kadant inc annual report composites llc retained all of the cash proceeds received from the asset sale and continued to administer and pay warranty claims from the sale proceeds into the third quarter of on september   composites llc announced that it no longer had sufficient funds to honor warranty claims  was unable to pay or process warranty claims  and ceased doing business 
composites llc will continue to record adjustments to accrued warranty costs to reflect the minimum amount of the potential range of loss for products under warranty based on judgments entered against it in litigation  if any 
stock based compensation 
we issue a variety of stock based compensation  including stock options and restricted stock unit awards  primarily to our key employees and directors 
compensation expense associated with restricted stock units is recognized ratably over the vesting period based on the grant date fair value 
determining the amount of stock based compensation to be recorded for stock options requires us to develop estimates to be used in calculating the grant date fair value 
we did not grant any stock options in  or for options granted prior to  we calculated the grant date fair values using the black scholes valuation model 
the use of valuation models requires us to make estimates of the following assumptions expected volatility we derived the estimated stock price volatility based on a review of our actual historic stock prices commensurate with the expected life of the award 
expected option life our estimate of an expected option life was derived based on a review of our historic option holding periods  including a consideration of the holding period inherent in currently vested  but unexercised options 
we believe that this historical data is currently the best estimate of the expected term of a new option 
risk free interest rate we used the yield on zero coupon us treasury securities for a period that is commensurate with the expected term assumption as the risk free interest rate 
the amount of stock based compensation recognized during a period is based on the value of the portion of the awards that are ultimately expected to vest 
forfeitures are estimated at the time of grant and revised  if necessary  in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates 
pension and other retiree benefits 
several of our us and us subsidiaries sponsor defined benefit pension and other retiree benefit plans 
the cost and obligations of these arrangements are calculated using many assumptions to estimate the benefits that the employee earns while working  the amount of which cannot be completely determined until the benefit payments cease 
major assumptions used in the accounting for these employee benefit plans include the discount rate  expected return on plan assets and rate of increase in employee compensation levels 
assumptions are determined based on company data and appropriate market indicators in consultation with third party actuaries  and are evaluated each year as of the plans measurement date 
our unfunded benefit obligation related to these plans totaled million at year end should any of these assumptions change  they would have an effect on net periodic pension costs and the unfunded benefit obligation 
income taxes 
we estimate the degree to which tax assets and loss carryforwards will result in a benefit based on expected profitability by tax jurisdiction  and provide a valuation allowance for tax assets and loss carryforwards that we believe will more likely than not go unused 
if it becomes more likely than not the tax asset or loss carryforward will be used  we would reverse the related valuation allowance 
our tax valuation allowance totaled million at year end should our actual future taxable income by tax jurisdiction vary from our estimate  additional allowances or reversals thereof may be necessary 
we provide a liability for future income tax payments in the worldwide tax jurisdictions in which we operate 
should tax return positions that we expect are sustainable not be sustained upon audit  we could be required to record an incremental tax provision for such taxes 
should previously unrecognized tax benefits be sustained  a reduction in our tax provision would result 
it is our policy to provide for uncertain tax positions and the related interest and penalties based upon management s assessment of whether a tax benefit is more likely than not to be sustained upon examination by tax authorities 
at january   we believe that we have appropriately accounted for any unrecognized tax benefits 
to the extent we prevail in matters for which a liability for an unrecognized tax benefit is established or are required to pay amounts in excess of the liability  our effective tax rate in a given financial statement period may be affected 

table of contents kadant inc annual report inventories 
we value our inventory at the lower of the actual cost on a first in  first out  or weighted average basis or market value and include materials  labor  and manufacturing overhead 
we regularly review inventory quantities on hand and compare these amounts to historical and forecasted usage of and demand for each particular product or product line 
we record a charge to cost of revenues for excess and obsolete inventory to reduce the carrying value of the inventories to net realizable value 
inventory writedowns have historically been within our expectations and the provisions established 
a significant decrease in demand for our products could result in an increase in the amount of excess inventory quantities on hand  resulting in a charge for the writedown of that inventory in that period 
in addition  our estimates of future product usage or demand may prove to be inaccurate  resulting in an understated or overstated provision for excess and obsolete inventory 
therefore  although we make every effort to ensure the accuracy of our forecasts of future product usage and demand  any significant unanticipated changes in demand or technological developments could have a significant impact on the value of our inventory and our reported operating results 
derivatives 
we use derivative instruments primarily to reduce our exposure to changes in currency exchange rates and interest rates 
when we enter into a derivative contract  we make a determination as to whether the transaction is deemed to be a hedge for accounting purposes 
for contracts deemed to be a hedge  we formally document the relationship between the derivative instrument and the risk being hedged 
in this documentation  we specifically identify the asset  liability  forecasted transaction  cash flow  or net investment that has been designated as the hedged item  and evaluate whether the derivative instrument is expected to reduce the risks associated with the hedged item 
to the extent these criteria are not met  we do not use hedge accounting for the derivative 
sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  as amended  requires that all derivatives be recognized on the balance sheet at fair value 
for derivatives designated as cash flow hedges  the related gains or losses on these contracts are deferred as a component of accumulated other comprehensive items 
these deferred gains and losses are recognized in the period in which the underlying anticipated transaction occurs 
for derivatives designated as fair value hedges  the unrealized gains and losses resulting from the impact of currency exchange rate movements are recognized in earnings in the period in which the exchange rates change and offset the currency gains and losses on the underlying exposures being hedged 
we perform an evaluation of the effectiveness of the hedge both at inception and on an ongoing basis 
the ineffective portion of a hedge  if any  and changes in the fair value of a derivative not deemed to be a hedge  are recorded in the consolidated statement of operations 
we use interest rate swap agreements to hedge our exposure to variable rate debt and have designated these agreements as cash flow hedges of the forecasted interest payments 
the fair values of the interest rate swap agreements are included in other assets for unrecognized gains and in other liabilities for unrecognized losses with an offset in accumulated other comprehensive items net of tax 
we use forward currency exchange contracts primarily to hedge certain operational cash flow hedges and balance sheet fair value hedges exposures resulting from fluctuations in currency exchange rates 
such exposures primarily result from portions of our operations and assets that are denominated in currencies other than the functional currencies of the businesses conducting the operations or holding the assets 
as part of our overall strategy to manage the level of exposure to the risk of currency exchange fluctuations  some of our subsidiaries hedge a portion of their currency exposures anticipated over the ensuing month period  using forward currency exchange contracts that have maturities of months or less 
we do not hold or engage in transactions involving derivative instruments for purposes other than risk management 
valuation of goodwill and intangible assets 
we evaluate the recoverability of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets annually in the fourth quarter  or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances  such as a decline in sales  earnings  or cash flows  or material adverse changes in the business climate  indicate that the carrying value of an asset might be impaired 
goodwill is considered to be impaired when the net book value of a reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value 
fair values are primarily established using a discounted cash flow methodology specifically  the income approach 
the determination of discounted cash flows is based on our long range forecasts 
the revenue growth rates included in the forecasts are our best estimates based on current and anticipated market conditions  and the profit margin assumptions are projected based on current and 
table of contents kadant inc annual report anticipated cost structures 
during the fourth quarter of  we experienced a significant decline in our stock price 
as a result of the decline in our stock price our market capitalization fell significantly below the recorded value of our consolidated net assets 
the reduced market capitalization reflected  in part  the current economic climate  which has led  and we believe will continue to lead  to weakness in demand for some of our products 
we completed the impairment test in the fourth quarter of the forecasts utilized in the impairment test reflected the anticipated decline in stock preparation equipment sales  especially in china  which we expect to see over the next several years given the current economic environment and its impact on paper producers 
the impairment test indicated the carrying amounts of goodwill for the stock preparation reporting unit within our papermaking systems segment exceeded its implied fair value  and as a result  the company recorded a million pre tax million after tax non cash impairment charge to write down the goodwill associated with this reporting unit 
the goodwill impairment test indicated that the estimated fair value of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets associated with its other reporting units exceeded their carrying value and  as a result  no adjustment to goodwill was required for these reporting units 
intangible assets subject to amortization are evaluated for impairment if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset might be impaired 
no adjustment was required in to the carrying value of our intangible assets subject to amortization based on the analysis performed 
our judgments and assumptions regarding the determination of the fair value of an intangible asset or goodwill associated with an acquired business could change as future events impact such fair values 
any future impairment loss could have a material adverse affect on our long term assets and operating expenses in the period in which an impairment is determined to exist 
industry and business outlook our products are primarily sold to the global pulp and paper industry 
the worldwide economic downturn  which accelerated in the fourth quarter of  had a significant negative impact on paper producers 
in response to the economic slowdown  paper producers took numerous steps to control operating costs including closing factories  increasing downtime at paper mills  and delaying or canceling projects 
this slowdown was particularly pronounced in our stock preparation equipment product line where we experienced a million  or  decrease in revenues in compared to the most significant factor contributing to this decrease was the slowdown in china  where the linerboard market is experiencing overcapacity 
our revenues from china are primarily derived from large capital orders  the timing of which is often difficult to predict 
the recent downturn has caused many paper producers in china to significantly delay or even cancel projects 
slowdowns in financing approvals in china s banking system have also negatively affected paper producers in the region 
these delays  as well as delays in receiving down payments  could cause us to recognize revenue on these projects in periods later than originally anticipated 
we expect our revenues in  especially in our stock preparation equipment product line  will continue to be negatively impacted by the current economic environment 
in response to this difficult environment  we have taken a number of steps to optimize our business structure and maximize internal efficiencies  which include integrating multiple operations in a region  merging our sales teams in certain markets  and reducing the number of employees in certain locations  including china and north america 
in addition  we continue to concentrate our efforts on several initiatives intended to improve our operating results  including increasing aftermarket sales  delivering products and technical solutions that provide our customers with a good return on their investments through energy savings and fiber yield improvements  penetrating existing markets where we see opportunity  and increasing our use of low cost manufacturing bases 
we also continue to focus our efforts on managing our operating costs  capital expenditures  and working capital 
for the first quarter of  we expect to report a loss from continuing operations between 
and 
per diluted share  including 
of restructuring costs  on revenues of to million 
for  we expect to report income from continuing operations between

through january   we have not provided for us income taxes on approximately million of unremitted foreign earnings 
the us tax cost has not been determined due to the fact that it is not practicable to estimate at this time 
the related foreign tax withholding  which would be required if we remitted the foreign earnings to the us  would be approximately million

although we currently have no material commitments for capital expenditures  we plan to make expenditures of approximately to million during for property  plant  and equipment

contractual obligations and other commercial commitments the following table summarizes our known contractual obligations and commercial commitments to make future payments or other consideration pursuant to certain contracts as of january   as well as an estimate of the timing in which these obligations are expected to be satisfied

b in the ordinary course of business  certain contracts contain limited performance guarantees  which do not require letters of credit  relating to our equipment and systems 
we typically limit our liability under these guarantees to amounts that would not exceed the value of the contract 
we believe that we have adequate reserves for any potential liability in connection with such guarantees 
these guarantees are not included in this table

g this table excludes a liability for unrecognized tax benefits and an accrual for the payment of interest and penalties totaling million 
due to the uncertain nature of these tax matters  we are unable to make a reasonably reliable estimate as to if and when cash settlements with the appropriate taxing authorities will occur 
provisions in financial guarantees or commitments  debt or lease agreements  or other arrangements could trigger a requirement for an early payment  additional collateral support  amended terms  or acceleration of maturity 
we do not have special purpose entities nor do we use off balance sheet financing arrangements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates  which could affect our future results of operations and financial condition 
we manage our exposure to these risks through our regular operating and financing activities 
we entered into receive variable pay fixed swap agreements in and to hedge our exposure to variable rate long term debt 
additionally  we use short term forward contracts to manage certain exposures to foreign currencies 
we enter into forward currency exchange contracts to hedge firm purchase and sale commitments denominated in currencies other than our subsidiaries local currencies 
we do not engage in extensive foreign currency hedging activities  however  the purpose of our foreign currency hedging activities is to protect our local currency cash flows related to these commitments from fluctuations in foreign exchange rates 
our forward currency exchange contracts principally hedge transactions denominated in us dollars 
gains and losses arising from forward contracts are recognized as offsets to gains and losses resulting from the transactions being hedged 
we do not use financial instruments for trading purposes 
interest rates our cash and cash equivalents are sensitive to changes in interest rates 
interest rate changes would result in a change in interest income due to the difference between the current interest rates on cash and cash equivalents and the variable rates to which these financial instruments may adjust in the future 
a decrease in year end interest rates would have resulted in a negative impact on our net income of million in both and a portion of our outstanding debt is sensitive to changes in interest rates 
we hedged million and million of our debt at year end and  respectively  with receive variable pay fixed swap agreements 
the fair values of the swap agreements are sensitive to changes in long term swap rates 
a decrease in the long term swap rates would have resulted in an increase in unrealized losses of million and million as of year end and  respectively 
the remaining unhedged portion of the debt totaling million and million as of year end and  respectively  is sensitive to changes in interest rates 
as of year end and  the interest rate on the unhedged portion of our us debt was based on libor  and for our foreign debt  based on rates established by the people s bank of china 
a increase in the year end rates would have resulted in a negative impact on our net loss income of million in both and currency exchange rates we generally view our investment in foreign subsidiaries in a functional currency other than our reporting currency as long term 
our investment in foreign subsidiaries is sensitive to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates 
the functional currencies of our foreign subsidiaries are principally denominated in euros  british pounds sterling  mexican pesos  canadian dollars  chinese renminbi and brazilian reals 
the effect of 
table of contents kadant inc annual report changes in foreign exchange rates on our net investment in foreign subsidiaries is reflected in the accumulated other comprehensive items component of shareholders investment 
a depreciation in functional currencies at year end and  relative to the us dollar  would have resulted in a reduction in shareholders investment of million and million  respectively 
the fair value of forward currency exchange contracts is sensitive to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates 
the fair value of forward currency exchange contracts is the estimated amount that we would pay or receive upon termination of the contracts  taking into account the change in foreign currency exchange rates 
a depreciation in year end and foreign currency exchange rates related to our contracts would have resulted in an increase in unrealized losses on forward currency exchange contracts of million and million in and  respectively 
since we use forward currency exchange contracts as hedges of firm purchase and sale commitments  the unrealized gain or loss on forward foreign currency exchange contracts resulting from changes in foreign currency exchange rates would be offset primarily by corresponding changes in the fair value of the hedged items
