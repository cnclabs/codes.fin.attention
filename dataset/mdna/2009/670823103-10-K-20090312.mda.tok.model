box economics is the relationship between the investment in our restaurants and the sales and related operating margin that those investments should produce 
our product development teams at all three concepts continue to deliver great tasting menu offerings 
while same store sales and guest counts decreased at all of our concepts  average check increased during by percent at our o charley s restaurants  percent at our ninety nine restaurants and percent at our stoney river restaurants 
we increased our advertising spending as a percent of sales in in order to improve consumer awareness of our brands 
as part of the re branding initiative  we have trained and implemented new service standards  and introduced new kitchen technology and menu engineering 
while we believe our re branding programs have improved our guests perceptions of our brands  in light of the current economic conditions and the impact on consumer spending  and to maintain financial flexibility  we do not plan to re brand any additional restaurants in through the end of fiscal  we have completed a total of project revo lution re brandings at our o charley s restaurants and dressed to the nines re brandings at our ninety nine restaurants

fiscal years end on the last sunday of the calendar year 
fiscal years and each consisted of weeks while fiscal consisted of weeks 
we have one reportable segment 
following is an explanation of certain items in our consolidated statements of operations revenues consist primarily of company operated and joint venture restaurant sales and  to a lesser extent  royalty and franchise revenue 
restaurant sales include food and beverage sales and are net of applicable state and local sales taxes and discounts 
franchise revenue and other revenue consists of development fees  royalties on sales by franchised units and royalties on sales of branded food items  particularly salad dressings 
our development fees for franchisees in which we do not have an ownership interest are between  and  per restaurant 
the development fees are recognized during the reporting period in which the developed restaurant begins operation 
the royalties are recognized in revenue in the period corresponding to the franchisees sales 
a percentage of gift card redemptions  based on actual experience  are recognized as income for gift cards sold that will not be redeemed 
cost of food and beverage primarily consists of the costs of beef  poultry  seafood  produce and alcoholic and non alcoholic beverages net of vendor discounts and rebates 
the three most significant commodities that may affect our cost of food and beverage are beef  poultry and seafood which accounted for approximately percent  percent and percent  respectively  of our overall cost of food and beverage in generally  temporary increases in these costs are not passed on to guests  however  in the past  we have adjusted menu prices to compensate for increased costs of a more permanent nature 
payroll and benefits include payroll and related costs and expenses directly relating to restaurant level activities including restaurant management salaries  bonuses  share based compensation  k compensation match  hourly wages for restaurant level team members  payroll taxes  workers compensation  various health  life and dental insurance programs  vacation expense and sick pay 
we have various incentive plans that compensate restaurant management for achieving certain restaurant level financial targets and performance goals 
restaurant operating costs include occupancy and other expenses at the restaurant level  except property and equipment depreciation and amortization 
in addition to occupancy costs  supplies  straight line rent  supervisory salaries  bonuses  share based compensation  k and deferred compensation match for multi unit operational employees  and related expenses  management training salaries  general liability and property insurance  property taxes  utilities  repairs and maintenance  outside services and credit card fees account for the major expenses in this category 
advertising and marketing expenses include all advertising and marketing related expenses for the various programs that we utilize to promote traffic and brand recognition for our three restaurant concepts 
this category also includes the administrative costs of our marketing departments

this category also includes all recruiting  relocation and most severance related expenses 
severance costs associated with the supply chain restructuring are included in the impairment  disposal and restructuring charges  net line 
depreciation and amortization  property and equipment primarily includes depreciation on property and equipment calculated on a straight line basis over the estimated useful lives of the respective assets or the lease term plus one renewal term for leasehold improvements  if shorter 
based on the size of the investment that we make  the economic penalty incurred by discontinuing use of the leased facility  our historical experience with respect to the length of time a restaurant operates at a specific location  and leases that typically have multiple five year renewal options that are exercised entirely at our discretion  we have concluded that one five year renewal option is reasonably assured 
it also includes accelerated depreciation expenses taken on assets to be disposed of during our project revo lution and dressed to the nines re branding activities 
impairment  disposal and restructuring charges  net includes asset impairments  asset disposals  gains and losses incurred upon the sale of assets  and to a lesser extent  various costs associated with restructuring our supply chain 
impairment charges are taken for land  buildings and equipment and certain other assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of the assets to the future undiscounted net cash flows expected to be generated by the assets 
impairment charges for assets that are held for sale represents the difference between their current book value and the estimated net sales proceeds 
disposal charges include the costs incurred to prepare the asset or assets for sale  including repair and maintenance  clean up costs  broker commissions  and independent appraisals 
gains and or losses associated with the sale of assets are also included in this category 
we evaluate restaurant closures for potential disclosure as discontinued operations based on an assessment of quantitative and qualitative factors  including the nature of the closure  potential for revenue migration to other company operated and franchised restaurants  planned market development in the area of the closed restaurant and the significance of the impact on the related consolidated financial statement line items 
goodwill impairment represents the impairment associated with goodwill as events and circumstances result in a carrying value in excess of fair value 
the determination of a goodwill impairment  in accordance with sfas no 
 consists of a two step process 
the first step consists of comparing each reporting unit s fair value to its carrying value 
if the carrying value exceeds the fair value  the goodwill is considered to be potentially impaired 
if a potential impairment exists  a second step is performed to measure the amount of the impairment 
pre opening costs represent costs associated with our store opening teams  as well as other costs associated with opening a new restaurant 
these costs are expensed as incurred 
these costs also include straight line rent related to leased properties from the period of time between when we have waived any contingencies regarding use of the leased property and the date on which the restaurant opens 
the amount of pre opening costs incurred in any one period includes costs incurred during the period for restaurants opened and under development 
our pre opening costs may vary significantly from period to period primarily due to the timing of restaurant development and openings 
pre opening costs also include training  supply  and other incremental costs necessary to prepare for the re opening of an existing restaurant as part of project revo lution and dressed to the nines re brandings 
interest expense  net represents the sum of the following interest on our credit facility  interest on our percent senior subordinated notes due the notes  impact of the interest rate swaps on the million notional amount of the notes  amortization of prepaid interest and finance charges  changes in the value of the assets associated with our non qualified deferred compensation plan resulting from gains and losses in the underlying funds  interest on capital lease obligations  fees for certain unused credit facilities  and interest income from our investments in overnight repurchase agreements

when computing same store sales  guest visits and average check per guest  restaurants open for at least weeks are compared from period to period for company operated restaurants 
the average check per guest is computed using all restaurants open at the end of the year 
fiscal year compared with fiscal year overview the comparison between our financial results in and our financial results in was impacted by a number of developments in such years 
goodwill impairment charges of million  charges of million to establish a valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets  and severance charges from organizational changes in our support centers of million reduced our income from operations in impairment  severance  and transition charges relating to the sale of the commissary and other supply chain changes reduced our income from operations in by million 
severance  recruiting and relocation charges relating to our organizational changes reduced income from operations in by million 
the comparison between our financial results in and our financial results in was also impacted by restaurant impairment charges in both years 
during we recorded impairment charges for restaurants that will remain open 
these asset impairment charges reduced income from operations in by million  net of gains on related asset sales 
in comparison  during we recorded impairment charges for one restaurant that we closed and for five restaurants that have remained open 
these asset impairment charges  net of gains on related asset sales  reduced income from operations in by million 
all of these restaurant impairment charges  as well as impairment charges connected with changes in our supply chain  are reflected in impairment  disposal  and restructuring charges  net 
revenues saw a continued slow down in the us economy as consumers continued to react to declining home prices  rising unemployment  increased prices for energy and food  and turbulence in the financial markets 
these trends had a negative impact on our sales and guest counts in during  total revenues decreased million  or percent  to million from million in in  we increased average check at all of our concepts  which was more than offset by a decrease in guest visits at all of our concepts 
the increase in average check was attributable to increases in menu prices and changes in product mix 
we believe that the decrease in guest counts was due primarily to weak consumer demand caused by the current economic environment 
we had a net addition of five company owned restaurants in o charley s company operated restaurant sales decreased million  or percent  to million during  as compared to million in during  same store sales for o charley s company operated restaurants declined percent  which was comprised of a decrease in guest counts of percent  partially offset by an increase in average check of percent 
during  we added four new company operated o charley s restaurants and closed one company operated o charley s restaurant 
ninety nine restaurant sales decreased million  or percent  to million during  as compared to million in during  same store sales declined percent  which was comprised of a decrease in guest counts of percent  partially offset by an increase in average check of percent 
during  we added two new restaurants and closed one ninety nine restaurant 
stoney river restaurant sales decreased million  or percent  to million during  as compared to million in during  stoney river experienced a same store sales decrease of percent  which was comprised of a decrease in guest counts of percent  partially offset by an increase in average check of percent 
during  we added one new stoney river restaurant 
cost of food and beverage during  our cost of food and beverage was million  or percent of restaurant sales  compared with million  or percent of restaurant sales  in this basis point increase in food and beverage cost as a percentage of sales in reflects the impact of increased discount  promotion  and coupon activity designed to drive sales  higher costs on most food commodities specifically  beef  poultry and seafood  and higher fuel related distribution costs 
payroll and benefits during  payroll and benefits were million  or percent of restaurant sales  compared to million  or percent of restaurant sales in the increase in payroll and benefit costs as a percentage of restaurant sales was due to the de leveraging impact of the reductions in guest counts  higher employee benefit costs and higher management labor expense on a reduced sales base 
restaurant operating costs during  restaurant operating costs were million  or percent of restaurant sales  compared to million  or percent of restaurant sales in this basis point increase  as a percentage of restaurant sales  was primarily the result of an increase in utility costs and the de leveraging impact of reduced sales on other fixed costs  such as rent 
advertising and marketing expenses during  advertising and marketing expenditures increased percent to million from million in and  as a percentage of total revenues  increased to percent from percent in this basis point increase  as a percentage of sales  was primarily attributable to our decision to increase spending at the o charley s concept in an effort to drive sales in the current economic environment  as well as the de leveraging impact of reduced sales 
general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses decreased percent to million in from million in  and as a percentage of total revenues  decreased to percent from percent in the prior year 
this net basis point decrease in general and administrative expense is the result of several partly offsetting items 
general and administrative expenses decreased due to changes in the value of deferred compensation from the investment performance of the participant s self directed accounts and effective spending controls  partly offset by increased share based compensation expense and severance costs 
depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization expense was million or percent of total revenues  as compared to million  or percent of total revenues  in deprecation and amortization expense was essentially flat over the same prior year period  however  as a percentage of revenue  depreciation and amortization was higher as a result of the de leveraging impact of reduced sales 
impairment  disposal and restructuring charges  net impairment  disposal and restructuring charges  net were million or percent of revenue in  compared to million or percent of revenue in in we recorded impairment charges with respect to seven o charley s restaurants  ten ninety nine restaurants and two stoney river restaurants  all of which will remain open  as well as our remaining airplane 
the current economic environment  reduced consumer spending  and current negative economic outlook have reduced demand and expected future cash flow for our products  therefore  reducing the fair value of these restaurants  as well as the airplane  below their carrying value 
the excess carrying value of the restaurants and airplane was recorded as an impairment charge on our statement of operations 
in these charges included million in connection with changes in our supply chain which primarily consisted of non cash charges taken for the loss on the sale of the commissary real estate and facility and related impairment of manufacturing equipment  charges taken for employee severance and retention  and to a lesser extent  legal and transition costs 
we also recorded impairment and disposal costs of million relating to restaurant re brandings  restaurant impairments and other asset retirements during included in the million charge were the impairments related to three underperforming o charley s restaurants  one of which was closed  and the impairment of one stoney river restaurant and two ninety nine restaurants that have remained open 
goodwill impairment we test goodwill and intangible assets for potential impairment on an annual basis or when events or circumstances indicate a possible impairment  in accordance with sfas no 
due to the decrease of our enterprise market value  the current economic environment  the negative financial performance of other casual dining restaurant companies  and lower sales and higher commodity costs at the ninety nine restaurants  we believed the goodwill related to the acquisition of the ninety nine restaurants was potentially impaired 
during the third quarter of  we completed the first step of the impairment evaluation process and recorded an estimated goodwill impairment charge of million related to our ninety nine restaurants 
the estimated fair value of the ninety nine restaurants was based on the average of three valuation methodologies market multiple  comparable transaction  and discounted cash flow 
the results indicated an impairment as the current carrying value exceeded the estimated fair value 
based on sfas no 
 we were required to record goodwill impairment if the amount was probable and reasonably estimable 
we obtained an updated estimate of fair value of the ninety nine restaurants and completed the second step of the goodwill impairment process during the fourth quarter of and recognized an additional impairment charge of million 
the additional impairment charge in the fourth quarter of was primarily due to the continued decline in our enterprise market value and lower estimates of and projected operating results in our ninety nine concept 
we also tested the goodwill of our stoney river restaurants and recorded an impairment charge of million resulting in the write off of all of the goodwill on our balance sheet pre opening costs during  our pre opening costs increased million to million  or percent of total revenues  compared with million  or percent of total revenues  in this increase in pre opening costs was due primarily to an increase in the number of new store construction and re branding initiatives 
during we completed project revo lution and dressed to the nines re brandings 
since inception  we have completed a total of project revo lution re brandings at our o charley s restaurants  and dressed to the nines re brandings at our ninety nine restaurants 
we have suspended our re branding initiatives until economic conditions improve 
interest expense  net our net interest expense was million in  as compared to million in this change from the prior year is primarily the result of changes in the value of deferred compensation balances  million of borrowings under our credit facility  and fees  charges  and write offs of previously deferred finance costs related to third and fourth amendments to our credit facility and a reduction in our borrowing capacity 
at the end of  we did not have any borrowings under our credit facility 
income taxes for we have recorded an income tax expense of million  compared with million of tax benefit in the prior year 
we estimate that the tax credits for  which are primarily the fica tip credits and the work opportunity tax credit wotc  will be approximately million 
included in the tax expense of million is a charge of million to establish a deferred income tax valuation allowance on substantially all of our deferred tax assets 
under sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes sfas no 
 we are required to assess whether a valuation allowance should be established against our deferred tax assets based on the consideration of all available evidence using a more likely than not standard 
in making such judgments  significant weight is given to evidence that can be objectively verified 
as a result of the goodwill impairment charge  we now have a three year cumulative pre tax loss 
a cumulative pre tax loss is given more weight than projections of future income  and a recent historical cumulative loss is considered a significant factor that is difficult to overcome 
before consideration of the valuation allowance expense  we had an income tax benefit of million  including the tax credits 
the deferred tax valuation allowance may be released in future years when we consider that it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will be realized 
to form a conclusion that some or all of the deferred tax assets will be realized  we will need to generate a three year cumulative pre tax income  and we will need to evaluate whether or not all available evidence  such as future taxable income and reversal of temporary differences  provides sufficient positive evidence to offset any other potential negative evidence that may exist at such time 
in the event the deferred tax valuation allowance is released  we would record an income tax benefit for the portion or all of the deferred tax valuation allowance released 
fiscal year compared with fiscal year revenues as progressed  the us economy experienced a slow down in consumer spending  as consumers increasingly reacted to declining home prices  increased prices for energy and food  and turbulence in the credit markets 
these trends had a negative impact on our sales and guest counts in during  total revenues decreased million  or percent  to million from million in in  we increased average check at all of our concepts  partially offset by a decrease in guest visits at all of our concepts 
the increase in average check and decrease in guest counts was attributable to the partial phase out of the kids eat free program at our o charley s concept  the reduction of promotional coupons and a more analytical approach to menu pricing at all of our concepts in we had a net addition of three company owned restaurants in o charley s company operated restaurant sales decreased million  or percent  to million during  as compared to million in  primarily as a result of a rd week in  as compared to a week year in during  same store sales for o charley s company operated restaurants declined percent  which was comprised of a decrease in guest counts of percent partially offset by an increase in average check of percent 
during  we added five new company operated o charley s restaurants and closed three company operated o charley s restaurants 
ninety nine restaurant sales decreased million  to million during  as compared to million in the year over year sales decrease was primarily related to a rd week in  as compared to weeks in this was offset by a same store sales increase of percent and the net addition of one new restaurant during the same store sales increase in was comprised of a percent increase in average check per guest partially offset by a decrease in guest counts of percent 
stoney river restaurant sales increased million  or percent  to million during  as compared to million in this increase in revenue reflects business from three restaurants that were opened during and operated for the entire year of  as compared to only a partial year in during  stoney river experienced a same store sales decrease of percent which was comprised of a decrease in guest counts of percent partially offset by an increase in average check of percent 
cost of food and beverage during  our cost of food and beverage was million  or percent of restaurant sales  compared with million  or percent of restaurant sales  in this basis point improvement in food and beverage cost as a percentage of sales in reflects the impact of our higher average check for all of our concepts which is primarily due to higher margins on our limited time offers  a more analytical approach to menu pricing and the continued reduction of our kids eat free program at our o charley s concept  partially offset by higher costs on most food commodities 
payroll and benefits during  payroll and benefits were million  or percent of restaurant sales  compared to million  or percent of restaurant sales in the increase in payroll and benefit costs as a percentage of restaurant sales was due to higher minimum wage rates  the de leveraging impact of the reductions in guest counts and higher employee benefit costs 
restaurant operating costs during  restaurant operating costs were million  or percent of restaurant sales  compared to million  or percent of restaurant sales in this basis point increase  as a percentage of restaurant sales  is primarily the result of an increase in repair and maintenance costs  general liability costs and higher occupancy costs 
advertising and marketing expenses during  advertising and marketing expenditures increased percent to million from million in and  as a percentage of total revenues  increased to percent from percent in the basis point increase  as a percentage of sales  is primarily attributable to our decision to increase spending in this area beginning in the second quarter of and for the remainder of at the o charley s concept in response to current conditions in the restaurant industry and discounting by certain of our competitors 
general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses decreased percent to million in from million in  and as a percentage of total revenues  decreased to percent from percent in the prior year 
this basis point decrease in general and administrative expenses is primarily the result of decreased bonus compensation expense as no bonuses were accrued for  or paid to  the executive officers as our earnings per diluted share were below the bonus threshold level 
this decrease was offset by higher costs associated with our share based compensation plans and professional fees 
depreciation and amortization during  depreciation and amortization expense was million or percent of total revenues  as compared to million  or percent  in the increase in deprecation and amortization is primarily attributable to our capital expenditures over the past two years and for charges taken for accelerated depreciation associated with our re brandings initiative 
impairment  disposal and restructuring charges  net during  we recorded charges of million for impairment  disposal and restructuring charges  net which consisted of million in connection with changes in our supply chain which primarily consisted of non cash charges taken for the loss on the sale of the commissary real estate and facility and related impairment of manufacturing equipment  charges taken for employee severance and retention  and to a lesser extent  legal and transition costs 
we also recorded impairment and disposal costs of million relating to restaurant re brandings  restaurant impairments and other asset retirements during included in the million charge are the impairments related to three underperforming o charley s restaurants one of which was closed and the impairment of one stoney river restaurant and two ninety nine restaurants that have remained open 
our results of operations for include net charges of million for impairment  disposals and restructuring charges 
this amount includes an asset impairment charge of million related to three planned o charley s restaurant closures  million relating to one o charley s restaurant and two ninety nine restaurants that are impaired but have remained open  and million relating to the impairment of purchased software and assets related to the company s re branding efforts 
the million charge in was offset by a net gain of million on assets held for sale and other assets that were sold 
pre opening costs during  our pre opening costs decreased million to million  or percent of total revenues  compared with million  or percent of total revenues  in the decrease is due to the reduction in company owned restaurant openings in  as compared to interest expense  net our net interest costs were million in  as compared to million in this change from the prior year is primarily the result of higher earnings on our cash and cash equivalents  as we earned higher rates of return on our overnight repurchase agreements of approximately basis points 
income taxes during  our income tax expense decreased million to a million tax benefit  compared with million of tax expense in the prior year 
our effective tax rate was a negative percent in compared to percent in this decrease was the result of reduced levels of pretax profit in along with the value of our tax credits for the fica tip credit and the work opportunities tax credit that were higher than our tax liability at the statutory rate 
outlook given current conditions in the general economy and the casual dining industry  and the resulting uncertainty about future performance  we are not offering sales or earnings guidance for we expect to open one ninety nine restaurant and one stoney river in we estimate our capital expenditures to be between million and million for we have started to lock in pricing on many of ourcommodities for  in an attempt to reduce their cost 
to date  we have locked in over percent of our beef requirements and approximately half of our seafood requirements 
of the beef and seafood prices we have locked in  these prices are on average at or below prices for like items 
we have also locked in pricing for approximately percent of our requirements for poultry and approximately percent of our requirements for pork  at prices that are higher than prices for like items 
of the poultry and pork prices we have locked in  we expect to see increases in the low single digits 
liquidity and capital resources our primary sources of capital have historically been cash provided by operations  borrowings under our credit facilities and capital leases 
our principal capital needs have historically arisen from property and equipment additions  acquisitions  and payments on long term debt and capitalized lease obligations 
in addition  we lease a substantial number of our restaurants under operating leases and have substantial operating lease obligations 
like many restaurant companies  our working capital has historically had current liabilities in excess of current assets due to the fact that most of our sales are received as cash or credit card charges  and we have reinvested our cash in new restaurant development  re branding capital spending and other capital expenditures  or have used or cash to fund stock repurchases or cash dividends 
we do not believe this indicates a lack of liquidity 
to the extent operations generate cash in excess of working capital and development needs  we have historically invested this cash in overnight repurchase agreements 
we have slowed our restaurant development in recent years in order to focus on improving the performance of our existing restaurants and reduce our debt 
we opened four company owned o charley s restaurants  two ninety nine restaurants and one stoney river restaurant during as part of our focus on improving the performance of our existing restaurants  we completed o charley s restaurants re brandings and ninety nine restaurant re brandings during and since inception have completed o charley s restaurant re brandings and ninety nine restaurant re brandings as of december  during the third quarter of  we ceased our re branding initiatives in light of the current economic conditions  the impact on consumer spending  and to maintain financial flexibility 
we do not plan to re brand any additional restaurants in we believe that our various sources of capital  including cash flow from operating activities  availability under our credit facility  and the ability to acquire additional financing  are adequate to finance operations as well as to fund the repayment of current debt obligations 
over the past several months  we have been paying down the balances on our revolving credit facility and our capital lease obligations 
at the end of the third quarter of  the balances on our revolving credit facility and capital lease obligations were million and million  respectively 
as of the end of  the balances on our revolving credit facility and capital lease obligations were million and million  respectively 
we currently believe this is a trend that will continue  given the fact that we have reduced our plans for capital expenditures from the million spent in to approximately million to million in we have made this decision with the understanding that our cash provided by operating activities could be lower in than they were in our credit facility has participation from nine regional and national bank organizations  all of which have been impacted to some extent by the current economic environment and credit crisis 
as of the end of  we had million of remaining borrowing capacity under our credit facility 
of this amount two banks each have made commitments for of the capacity  three banks each have made commitments for of the capacity and four banks each have made commitments for of the capacity 
based upon our conversations with these banks and our current lack of dependence upon our credit facility to substantially fund our operations  we believe that in the event of a disruption or cessation of operations by one or more participants in our credit facility rendering them unable to fund any short term financing that we may have  given the remaining capacity available to us under the credit facility in such event  that we would be able to continue meeting our current obligations and funding our operating activities through internally generated cash or through other financing means available to us 
net cash provided by operating activities decreased in from by approximately percent  or million  from million to million 
after considering changes in non cash items such as goodwill  restaurant and other impairments and a reduction in our deferred tax asset  resulting from the valuation allowances prescribed by sfas no 
 our cash provided through net earnings decreased by million 
there were several off setting changes in working capital resulting in the additional million net reduction in cash provided by operating activities 
material factors contributing to this decrease include an additional million of inventory at december   as we exercised favorable commodity buying opportunities  increased construction related inventory associated with our re branding project which can be re deployed to future projects and greater on hand inventory at the restaurants  an additional million of prepaid technology maintenance contracts and advertising  and other items of million  net 
this was partly offset by a million increase related to recorded credit balances with certain financial institutions 
on october   we entered into a second amended and reinstated credit agreement as amended  the credit agreement 
the credit agreement contains customary restrictive covenants  including limitations on dividends  repurchases of capital stock  sale leaseback transactions  the incurrence of additional indebtedness and mergers  acquisitions and asset sales 
in addition  the credit agreement contains certain financial covenants 
on december   we amended our credit agreement 
this amendment changed three of the four financial covenants the adjusted debt to ebidar has been increased from to through the end of the current fiscal year  and thereafter  our actual adjusted debt to ebitdar ratio was  the minimum fixed charge ratio has been reduced from to  our actual fixed charge coverage ratio was  the maximum senior leverage ratio has been reduced from to  our actual senior secured leverage ratio was  and our minimum capital expenditures ratio of  which was not changed  was 
pursuant to the amendment  our pricing grid increased from basis points over libor on drawn balances and basis points for undrawn balances to an initial basis points over libor on drawn balances and basis points for undrawn balances 
our maximum borrowing capacity was reduced from million to million  and will be further reduced to million by the end of the first fiscal quarter of at december   we had million outstanding under the credit agreement and million in letters of credit  which reduced our available borrowings under the credit agreement 
pursuant to our credit agreement  we have million in remaining capacity at december  as of the end of our fiscal year  there were no defaults under the credit agreement and we were in compliance with all covenants 
the interest rates per annum applicable to loans outstanding under the credit agreement are  at our option  equal to either a base rate or a libor rate  in each case plus an applicable margin percent to percent in the case of base rate loans and percent to percent in the case of libor rate loans  depending on adjusted debt to ebitdar ratio 
at december   our margin applicable to libor loans was basis points 
in addition to the interest payments required under the credit agreement  we are required to pay a commitment fee on the aggregate average daily unused portion of the credit facility equal to percent to percent per annum  depending on our adjusted debt to ebitdar ratio 
at december   our applicable commitment fee on the aggregate average daily unused portion of the credit facility was percent 
our obligations under the credit agreement are secured by liens on substantially all of our assets  including a pledge of the capital stock of our material subsidiaries but excluding real property acquired after november  
except as otherwise provided in the credit agreement  the credit agreement will mature on october  in addition  we have four separate lease agreements that cover lease arrangements for an aggregate of ninety nine restaurants  each of which contains a fixed charge covenant calculation 
each of the four restaurant groups are subject to an annual fixed charge coverage ratio of to 
we were in compliance with this covenant at december from time to time  we have entered into interest rate swap agreements with certain financial institutions 
during the first quarter of  we entered into interest rate swap agreements with a financial institution that effectively converted a portion of the fixed rate indebtedness related to the million aggregate principal amount of senior subordinated notes due into variable rate obligations 
on december   the counterparties to our swap agreements exercised their right to exit the agreement in exchange for a million payment of the remaining swap value  and we therefore did not have any swap arrangements as of december  we announced a quarterly dividend of per share during the first  second and third quarters of during the weeks ended december   we have paid million in dividends 
during the fourth fiscal quarter of  the board of directors decided to discontinue the per share quarterly dividend to conserve cash and reduce our debt 
pursuant to the terms of our amended credit agreement  we are prohibited from paying dividends 
on february   we announced that our board of directors approved a million increase in our share repurchase authorization 
during  the board of directors approved a million repurchase authorization under which we repurchased million of our common stock by the end of fiscal during  we repurchased million shares for million 
the remaining balance that may be repurchased under the current repurchase authorization is million 
pursuant to the credit facility and the bond indenture  the basket available to pay dividends and repurchase shares is equal to million plus of cumulative net earnings since the beginning of fiscal since the beginning of fiscal  we have paid dividends of million and made share repurchases of million 
our cumulative net loss since the beginning of fiscal is million 
based upon our cumulative net loss since the beginning of fiscal  we cannot repurchase any more shares of our stock or pay dividends under the terms of our credit agreement 
in and  net cash flows used by investing activities included capital expenditures incurred principally for building new restaurants  improvements to existing restaurants  and technological improvements at our restaurant support center 
we did not finance any capital expenditures during capital expenditures for and  excluding new computer equipment financed through capital lease obligations in  were as follows year ended december  december  in thousands new restaurant capital expenditures re branding capital expenditures other capital expenditures total capital expenditures expenditures related to our kitchen display system initiative  of approximately million  previously shown as other capital expenditures in have been reclassified and included as re branding capital expenditures 
contractual obligations and commercial commitments the following tables set forth our contractual obligations and commercial commitments at december  payments due by period less more than than total yr yrs yrs years contractual obligation in thousands long term debt  excluding credit facility long term debt interest capitalized lease obligations operating leases unconditional purchase obligations total contractual obligations amount of commitment expiration per period other commercial commitments total committed less than yr yrs yrs more than years in thousands line of credit fin tax liability this interest primarily relates to our million senior subordinated notes with stated interest rate of percent 
in december  the counterparties to our swap agreements exercised their right to exit the agreement in exchange for a million payment of the remaining swap value 
in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles gaap  the million will be recognized over the life of the senior subordinated notes 
however  since the entire million payment was received in  the full credit has been applied against interest due less than year 
capitalized lease obligations include a million interest component 
these purchase obligations are primarily food obligations with fixed commitments in regards to the time period of the contract with annual price adjustments that can fluctuate and a fixed beverage contract with an annual price adjustment 
in situations where the price is based on market prices  we use the existing market prices at december  to determine the amount of the obligation 
total unconditional purchase obligations shown are based on variable pricing that is adjusted annually 
this pertains to our credit facility 
at december   we had million outstanding on this credit facility 
we have million of outstanding letters of credit as of december  as of december   we had million remaining borrowing capacity under our credit facility 
this credit facility is reduced to million by the end of the first quarter of and has a maturity date of october  joint ventures and franchise arrangements in connection with our franchising initiative  we have entered into joint venture arrangements to develop and operate o charley s restaurants 
for any franchisee or joint venture partner in which we have an ownership interest  we may make loans to the joint venture entity and or guarantee certain of its debt and obligations 
while we continue to work towards increasing our number of franchised restaurants  as of december   we do not intend to do so pursuant to joint venture agreements

critical accounting policies we prepare our consolidated financial statements in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles gaap 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements  and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period see note to our consolidated financial statements 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
critical accounting policies are those that management believes are both most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and operating results  and require management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
judgments and uncertainties affecting the application of those policies may result in materially different amounts being reported under different conditions or using different assumptions 
we consider the following policies to be most critical in understanding the judgments that are involved in preparing our consolidated financial statements 
our critical accounting policies are as follows lease accounting share based compensation property and equipment goodwill and trademarks impairment of long lived assets income taxes lease accounting on february   the office of the chief accountant of the sec issued a letter to the american institute of certified public accountants expressing its views regarding certain accounting principles relating to three aspects of lease accounting the period of time used for the amortization of leasehold improvements  the recognition of rent expense when the lease term in an operating lease contains a period of free or reduced rents commonly referred to as a rent holiday  and accounting for landlord improvement incentives to tenants 
in october  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued fasb staff position fsp fas  accounting for rental costs incurred during a construction period 
the fasb concludes in this fsp that rental costs associated with ground or building operating leases that are incurred during a construction period should be expensed 
our policy for lease accounting involves recognizing rent on a straight line basis from the time we are committed to a leased property  which is when all contingencies associated with the delivery of the property by the landlord are taken care of  to the end of the lease term  generally inclusive of one renewal period 
the term  for purposes of straight line rent calculations and the useful life over which leasehold improvements are depreciated  is the shorter of the estimated useful life of the leased property or the base lease term  inclusive of one renewal period 
we also recognize tenant allowances as a deferred rent liability and amortize them over the lease term  inclusive of one renewal period 
based upon the size of the investment that we make at a restaurant site  the economic penalty incurred by discontinuing use of the leased facility  our historical experience with respect to the length of time a restaurant operates at a specific location  and leases that typically have multiple five year renewal options that are exercised entirely at our discretion  we have concluded that one five year renewal option is reasonably assured 
share based compensation effective december   the company adopted sfas no 
revised  share based payment  sfas no 
r  which requires the measurement and recognition of compensation cost at fair value for all share based payments including stock options 
share based compensation for fiscal years   and includes compensation expense  recognized over the applicable vesting periods  for share based awards granted prior to  but not vested as of december   as well as compensation cost for new share based awards granted during   and we use the black scholes merton option pricing model to estimate the fair value of stock options on their grant dates 
under the black scholes merton option pricing model we estimate volatility using only historical share price performance over the expected life of the option 
the company s policy is to recognize compensation cost for restricted awards with only service conditions and a graded vesting schedule on a straight line basis over the requisite service period for the entire award 
in addition  sfas no 
r also requires that compensation expense be recognized for only the portion of options and restricted awards that are expected to vest 
therefore  an estimated forfeiture rate derived from historical employee terminations is applied against share based compensation expense 
the forfeiture rate is applied on a straight line basis over the service vesting period for each separately vesting portion of the award as if the award was in substance  multiple awards 
property and equipment the company had million of property and equipment  net of accumulated depreciation  at december  as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements  our property and equipment are stated at cost and depreciated on a straight line basis over the following estimated useful lives building and improvements years  furniture  fixtures and equipment to years 
leasehold improvements are amortized over the lesser of the asset s estimated useful life or the expected lease term  inclusive of one renewal period 
equipment under capital leases is amortized to its expected residual value at the end of the lease term 
gains or losses are recognized upon the disposal of property and equipment  and the asset and related accumulated depreciation and amortization are removed from the accounts 
maintenance  repairs and betterments that do not enhance the value of or increase the life of the assets are expensed as incurred 
we capitalize all direct external costs associated with obtaining the land  building and equipment for each new restaurant  as well as construction period interest 
we also capitalize all direct external costs associated with obtaining the dining room and kitchen equipment  signage and other assets and equipment for each re branded restaurant 
in addition  for each new restaurant and re branded restaurant we also capitalize a portion of the internal direct costs of our real estate and construction department 
to determine our accounting policies related to capitalizing costs associated with our in house real estate department  we have taken guidance from fasb statement no 
 accounting for costs and initial rental operations of real estate projects sfas no 

while sfas no 
establishes accounting and reporting standards for the acquisition  development  construction  selling and rental costs associated with real estate projects  it excludes from its scope real estate developed by an enterprise for use in its own operations  other than for sale of rental 
given there is no other authoritative literature directly addressing our circumstance of developing real estate projects for our own operations  we have applied the principles of sfas no 
in such accounting for costs 
inherent in the policies regarding property and equipment are certain significant management judgments and estimates  including useful life  residual value to which the asset is depreciated  the expected value at the end of the lease term for equipment under capital leases  and the determination as to what constitutes enhancing the value of or increasing the life of assets 
these significant estimates and judgments  coupled with the fact that the ultimate useful life and economic value at the end of a lease are typically not known until after the passage of time  through proper maintenance of the asset  or through continued development and maintenance of a given market in which a restaurant operates can  under certain circumstances  produce distorted or inaccurate depreciation and amortization or  in some cases result in a write down of the value of the assets under sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets sfas no 

see critical accounting policy impairment of long lived assets below 
we believe that our accounting policy for property and equipment provides a reasonably accurate means by which the costs associated with an asset are recognized in expense as the cash flows associated with the asset s use are realized 
goodwill and trademarks as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements  goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are tested for impairment at least annually in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
sfas no 
also requires that intangible assets with definite useful lives be amortized over their respective estimated useful lives to their estimated residual values  and reviewed for impairment in accordance with sfas no 
accounting for the impairment and disposal of long lived assets sfas no 

on january   we acquired ninety nine restaurants for million in cash and approximately million shares of our common stock 
we completed a valuation of the assets and liabilities of ninety nine and allocated the purchase price to the acquired tangible and intangible assets and liabilities  including million related to the trademarks  with the remaining amount of million being allocated to goodwill 
we selected the first day of each new fiscal year as the date on which we will test the goodwill and trademarks for impairment  or when events or circumstances indicate there may be an impairment 
we performed an interim test during the third quarter of to determine if the carrying amount of the goodwill associated with our ninety nine restaurants was impaired 
the results indicated an impairment  as the current carrying value exceeded the estimated fair value of the ninety nine restaurants 
accordingly  an estimated non cash impairment charge of million was recorded in the third fiscal quarter 
we obtained an updated estimate of the fair value of the ninety nine restaurants and completed the valuation of the goodwill and intangibles during the fourth fiscal quarter of our valuation showed that the carrying value of the reporting unit exceeded the fair value 
an additional goodwill impairment charge of million was recorded during the fourth fiscal quarter of related to our ninety nine restaurants and million related to our stoney river restaurants see note to our consolidated financial statements 
at december   as a result of the impairment charges recorded in  we had no goodwill and million in indefinite life intangible assets  for trademarks  shown on our consolidated balance sheets related primarily to the acquisition of ninety nine restaurants 
the determination of whether these assets are impaired involves significant judgments based upon short and long term projections of future performance 
changes in strategy  new accounting pronouncements and or market conditions may result in future impairment of recorded asset balances 
impairment of long lived assets as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements  sfas no 
requires that long lived assets and certain identifiable intangibles be reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to future net undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the asset 
if such assets are considered to be impaired  the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets 
assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell 
the cost associated with asset impairments are recorded in the consolidated statement of operations in the financial statement line item impairment  disposal and restructuring charges  net 
the judgments made related to the ultimate expected useful life and our ability to realize undiscounted cash flows in excess of the carrying value of an asset are affected by such issues as ongoing maintenance of the asset  continued development of a given market within which a restaurant operates  including the presence of traffic generating businesses in the area  and our ability to operate the restaurant efficiently and effectively 
we assess the projected cash flows and carrying values at the restaurant level  whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the long lived assets associated with a restaurant may not be recoverable 
we believe that our accounting policy for impairment of long lived assets provides reasonable assurance that any assets that are impaired are written down to their fair value and a charge is taken in operating earnings on a timely basis 
long lived assets are tested for possible impairment each fiscal quarter 
during the year ended december   we took an impairment charge of million for seven o charley s restaurants that will remain open  ten ninety nine restaurants that will remain open and two stoney river restaurants that will remain open 
the million charge in was offset by a net gain of million on assets held for sale and assets sold or otherwise settled that were not held for sale 
during the fiscal year ended december   we incurred charges of million for fiscal in connection with changes in its supply chain which primarily consisted of non cash charges taken for the loss on the sale of the commissary real estate and facility and related impairment of manufacturing equipment  charges taken for employee severance and retention  and to a lesser extent  legal and transition costs 
in addition to the supply chain charges  we also recorded impairment and disposal costs relating to restaurant impairments and other asset retirements during fiscal of million 
included in the million charge is the impairments related to three underperforming o charley s restaurants one of which was closed while the other two o charley s restaurants have remained open and the impairment of one stoney river restaurant and two ninety nine restaurants that have remained open 
during the year ended december   we took an impairment charge of million for three o charley s restaurants  two of which were closed in and one that has remained open and two ninety nine restaurants that have remained open 
we also recorded charges for purchased software that is no longer in use and for asset write offs relating to our project revo lution and dressed to the nines re branding efforts 
the million charge in was offset by a net gain of million on assets held for sale and assets sold or otherwise settled that were not held for sale 
income taxes we must make estimates of certain items that comprise our income tax provision and the related current and deferred tax liabilities 
these estimates include employer tax credits for items such as fica taxes paid on employee tip income  work opportunity and welfare to work credits  as well as estimates related to certain depreciation and capitalization policies 
these estimates are made based on the best available information at the time of the provision and historical experience 
we file our income tax returns many months after our year end 
these returns are subject to audit by various federal  state and local governments several years after the returns are filed and could be subject to differing interpretations of the tax laws 
we then must assess the likelihood of successful legal proceedings or reach a settlement  either of which could result in material adjustments to our consolidated financial statements 
under fasb interpretation fin no 
accounting for uncertainty in income taxes  fin no 
we are required to perform an analysis and measure each uncertain tax position 
the analysis and measurement requires estimates and interpretations to be made 
we base these estimates upon the best available information at that time of the provision and in coordination with our interpretation of existing tax law 
as part of the computation of the income tax provision  we identify and measure deferred tax assets and liabilities 
we weigh available evidence in determining the realization of deferred tax assets 
available evidence includes historical  current and future financial performance of the company 
we also consider the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities  projected future taxable income  and tax planning strategies in making this assessment 
if we determine it is more likely than not that some portion or the entire deferred tax asset will not be recognized  the deferred tax asset will be reduced by a valuation allowance 
the deferred tax valuation allowance may be released in future years when we consider that it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will be realized 
to form a conclusion that some or all of the deferred tax assets will be realized  we will need to generate three year cumulative pre tax income  and we will need to evaluate whether or not all available evidence  such as future taxable income and reversal of temporary differences  provides sufficient positive evidence to offset any other potential negative evidence that may exist at such time 
in the event the deferred tax valuation allowance is released  we would record an income tax benefit for the portion or all of the deferred tax valuation allowance released 
at december   the company had a deferred tax valuation allowance of million 
recently issued accounting pronouncements in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
revised  business combinations sfas no 
r  which replaces sfas no 
 business combinations sfas no 

sfas no 
r retains the underlying concepts of sfas no 
in that all business combinations are still required to be accounted for at fair value under the acquisition method of accounting  but sfas no 
r changed the method of applying the acquisition method in a number of significant aspects 
acquisition costs will generally be expensed as incurred  noncontrolling interests will be valued at fair value at the acquisition date  in process research and development will be recorded at fair value as an indefinite lived intangible asset at the acquisition date  restructuring costs associated with a business combination will generally be expensed subsequent to the acquisition date  and changes in deferred tax asset valuation allowances and income tax uncertainties after the acquisition date generally will affect income tax expense 
sfas no 
r is effective on a prospective basis for all business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after the beginning of the first annual period subsequent to december   with the exception of the accounting for valuation allowances on deferred taxes and acquired tax contingencies 
sfas no 
r amends sfas no 
such that adjustments made to valuation allowances on deferred taxes and acquired tax contingencies associated with acquisitions that closed prior to the effective date of sfas no 
r would also apply the provisions of sfas no 
r 
early adoption is not permitted 
the provisions of sfas no

 noncontrolling interests in consolidated financial statements an amendment of arb no 
sfas no 

this statement is effective for fiscal years  and interim periods within those fiscal years  beginning on or after december   with earlier adoption prohibited 
this statement requires the recognition of a noncontrolling interest minority interest as equity in the consolidated financial statements and separate from the parent s equity 
the amount of net income attributable to the noncontrolling interest will be included in consolidated net income on the face of the statement of operations 
it also amends certain of arb no 
s consolidated financial statements consolidation procedures for consistency with the requirements of sfas no

this statement also includes expanded disclosure requirements regarding the interests of the parent and its noncontrolling interest 
the adoption of sfas no

the adoption of fsp eitf is not expected to have a material impact on our financial statements 
impact of inflation the impact of inflation on the cost of food  labor  equipment  land construction costs  and fuel energy costs could adversely affect our operations 
a majority of our employees are paid hourly rates related to federal and state minimum wage laws 
the federal government and several states have instituted or are considering changes to their minimum wage and or benefit related laws which  if and when enacted  could have an adverse impact on our payroll and benefit costs 
as a result of increased competition and the low unemployment rates in the markets in which our restaurants are located  we have continued to increase wages and benefits in order to attract and retain management personnel and hourly employees 
in addition  most of our leases require us to pay taxes  insurance  maintenance  repairs and utility costs  and these costs are subject to inflationary pressures 
commodity inflation has had a significant impact on our operating costs 
we also believe that increased fuel costs from may through october had a negative impact on consumer behavior and have increased the cost of our operations 
we attempt to offset the effect of inflation through periodic menu price increases  economies of scale in purchasing and cost controls and efficiencies at our restaurants 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are subject to market risk from exposure to changes in interest rates based on our financing  investing  and cash management activities 
we utilize a balanced mix of debt maturities along with both fixed rate and variable rate debt to manage our exposures to changes in interest rates 
our fixed rate debt consists primarily of capitalized lease obligations and senior subordinated notes and our variable rate debt consists primarily of our credit facility
