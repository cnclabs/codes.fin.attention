lending is the major driver of revenue and we are committed to supporting our loan growth 
we recognize that loan and deposit growth are interdependent  and over the long term both must grow consistently 
one of our biggest challenges is to grow our customer base and to grow the depth and breadth of our customer relationships 
we address this challenge by maintaining our focus on anticipating  understanding and assisting our customers in achieving their financial goals 

table of contents our deposit pricing strategy is two fold 
first  our relationship savings product is important to our deposit mix 
it requires customers to maintain a checking account as part of the relationship  the goal being to create multiple relationships with our customers to aid both profitability and customer retention 
the relationship savings product is structured and priced like a money market deposit or fund  except that it does not offer check writing 
relationship savings deposits amounted to million as of december  our experience with money market type deposit accounts has been that they become a long term  stable funding source at reasonable cost 
the second component in our pricing strategy is to continuously offer a selection of special certificates of deposit with competitive interest rates 
another challenge is being able to maintain sufficient asset size or scale to provide the marketing  technology  service and other support functions so that we will continue to be relevant and competitive 
it is for these reasons that management emphasizes and monitors growth in terms of customers  customer households  customer relationships  assets  revenue per employee  and efficiency 
we also know that to successfully grow  our employees must be extremely well trained and experienced 
we regularly monitor training hours per employee  employee turnover and employee and customer satisfaction surveys 
we also engage a mystery shopping firm that sends representatives into each of our locations to experience and witness what the customer experiences and then provide us with constructive feedback 
critical accounting policies the company has established various accounting policies  which govern the application of generally accepted accounting principles in the preparation of the financial statements 
certain accounting policies involve significant judgments and assumptions by management that have a material impact on the carrying value of certain assets and liabilities 
management considers such accounting policies to be critical accounting policies 
the judgments and assumptions used by management are based on historical experience and other factors  which are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
because of the nature of the judgments and assumptions made by management  actual results could differ from these judgments and estimates that could have a material impact on the carrying values of assets and liabilities and the results of operations of the company 
refer to footnote to the consolidated financial statements  summary of significant accounting policies 
we consider the following to be critical accounting policies allowance for loan losses the determination of the allowance for loan losses is considered critical due to the high degree of judgment involved  the subjectivity of the underlying assumptions used  and the potential for changes in the economic environment that could result in material changes in the amount of the allowance for loan losses considered necessary 
the allowance is evaluated on a regular basis by management and is based on a periodic review of the collectibility of the loans in light of historical experience  the nature and size of the loan portfolio  adverse situations that may affect borrowers ability to repay  the estimated value of any underlying collateral and prevailing economic conditions 
for a full discussion of the allowance for loan losses  please refer to business of legacy bancorp and subsidiaries asset quality 
income taxes legacy bancorp uses the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes 
under this method  deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases 
a valuation allowance related to deferred tax assets is established when  in management s judgment  it is more likely than not that all or a portion of such deferred tax assets will not be realized 
deferred tax assets applicable to capital loss carryforwards of  which expire in  are recoverable only to the extent that capital gains can be realized during the carryforward period 
the judgments applied by management consider the likelihood that capital gain income will be realized within the carryforward period in light of our tax planning strategies and changes in market conditions 
as of december  management has not established a valuation allowance against the deferred tax assets related to capital loss carryforwards 
as of december  a valuation allowance was established against deferred tax assets related to the uncertain utilization of the charitable contribution carryforward created primarily by the donation to the legacy banks foundation as part of the conversion 
the contribution carryforward expires in  and the allowance amounted to million as of december  
table of contents other than temporary impairment certain equity security investments that do not have readily determinable fair values are carried at cost 
all investments are reviewed for impairment at least quarterly or sooner if events or changes occur which indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
declines in the fair value of held to maturity and available for sale securities below their cost that are deemed to be other than temporary are reflected in earnings as realized losses 
in estimating other than temporary impairment losses  management considers the length of time and the extent to which the fair value has been less than cost  the financial condition of the issuer  and the intent and ability of the company to retain its investment in the issuer for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in fair value 
fair values of assets and liabilities the company adopted sfas no 
 fair value measurements  which provides a framework for measuring fair value under generally accepted accounting principles 
in accordance with sfas no 
 the company groups its financial assets and financial liabilities generally measured at fair value in three levels  based on the markets in which the assets and liabilities are traded and the reliability of the assumptions used to determine fair value 
the company has classified all private issue collateralized mortgage obligations and trust preferred backed bonds as level assets  the valuation of which is based on unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities 
management determined that an orderly and active market for these securities did not exist based on a significant reduction in trading volume and widening spreads during the third and fourth quarters of for a full discussion of sfas and the company s methods in determining fair value  see footnote fair value of assets and liabilities within
