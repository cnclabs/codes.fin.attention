item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our financial statements and related notes and the other information appearing in this report 
overview we are an independent energy company primarily engaged in the acquisition  exploration  exploitation and development of oil and natural gas properties 
our strategy is to grow through exploration  exploitation and development projects we believe to be relatively low risk and through selective acquisitions of underdeveloped properties 
pursuit of this strategy has led to increases in our oil and natural gas production over the past three years 
our average net production increased from  boe d in calculated as described in footnote to the table included in results of operations to  boe d in and to  boe d in our proved reserves were mmboe at december   mmboe at december  and mmboe at december  in the execution of our strategy  our management is principally focused on developing additional reserves of oil and natural gas and on maximizing production levels through exploration  exploitation and development activities on a cost effective basis and in a manner consistent with preserving adequate liquidity and financial flexibility 
capital expenditures we have developed an active capital expenditure program to take advantage of our extensive inventory of drilling prospects and other projects 
our exploration  exploitation and development capital expenditures  including amounts accrued and unpaid at december   were million in  down from million in  and we expect that they will be approximately million in we expect to spend approximately of the amount budgeted for on projects in the sacramento basin  in the southern california region  in texas  for exploration projects in a variety of areas  and the balance for capitalized g a 
we have entered into hedging arrangements to secure floors on of our forecast production 
the price floors are intended to ensure a minimum revenue stream to sustain an active capital expenditure program and satisfy our other obligations 
the aggregate levels of capital expenditures for  and the allocation of those expenditures  are dependent on a variety of factors  including the availability of capital resources to fund the expenditures and changes in our business assessments as to where our capital can be most profitably employed 
accordingly  the actual levels of capital expenditures and the allocation of those expenditures may vary materially from our estimates 
the following summarizes certain significant aspects of our capital spending program in and southern california exploitation and development in southern california  we drilled four new wells in  including one at platform grace that was spud in and plugged during the first quarter of the remaining three wells were all in the west montalvo field 
the first  a successful onshore development well  was spud in september and completed in november 
the second  also a successful onshore well  was spud in october and was completed and brought on to production in january the third well is an offshore well drilled from an onshore surface location 
this well was spud in december and is expected to be completed and placed on production in the first half of march we have projects ongoing to increase our gas handling capacity at west montalvo and we do not expect these wells to produce at full capacity until this work is completed later in march 
we also performed workovers and recompletions in southern california during this work included six workovers and eight wells returned to production at the west montalvo field  four workovers at the sockeye field  and one 
table of contents workover at the south ellwood field 
in  we plan to drill two additional wells in the west montalvo field and one new well at the sockeye field 
we also plan to conduct wellwork as part of waterflood optimizations at the sockeye and beverly hills west fields 
in the sockeye field  we continue to implement our waterflood program from platform gail and are working on the evaluation and design of a possible expansion of the program 
we are also continuing to evaluate a possible expansion of our horizontal and multi lateral well drilling activities to the monterey formation in the field 
in the south ellwood field  the permitting process continues for our full field development project in the south ellwood field 
we anticipate receiving a final environmental impact report relating to the project in and for the project approval hearings to begin thereafter 
key components of the project include an extension of the current lease boundary which would effectively double the size of the existing lease area and the installation of an onshore oil transport pipeline to replace the existing barge 
development of the lease extension area can be accomplished from the field s existing platform 
we have been pursuing the pipeline permitting process and acquiring rights of way 
our capital expenditure budget includes a small amount for continued work towards pipeline permitting and acquisition of rights of way 
sacramento basin exploitation and development in the sacramento basin  we continue to pursue our infill drilling program in the greater grimes and willows fields 
we drilled wells in the basin in of which were productive and performed workovers and recompletions 
we operated during the majority of with five drilling rigs in the basin 
for a short period of time at the end of and beginning of we operated with six drilling rigs 
as of february  we have three drilling rigs and seven workover completion rigs working in the basin 
we expect to drill over new wells and perform more than workovers and recompletions there in as of december   we had identified drilling locations in the basin  and we anticipate identifying additional locations as we pursue exploitation and development opportunities there 
we continue to test and evaluate potential downspacing opportunities in the basin as well as new methods of improving productivity and reducing drilling costs 
of the wells drilled in the basin during  were drilled on acre spacing  were drilled on acre spacing  and were drilled on acre spacing 
we also initiated a hydraulic fracturing program during to targets in the forbes and deeper formations of the basin 
we fractured wells during we have been encouraged by the results and continue to analyze those results in order to optimize future fracture simulations in the basin 
as of december   our acreage position in the basin had grown to approximately  net acres  gross 
texas exploitation and development in texas  our primary focus in was the redevelopment of the hastings complex in preparation for the sale of our principal interests in the complex to denbury 
other texas activity included the drilling of three new wells 
one of these wells was a development well in the manvel field that was spud in december we drilled across a fault and plan to use the well for a sidetrack at a later date 
the second well was a successful exploration gas well drilled in the south liberty field 
the third well  also an exploration well  was spud in august 
the well was unsuccessful and we plan to plug and abandon it in the first quarter of we also performed workovers and recompletions in texas during  of which were completed at the hastings complex and were completed in the manvel field 
in  we plan to drill three wells and perform approximately seven workovers and recompletions in our texas fields 

table of contents acquisitions and divestitures west montalvo and manvel acquisitions 
we acquired the west montalvo field in ventura county  california in may for approximately million 
we acquired the manvel field in brazoria county  texas  and certain other fields in texas  in april for million 
texcal transaction 
we acquired texcal energy lp llc on march  for million in cash 
in order to finance the purchase price for the acquisition and related transaction costs of approximately million  we borrowed approximately million under our revolving credit facility and million under our second lien term loan facility 
hastings sale 
in february  we completed the sale of our principal interests in the hastings complex to denbury for approximately million 
as a result of the sale  we repaid all amounts outstanding under our revolving credit facility and million of the outstanding principal balance on our second lien term loan facility 
other 
we have an active acreage acquisition program and we regularly engage in acquisitions and  to a lesser extent  dispositions of oil and natural gas properties  primarily in and around our existing core areas of operations  including several transactions in each of  and trends affecting our results of operations oil and natural gas prices 
historically  prices received for our oil and natural gas production have been volatile and unpredictable  and that volatility is expected to continue 
changes in the market prices for oil and natural gas directly impact many aspects of our business  including our financial condition  revenues  results of operations  liquidity  rate of growth  the carrying value of our oil and natural gas properties and borrowing capacity under credit facilities  all of which depend primarily or in part upon those prices 
for example  as a result of lower commodity prices at december   we were required to record a full cost ceiling impairment of our oil and gas properties in the fourth quarter 
continued low prices in early contributed significantly to a reduction in the borrowing base under our revolving credit facility 
in addition  as a result of declines in commodity prices  as well as the deterioration in the overall economy  we significantly reduced our capital expenditures planned for as compared to our actual capital expenditures incurred in in order to reduce the variability of the prices we receive for our production and provide a minimum revenue stream  we employ a hedging strategy 
as of march   we had hedge contract floors covering approximately of our production guidance  in excess of of our anticipated production and in excess of of our anticipated production 
all of our derivatives counterparties are commercial banks that are parties to our credit facilities 
see quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk commodity derivative transactions for further details concerning our hedging activities 
expected production 
we expect that the execution of our capital expenditure program in will result in average daily production volumes in that are consistent with volumes  pro forma for the hastings sale 
we expect our southern california properties  which produced mmboe during of which was oil  to exhibit modest production growth as compared to in particular  we expect the drilling and workover recompletion programs we began at the west montalvo field in to result in production increases there in in the sacramento basin  we intend to continue our multi year drilling program and plan to drill more than new wells and perform over workovers and recompletions 
as a result of reducing the number of rigs active in the basin from five to three  we expect average daily production in the basin to decline over the course of but expect full year average net production in to be relatively flat relative to average net production from the basin 
at the manvel field  which we acquired in april  we are continuing a redevelopment program by upgrading our fluid handling and injection capacity and plan to drill two new wells and perform approximately five workovers and recompletions 
our expectations with respect 
table of contents to future production rates are subject to a number of uncertainties  including those associated with third party services  oil and natural gas prices  events resulting in unexpected downtime  permitting issues  drilling success rates  pipeline capacity  changes in our capital expenditure budget and other factors  including those referenced in risk factors 
production expenses 
production expenses consist of lease operating expenses loe and production and property taxes 
loe per boe increased from per boe in to per boe in the loe reflects an increase in electrical usage and rates in texas  non recurring maintenance costs at sockeye and twelve full months of expense at manvel and west montalvo acquired in april and may  respectively 
we expect our production expenses to decrease on a boe basis for as a whole  primarily due to the sale of the relatively high cost hastings properties in the first quarter of production and property taxes decreased as a percentage of revenue from in to in  primarily due to increased revenues in as a result of historically high commodity prices in the first half of the year 
we expect production property taxes to increase as a percentage of revenue in due to lower expected commodity prices in our expectations with respect to future expenses are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties  including those described and referenced in the preceding paragraph 
general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses were per boe in  excluding charges under sfas r of per boe and non recurring charges of per boe relating to the termination of a planned master limited partnership mlp offering 
this represented an increase from per boe g a costs of excluding sfas r charges of in the change resulted from an overall increase in g a costs in the period due to increased headcount and related infrastructure 
excluding sfas r charges  we expect our g a costs to be similar to our full year costs on a per boe basis 
as with production expenses  our expectations with respect to g a costs are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties 
unrealized derivative gains and losses 
rising oil prices led to substantial unrealized commodity derivative losses in and the first half of  while sharp declines in both oil and gas prices in the second half of resulted in unrealized commodity derivative gains in these unrealized gains and losses resulted from mark to market valuations of derivative positions that are not accounted for as cash flow hedges and are reflected as unrealized commodity derivative gains or losses in our income statement 
payments actually due to or from counterparties in the future on these derivatives will typically be offset by corresponding changes in prices ultimately received from the sale of our production 
we may incur significant gains or losses of this type in and in subsequent years 
as described in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in this report  we discontinued hedge accounting as of april  this may increase volatility in gains and losses of this type in subsequent periods 
we may also have significant unrealized interest rate derivative gains and losses in subsequent periods due to changes in market interest rates

amended revolving credit facility 
we entered into a second amended and restated agreement governing our revolving credit facility in march  and have entered into several subsequent amendments to the agreement 
in may we amended the facility to  among other things  extend its maturity to march the agreement contains customary representations  warranties  events of default  indemnities and covenants  including covenants that restrict our ability to incur indebtedness and require us to maintain specified ratios of current assets to current liabilities and debt to ebitda 
the minimum ratio of current assets to current liabilities as those terms are defined in the agreement is one to one  the maximum ratio of debt to ebitda as defined in the agreement is four to one 
the revolving credit facility has a total capacity of million  but is limited by a borrowing base currently established at million 
the borrowing base is subject to redetermination in april and november of each year  and may be redetermined at other times at our request or at the request of the lenders 
the agreement requires us to reduce amounts outstanding under the facility with the proceeds of certain transactions or events  including sales of assets  in certain circumstances 
the revolving credit facility is secured by a first priority lien on substantially all of our assets 
loans under the revolving credit facility designated as base rate loans bear interest at a floating rate equal to i the greater of bank of montreal s announced base rate and the overnight federal funds rate plus plus ii an applicable margin ranging from zero to  based upon utilization 
loans designated as libo rate loans under the revolving credit facility bear interest at i libor plus ii an applicable margin ranging from to  based upon utilization 
a commitment fee ranging from to per annum is payable with respect to unused borrowing availability under the facility 
in anticipation of the hastings sale  in january we requested a borrowing base redetermination 
consequently  effective with the sale  the borrowing base under the revolving credit facility was reduced from million to million 
lending commitments under the facility have been allocated at various percentages to a syndicate of twelve banks 
certain of the institutions included in the syndicate have received support from governmental agencies in connection with recent events in the credit markets 
in addition  of the million borrowing base has been allocated to lehman commercial paper lcp  a wholly owned subsidiary of lehman brothers holding  inc  which filed for bankruptcy protection in september lcp is no longer funding its portion of our borrowing requests made under the facility 
our effective borrowing base is million  excluding million related to lcp 
a failure of any other member of the syndicate to fund under the facility  or a reduction in the borrowing base  would adversely affect our liquidity 
as a result of the hastings sale in february  we repaid the outstanding balance of the facility in full 
subsequently  we borrowed approximately million solely to maintain a balance of variable rate debt equivalent to the notional amount of our interest rate swap 
see quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 
while we do not expect to be in violation of any of our debt covenants during  we believe that it will be important to monitor the requirement that we maintain a specified ratio of debt to ebitda as defined in the agreement governing the revolving credit facility  in particular if commodity prices do not increase and we pursue our current capital expenditure plan 
we do not currently expect to borrow any additional amounts under the facility until the third quarter of if we believe at that time that borrowing under the facility will give rise to a 
table of contents significant possibility of a covenant default  we may take a variety of actions  including but not limited to reducing our capital expenditure budget so as to reduce or eliminate the need to borrow under the facility 
second lien term loan 
we entered into a million senior secured second lien term loan agreement in may the term loan agreement contains customary representations  warranties  events of default and indemnities and certain customary operational covenants  including covenants that restrict our ability to incur additional indebtedness 
the agreement requires us to maintain derivative contracts covering at least of our projected oil and natural gas production attributable to proved developed producing reserves through may   and at least of such production on an annual basis until the maturity date of the term loan 
we cannot  however  enter into derivative contracts other than certain put contracts covering more than of such projected oil and gas production in any month 
the agreement also prohibits us from paying dividends on our common stock 
the agreement will require us to make offers to prepay amounts outstanding under the second lien term loan facility with the proceeds of certain transactions or events  including sales of assets  in certain circumstances 
amounts prepaid under the facility may not be reborrowed 
the term loan facility is secured by a second priority lien on substantially all of our assets 
we repaid million of principal under the facility in february after the hastings sale 
loans under the term loan facility designated as base rate loans bear interest at a floating rate equal to i the greater of the overnight federal funds rate plus and the administrative agent s announced base rate  plus ii 
loans designated as libo rate loans bear interest at libor plus 
we have entered into interest rate swaps pursuant to which amounts borrowed under the term loan agreement will effectively bear interest at a fixed rate of approximately until june see quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate derivative transactions 
senior notes 
we issued million of our senior notes in december the notes bear interest at per year and will mature on december  we may redeem the notes at a redemption price initially equal to of the principal amount and declining to of the principal amount by december  upon the occurrence of a change of control of our company  each holder of the notes may require us to repurchase all or a portion of its notes for cash at a price equal to of the aggregate principal amount of those notes  plus any accrued and unpaid interest 
the indenture governing the notes also contains operational covenants that  among other things  limit our ability to make investments  incur additional indebtedness or create liens on our assets 
the notes are secured with the second lien term loan on an equal and ratable basis 
principal on our second lien term loan facility is payable on may  however  if the senior notes are not refinanced in full prior to september   principal on the second lien term loan facility will be payable on that date 
in order to preserve the later maturity date for the second lien term loan  we expect to pursue a refinancing of the senior notes 
we are currently considering different refinancing options and will likely seek to exercise one of those refinancing options during if we believe market conditions are appropriate 
if currently adverse conditions in the credit markets persist or worsen  it may be more difficult  or impossible  to refinance the senior notes 
because we must dedicate a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to the payment of amounts due under our debt agreements  that portion of our cash flow is not available for other purposes 
our ability to make scheduled interest payments on our indebtedness and pursue our capital expenditure plan will depend to a significant extent on our financial and operating performance  which is subject to prevailing economic conditions  commodity prices and a variety of other factors 
if our cash flow and other capital resources are insufficient to fund our debt service obligations and our capital expenditure budget  we may be forced to reduce or delay scheduled capital projects  sell material assets or operations and or seek additional capital 
needed capital may not be available on acceptable terms or at all 
our ability to raise funds through the incurrence of additional indebtedness 
table of contents and certain other means is limited by covenants in our debt agreements 
in addition  pursuant to mandatory prepayment provisions in our credit facilities  our ability to respond to a shortfall in our expected liquidity by selling assets or incurring additional indebtedness would be limited by provisions in the facilities that require us to use some or all of the proceeds of such transactions to reduce amounts outstanding under one or both of the facilities in some circumstances 
if we are unable to obtain funds when needed and on acceptable terms  we may not be able to complete acquisitions that may be favorable to us  meet our debt obligations or finance the capital expenditures necessary to replace our reserves 
commitments and contingencies as of december   the aggregate amounts of contractually obligated payment commitments for the next five years were as follows in thousands less than one year to years to years after years total long term debt interest on senior notes rental of office space total total contractually obligated payment commitments do not include the anticipated settlement of derivative contracts  obligations to taxing authorities or amounts relating to our asset retirement obligations  which include plugging and abandonment obligations  due to the uncertainty surrounding the ultimate settlement amounts and timing of these obligations 
our total asset retirement obligations were million at december  amounts related to interest expense on our revolving credit facility and second lien term loan facility are not included in the table above because the interest rates on those debt instruments are variable 
during the years ended december   and  we incurred interest expense on those debt instruments of million  million and million  respectively 
off balance sheet arrangements at december   we had no existing off balance sheet arrangements  as defined under sec rules  that have or are reasonably likely to have a material current or future effect on our financial condition  revenues or expenses  results of operations  liquidity  capital expenditures or capital resources 
critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon financial statements that have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  or gaap 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
we have identified certain accounting policies as being of particular importance to the presentation of our financial position and results of operations and which require the application of significant judgment by our management 
we analyze our estimates  including those related to oil and natural gas revenues  oil and natural gas properties  fair value of derivative instruments  income taxes and contingencies and litigation  and base our estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting 
table of contents policies and estimates affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements 
reserve estimates our estimates of oil and natural gas reserves are  by necessity  projections based on geologic and engineering data  and there are uncertainties inherent in the interpretation of such data as well as in the projection of future rates of production and the timing of development expenditures 
reserve engineering is a subjective process of estimating underground accumulations of oil and natural gas that are difficult to measure 
the accuracy of any reserve estimate is a function of the quality of available data  engineering and geological interpretation and judgment 
estimates of economically recoverable oil and natural gas reserves and future net cash flows necessarily depend upon a number of variable factors and assumptions  such as historical production from the area compared with production from other producing areas  the assumed effects of regulation by governmental agencies and assumptions governing future oil and natural gas prices  future operating costs  severance  ad valorem and excise taxes  development costs and workover and remedial costs  all of which may vary considerably from actual results 
for these reasons  estimates of the economically recoverable quantities of oil and natural gas attributable to any particular group of properties  classifications of such reserves based on the likelihood of recovery and estimates of the future net cash flows expected from them may vary substantially 
any significant variance in the assumptions could materially affect the estimated quantity and value of the reserves  which could affect the carrying value and the rate of depletion of the oil and natural gas properties 
for example  oil and natural gas price changes affect the estimated economic lives of oil and natural gas properties and therefore cause reserve revisions 
our december  estimate of net proved oil and natural gas reserves totaled mboe 
had oil and natural gas prices been lower as of the date of the estimate  our total oil and natural gas reserves would have been approximately lower 
in addition  our proved reserves are concentrated in a relatively small number of wells 
at december   of our proved reserves were concentrated in our largest wells 
as a result  any changes in proved reserves attributable to such individual wells could have a significant effect on our total reserves 
actual production  revenues and expenditures with respect to our reserves will likely vary from estimates  and such variances may be material 
oil and natural gas properties  depletion and full cost ceiling test we follow the full cost method of accounting for oil and natural gas properties 
under this method  all productive and nonproductive costs incurred in connection with the acquisition of  exploration for and exploitation and development of oil and natural gas reserves are capitalized 
such capitalized costs include costs associated with lease acquisition  geological and geophysical work  delay rentals  drilling  completing and equipping oil and natural gas wells  and salaries  benefits and other internal salary related costs directly attributable to these activities 
proceeds from the disposition of oil and natural gas properties are generally accounted for as a reduction in capitalized costs  with no gain or loss recognized 
depletion of the capitalized costs of oil and natural gas properties  including estimated future development and capitalized asset retirement costs  is provided for using the equivalent unit of production method based upon estimates of proved oil and natural gas reserves 
the capitalized costs are amortized over the life of the reserves associated with the assets  with the amortization being expensed as depletion in the period that the reserves are produced 
this depletion expense is calculated by dividing the period s production volumes by the estimated volume of reserves associated with the investment and multiplying the calculated percentage by the sum of the capitalized investment and estimated future development costs associated with the investment 
changes in our reserve estimates will therefore result in changes in our depletion expense per unit 
for example  a reduction in our estimated reserves as of december  would have resulted in an increase of approximately per boe in our depletion expense rate during costs associated with production and general corporate activities are expensed in the period incurred 
interest costs related 
table of contents to unproved properties and properties under development are also capitalized to oil and natural gas properties 
unproved property costs not subject to amortization consist primarily of leasehold and seismic costs related to unproved areas 
costs are transferred into the amortization base on an ongoing basis as the properties are evaluated and proved reserves established or impairment determined 
we will continue to evaluate these properties and costs will be transferred into the amortization base as undeveloped areas are tested 
unproved oil and natural gas properties are not amortized  but are assessed  at least annually  for impairment either individually or on an aggregated basis to determine whether we are still actively pursuing the project and whether the project has been proven  either to have economic quantities of reserves or that economic quantities of reserves do not exist 
capitalized costs of oil and natural gas properties  excluding costs associated with unproved properties  may not exceed the present value of estimated future net revenues from proved reserves  discounted at 
application of the ceiling test generally requires pricing future revenue at the unescalated prices in effect as of the last day of the relevant quarter and requires a write down for accounting purposes if the ceiling is exceeded 
at december   our net capitalized costs exceeded the ceiling by million  net of income tax effects  and we recorded a write down of our oil and natural gas properties in that amount 
we may be required to recognize additional impairments of oil and gas properties in future periods if market prices of oil and natural gas continue to decline 
asset retirement obligations effective january   we adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations sfas 
sfas provides that  if the fair value for asset retirement obligations can be reasonably estimated  the liability should be recognized in the period when it is incurred 
oil and natural gas producing companies incur this liability upon acquiring or drilling a well 
under the method prescribed by sfas no 
 the retirement obligation is recorded as a liability at its estimated present value at the asset s inception  with the offsetting charge to property cost 
periodic accretion of discount of the estimated liability is recorded in the income statement 
prior to adoption of sfas no 
 we accrued for future abandonment costs of wells and related facilities through our depletion calculation in accordance with regulation s x rule and industry practice 
this method resulted in recognition of the obligation over the life of the property on a unit of production basis  with the estimated obligation netted in property cost as part of the accumulated depreciation  depletion and amortization balance 
our asset retirement obligation primarily represents the estimated present value of the amount we will incur to plug  abandon and remediate our properties at the end of their productive lives  in accordance with applicable laws 
we have determined our asset retirement obligation by calculating the present value of estimated cash flows related to each liability 
the discount rates used to calculate the present value varied depending on the estimated timing of the relevant obligation  but typically ranged between and 
we periodically review the estimate of costs to plug  abandon and remediate our properties at the end of their productive lives 
this includes a review of both the estimated costs and the expected timing to incur such costs 
we believe most of these costs can be estimated with reasonable certainty based upon existing laws and regulatory requirements and based upon wells and facilities currently in place 
any changes in regulatory requirements  which changes cannot be predicted with reasonable certainty  could result in material changes in such costs 
changes in reserve estimates and the economic life of oil and natural gas properties could affect the timing of such costs and accordingly the present value of such costs 
income tax expense income taxes reflect the tax effects of transactions reported in the financial statements and consist of taxes currently payable plus deferred income taxes related to certain income and expenses recognized in different periods for financial and income tax reporting purposes 
deferred income tax 
table of contents assets and liabilities represent the future tax return consequences of those differences  which will either be taxable or deductible when assets are recovered or settled 
deferred income taxes are also recognized for tax credits that are available to offset future income taxes 
deferred income taxes are measured by applying current tax rates to the differences between financial statement and income tax reporting 
we have recognized a valuation allowance against our net deferred taxes because we cannot conclude that it is more likely than not that the net deferred tax assets will be realized as a result of estimates of our future operating income based on current oil and natural gas commodity pricing 
in assessing the realization of deferred tax assets  we consider whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will be realized 
the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible 
we consider the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities  available taxes in carryback periods  projected future taxable income and tax planning strategies in making this assessment 
we will continue to evaluate whether the valuation allowance is needed in future reporting periods 
derivative instruments under sfas  accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  as amended  we reflect the fair market value of our derivative instruments on our balance sheet 
our estimates of fair value are determined by obtaining independent market quotes  as well as utilizing a black scholes option valuation model that is based upon underlying forward price curve data  a risk free interest rate and estimated volatility factors 
changes in commodity prices will result in substantially similar changes in the fair value of our commodity swap agreements  and in substantially similar changes in the fair value of our commodity collars to the extent the changes are outside the floor or cap of our collars

the statement also provides guidance for recognizing and measuring the goodwill acquired in business combinations and determines what information to disclose to enable users of the financial statements to evaluate the nature and financial effects of the business 
table of contents combination 
the statement applies prospectively to business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after the beginning of the first annual reporting period beginning on or after december  sfas r may have an impact on our consolidated financial statements when effective  but the nature and magnitude of the specific effects will depend upon the nature  terms and size of the acquisitions we consummate after the effective date

 fair value measurements sfas  which defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value  and expands disclosures about fair value measurements 
this pronouncement applies to other standards that require or permit fair value measurements 
accordingly  this statement does not require any new fair value measurements

 which delays the effective date of sfas for nonfinancial assets and liabilities  except for items that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis at least annually  until fiscal years beginning after november  we adopted sfas as of january  for all financial and nonfinancial assets and liabilities recognized or disclosed at fair value on a recurring basis 
we elected to defer the application thereof to nonfinancial assets and liabilities in accordance with fsp no 
in december  the sec published revised rules regarding oil and gas reserves reporting requirements 
the objective of the rules are to provide readers of financial statements with more meaningful and comprehensive understanding of oil and gas reserves 
key elements of the revised rules include a change in the pricing used to estimate reserves at period end  optional disclosure of probable and possible reserves  allowance of the use of new technologies in the determination of reserves and additional disclosure requirements 
the rules also revise the prices used for reserves in determining depletion and the full cost ceiling test from a period end price to a month average price 
the revised rules are effective for registration statements filed on or after january  and for annual reports for fiscal years ending on or after december  early adoption is not allowed 
we are currently assessing the impact that the adoption of the revised rules will have on our operating results  financial position  cash flows  oil and gas reserves and disclosures 
pv the pre tax present value of future net cash flows  or pv  is a non gaap measure because it excludes income tax effects 
management believes that pre tax cash flow amounts are useful for evaluative purposes since future income taxes  which are affected by a company s unique tax position and strategies  can make after tax amounts less comparable 
we derive pv based on the present value of estimated future revenues to be generated from the production of proved reserves  net of estimated production and future development costs and future plugging and abandonment costs  using prices and costs as of the date of estimate without future escalation  without giving effect to hedging activities  non property related expenses such as general and administrative expenses  debt service and depreciation  depletion  amortization and impairment and income taxes  and discounted using an

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk this section provides information about derivative financial instruments we use to manage commodity price volatility 
due to the historical volatility of crude oil and natural gas prices  we have implemented a hedging strategy aimed at reducing the variability of the prices we receive for our production and providing a minimum revenue stream 
currently  we purchase puts and enter into other derivative transactions such as collars and fixed price swaps in order to hedge our exposure to changes in commodity prices 
all contracts are settled with cash and do not require the delivery of a physical quantity to satisfy settlement 
while this hedging strategy may result in us having lower revenues than we would have if we were unhedged in times of higher oil and natural gas prices  management believes that the stabilization of prices and protection afforded us by providing a revenue floor on a portion of our production is beneficial 
this section also provides information about derivative financial instruments we use to manage interest rate risk

prices natural gas derivatives for production february december  january december  we enter into derivative contracts  primarily collars  swaps and option contracts  to hedge future crude oil and natural gas production in order to mitigate the risk of market price fluctuations 
most of our derivative contracts relate to changes in the market price relative to the applicable benchmark price  basis swap contracts relate to changes in the applicable differential 
the objective of our hedging activities and the use of derivative financial instruments is to achieve more predictable cash flows 
our hedging activities mitigate our exposure to price declines and allow us more flexibility to continue to execute our capital plan even if prices decline 
our collar and swap contracts  however  prevent us from receiving the full advantage of increases in oil or natural gas prices above the maximum fixed amount specified in the hedge agreement 
also  if production is less than the amount we have hedged and the price of oil or natural gas exceeds a fixed price in a hedge contract  we will be required to make payments against which there are no offsetting sales of production 
this could impact our ability to 
table of contents fund future capital expenditures 
in addition  we have incurred  and may incur in the future  substantial unrealized commodity derivative losses in connection with our hedging activities  although we do not expect such losses to have a material effect on our ability to fund expected capital expenditures 
finally  the use of derivatives involves the risk that the counterparties to such instruments will be unable to meet the financial terms of such contracts 
lehman brothers commodity services  inc lbcs was a counterparty to several derivative contracts with us entered into between august and may in september  lehman brothers holdings inc lbh  credit support provider for lbcs  filed for bankruptcy 
the bankruptcy filing of lbh constituted an event of default under the isda master agreement 
accordingly  we notified lbcs that we were terminating each of the outstanding transactions  effective immediately 
subsequent to our notification of termination  lbcs filed for bankruptcy protection 
similar issues could affect other hedge counterparties in the future 
because a large portion of our commodity derivatives do not qualify for hedge accounting and to increase clarity in our financial statements  we elected to discontinue hedge accounting effective april  consequently  from that date forward  we have recognized mark to market gains and losses in earnings currently  rather than deferring such amounts in accumulated other comprehensive income for those commodity derivatives that qualify as cash flow hedges 
all derivative instruments are recorded on the balance sheet at fair value 
fair value is generally determined based on the difference between the fixed contract price and the underlying market price at the determination date 
changes in the fair value of derivatives are recorded in commodity derivative gains losses on the consolidated statement of operations 
interest rate derivative transactions we are subject to interest rate risk with respect to amounts borrowed under our credit facilities because those amounts bear interest at variable rates 
as of march   there was approximately million outstanding under those facilities 
we have entered into an interest rate swap transaction to limit our exposure to changes in interest rates with respect to our second lien term loan facility to lock in our interest cost on million of borrowings through june as a result  amounts borrowed up to million will effectively bear interest at a fixed rate of approximately until june accordingly  we expect to be subject to interest rate risk until that time only with respect to amounts borrowed in excess of million 
a increase in interest rates on unhedged variable rate borrowings of million at december  would result in additional annualized interest expense of million 
as of december   the fair value of our interest rate derivatives was a liability of million
