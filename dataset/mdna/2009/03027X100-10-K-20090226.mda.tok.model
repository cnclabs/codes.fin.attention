item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations that follows are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of our financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  revenues and expenses  and the related disclosures in our financial statements 
actual results may differ significantly from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
this discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes thereto and the information set forth under the caption critical accounting policies and estimates beginning at page our continuing operations are reported in two segments  rental and management and network development services 
management focuses on segment gross margin and segment operating profit as a means to measure operating performance in these business segments 
we define segment gross margin as segment revenue less segment operating expenses excluding depreciation  amortization and accretion  selling  general  administrative and development expense  and impairments  net loss on sale of long lived assets  restructuring and merger related expense 
we define segment operating profit as segment gross margin less selling  general  administrative and development expense attributable to the segment  excluding stock based compensation expense and corporate expenses 
segment gross margin and segment operating profit for the rental and management segment also include interest income  tv azteca  net see note to our consolidated financial statements included herein 
these measures of segment gross margin and segment operating profit are also before interest income  interest expense  loss on retirement of long term obligations  other income expense  minority interest in net earnings of subsidiaries  income on equity method investments  income taxes and discontinued operations 
executive overview our principal operating segment is our rental and management segment  which accounted for approximately and of our total revenues for the years ended december  and  respectively  and approximately of our segment operating profit in both years 
the primary factors affecting the stability and growth of our revenues and cash flows for this segment are our recurring revenues from existing tenant leases and the contractual escalators in those leases  leasing additional space on our existing towers  acquiring and building additional tower sites and the degree to which any of our existing customer leases are cancelled 
we continue to believe that our site leasing revenue is likely to increase due to the growing use of wireless communications services and our ability to utilize existing tower capacity 
in addition  we believe the majority of our site leasing activity will continue to come from customers providing wireless broadband services 
the majority of our tenant leases with wireless carriers are for an initial non cancelable term of five to ten years  with multiple five year renewal terms thereafter 
accordingly  nearly all of the revenue generated by our rental and management segment as of the end of december is recurring revenue that we should continue to receive in future periods 
in addition  most of our leases have provisions that periodically increase the rent due under the lease 
these contractual escalators are typically annual and are based on a fixed percentage generally three to five percent  inflation  or a fixed percentage plus inflation 
revenue generated by rate increases based on fixed escalation clauses is recognized on a straight line basis over the non cancelable term of the applicable agreement 
we also routinely seek to extend our tenant leases with our customers  which has the effect of increasing the non cancelable term of the agreement and creating additional stability for our revenues and cash flows 
the revenues generated by our rental and management segment also may be affected by cancellations of existing customer leases 
as discussed above  most of our tenant leases with wireless carriers and broadcasters are multi year contracts  which typically may not be cancelled or  in some instances  may be cancelled only upon payment of a termination fee 
accordingly  lease cancellations historically have not had a material adverse effect 
table of contents on the revenues generated by our rental and management segment 
during the year ended december   tenant leases representing less than of our rental and management revenues were cancelled 
a significant majority of our revenue growth in the year ended december  was attributable to incremental revenue generated by our existing communications sites 
during  incremental revenue attributable to those sites that existed during the entire period between january  and december   was approximately million  which reflects revenue increases from adding new tenants to those sites  existing tenants adding more equipment to those sites  contractual escalators  net of straight line accounting treatment  and the net increase in straight line revenue from extending the renewal dates of thousands of our tenant leases  partially offset by lease cancellations 
our ability to lease additional space on our sites is a function of the rate at which wireless carriers deploy capital to improve and expand their wireless networks and  to a lesser extent  the location of and available capacity on our existing sites 
this rate  in turn  is influenced by the growth of wireless communications services and related infrastructure needs  the financial performance of our customers and their access to capital  and general economic conditions 
we believe leasing additional space on our existing sites will contribute the substantial majority of our year over year revenue growth in we also generate revenues by building and acquiring new communications sites 
we constructed or acquired and sites in the years ended december  and  respectively 
because of the nature of our recurring revenues described above  our results of operations only reflect revenues generated on these sites following the respective dates of their construction or acquisition  which affects year over year comparisons 
during  incremental revenue attributable to the approximately  sites that were built or acquired between january  and december   was approximately million 
our rental and management segment operating expenses include our direct tower level expenses and consist primarily of ground rent  property taxes  repairs and maintenance and utilities 
these segment level expenses exclude all segment and corporate  selling  general  administrative and development expenses  which are aggregated into one line item entitled selling  general  administrative and development expense 
our segment level selling  general  administrative and development expenses consist of expenses to support our rental and management and network development services segments  such as sales and property management functions 
in general  our segment level selling  general and administrative expenses do not significantly increase as a result of adding incremental customers to our sites and increase only modestly year over year 
as a result  leasing space to new customers on our existing sites provides significant incremental cash flow 
our profit margin growth is  therefore  directly related to the number of new tenants added to our existing tower sites and the related rental revenue generated in a particular period

table of contents existing tenants adding more equipment to those sites  contractual escalators  net of straight line accounting treatment  and the net increase in straight line revenue from extending the renewal dates of thousands of our tenant leases  partially offset by lease cancellations 
approximately million of the increase resulted from approximately  communications sites acquired and or constructed subsequent to january  we believe that our rental and management revenue will grow as we continue to utilize existing site capacity 
we anticipate that the majority of our new leasing activity will continue to come from wireless service providers 
network development services revenue network development services revenue for the year ended december  was million  an increase of million from the year ended december  the increase was primarily attributable to revenues generated from our site acquisition  zoning and permitting services 
as we continue to focus on and grow our rental and management business  however  we anticipate that our network development services revenue will continue to represent a small percentage of our total revenues 
total operating expenses total operating expenses for the year ended december  were million  a decrease of approximately million from the year ended december  the decrease was attributable to decreases in depreciation  amortization and accretion expense and selling  general  administrative and development expense of million and million  respectively

primarily represents our asset retirement obligations and excludes certain other long term liabilities included in our consolidated balance sheet  primarily our straight line rent liability for which cash payments are included in operating lease payments and unearned revenue that is not payable in cash 
other long term liabilities exclude million of liabilities for unrecognized tax positions and million of accrued income tax related interest and penalties included in our consolidated balance sheet as we are uncertain as to when and if the amounts may be settled 
settlement of such amounts could require the use of cash flows generated from operations 
we expect the unrecognized tax benefits to change over the next months if certain tax matters ultimately settle with the applicable taxing jurisdiction during this timeframe 
however  based on the status of these items and the amount of uncertainty associated with the outcome and timing of audit settlements  we are currently unable to estimate the impact of the amount of such changes  if any  to previously recorded uncertain tax positions 
off balance sheet arrangements 
we have no material off balance sheet arrangements as defined in item a ii of sec regulation s k 
refinancing activities in order to extend the maturity dates of our indebtedness  lower our cost of debt and improve our financial flexibility  we use our available liquidity and seek new sources of liquidity to refinance our outstanding indebtedness 
during the year ended december   we entered into a million term loan pursuant to the revolving credit facility  and we used the net proceeds  together with available cash  to repay million of existing indebtedness under the revolving credit facility  as discussed above 
during the year ended december   we also reduced the amount of indebtedness outstanding under our convertible notes through conversions of notes into shares of our common stock  and we sought to manage our exposure to variable interest rates under our revolving credit facility and term loan by entering into swap agreements  as discussed below 
convertible notes 
during the year ended december   we issued approximately million shares of our common stock upon conversion of approximately million principal amount of our notes 
pursuant to the terms of the indenture  holders of the notes are entitled to receive shares of common stock for every  principal amount of notes converted 
in april  we issued approximately million shares of our common stock upon conversion of approximately million principal amount of our notes 
in connection with the conversion  we paid the holders an aggregate of approximately million  calculated based on the accrued and unpaid interest on the notes and the discounted value of the future interest payments on the notes 
in july  we issued a notice for the redemption on august  of all of our outstanding notes 
in accordance with the conversion provisions of the notes and the indenture for the notes  holders of the notes had the right at any time until and including  but not after  the close of business on august   to convert their notes into shares of our common stock 
holders of all million of the outstanding notes converted their notes into an aggregate of approximately million shares of our common stock prior to redemption 
as a result  as of august   none of the notes remained outstanding 

table of contents convertible notes 
during the year ended december   we issued million shares of our common stock upon conversion of approximately million principal amount of our notes 
pursuant to the terms of the indenture  holders of the notes are entitled to receive shares of common stock for every  principal amount of notes converted 
in connection with the conversions  we paid such holders an aggregate of approximately million  calculated based on the discounted value of the future interest payments on the notes 
as of december   million principal amount of the notes remained outstanding 
interest rate swap agreements 
during the year ended december   we entered into twelve additional interest rate swap agreements to manage exposure to variability in cash flows related to forecasted interest payments under the revolving credit facility and term loan 
as of december   we held fifteen interest rate swap agreements  all of which have been designated as cash flow hedges  and which have an aggregate notional amount of million  interest rates ranging from to and expiration dates through march factors affecting sources of liquidity internally generated funds 
because the majority of our tenant leases are multi year contracts  a significant majority of the revenues generated by our rental and management segment as of the end of is recurring revenue that we should continue to receive in future periods 
accordingly  a key factor affecting our ability to generate cash flow from operating activities is to maintain this recurring revenue and to convert it into operating profit by minimizing operating costs and fully achieving our operating efficiencies 
in addition  our ability to increase cash flow from operating activities is dependent upon the demand for our communications sites and our related services and our ability to increase the utilization of our existing communications sites 
restrictions under loan agreement relating to revolving credit facility and term loan 
the loan agreement for the revolving credit facility and term loan contains certain financial ratios and operating covenants and other restrictions applicable to us and all of our subsidiaries designated as restricted subsidiaries on a consolidated basis 
these include limitations on additional debt  distributions and dividends  guaranties  sales of assets and liens  as well as the following three financial maintenance tests a consolidated total leverage ratio total debt to adjusted ebitda of not greater than to  a consolidated senior secured leverage ratio senior secured debt to adjusted ebitda of not greater than to  and an interest coverage ratio adjusted ebitda to interest expense of not less than to 
as of december   we were in compliance with each of the foregoing financial tests 
the loan agreement also contains reporting and information covenants that require us to provide financial and operating information within certain time periods 
if we are unable to timely provide the required information  we would be in breach of these covenants 
any failure to comply with the financial maintenance tests and operating covenants of the loan agreement for the revolving credit facility and term loan would not only prevent us from being able to borrow additional funds under the facility  but would constitute a default  which could result in  among other things  the amounts outstanding  including all accrued interest and unpaid fees  becoming immediately due and payable 
restrictions under loan agreement relating to securitization transaction 
the loan agreement related to the securitization transaction includes operating covenants and other restrictions customary for loans subject to rated securitizations 
among other things  our two special purpose subsidiaries that are borrowers are prohibited from incurring other indebtedness for borrowed money or further encumbering their assets 
the organizational documents of the borrowers contain provisions consistent with rating agency securitization criteria for special 
table of contents purpose entities  including the requirement that the borrowers maintain at least two independent directors 
the loan agreement also contains certain covenants that require the borrowers to provide the trustee with regular financial reports and operating budgets  promptly notify the trustee of events of default and material breaches under the loan agreement and other agreements related to the towers subject to the securitization transaction  and allow the trustee reasonable access to the towers  including the right to conduct site investigations 
failure to comply with the covenants in the loan agreement related to the securitization transaction could prevent the borrowers from taking certain actions with respect to the towers  and could prevent the borrowers from distributing any excess cash from the operation of the towers to us 
if the borrowers were to default on the loan related to the securitization transaction  the trustee could seek to foreclose upon or otherwise convert the ownership of the towers subject to the securitization transaction  in which case we could lose the towers and the revenue associated with the towers 
restrictions under notes indentures 
the indentures governing the terms of our notes and notes also contain certain restrictive covenants with which we and the restricted subsidiaries under these indentures must comply 
these include restrictions on our ability to incur additional debt  guarantee debt  pay dividends and make other distributions and make certain investments 
with the exception of spectrasite and its subsidiaries  most of our operating subsidiaries are designated as restricted subsidiaries under these note indentures 
this means  among other things  that those subsidiaries  like american tower corporation itself  are subject to those indentures restrictions on the amount of cash that they can distribute to unrestricted subsidiaries or otherwise pay out of the restricted group 
in addition  certain of spectrasite s subsidiaries are subject to restrictions on the amount of cash that they can distribute to us under the loan agreement for the securitization transaction  as discussed above 
any failure to comply with these covenants would constitute a default 
specifically  these indentures restrict us from incurring additional debt or issuing certain types of preferred stock unless our consolidated debt is not greater than times our adjusted consolidated cash flow 
the indentures also contain reporting and information covenants that require us to provide financial and operating information within certain time periods 
if we are unable to timely provide the required information  we would be in breach of these covenants 
if a default occurred under the loan agreement related to the securitization transaction  the loan agreement for the revolving credit facility and term loan or the indentures for our other debt securities  the maturity dates for our outstanding debt could be accelerated  and we likely would be prohibited from making additional borrowings under the revolving credit facility until we cured the default 
if this were to occur  we would not have sufficient cash on hand to repay such indebtedness 
the key factors affecting our ability to comply with the debt covenants described above are our financial performance relative to the financial maintenance tests defined in the loan agreement for the revolving credit facility and term loan and our ability to fund our debt service obligations 
based upon our current expectations  we believe our operating results will be sufficient to comply with these covenants 
as of december   our annual consolidated cash debt service obligations principal and interest for each of the next five years and thereafter are approximately million  million  million  billion  million and billion  respectively 
in addition  as a holding company  we depend on distributions from our operating subsidiaries or funds raised through credit facilities and debt and equity offerings to fund our debt obligations 
although the agreements governing the terms of the loan agreement related to the securitization transaction permit certain of spectrasite s subsidiaries to make distributions to us  such terms also significantly limit their ability to distribute cash to us 
accordingly  if we do not receive sufficient funds from our subsidiaries to meet our debt service obligations  we may be required to refinance or renegotiate the terms of our debt  and there is no assurance we will succeed in such efforts 
our ability to make scheduled payments of principal and interest on our debt obligations will depend on our future financial performance  which is subject to many factors beyond our control  as outlined above in item a 
table of contents of this annual report under the caption risk factors 
in addition  our ability to raise capital in the future may depend on our credit ratings from commercial rating agencies  which are dependent on our expected financial performance  the liquidity factors discussed above  and the rating agencies outlook for our industry 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to complete such financings or  if such financings are completed  that the terms will be commercially reasonable  particularly in light of the recent downturn in the economy and the disruptions in the financial and credit markets 
critical accounting policies and estimates management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  as well as related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities 
we evaluate our policies and estimates on an ongoing basis  including those related to income taxes  asset retirement obligations  stock based compensation  impairment of assets  revenue recognition and estimated useful lives of assets 
management bases its estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we have reviewed our policies and estimates to determine our critical accounting policies for the year ended december  we have identified the following policies as critical to an understanding of our results of operations and financial condition 
this is not a comprehensive list of our accounting policies 
in many cases  the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by generally accepted accounting principles  with no need for management s judgment in its application 
there are also areas in which management s judgment in selecting any available alternative would not produce a materially different result 
for a discussion of our other accounting policies  see note to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report  beginning on page f income taxes 
we recognize tax liabilities in accordance with fin  and we adjust these liabilities when our judgment changes as a result of the evaluation of new information not previously available 
due to the complexity of some of these uncertainties  the ultimate resolution may result in a payment that is materially different from our current estimate of the tax liabilities 
these differences will be reflected as increases or decreases to income tax expense in the period in which they are determined 
we expect the unrecognized tax benefits to change over the next months if certain tax matters ultimately settle with the applicable taxing jurisdiction during this timeframe  or if the applicable statute of limitations lapses 
we believe that the amount of the change could range from zero to million 
as of december   we have classified approximately million as other long term liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet 
we also classified approximately million of accrued income tax related interest and penalties as other long term liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet as of december  sfas no 
accounting for income taxes  requires that companies record a valuation allowance when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
we periodically review our deferred tax assets  and we record a valuation allowance to reduce our net deferred tax asset to the amount that management believes is more likely than not to be realized 
as of december   we have provided a valuation allowance of approximately million which primarily relates to state net operating loss carryforwards  equity investments and foreign items 
we have not provided a valuation allowance for the remaining deferred tax assets  primarily our federal net operating loss carryforwards  as we believe that we will have sufficient taxable income to realize these federal net operating loss carryforwards during the twenty year tax 
table of contents carryforward period 
valuation allowances may be reversed if related deferred tax assets are deemed realizable based on changes in facts and circumstances relevant to the assets recoverability 
the recoverability of our remaining net deferred tax asset has been assessed utilizing projections based on our current operations 
the projections show a significant decrease in depreciation in the later years of the carryforward period as a result of a significant portion of our assets being fully depreciated during the first fifteen years of the carryforward period 
accordingly  the recoverability of our net deferred tax asset is not dependent on material improvements to operations  material asset sales or other non routine transactions 
based on our current outlook of future taxable income during the carryforward period  management believes that our net deferred tax asset will be realized 
the realization of our deferred tax assets will be dependent upon our ability to generate approximately billion and billion in federal and state taxable income  respectively  from january  to december  if we are unable to generate sufficient taxable income in the future or carry back losses as described above  we will be required to reduce our net deferred tax asset through a charge to income tax expense 
changes in tax laws and rates could also affect recorded deferred tax assets and liabilities in the future 
management is not aware of any such changes that would have a material effect on our consolidated results of operations  cash flows or financial position 
the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws and regulations in a multitude of jurisdictions across our international operations 
from time to time  we are subject to examination by various tax authorities in jurisdictions in which we have significant business operations  and we regularly assess the likelihood of additional assessments in each of the tax jurisdictions resulting from these examinations 
we believe that adequate provisions have been made for income taxes for all periods through december  as described in note to the consolidated financial statements  in april  verestar s plan of liquidation was approved by the bankruptcy court and in december  verestar was liquidated 
as a result  we recorded an income tax benefit of million related to losses associated with our investment in verestar as income from discontinued operations during the year ended december  asset retirement obligations 
we comply with the provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations sfas no 
and the provisions of fasb interpretation no 
accounting for conditional asset retirement obligations fin 
both pronouncements address the financial accounting and reporting requirements for conditional obligations associated with our legal obligation to retire tangible long lived assets and the related asset retirement costs  principally obligations to remediate leased land on which certain of our tower assets are located 
under these accounting principles  we recognize asset retirement obligations in the period in which they are incurred  if a reasonable estimate of a fair value can be made  and we accrete such liability through the obligation s estimated settlement date 
the associated retirement costs are capitalized as part of the carrying amount of the related tower fixed assets and depreciated over their estimated useful life 
during the years ended december  and  we updated our assumptions used in estimating our aggregate asset retirement obligation  which resulted in a net increase in the estimated obligation of million and a net decrease in the estimated obligation of million  respectively 
the increase in primarily resulted from changes in timing of certain settlement date assumptions  and the purchase of land underlying ground leases 
fair value estimates of liabilities for asset retirement obligations generally involve discounted future cash flows  and periodic accretion of such liabilities due to the passage of time is recorded as an operating expense 
the significant assumptions used in estimating our aggregate asset retirement obligation are timing of tower removals  cost of tower removals  timing and number of land lease renewals  expected inflation rates  and credit adjusted risk free interest rates that approximate our incremental borrowing rate 
while we feel the assumptions 
table of contents are appropriate  there can be no assurances that actual costs and the probability of incurring obligations will not differ from these estimates 
we will continue to review these assumptions periodically and we may need to adjust them as necessary 
stock based compensation 
we account for stock based compensation in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
revised  share based payment  sfas no 
r and related pronouncements  which requires the measurement and recognition of compensation expense for all share based payment awards made to employees and directors  including stock options  restricted stock units and employee stock purchases under employee stock purchase plans 
under the fair value recognition provisions of sfas no 
r  stock based compensation cost is measured at the accounting measurement date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized as expense over the service period  which generally represents the vesting period 
the expense recognized over the service period is required to include an estimate of the awards that will be forfeited 
under sfas no 
r  the fair value of a stock option is determined using a black scholes option pricing model that takes into account the stock price at the accounting measurement date  the exercise price  the expected life of the option  the volatility of the underlying stock and its expected dividends  and the risk free interest rate over the expected life of the option 
these assumptions are highly subjective and changes in them could significantly impact the value of the option and hence the compensation expense 
under sfas no 
r  the fair value of restricted stock units is based on the fair value of our common stock on the grant date 
impairment of assets 
assets subject to depreciation and amortization and non core long lived assets held for sale we review long lived assets  including intangibles  for impairment whenever events  changes in circumstances or our review of our tower portfolio indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
our tower portfolio review includes sites for which we have no current tenant leases and towers for which expenses exceed revenues 
we assess recoverability by determining whether the net book value of the related assets will be recovered through projected undiscounted cash flows or anticipated proceeds from sales of the assets 
if we determine that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable  we will measure any impairment based on the projected future discounted cash flows to be provided from the asset or available market information relative to the asset s fair market value as compared to its carrying value 
we record any related impairment losses in the period in which we identify such impairment 
we also review the carrying value of assets held for sale for impairment based on management s best estimate of the anticipated net proceeds expected to be received upon final disposition 
we record any impairment charges or estimated losses on disposal in the period in which we identify such impairment or loss 
goodwill assets not subject to amortization we perform our annual goodwill impairment test each year and when events or circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired 
in december  and  we completed our annual impairment testing related to the goodwill of our rental and management segment and determined that goodwill was not impaired 
fair value estimates are based on our historical and projected operating results and market information  changes to which could affect those fair value estimates 
revenue recognition 
rental and management revenues are recognized on a monthly basis under lease or management agreements when earned  regardless of whether the payments from the customer are received in equal monthly amounts 
fixed escalation clauses present in non cancelable lease agreements  excluding those tied to the consumer price index or other inflation based indices  and other incentives present in lease agreements with our customers are recognized on a straight line basis over the terms of the applicable leases 
straight line revenues for the years ended december   and approximated million  million and million  respectively 
amounts billed up front for certain services provided in connection with the execution of lease agreements are initially deferred and recognized as revenue over the terms of the applicable leases 
amounts billed or 
table of contents received prior to being earned are deferred and reflected in unearned revenue in the consolidated balance sheets until the earnings process is complete 
estimated useful lives of assets 
as described in note to our consolidated financial statements included herein  during the year ended december  we undertook a review of the estimated useful lives of our tower assets to determine if we should modify our estimates for asset lives based on our historical operating experience 
we completed the review of the estimated useful lives of our tower assets in the first quarter of based on this review  we revised the estimated useful lives of our towers and certain related intangible assets from our historical estimate of years to a revised estimate of years  effective january  we accounted for the change in estimated useful lives as a change in estimate under statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
accounting changes and error corrections 
the impact of the change in estimate was accounted for prospectively effective january  for the year ended december   the change resulted in a reduction in depreciation and amortization expense of approximately million and an increase in net income of approximately million

the indentures governing our notes and notes contain restrictive covenants with which we and certain subsidiaries under these indentures must comply 
these include restrictions on our ability to incur additional debt  guarantee debt  pay dividends and make other distributions and make certain investments 
any failure to comply with these covenants would constitute a default  which could result in the acceleration of the principal amount and accrued and unpaid interest on all our outstanding notes and notes 
in order for the holders of these notes to assess our compliance with certain of these covenants  the indentures require us to disclose in the periodic reports we file with the sec our tower cash flow  adjusted consolidated cash flow and non tower cash flow each as defined in the indentures 
under the indentures  our ability to make certain types of restricted payments is limited by the amount of adjusted consolidated cash flow that we generate  which is determined based on our tower cash flow and non tower cash flow 
in addition  the indentures for our notes and notes restrict us from incurring additional debt or issuing certain types of preferred stock if on a pro forma basis the issuance of such debt and preferred stock would cause our consolidated debt to be greater than times our adjusted consolidated cash flow
