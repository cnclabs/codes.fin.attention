cim is a specialized manufacturer of high performance coating and lining systems used worldwide in the liquid storage and containment industry 
with a primary focus on the water and wastewater industry  cim has the preferred products that complement our product line of high performance tapes and coatings 
in its most recently completed twelve month period ending august   cim revenues were approximately  the total purchase price  net of cash received  was  subject to certain adjustments relating to the closing date working capital 
the purchase was funded through a combination of available cash on hand  a term loan in the amount of  from bank of america  and a  note payable to cim shareholders 
the net assets acquired by us include cash  inventories  trade receivables  property  plant equipment  trade payables and certain other current assets and liabilities 
the effective date for this acquisition was september  the results of this acquisition have been included in our financial statements since that date  and consequently are not reflected in our results of operations for the fiscal year ended august  or any prior period 
overview following a record year in for both sales and profits  we were faced with numerous challenges during the fiscal year as the global recession negatively impacted most of our core product offerings and led to sales and profits in the current fiscal year well below the levels observed in the prior year 
the continued declines in two of the larger industries we service  the housing market and worldwide automotive sector  have caused us to reset our expectations and refocus our priorities 
we emphasized our efforts to review and consolidate costs where possible  achieved production efficiencies via continuous improvement plans  and identify new business opportunities through sales  marketing and product development teams 
additionally  we are focused on continuing 
table of contents to support our long term consolidation plans  facility and process improvements and r d for new and improved product offerings 
revenues from our specialized manufacturing segment were below those of the prior year primarily due to lower demand for pipeline and wire and cable products 
additionally  as previously mentioned  the downturn in the automotive and housing market has negatively impacted sales of our humiseal conformal coatings which is used to protect electronic circuitry in automobiles and home appliances 
the financial results of our european operations were negatively impacted in fiscal by the weakened pound sterling whose value against the dollar decreased from august to august while fiscal results were disappointing for this segment  some new business opportunities have been achieved to offset some of the automotive and housing loss  and we experienced increased activity in some sectors during the later stages of the fiscal year 
the chase electronic manufacturing services segment also faced softness in some key market segments which led to decreased customer demand during fiscal lower sales and profits in fiscal compared to the prior year period reflect the reduced order backlog experienced by this segment as many of our key customers continue to assess their inventory levels and their own customer demand 
we continue to have strong relationships with our customers in this segment  even though overall volume is down from what was experienced in fiscal in the upcoming fiscal year  our key strategies will include continuous improvement  long term consolidation  product and market development and a targeted acquisition effort 
we maintained strong positive cash flows throughout fiscal and ended the fiscal year with our healthiest balance sheet ever 
despite the uncertainty of the current economic climate  we will continue to focus on our long terms strategic goals 
this was evidenced by our acquisition of cim in the first quarter of fiscal additionally  we have recently announced the planned december closing of the paterson  nj plant whose manufacturing will be redistributed to other chase facilities  and we will be starting up a new coatings plant in pittsburgh during the same timeframe 
the company has two reportable segments summarized below segment product lines manufacturing focus and products specialized manufacturing wire and cable electronic coatings pipeline construction specialty products produces protective coatings and tape products including insulating and conducting materials for wire and cable manufacturers  protective coatings for pipeline applications  moisture protective coatings for electronics  high performance polymeric asphalt additives  and expansion and control joint systems for use in the transportation and architectural markets 
electronic manufacturing services contract electronic manufacturing services provides assembly and turnkey contract manufacturing services including printed circuit board and electromechanical assembly services to the electronics industry operating principally in the united states 

table of contents results of operations revenues and operating profit by segment are as follows revenues income before income taxes of revenues dollars in thousands fiscal specialized manufacturing   a electronic manufacturing services less corporate and common costs  b income before income taxes fiscal specialized manufacturing electronic manufacturing services less corporate and common costs income before income taxes fiscal specialized manufacturing   a electronic manufacturing services less corporate and common costs income before income taxes a includes loss on impairment of goodwill of in and in b includes loss on impairment of assets of total revenues total revenues for fiscal decreased  or to  from  in the prior year 
revenues in our specialized manufacturing segment decreased  or to  for the year ended august  compared to  in fiscal the decrease in revenues from our specialized manufacturing segment in fiscal was primarily due to the following a decreased sales of  in the electronic coatings product lines due to reduced demand in the electronic and automotive markets  b decreased sales of  in the wire cable market primarily due to less demand in the energy and communications markets  c decreased sales of  in the pipeline and construction product lines  and d decreased sales of  in specialty products 
revenues from our electronic manufacturing services segment decreased  or to  for the year ended august  compared to  for fiscal the reduced sales in fiscal is primarily a result of decreased customer orders and projects as many of our key customers continue to assess their inventory levels and closely monitor their own customers demand during this economic downturn 
the backlog for this segment as of august  was  compared to  at august  royalties and commissions in the specialized manufacturing segment were   and  for the years ended august   and  respectively 
the decrease in royalties and commissions in fiscal from the prior two fiscal years was due to decreased sales of conformal coatings from our licensed manufacturer in asia 

table of contents export sales from domestic operations to unaffiliated third parties were   and  for the years ended august   and  respectively 
we anticipate future growth in our export sales due to the cim acquisition that was recently completed in september total revenues for fiscal increased  or to  from  in fiscal revenues in our specialized manufacturing segment increased  or to  for the year ended august  compared to  in fiscal the increase in revenues from this segment in fiscal was primarily due to increased sales related to the following a the operations acquired by humiseal europe sarl in march and chase protective coatings ltd 
in september which combined accounted for the majority of the  increased revenue from european operations  b increased sales of  from the pipeline product line  c increased sales of  from the electronic coatings product line  and d increased sales of  from a large  nonrecurring construction project that was completed in fiscal year 
these increases were partially offset by the following a decreased sales of  in the wire cable market primarily due to decreased demand for building wire  insulation and identification tapes during fiscal  b decreased sales of  in the transportation and packaging industrial product lines  and c decreased sales of  in the construction product line primarily due to the reduction in rosphalt project sales which had experienced record levels in fiscal the electronic manufacturing services segment achieved record revenues in fiscal which increased  or to  compared to  in fiscal this was primarily due to increased order activity from existing customers as well as several new customers added during fiscal year cost of products and services sold cost of products and services sold decreased  or to  for the fiscal year ended august  compared to  in fiscal as a percentage of revenues  cost of products and services sold increased to in fiscal compared to for fiscal the following table summarizes the relative percentages of costs of products and services sold to revenues for both of the company s reporting segments fiscal years ended august  cost of products and services sold specialized manufacturing electronic manufacturing services total cost of products and services sold in our specialized manufacturing segment were  for the fiscal year ended august  compared to  in fiscal as a percentage of revenues  cost of products and services sold in the specialized manufacturing segment increased due to decreased sales of our higher margin products and the resulting larger share of total sales that were made up of lower margin products  coupled with the impact of fixed manufacturing overhead costs on a lower revenue base 
these increases were partially offset by the favorable impact of ongoing cost reduction efforts and continued focus on raw material costs through supply chain management 
we continue to face challenges with margin pressures across many of our key product lines 
cost of products and services sold in our electronic manufacturing services segment were  for the fiscal year ended august  compared to  in fiscal as a percentage of revenues  cost of products and services sold in the electronic manufacturing services segment remained relatively flat as cost savings initiatives were able to offset our fixed costs on a lower revenue base and some increased costs related to facility and production improvements that were incurred earlier in the current fiscal year as a result of this segment s focus on generating new customer orders 
in fiscal  cost of products and services sold increased  or to  compared to  in the prior fiscal year 
as a percentage of revenues  cost of products and services sold decreased to in fiscal compared to for fiscal cost of products and services sold in our specialized manufacturing segment were  for the fiscal year ended august  compared to  in fiscal the dollar value increase in cost of products and services sold in this segment during fiscal was primarily attributable to increased revenues offset by our emphasis on leveraging fixed costs and improving 
table of contents manufacturing efficiencies 
the decrease in cost of products and services sold as a percentage of revenues in this segment during fiscal was a direct result of a favorable product mix coupled with continued focus and scrutiny on material purchases that helped stabilize margins on many of our key product lines 
cost of products and services sold in our electronic manufacturing services segment were  for the fiscal year ended august  compared to  in fiscal as a percentage of revenues  cost of products and services sold in this segment remained flat in fiscal compared to this reflects increased manufacturing costs and competitive pricing pressures placed on this segment by many of its key customers in fiscal  offset by our ability to leverage fixed overhead costs on a higher revenue base 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses decreased  or to  during fiscal compared to  in fiscal as a percentage of revenues  selling  general and administrative expenses increased to in fiscal compared to for fiscal the dollar decrease in fiscal relates primarily to our continued emphasis on controlling costs  including reduced annual incentive compensation  travel and external consulting costs 
additionally  lower revenues in fiscal compared to the prior year have led to decreased sales commissions and other selling related expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased  or to  during fiscal compared to  in fiscal as a percentage of revenues  selling  general and administrative expenses remained flat at for the years ended august  and the dollar increase in fiscal related primarily to increased employee head count due to acquisitions along with rising employee related benefits  including health care costs  and increased stock based compensation costs of approximately  related to our long term incentive plan 
the increases in fiscal were partially offset by a decrease of approximately  in costs related to professional services required for compliance with the internal control reporting requirements of section of the sarbanes oxley act compared to fiscal  which was our initial year of compliance 
in fiscal  we had recoveries of previously identified bad debt that exceeded additions to bad debt expense for the year  resulting in a net gain of  this gain of  in fiscal compared to bad debt expense of  and  in fiscal and  respectively 
the improvements in both fiscal and as compared to fiscal were the direct result of management s strict adherence to its established credit policies as well as closely monitoring the accounts receivable function and taking a proactive approach to the collections process 
loss on impairment of goodwill in fiscal  based on the decrease in sales activity in the current year and the completion of the fiscal budget  we determined that the carrying value of goodwill associated with our northeast quality products neqp division may not be recoverable 
accordingly  we performed a goodwill impairment analysis 
based on the present value of future cash flows utilizing projected results for the balance of fiscal year and projections for future years based on the fiscal year budgeting process  the goodwill impairment analysis yielded results that would not support the current book value of the goodwill associated with this division 
as a result  we concluded that the carrying amount of goodwill for the neqp division was not fully recoverable and an impairment charge of  was recorded as of may  goodwill related to neqp  having a pre impairment book value of  was written down to its fair value of  in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 
the neqp division was sold on august   and the adjusted fair value of  was realized upon the sale 
loss on impairment of fixed assets in fiscal  we recorded a  charge related to the impairment of real property land and building located in west bridgewater  ma which was being leased to sunburst electronics manufacturing solutions  inc the real property  having a pre impairment book value of  was written down to its fair value of  which was realized upon the june  sale of the property 

table of contents interest expense interest expense was  in fiscal compared to  and  in fiscal and  respectively 
the decrease in interest expense during the past two fiscal years is a direct result of a reduction in our overall debt balances through principal payments from operating cash flow 
we anticipate an increase to interest expense in fiscal due to our million term loan agreement and million promissory notes related to the acquisition of cim in september other income other income decreased  to  in fiscal compared to  and  in fiscal and  respectively 
other income includes bank interest and foreign exchange gains in europe earned by our humiseal europe division and rental income of  on real property building and land that we owned and leased to sunburst electronic manufacturing solutions  inc and subsequently sold in june as discussed previously 
the increase in fiscal compared to consists primarily of bank interest and exchange gains earned by our humiseal europe division 
income taxes the effective tax rate for fiscal was compared to and in fiscal and  respectively 
in all three years  we have received the benefit of the domestic production deduction and foreign rate differential 
the decrease in the effective tax rate in fiscal as compared to fiscal is primarily due to a more favorable effective state income tax rate in the effective tax rate of for fiscal compares favorably to due to an increase in the applicable domestic production deduction for the year 
net income net income in fiscal decreased  or to  compared to  in fiscal the decrease in net income in the current year is a direct result of decreased revenue across all of our core product lines as discussed previously 
additionally  net income was negatively impacted in the current year by the impairment of our west bridgewater  ma real property and the impairment of goodwill from neqp 
net income in fiscal increased  or to  compared to  in fiscal the increase in net income in was primarily due to increased revenue growth in our core product lines coupled with favorable product mix and our ability to leverage our fixed costs and properly manage increasing raw material costs 
in fiscal  net income was negatively impacted by higher expenses incurred related to our first year of compliance with section of the sarbanes oxley act and the loss on impairment of goodwill from neqp 
liquidity and sources of capital our overall cash balance increased  to  at august  from  at august  the increased cash balance at august  was a result of cash flow generated from operations during the year as well as the sale of the west bridgewater property 
we continue to review our current cash balances denominated in foreign currency in light of current tax guidelines and potential acquisitions 
the higher cash balance of  at august  compared to  at august  was primarily the result of cash flow generated during the year  after a portion was used to repay all outstanding balances on our existing debt 
cash flow provided by operations was  for the year ended august  compared to  in fiscal and  in fiscal cash provided by operations during fiscal was primarily due to operating income and decreased accounts receivable and inventory balances  offset by reduced accounts payable balances 
cash provided by operations during fiscal was primarily due to operating income and increased accounts payable and accrued expenses  offset by purchases of raw materials 
cash provided by operations during fiscal was primarily due to operating income and decreased inventory balances offset by increased accounts receivable balances 

table of contents the ratio of current assets to current liabilities was as of august  compared to as of august  the increase in our current ratio at august  was primarily attributable to increased cash and a decrease in accounts payable and accrued liabilities partially offset by decreases in accounts receivable and inventory 
cash flow used in investing activities was  for the year ended august  compared to  in fiscal and  in fiscal during fiscal  cash flow used in investing activities was primarily due to  used to pay for the purchase of real property in oxford  ma   paid for purchases related to the build out of our manufacturing facility in pittsburgh  pa  and purchases of machinery and equipment at our other manufacturing locations 
during fiscal  cash flow used in investing activities was primarily due to  paid for the assets acquired by chase protective coatings ltd  purchases related to the build out of our manufacturing facility in pittsburgh of  contingent payments related to previous acquisitions of  and cash paid for purchases of machinery and equipment at our other manufacturing locations 
during fiscal  cash flow used in investing activities was primarily due to the acquisition of capital services  the acquisition of certain assets from metronelec sarl  and cash paid for purchases of property  plant and equipment 
cash flow used in financing activities was  for the year ended august  compared to  in fiscal and  in fiscal during fiscal  cash flow used in financing activities reflects the payment of the annual dividend and payments of statutory minimum taxes on restricted stock 
during fiscal  cash flow used in financing activities reflected the annual dividend payment and our ability to use excess cash generated from operating results to pay off existing long term debt  including  to pay the total outstanding balances of the term notes used to finance our acquisitions of concoat holdings limited acquired in october and capital services of new york  inc acquired in september 
during fiscal  cash flow used in financing activities was primarily due to our ability to use excess cash generated from operating results to pay off existing long term debt and the annual dividend payment  partially offset by the excess tax benefit from the exercise of employee stock options 
on october   we announced a cash dividend of per share totaling  to shareholders of record on october  and payable on december  on october   we announced a cash dividend of per share totaling  to shareholders of record on october  and payable on december  we continue to have long term unsecured credit available with bank of america up to a maximum amount of million at the bank s base lending rate or  at the option of the company  at the effective day london interbank offered rate libor plus percent 
as of august  and october   the entire amount of million was available for use under this credit facility 
we plan to use this availability to help finance our cash needs  including acquisitions  in fiscal and future periods 
under the terms of our credit facility  we must comply with certain debt covenants related to a the ratio of total liabilities to tangible net worth and b the ratio of operating cash flow to debt service on a rolling twelve month basis 
we were in compliance with our debt covenants as of august  the credit facility currently has a maturity date of march  we borrowed million from bank of america in september in order to fund our acquisition of cim this borrowing involved an unsecured  three year term note with interest and principal payments due monthly 
interest is calculated at the applicable libor rate plus a margin of per annum  with interest payments due on the last day of each month 
at october   the applicable interest rate was per annum 
in addition to monthly interest payments  chase corporation will repay the principal in equal installments of  per month  beginning on september   and on the last day of each month thereafter  ending on august  in any event  on the last day of the repayment period  chase will repay the remaining principal balance plus any interest then due 
the loan is subject to the same debt covenants as our primary credit facility discussed above 
prepayment of the note is allowed at any time during the term of the loan 
as part of the cim acquisition in september  we delivered  in non negotiable promissory notes the notes payable to five cim shareholders  who were the holders of all of the issued and outstanding shares of capital stock of cim as of the acquisition date 
the principal of the notes will be paid in three consecutive annual installments of  each  with the initial payment due on september  interest on the unpaid principal balance of the notes will accrue at a rate per annum equal to the applicable federal rate  
table of contents and will be paid annually with each principal payment 
at october   the applicable interest rate was per annum 
in december  we acquired real property land and building in oxford  ma in order to reduce off site storage expenses and provide capacity for future growth 
machinery and equipment will be added as needed to increase capacity or enhance operating efficiencies in our other manufacturing plants 
furthermore  we may consider the acquisition of companies or other assets in fiscal or future periods which are complementary to our business 
we believe that our existing resources  including our primary credit facility  together with cash generated from operations and additional bank borrowings  will be sufficient to fund our cash flow requirements through at least the next twelve months 
however  there can be no assurances that additional financing will be available at favorable terms  if at all 
to the extent that interest rates increase in future periods  we will assess the impact of these higher interest rates on the financial and cash flow projections of our potential acquisitions 
we have no significant off balance sheet arrangements 
contractual obligations the following table summarizes our contractual cash obligations at august  and the effect such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flow in future periods 
contractual obligations total payments due less than year payments due years payments due years payments after years dollars in thousands operating leases purchase obligations other long term liabilities total other long term liabilities represent the expected payments for our obligations for pension and other post retirement benefits 
see note benefits and pension plans to the consolidated financial statements for further information 
we may be required to make payments related to our unrecognized tax benefits 
however  due to the uncertainty of the timing of future cash flows associated with these unrecognized tax benefits  we are unable to make reasonably reliable estimates of the period of cash settlement  if any  with the respective taxing authorities 
accordingly  unrecognized tax benefits of  as of august  have been excluded from the contractual obligations table above 
see note income taxes to the consolidated financial statements for further information 
the table above does not include payment obligations under the million borrowing from bank of america that we used to finance the cim acquisition  or the related million in promissory notes we issued in the same acquisition  because they were incurred after our fiscal year end 
the payment terms of each of those obligations are described above under liquidity and sources of capital 
we have no other outstanding long term indebtedness

 subsequent events fas  which provides guidance to establish general standards of accounting for and disclosures of events that occur after the balance sheet date but before financial statements are issued or are available to be issued 
fas also requires entities to disclose the date through which subsequent events were evaluated as well as the rationale for why that date was selected 
this disclosure should alert all users of financial statements that an entity has not evaluated subsequent events after that date in the set of financial statements being presented 
fas is effective for interim and annual periods ending after june  and is effective for us beginning with this reporting period 
accordingly  we have adopted this pronouncement  which did not have a material impact on our results of operations or financial condition 
the disclosures required by fas have been made in note to the consolidated financial statements included in this report 
in june  the fasb approved the fasb accounting standards codification the codification as the single source of authoritative nongovernmental us gaap to be launched on july  the codification does not change current us gaap  but is intended to simplify user access to all authoritative us gaap by providing all the authoritative literature related to a particular topic in one place

the codification is effective for interim and annual periods ending after september  the codification is effective for us in the interim period ending november  and it will not have a material impact on our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
critical accounting policies  judgments  and estimates the us securities and exchange commission sec requires companies to provide additional disclosure and commentary on their most critical accounting policies 
the sec has defined the most critical accounting policies as the ones that are most important to the portrayal of a company s financial condition and operating results  and requires management to make its most significant estimates and judgments in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements 
our critical accounting policies are described below 
accounts receivable we evaluate the collectability of accounts receivable balances based on a combination of factors 
in cases where we are aware of circumstances that may impair a specific customer s ability to meet its financial obligations to us  a specific allowance against amounts due to us is recorded  and thereby reduces the net recognized receivable to the amount we reasonably believe will be collected 
for all other customers  we recognize allowances for doubtful accounts based on the length of time the receivables are past due  industry and geographic concentrations  the current business environment and our historical experience 
if the financial condition of our 
table of contents customers deteriorates or if economic conditions worsen  additional allowances may be required in the future  which could have an adverse impact on our future operating results 
inventories we value inventory at the lower of cost or market using the first in  first out fifo method 
management assesses the recoverability of inventory based on types and levels of inventory held  forecasted demand and changes in technology 
these assessments require management judgments and estimates  and valuation adjustments for excess and obsolete inventory may be recorded based on these assessments 
we estimate excess and obsolescence exposures based upon assumptions about future demand  product transitions  and market conditions and record reserves to reduce inventories to their estimated net realizable value 
the failure to accurately forecast demand may lead to additional excess and obsolete inventory and future charges 
goodwill  intangible assets  and other long lived assets long lived assets consist of goodwill  identifiable intangible assets  trademarks  patents and agreements and property  plant  and equipment 
intangible assets and property  plant  and equipment  excluding goodwill  are amortized using the straight line method over their estimated useful life 
we review long lived assets and all intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable 
goodwill is also reviewed at least annually for impairment 
factors which we consider important and that could trigger an impairment review include significant underperformance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results and significant negative industry or economic trends 
we determine whether an impairment has occurred based on gross expected future cash flows and measure the amount of the impairment based on the related future discounted cash flows 
the cash flow estimates used to determine impairment  if any  contain management s best estimates  using appropriate and customary assumptions and projections at the time 
see notes to consolidated financial statements 
the estimates of expected cash flows require us to make significant judgments regarding future periods that are subject to some factors outside of our control 
changes in these estimates can result in significant revisions to the carrying value of these assets and may result in material charges to the results of operations 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  performance of our obligation is complete  our price to the buyer is fixed or determinable  and we are reasonably assured of collecting 
this is typically at the time of shipment 
if a loss is anticipated on any contract  a provision for the entire loss is made immediately 
revenue recognition involves judgments and assessments of expected returns  and the likelihood of nonpayment due to insolvent customers 
we analyze various factors  including a review of specific customer contracts and shipment terms  historical experience  creditworthiness of customers and current market and economic conditions in determining when to recognize revenue 
changes in judgments on these factors could impact the timing and amount of revenue recognized with a resulting impact on the timing and amount of associated income 
commissions are recognized when earned and payments are received from the manufacturers represented 
royalty revenue is recognized based on licensee production statements received from the authorized manufacturers 
billed shipping and handling fees are recorded as sales revenue with the associated costs recorded as costs of products and services sold 
contingent income tax liabilities we are subject to routine income tax audits that occur periodically in the normal course of business 
our contingent income tax liabilities are estimated based on the methodology prescribed in fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes fin  which was adopted as of the beginning of fiscal fin prescribes a minimum recognition threshold a tax position is required to meet before being recognized in the financial statements 
our liabilities related to uncertain tax positions require an assessment of the probability of the income tax related exposures and settlements and are influenced by our historical audit experiences with various state and federal taxing authorities as well as by current income tax trends 
if circumstances change  we may be required to record adjustments that could be material to our reported financial condition and results of operations 
see note to the consolidated financial statements included in this report for more information on fin 
table of contents deferred income taxes we evaluate the need for a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
we have considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for a valuation allowance 
should we determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax asset in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would be charged to income in the period such determination was made 
pension benefits we sponsor a non contributory defined benefit pension plan covering substantially all employees of certain divisions of the company 
in calculating our retirement plan obligations and related expense  we make various assumptions and estimates 
these assumptions include discount rates  benefits earned  expected return on plan assets  mortality rates  and other factors 
while we believe that the assumptions used are appropriate  differences in actual experience or changes in assumptions may affect our pension obligations and future expense 
effective december   the defined benefit pension plan was amended to include a soft freeze whereby any employee hired after the effective date of december  will not be admitted to the plan 
the only exception relates to employees of the international association of machinists and aerospace workers union 
all participants who were previously admitted to the plan prior to the december  soft freeze will continue to accrue benefits as detailed in the plan agreements 
we account for our pension plan following the requirements of sfas no 
 employers accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans fas 
fas requires an employer to a recognize in its statement of financial position the funded status of a benefit plan  b measure defined benefit plan assets and obligations as of the end of the employer s fiscal year with limited exceptions  and c recognize as a component of other comprehensive income  net of tax  the gains or losses and prior service costs or credits that arise but are not recognized as components of net periodic benefit costs pursuant to prior existing guidance 
impact of inflation inflation has not had a significant long term impact on our earnings 
in the event of significant inflation  our efforts to recover cost increases would be hampered as a result of the competitive nature of the industries in which we operate
