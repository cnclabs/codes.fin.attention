recent events on september   boeing employees represented by the international association of machinists and aerospace workers  or the iam  went on strike following the expiration of their collective bargaining agreement with the boeing company the strike 
at the onset of the strike  spirit and boeing jointly implemented a ship in place plan for all spirit produced major components  whereby we continued production at a reduced rate  but did not physically deliver the majority of end items to boeing 
in addition  we worked with our employees to implement reduced work weeks and other cost saving measures to mitigate the effects of the strike 
the reduced production rates during the strike  which ended on november   reduced spirit s revenue by an estimated million for  as compared to results consistent with pre strike delivery levels  which negatively impacted our income and cash flows for the third and fourth quarters of by segment  this amounted to estimated reductions in revenue of million  million and million for the fuselage systems  propulsion systems  and wing systems segments  respectively  as compared to results consistent with pre strike delivery levels 
as of december   we had units with a total value of million that had not been physically delivered to boeing 
as of february   we had six units on hand 
spirit s supply agreement with boeing provides for selling prices to be established based on planned production volumes for each period beginning june through may  with higher prices at lower volumes and lower prices at higher volumes 
these pre established prices are the basis for billing and payment for the entire year regardless of actual volume  with any differences settled after the yearly period has ended 
the strike impacted production volumes  as they fell below the planned levels for the june  through may  time period  resulting in higher actual average prices than had been anticipated 
the financial results for includes accrued revenue of million for volume based price increases retroactive to june  the company recorded an unfavorable cumulative catch up adjustment during the fourth quarter of of approximately million related to lower forecasted pension income in the current accounting blocks  unfavorable foreign exchange rate movements  net impact from other matters including customer requested delivery delays on the b and b programs  increasing costs from certain suppliers and the strike 
the company recognized a million favorable cumulative catch up adjustment during the fourth quarter of overview we are the largest independent non oem oem refers to aircraft original equipment manufacturer parts designer and manufacturer of commercial aerostructures in the world 
aerostructures are structural components  such as fuselages  propulsion systems and wing systems for commercial  military and business jet aircraft 
we derive our revenues primarily through long term supply agreements with boeing and requirements contracts with airbus 
for the twelve months ended december   we generated net revenues of  million and net income of million 
we are organized into three principal reporting segments fuselage systems  which include the forward  mid and rear fuselage sections  propulsion systems  which include nacelles  struts pylons and engine structural components  and wing systems  which include facilities in tulsa and mcalester  oklahoma and prestwick  scotland that manufacture wings  wing components  flight control surfaces and other miscellaneous structural parts 
all other activities fall within the all other segment  principally made up of sundry sales of miscellaneous services  tooling contracts  and sales of natural gas through a tenancy in common with other wichita companies

table of contents systems  propulsion systems  wing systems and all other represented approximately   and  respectively  of our revenues for the twelve months ended december  market trends the financial health of the commercial airline industry has a direct and significant effect on our commercial aircraft programs 
the global industry is expected to contract in for both passenger air traffic and cargo freight 
near term challenges include continuing turmoil in global credit markets  which may lead to increased aircraft order cancellations and deferrals as well as customer difficulty in obtaining financing for large purchases  and ongoing pressure by airlines to cut capacity by cancelling some routes  limiting flight frequencies  and parking aircraft all contributing to a further softening demand for new aircraft 
to date  both boeing and airbus have been able to avoid production and delivery slowdowns by finding replacement customers for deferred or cancelled aircraft 
possible exogenous shocks such as expanding conflicts in the middle east  terrorist attacks against the industry  or a pandemic health crisis also have the potential to cause precipitous declines in air traffic 
from through  boeing and airbus experienced an unprecedented order intake and backlog growth 
in that period  the two manufacturers obtained combined total orders of approximately  aircraft 
their aggregate backlog increased from nearly  to over  aircraft 
however  many industry experts believe that due to declining demand for commercial air travel including both passenger and freight activity  annual commercial orders will fall behind industry deliveries in  resulting in a downturn in aggregate backlog 
the industry has begun to experience this downturn in the fourth quarter of  as a result of low levels of new orders 
total new orders in for boeing and airbus dropped to  from  total orders in despite the anticipated order slowdown  high backlog levels continue to drive stable production and delivery forecasts for from both boeing and airbus 
if the commercial backlog were to decline  there could be a resulting near term impact on production rates 
if production rates fell  we would take actions to reduce costs and limit capital spending to mitigate the resulting loss of revenues and production base 
the following table sets forth the historical deliveries of boeing and airbus for through  and their announced delivery expectations for boeing airbus total boeing has announced that it expects its deliveries to be between airbus deliveries of are estimated  based on airbus public statements 
although the commercial aerospace industry is currently experiencing a period of stable production due to high backlog  absent the impact of the strike  economic trends indicate that this period may be coming to an end in the near term 
historically  commercial air travel including both passenger and freight activity  correlates to economic conditions as measured by growth in global domestic product 
weakening economies can lead to a reduction in airline traffic and resultant decreases in new orders  or even cancellations or deferrals of existing orders 
outlook we expect the following results  or ranges of results  for the year ending december  outlook actuals revenues billion billion earnings per share  fully diluted per share per share effective tax rate capital expenditures million million capital reimbursement million million 
table of contents our outlook is based on the following market assumptions we expect our revenues to be approximately billion based on previously issued boeing delivery guidance of aircraft  anticipated ramp up of b deliveries  expected airbus deliveries of around aircraft  internal spirit forecasts for non oem production activity and non boeing and airbus customers  and foreign exchange rates consistent with year end levels 
we expect our fully diluted earnings per share guidance to be between and per share  largely reflecting flat year over year production of large commercial aircraft excluding the impact of the strike at boeing on results  and a continued focus on expense management and improving operating efficiencies 
we expect our cash flow from operations less capital expenditures  net of customer reimbursements  to be positive in the aggregate with capital expenditures to be between million and million 
the us research and experimentation tax credit r e tax credit expired december   but was reinstated on october  retroactive to january  thus  the r e tax credit is reflected in our effective income tax rate and our outlook 
union equity participation plan compensation expense pursuant to our union equity participation plan uep we were obligated to pay benefits tied to the value of our class b common stock for the benefit of certain employees represented by the iam  ibew and uaw upon the consummation of our initial public offering 
the benefits were to be paid  at our option  in the form of cash and or future issuance of shares of our class a common stock  valued at the initial public offering price 
the company expensed million and million related to the union equity participation plan for the year ended december  and the quarter ended march   respectively 
we paid approximately of the total benefit in shares of class a common stock  through the issuance of  shares in march the portion of the benefit that was paid in stock was accounted for as an equity based plan under sfas r  statement of financial accounting standards no 
revised share based payment 
this treatment resulted in a million increase and a million decrease to additional paid in capital on our consolidated balance sheet as of december  and march   respectively 
the decrease as of march   resulted from the payment of cash in lieu of shares to employees whose employment terminated prior to march  the remainder of the benefit was paid in cash using million of the proceeds of the initial public offering and million from available cash 
basis of presentation the financial statements include spirit s financial statements and the financial statements of its majority owned subsidiaries and have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
investments in business entities in which the company does not have control  but has the ability to exercise significant influence over operating and financial policies generally to ownership  are accounted for by the equity method 
kansas industrial energy supply company kiesc  a tenancy in common with other wichita companies established to purchase natural gas  is fully consolidated as spirit owns of the entity s equity 
all intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation 
spirit s uk subsidiary uses local currency  the british pound  as its functional currency 
all other foreign subsidiaries use local currency as their functional currency with the exception of our malaysian subsidiary  which uses the british pound 
as part of the monthly consolidation process  the functional currency is translated to us dollars using the end of month translation rate for balance sheet accounts and average period currency translation rates for revenue and income accounts as defined by sfas no 
 foreign currency translation as amended 
critical accounting policies the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with us gaap 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  
table of contents liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to inventory  income taxes  financing obligations  warranties  pensions and other post retirement benefits and contingencies and litigation 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
management believes that the quality and reasonableness of our most critical policies enable the fair presentation of our financial position and results of operations 
however  the sensitivity of financial statements to these methods  assumptions and estimates could create materially different results under different conditions or using different assumptions 
the following are our most critical accounting policies  which are those that require management s most subjective and complex judgments  requiring the use of estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain and may change in subsequent periods 
revenues and profit recognition a significant portion of the company s revenues are recognized under long term  volume based pricing contracts  requiring delivery of products over several years 
the company recognizes revenue under the contract method of accounting and records sales and profits on each contract in accordance with the percentage of completion method of accounting  primarily using the units of delivery method 
revenues from non recurring design work are recognized based on substantive milestones or use of the cost to cost method  depending on facts and circumstances  that are indicative of our progress toward completion 
we follow the requirements of statement of position sop  accounting for performance of construction type and certain production type contracts the contract method of accounting  using the cumulative catch up method in accounting for revisions in estimates 
under the cumulative catch up method  the impact of revisions in estimates is recognized immediately when changes in estimated contract profitability become known 
a profit rate is estimated based on the difference between total revenues and total costs of a contract 
total revenues at any given time include actual historical revenues up to that time plus future estimated revenues 
total costs at any given time include actual historical costs up to that time plus future estimated costs 
estimated revenues include negotiated or expected values for units delivered  estimates of probable recoveries asserted against the customer for changes in specifications  price adjustments for contract and volume changes  and escalation 
costs include the estimated cost of certain pre production effort including non recurring engineering and planning subsequent to completion of final design plus the estimated cost of manufacturing a specified number of production units 
estimates take into account assumptions relative to future labor performance and rates  and projections relative to material and overhead costs including expected learning curve cost reductions over the term of the contract 
the specified number of production units used to establish the profit margin contract block is predicated upon contractual terms and market forecasts 
the assumed timeframe period covered by the contract block is generally equal to the period specified in the contract or the future timeframe for which we can project reasonably dependable cost estimates 
estimated revenues and costs also take into account the expected impact of specific contingencies that we believe are probable 
estimates of revenues and costs for our contracts span a period of multiple years and are based on a substantial number of underlying assumptions 
we believe that the underlying assumptions are sufficiently reliable to provide a reasonable estimate of the profit to be generated 
however  due to the significant length of time over which revenue streams will be generated  the variability of the revenue and cost streams can be significant if the assumptions change 
for revenues not recognized under the contract method of accounting  the company recognizes revenues from the sale of products at the point of passage of title  which is generally at the time of shipment 
shipping and handling costs are included in cost of sales 
revenues earned from providing maintenance services including any contracted research and development are recognized when the service is complete or other contractual milestones are attained 
since boeing retained title to tooling assets and provides such tooling to the company at no cost  the company treats the amortization of boeing owned tooling as a reduction to revenues as required by emerging issues task force eitf  accounting for consideration given by a vendor to a customer including a reseller of the 
table of contents vendor s products 
purchase accounting adjustments in related to the pension asset resulted in lower assigned value to the boeing owned tooling which in turn reduced the amortization year over year 
inventory raw materials are stated at lower of cost principally on an actual or average cost basis or market 
inventoried costs attributed to units delivered under long term contracts are based on the estimated average cost of all units expected to be produced and are determined under the learning curve concept which anticipates a predictable decrease in unit costs as tasks and production techniques become more efficient through repetition 
this usually results in an increase in inventory referred to as excess over average or deferred production costs during the early years of a contract 
these costs are deferred only to the extent the amount of actual or expected excess over average is reasonably expected to be fully offset by lower than average costs in future periods of a contract 
if in process inventory plus estimated costs to complete a specific contract exceed the anticipated remaining revenues of such contract  such excess is charged to cost of sales in the period the loss becomes known  thus reducing inventory to estimated realizable value 
costs in inventory include amounts relating to contracts with long production cycles  some of which are not expected to be realized within one year 
the company reviews its general stock materials and spare parts inventory each quarter to identify impaired inventory  including excess or obsolete inventory  based on historical sales trends and expected production usage 
impaired inventories are written off in the period identified 
finished goods inventory is stated at its estimated average per unit cost based on all units expected to be produced 
income taxes income taxes are accounted for in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
deferred income tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future income tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts for existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases 
a valuation allowance is recorded to reduce deferred income tax assets to an amount that in management s opinion will ultimately be realized 
the effect of changes in tax rates is recognized in the period during which the rate change occurs 
we record an income tax expense or benefit based on the net income earned or net loss incurred in each tax jurisdiction and the tax rate applicable to that income or loss 
in the ordinary course of business  there are transactions for which the ultimate tax outcome is uncertain 
these uncertainties are accounted for in accordance with fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes 
the final tax outcome for these matters may be different than management s original estimates made in determining the income tax provision 
a change to these estimates could impact the effective tax rate and net income or loss in subsequent periods 
we use the flow through accounting method for investment tax credits 
under this method  investment tax credits reduce income tax expense 
pensions and other post retirement benefits we account for pensions and other post retirement benefits in accordance with sfas no 
 employers accounting for pensions and sfas no 
 employers accounting for post retirement benefits other than pensions  both as modified by sfas r  employers disclosures about pensions and other post retirement benefits as amended and sfas sfas  employers accounting for defined benefit pension and other post retirement plans 
the financial accounting standards board issued and we adopted sfas during  which requires companies to reflect the funded status for each of their defined benefit and post retirement plans on the balance sheet 
in and we used november as our measurement date 
beginning in  we are required to and have used december as our measurement date 
assumptions used in determining the benefit obligations and the annual expense for our pension and post retirement benefits other than pensions are evaluated and established in conjunction with an independent actuary 

table of contents we set the discount rate assumption annually for each of our retirement related benefit plans as of the measurement date  based on a review of projected cash flows and long term high quality corporate bond yield curves 
the discount rate determined on each measurement date is used to calculate the benefit obligation as of that date  and is also used to calculate the net periodic benefit expense income for the upcoming plan year 
we derive assumed expected rate of return on pension assets from the long term expected returns based on the investment allocation by class specified in our investment policy 
the expected return on plan assets determined on each measurement date is used to calculate the net periodic benefit expense income for the upcoming plan year 
assumed health care cost trend rates have a significant effect on the amounts reported for the post retirement health care plans 
to determine the health care cost trend rates  we consider national health trends and adjust for our specific plan designs and locations 
stock compensation plans at inception  we adopted sfas no 
r  which generally requires companies to measure the cost of employee and non employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments based on the grant date fair value and to recognize this cost over the requisite service period or immediately if there is no service period or other performance requirements 
stock based compensation represents a significant accounting policy of ours  which is further described in note within the notes to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report 
we have established various stock compensation plans that include restricted share grants and restricted stock units 
purchase accounting bae acquisition 
we accounted for the bae acquisition as a purchase in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
 business combinations  and recorded the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based upon the fair value of the consideration paid  which is summarized in the following table dollars in millions cash payment to bae systems direct costs of the acquisition working capital settlement total consideration 
table of contents the fair value of the various assets acquired and liabilities assumed was determined by management based on valuations performed by an independent third party 
the total consideration exceeded the fair value of the net assets acquired by approximately million  resulting in goodwill 
the purchase price was allocated as follows book value april  dollars in millions cash accounts receivable inventory other current assets property  plant and equipment intangible assets goodwill currency hedge assets accounts payable and accrued liabilities pension liabilities other liabilities currency hedge liabilities net assets acquired new accounting standards for a listing of new accounting standards see note  summary of significant accounting policies new accounting standards

for purposes of measuring production or ship set deliveries for boeing aircraft in a given period  the term ship set refers to sets of structural fuselage components produced or delivered for one aircraft in such period 
for purposes of measuring production or ship set deliveries for airbus aircraft in a given period  the term ship set refers to all structural aircraft components produced or delivered for one aircraft in such period 
other components which are part of the same aircraft ship sets could be produced or shipped in earlier or later accounting periods than the components used to measure production or ship set deliveries  which may result in slight variations in production or delivery quantities of the various ship set components in any given period 
comparative ship set deliveries by model are as follows twelve months twelve months twelve months ended ended ended december  december  december  model b b b b b total boeing a family a a total airbus hawker series total spirit deliveries of the airbus and hawker products began on april   the date we acquired bae aerostructures 
twelve months ended december  as compared to twelve months ended december  net revenues 
net revenues for the twelve months ended december   were  million  a decrease of million  or  compared with net revenues of  million for the same period in the prior year 
the decrease in net revenues is primarily attributable to decreased ship set deliveries on the b  b  b and b programs due to the strike  partially offset by a volume based pricing adjustment  changes in product mix  and an increase in ship set deliveries for the a  a  and a programs 
ship set deliveries to boeing decreased to ship sets during the twelve months ended december   compared to ship sets for the same period in as of december   we had ship in place units with a total value of million that had not been physically delivered to boeing 
ship set deliveries for airbus increased to ship sets during the twelve months ended december   compared to ship sets for the same period in  while ship set deliveries to hawker increased to ship sets during the twelve months ended december   compared to ship sets for the same period in  in each case due to increases in the customer delivery schedule

the net impact of these matters resulted in a million unfavorable cumulative catch up adjustment for the twelve months ended december  related to periods prior to a favorable cumulative catch up adjustment of million was recorded in the twelve months of related to periods prior to  driven primarily by lower fringe expenses and favorable cost trends within the current contract blocks 
sg a  research and development and other period costs 
sg a  research and development and other period costs as a percentage of net revenues for the twelve months ended december  was  compared to for the same period in the prior year despite lower net revenues in as a result of the strike 
sg a expenses for the twelve months ended december   were lower as a percentage of net revenues due primarily to a reduction in spending on transition related costs and lower stock compensation expenses 
sg a in also included million of non cash stock compensation expense related to the secondary offering that occurred in may of and expenses of million associated with the potential acquisition of airbus manufacturing sites in europe 
transition expenses were reduced from million in to million in as we transitioned to spirit owned systems and processes

operating income for the twelve months ended december   was million  a decrease of million  or  compared to operating income of million for the same period in the prior year 
the decrease is primarily attributable to lower sales volume and the unfavorable cumulative catch up adjustments  partially offset by lower sg a and research and development expenses 
interest expense and financing fee amortization 
interest expense and financing fee amortization for the twelve months ended december   includes million of interest and fees paid or accrued in connection with long term debt and million in amortization of deferred financing costs  as compared to million of interest and fees paid or accrued in connection with long term debt and million in amortization of deferred financing costs in the prior year 
the increase of million as compared to the twelve months ended december  was primarily due to increased recurring fees associated with increasing the revolver capacity and amortization of deferred financing cost  partially offset by the effect of debt repayments 
interest income 
interest income for the twelve months ended december   consisted of million of accretion of the discounted long term receivable from boeing for capital expense reimbursement pursuant to the asset purchase agreement for the boeing acquisition and million of interest income compared to million of accretion of the discounted long term receivable and million of interest income for the same period in the prior year 
the decrease of million as compared to the twelve months ended december  was primarily due to lower accretion income as a result of a lower outstanding balance on the discounted long term receivable and lower interest earned on interest bearing accounts 
provision for income taxes 
our reported tax rate includes two principal components an expected annual tax rate and discrete items resulting in additional provisions or benefits that are recorded in the quarter that an event arises 
events or items that give rise to discrete recognition could include finalizing audit examinations for open tax years  a statute of limitations expiration  or a stock acquisition 
the income tax provision for the twelve months ended december   was million compared to million for the same period in the prior year 
the effective tax rate was as compared to for the increase in the effective tax rate recorded for is related primarily to reduced state income tax credits partially offset by additional federal research and experimentation tax credits 
the decrease from the us statutory tax rate is attributable primarily to state income tax credits  the federal research and experimentation tax credit  and the qualified domestic production activities deduction

liquidity and capital resources liquidity  or access to cash  is an important factor in determining our financial stability 
the primary sources of our liquidity include cash flow from operations  which include advance payments and receivables from customers  and borrowing capacity through our credit facilities 
our liquidity requirements and working capital needs depend on a number of factors  including delivery rates and payment terms under our contracts  the level of research and development expenditures related to new programs  capital expenditures  growth and contractions in the business cycle  contributions to our union sponsored benefit plans and interest and debt payments 
our ability to make scheduled payments of principal of  or to pay the interest on  or to refinance  our indebtedness  or to fund non acquisition related capital expenditures and research and development efforts  will depend on our ability to generate cash in the future 
this is subject  in part  to general economic  financial  competitive  legislative  regulatory and other factors that are beyond our control 
based on our current levels of operations and absent any disruptive events  management believes that internally generated funds  advance payments and receivables from customers  and borrowings available under our revolving loan facility should provide sufficient resources to finance our operations  non acquisition related capital expenditures  research and development efforts and long term indebtedness obligations through at least we cannot assure you  however  that our business will generate sufficient cash flow from operations or that future borrowing will be available to us under our credit facilities in an amount sufficient to enable us to pay our indebtedness or to fund our other liquidity needs 
if we cannot generate sufficient cash flow  we may need to refinance all or a portion of our indebtedness on or before maturity 
also  to the extent we accelerate our growth plans  consummate acquisitions or have lower than anticipated sales or increases in expenses  we may also need to raise additional capital 
in particular  increased working capital needs occur whenever we consummate acquisitions or experience strong incremental demand for our products 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to raise additional capital on commercially reasonable terms or at all 
our revolving credit facility is a significant source of liquidity for our business 
the current facility expires in mid and we intend to extend or renew this agreement prior to its expiration 

table of contents we may pursue strategic acquisitions on an opportunistic basis 
our acquisition strategy may require substantial capital  and we may not be able to raise any necessary funds on acceptable terms or at all 
if we incur additional debt to finance acquisitions  our total interest expense will increase 
the company believes that the lenders participating in its credit facilities will be willing and able to provide financing to the company in accordance with their legal obligations under the credit facilities 
however  there can be no assurance that the cost or availability of future borrowings  if any  in the debt markets or our credit facilities will not be impacted by the ongoing credit market disruptions 
we currently have manufacturing capacity to produce ship sets at the rates we have committed to our customers 
we have additional capacity on some of our products  but our capacity utilization on the fuselages for the b and b are at close to at our current production rates 
these capacity utilization rates are based on five days per week  three shifts per day operations 
significant capital expenditures may be required if our customers request that we increase production rates for an extended period of time 
our supply agreements typically have maximum production rates 
if a customer requests that we increase production rates above these stated maximum levels  additional negotiation would be required to determine whether we or our customer would bear the cost of any capital expenditures  tooling and non recurring engineering required as a result of such production rate increases 
during the first quarter of  standard poor s revised the company s credit outlook from negative to stable following spirit s announcement of its increased credit line and revised payment terms on the b program 
our corporate credit ratings at standard poor s rating services and moody s investor service as of december  were bb and ba  respectively 
the company s us pension plan remained fully funded at year end as a result of the plan s asset performance during and the increased pension obligation resulting from a lower discount rate at the december measurement date  spirit now expects significantly reduced non cash pension income in future periods 
spirit s plan investments are broadly diversified  and despite the recent downturn  we do not anticipate a near term requirement to make cash contributions to spirit s us pension plan 
the carrying amounts of certain of our financial instruments  including cash and cash equivalents  accounts receivable and accounts payable  approximate fair value because of their short maturities 
cash 
at december  and december  we had cash and cash equivalents of million and million  respectively 
we maintain bank accounts with highly rated financial institutions and our cash investments have had no direct exposure to any sub prime asset classes 
financial instruments 
we use derivative financial instruments to manage the economic impact of fluctuations in currency exchange rates and interest rates 
to account for our derivative financial instruments  we follow the provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  as amended by sfas and sfas derivative financial instruments are recognized on the consolidated balance sheets as either assets or liabilities and are measured at fair value 
the derivatives are valued at mark to market with the changes in fair market value of the instruments recorded at each period in earnings or accumulated other comprehensive income  depending on whether a derivative is effective as part of a hedge transaction  and if it is  the type of hedge transaction 
gains and losses on derivative instruments reported in accumulated other comprehensive income are subsequently included in earnings in the periods in which earnings are affected by the hedged item or when the hedge is no longer effective 
we present the cash flows associated with our derivatives as a component of the investing section of the statement of cash flows 
our use of derivatives has included interest rate swaps  as well as foreign currency swaps to manage our risk associated with us dollar denominated contracts negotiated by spirit europe 
we believe that the effect of significant increases or decreases in the aggregate fair value of our derivatives will not materially impact our liquidity

table of contents tax we establish reserves to provide for additional income taxes that may be due in future years as these previously filed tax returns are audited in accordance with fin we recognize the financial statement impact for tax positions only after determining that based on its technical merits the relevant tax authority would more likely than not sustain the position on audit 
for tax positions meeting the more likely than not threshold the amount recognized in the financial statements is the largest amount that has a greater than likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement with the relevant tax authority 
the reserves are adjusted quarterly to reflect changing facts and circumstances  such as the tax audit s progress  case law developments  and new or emerging legislation 
we believe that with a million long term payable  the tax reserves are adequate and reflect the most probable outcome for all tax contingencies known at december  accordingly  the tax contingency liability is included as a long term liability in our consolidated balance sheet 
expected backlog as of december   our expected backlog associated with large commercial aircraft  regional jet  business jet and military equipment deliveries through  calculated based on contractual product prices and expected delivery volumes  was approximately billion 
this is an increase of billion over our corresponding estimate as of the end of reflecting increased orders due to new business 
backlog is calculated based on the number of units spirit is under contract to produce on our fixed quantity contracts  and boeing or airbus announced backlog on our requirements contracts 
the number of units may be subject to cancellation or delay by the customer prior to shipment  depending on contract terms 
the level of unfilled orders at any given date during the year may be materially affected by the timing of our receipt of firm orders and additional airplane orders  and the speed with which those orders are filled

currency fluctuations  tariffs and similar import limitations  price controls and labor regulations can affect our foreign operations 
other potential limitations on our foreign operations include expropriation  nationalization  restrictions on foreign investments or their transfers and additional political and economic risks 
in addition  the transfer of funds from foreign operations could be impaired by any restrictive regulations that foreign governments could enact 
sales to foreign customers are subject to numerous additional risks  including the impact of foreign government regulations  political uncertainties and differences in business practices

inflation a majority of our sales are conducted pursuant to long term contracts that set fixed unit prices  some of which provide for price adjustment for inflation 
in addition  we typically consider expected inflation in determining proposed pricing when we bid on new work 
although we have attempted to minimize the effect of inflation on our business through these protections  sustained or higher than anticipated increases in costs of labor or materials could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
spirit s contracts with suppliers currently provide for fixed pricing in us dollars  spirit europe s supply contracts are denominated in us dollars  british pounds sterling and euros 
in some cases our supplier arrangements contain inflationary adjustment provisions based on accepted industry indices  and we typically include an inflation component in estimating our supply costs 
although the raw material industry is experiencing a softening in demand  some specific materials have yet to reflect a corresponding reduction in price 
we expect that raw material market pricing volatility will remain a factor that may impact our costs  despite protections in our existing supplier arrangements 
we will continue to focus our strategic cost reduction plans on mitigating the effects of this potential cost increase on our operations

we maintain cash and cash equivalents with various financial institutions and perform periodic evaluations of the relative credit standing of those financial institutions 
we have not experienced any losses in such accounts and believe that we are not exposed to any significant credit risk on cash and cash equivalents 
additionally  we monitor our defined benefit pension plan asset investments on a quarterly basis and we believe that we are not exposed to any significant credit risk in these investments 
commodity price risks some raw materials and operating supplies are subject to price and supply fluctuations caused by market dynamics 
our strategic sourcing initiatives are focused on mitigating the impact of commodity price risk 
we are party to collective raw material sourcing contracts arranged through boeing  airbus and bae systems 
these 
table of contents collective sourcing contracts allow us to obtain raw materials at pre negotiated rates and help insulate us from market volatility across the industry for certain specialized metallic and composite raw materials used in the aerospace industry 
although our supply agreements with boeing and requirements contracts with airbus allow us to pass on certain unusual increases in component and raw material costs to boeing and airbus in limited situations  we may not be fully compensated for such increased costs 
we also have long term supply agreements with a number of our major parts suppliers 
we  as well as our supply base  are experiencing pricing increases for metallic raw materials primarily aluminum and titanium despite softening market demand across the industry 
although the demand pressure has been somewhat eased for certain metallic and composite raw materials  the specialized nature of the materials used in the aerospace industry has prevented a corresponding decrease in prices 
we generally do not employ forward contracts or other financial instruments to hedge commodity price risk  although we are reviewing a full range of business options focused on strategic risk management for all raw material commodities 
any failure by our suppliers to provide acceptable raw materials  components  kits or subassemblies could adversely affect our production schedules and contract profitability 
we assess qualification of suppliers and continually monitor them to control risk associated with such supply base reliance 
to a lesser extent  we also are exposed to fluctuations in the prices of certain utilities and services  such as electricity  natural gas  chemicals and freight 
we utilize a range of long term agreements to minimize procurement expense and supply risk in these areas 
interest rate risks after the effect of interest rate swaps  as of december   we had million of total fixed rate debt and million of variable rate debt outstanding as compared to million of total fixed rate debt and million of variable rate debt outstanding as of december  borrowings under our senior secured credit facility bear interest that varies with libor 
interest rate changes generally do not affect the market value of such debt  but do impact the amount of our interest payments and  therefore  our future earnings and cash flows  assuming other factors are held constant 
assuming other variables remain constant  including levels of indebtedness  a one percentage point increase in interest rates on our variable debt would have an estimated impact on pre tax earnings and cash flows for the next twelve months of approximately million 
as required under our senior secured credit facility  we enter into floating to fixed interest rate swap agreements periodically 
as of december   the interest swap agreements had notional amounts totaling million 
in addition  we entered a forward starting swap effective from july to replace the swap expiring in july effective fair value  variable fixed fixed december  principal amount expires rate rate rate in millions july libor july libor july libor july libor forward starting swap effective july entered into october effective fixed rates include libor rates plus basis points 
the purpose of entering into these swaps was to reduce our exposure to variable interest rates 
in accordance with sfas no 
 the interest rate swaps are being accounted for as cash flow hedges and the fair value of the swap agreements is reported on the balance sheet as an asset  if positive  or a liability  if negative 
the fair value of the interest rate swaps was a net liability of approximately million at december  the company also considers counterparty credit risk and its own credit risk in its determination of all estimated fair values 
the company has applied these valuation techniques at year end and believes it has obtained the most accurate information available for the types of derivative contracts it holds 
the company attempts to manage exposure to 
table of contents counterparty credit risk by only entering into agreements with major financial institutions which are expected to be able to fully perform under the terms of the agreement 
foreign exchange risks on april   in connection with the bae acquisition  we acquired forward foreign currency exchange contracts denominated in british pounds sterling with notional amounts totaling approximately million 
the purpose of these forward contracts is to allow spirit europe to reduce its exposure to fluctuations of the us dollar exchange rate 
the notional amount of the contracts remaining at december  was million 
as a result of the bae acquisition  we have sales  expenses  assets and liabilities that are denominated in british pounds sterling 
spirit europe s functional currency is the british pound sterling 
however  sales of spirit europe s products to boeing and some procurement costs are denominated in us dollars and euros 
as a consequence  movements in exchange rates could cause net sales and our expenses to fluctuate  affecting our profitability and cash flows 
we use foreign currency forward contracts to reduce our exposure to currency exchange rate fluctuations 
the objective of these contracts is to minimize the impact of currency exchange rate movements on our operating results 
we do not use these contracts for speculative or trading purposes 
in addition  even when revenues and expenses are matched  we must translate british pound sterling denominated results of operations  assets and liabilities for our foreign subsidiaries to us dollars in our consolidated financial statements 
consequently  increases and decreases in the value of the us dollar as compared to the british pound sterling will affect our reported results of operations and the value of our assets and liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet  even if our results of operations or the value of those assets and liabilities has not changed in its original currency 
these transactions could significantly affect the comparability of our results between financial periods and or result in significant changes to the carrying value of our assets  liabilities and shareholders equity 
in accordance with sfas no 
 the foreign exchange contracts for are being accounted for as cash flow hedges 
the fair value of the foreign exchange contracts was a net liability of approximately million with a notional amount of million at december  at december   a unfavorable exchange rate movement in our portfolio of foreign currency contracts would have increased our unrealized losses by million 
the foreign exchange contracts for through are derivatives acquired as part of the bae acquisition 
in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities as amended  these are recorded at mark to market through our statement of operations on a monthly basis 
in millions notional amount foreign risk from change usd currency average average net fair in revaluation year buy sell buy sell contract rate revaluation rate value rate in accordance with sfas no 
 the intercompany revolving credit facility with spirit europe is exposed to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates 
the fluctuation in rates for resulted in a loss of million reflected in other income expense 
other than the interest rate swaps and foreign exchange contracts  we have no other derivative financial instruments
