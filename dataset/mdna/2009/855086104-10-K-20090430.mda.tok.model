consolidated net income for fiscal improved approximately million to net income of  or per diluted share as compared with a net loss of  or per diluted share for the comparable prior year period 
the improvement in net income is due to an increase in income from operations of approximately million primarily from new acquisitions which included lower impairment expense of approximately million partially offset by higher interest expense and an increase in income taxes of approximately million 
total revenues increased approximately million or from million in fiscal to million in fiscal the increase in revenues was primarily attributable to new store openings and newly acquired stores that resulted in additional sales of approximately million  partially offset by declines in comparable same store sales of approximately million primarily in the hometown buffet restaurants and the closure of restaurants 
the decline in sales from the closed stores was approximately million 
the company believes the decline in same store sales is a result of weaker economic conditions and new restaurant competition in certain markets 
the decline in sales on a same store basis significantly impacts consolidated net income because occupancy  salaries  benefits  and other expenses are primarily fixed in nature and generally do not vary significantly with restaurant sales volume 
occupancy and other expense includes major expenditures such as rent  insurance  property taxes  utilities  maintenance and advertising

impact of inflation management recognizes that inflation has an impact on food  construction  labor and benefit costs  all of which can significantly affect the company s operations 
historically  the company has been able to pass on certain increased costs due to these inflationary factors along to its customers because those factors have impacted nearly all restaurant companies 
critical accounting policies and judgments the company prepares its consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the company s consolidated financial statements are based on the application of certain accounting policies  the most significant of which are described in note summary of significant accounting policies to the audited consolidated financial statements for the year ended january   included in the company s annual report filed on form k 
certain of these policies require numerous estimates and strategic or economic assumptions that may prove inaccurate or may be subject to variations and may significantly affect the company s reported results and financial position for the current period or future periods 
changes in the underlying factors  assumptions or estimates in any of these areas could have a material impact on the company s future financial condition and results of operations 
the company considers the following policies to be the most critical in understanding the judgments that are involved in preparing its consolidated financial statements 
receivables receivables are stated at an amount management expects to collect and provides for an adequate reserve for probable uncollectible amounts 
amounts deemed to be uncollectible are written off through a charge to earnings and a credit to a valuation allowance based on management s assessment of the current status of individual balances 
a receivable is written off when it is determined that all collection efforts have been exhausted 
the company did not have a valuation allowance as of january  and january  notes receivable notes receivable are stated at an amount management expects to collect and provides for an adequate reserve for probable uncollectible amounts 
amounts deemed to be uncollectible are written off through a charge to earnings and a credit to a valuation allowance based on management s assessment of the current status of individual balances 
a note receivable is written off when it is determined that all collection efforts have been exhausted 
the company did not have a valuation allowance as of january  and january  income taxes periodically  the company records or reduces the valuation allowance against deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized based upon recent past financial performance  tax reporting positions  and expectations of future taxable income 
the company expects to continue to record a valuation allowance on certain future tax benefits as required under sfas the assets are evaluated each period under the requirements of sfas currently  the company does not have a valuation allowance against deferred tax assets since the company expects to utilize all deferred tax assets 
fin prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
fin requires recognition in the consolidated financial statements of the impact of a tax position if it is more likely than not the tax position will be sustained upon examination based on the technical merits of the position 
the company does not have any tax positions that require recognition under fin as of january  and april  property  buildings and equipment property and equipment and real property under capitalized leases are carried at cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization 
depreciation and amortization are provided using the straight line method over the following useful lives years buildings building and leasehold improvements furniture  fixtures and equipment building and leasehold improvements are amortized over the lesser of the life of the lease or estimated economic life of the assets 
the life of the lease includes renewal options determined by management at lease inception as reasonably likely to be exercised 
if a previously scheduled lease option is not exercised  any remaining unamortized leasehold improvements may be required to be expensed immediately which could result in a significant charge to operating results in that period 
property and equipment in non operating units or stored in warehouses held for remodeling or repositioning is not depreciated and is reclassed on the balance sheet as property  building and equipment held for future use 
property and equipment placed on the market for sale is not depreciated and is reclassed on the balance sheet as property held for sale 
repairs and maintenance are charged to operations as incurred 
major equipment refurbishments and remodeling costs are generally capitalized 
the company s accounting policies regarding buildings and equipment include certain management judgments regarding the estimated useful lives of such assets  the residual values to which the assets are depreciated and the determination as to what constitutes increasing the life of existing assets 
these judgments and estimates may produce materially different amounts of depreciation and amortization expense than would be reported if different assumptions were used 
as discussed further below  these judgments may also impact the company s need to recognize an impairment charge on the carrying amount of these assets as the cash flows associated with the assets are realized 
impairment of goodwill goodwill and other intangible assets primarily represent the excess of the purchase price paid over the fair value of the net assets acquired in connection with business acquisitions 
as of january   the company adopted sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas 
in accordance with sfas  the company ceased amortizing goodwill recorded in past business combinations effective as of january  as a result  there is no charge for goodwill amortization expense contained in the company s consolidated statements of operations for the year ended january  the company recorded an impairment charge of  for goodwill in fiscal year ended january  sfas requires that goodwill be tested for impairment by comparing the fair value of each reporting unit to the carrying amount of the reporting unit 
subsequent to the adoption of sfas  the company evaluates goodwill for impairment annually or when a triggering event occurs that indicates a potential impairment may have occurred in accordance with sfas future impairments of goodwill  if any  will adversely affect the results of operations in the periods recognized 
impairment of long lived assets the company determines that an impairment write down is necessary for locations whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
as of january   the company adopted sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets sfas 
in accordance with sfas  recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to future undiscounted net cash flows expected to be generated by the asset 
if such assets are considered to be impaired  the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets 
any impairment which would adversely affect operating results in the affected period 
judgments made by the company related to the expected useful lives of long lived assets and the ability of the company to realize undiscounted net cash flows in excess of the carrying amounts of such assets are affected by factors such as the ongoing maintenance and improvements of the assets  changes in economic conditions  and changes in operating performance 
as the company assesses the ongoing expected net cash flows and carrying amounts of its long lived assets  these factors could cause the company to realize a material impairment charge and could adversely affect operating results in any period 
insurance programs historically  the company has purchased first dollar insurance for workers compensation claims  high deductible primary property coverage  and excess policies for casualty losses 
effective january   the company modified its program for insuring casualty losses by lowering the self insured retention levels from million per occurrence to  per occurrence 
accruals for self insured casualty losses include estimates of expected claims payments 
because of large  self insured retention levels  actual liabilities could be materially different from calculated accruals

sfas also expands financial statement disclosure requirements about a company s use of fair value measurements  including the effect of such measures on earnings 
sfas was adopted in the beginning of fiscal for the company s financial assets and liabilities 
the company does not anticipate the application of sfas to nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities will have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements 
in february  the fasb issued sfas  the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities including an amendment of fasb statement no 
sfas 
this standard amends sfas  accounting for certain investment in debt and equity securities  with respect to accounting for a transfer to the trading category for all entities with available for sale and trading securities electing the fair value option 
this standard allows companies to elect fair value accounting for many financial instruments and other items that currently are not required to be accounted as such  allows different applications for electing the fair value option for a single item or groups of items  and requires disclosures to facilitate comparisons of similar assets and liabilities that are accounted for differently in relation to the fair value option

 noncontrolling interest in consolidated financial statements sfas 
sfas clarifies that a non controlling interest in a subsidiary is an ownership interest in the consolidated entity that should be reported as equity in the consolidated financial statements

sfas became effective for the company at the beginning of fiscal this statement will be applied prospectively  except for the presentation and disclosure requirements  which will be applied retrospectively for all periods presented

apb is effective for the company at the beginning of its fiscal year and early adoption is not permitted 
retrospective application to all periods presented is required except for instruments that were not outstanding during any of the periods that will be presented in the annual financial statements for the period of adoption but were outstanding during an earlier period 
the company does not currently have any convertible debt instruments and adoption of apb will not have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements
