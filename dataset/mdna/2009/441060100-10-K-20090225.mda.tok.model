critical accounting policies critical accounting policies are those policies that require management to make the most difficult  subjective or complex judgments  often because they must estimate the effects of matters that are 
table of contents inherently uncertain and may change in subsequent periods 
critical accounting policies involve judgments and uncertainties that are sufficiently sensitive to result in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions 
hospira believes its most critical accounting policies are those described below 
for a detailed discussion of these and other accounting policies  see note to the consolidated financial statements included in item revenue recognition hospira recognizes revenues from product sales when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  the price is fixed or determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
for other than certain drug delivery pumps and contract manufacturing  product revenue is recognized when products are delivered to customers and title passes 
in certain circumstances  hospira enters into arrangements in which it commits to provide multiple elements deliverables to its customers 
in these cases  total revenue is divided among the separate deliverables based on their relative fair value and is recognized for each deliverable in accordance with the applicable revenue recognition criteria 
for drug delivery pumps  revenue is typically derived under one of three types of arrangements outright sales of the drug delivery pump  placements under lease arrangements  and placements under contracts that include associated disposable set purchases 
on outright sales of the drug delivery pump and related sales of disposable products sets revenue is recognized as the products are delivered  in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 revenue recognition when right of return exists  and staff accounting bulletin sab no 
 revenue recognition 
other arrangements leases and contracts that included associated disposable set purchases are assessed in accordance with emerging issues task force eitf no 
determining whether an arrangement contains a lease and sfas no 
 accounting for leases  and drug delivery pump revenue is recorded as a sales type lease or operating lease 
for arrangements that qualify as sales type leases  the discounted sales value of the drug delivery pump is recorded as revenue upon delivery to the customer 
for arrangements that qualify as operating leases  hospira recognizes revenue over the lease term  and the related asset is depreciated over its estimated useful life on a straight line basis 
hospira markets a server based suite of software applications designed to exchange data from a hospital s drug information library database to drug delivery pumps throughout the hospital 
the arrangements related to such applications typically include a perpetual or subscription software license  software maintenance and implementation services  in addition to the drug delivery pump 
hospira recognizes revenue related to these arrangements in accordance with the provisions of statement of position sop  software revenue recognition  as amended 
drug delivery pump  perpetual software license revenue and implementation service revenue are generally recognized as obligations are completed or upon customer acceptance 
software subscription license revenue and software maintenance revenue is recognized ratably over the contract period 
contract manufacturing involves filling customers active pharmaceutical ingredients api into delivery systems 
under these arrangements  customers api is often consigned to hospira and revenue is recorded for the materials and labor provided by hospira  plus a profit  upon shipment to the customer 
upon recognizing revenue from a sale  hospira records an estimate for certain items that reduce gross sales in arriving at its reported net sales for each period 
these items include chargebacks  rebates and other items such as cash discounts and returns 
provisions for chargebacks and rebates represent the most significant and complex of these estimates 
chargebacks hospira sells a significant portion of its specialty injectable pharmaceutical products through wholesalers  which maintain inventories of hospira products and later sell those products to end customers 
in connection with its sales and marketing efforts  hospira negotiates prices with end customers for certain products under pricing agreements including  for example  group purchasing 
table of contents organization contracts 
consistent with industry practice  the negotiated end customer prices are typically lower than the prices charged to the wholesalers 
when an end customer purchases a hospira product that is covered by a pricing agreement from a wholesaler  the end customer pays the wholesaler the price determined under the pricing agreement 
the wholesaler is then entitled to charge hospira back for the difference between the price the wholesaler paid hospira and the contract price paid by the end customer a chargeback 
this process is necessary to enable hospira to track actual sales to the end customer  which is essential information to run the business effectively 
settlement of chargebacks generally occurs between and days after the sale to wholesalers 
to account for the chargeback  hospira records the initial sale to a wholesaler at the price invoiced to the wholesaler and at the same time  records a provision equal to the estimated amount the wholesaler will later charge back to hospira  reducing gross sales and trade receivables 
this provision must be estimated because the actual end customer and applicable pricing terms may vary at the time of the sale to the wholesaler 
accordingly  the most significant estimates inherent in the initial chargeback provision relate to the volume of sales to the wholesalers that will be subject to chargeback and the ultimate end customer contract price 
these estimates are based primarily on an analysis of hospira s product sales and most recent historical average chargeback credits by product  estimated wholesaler inventory levels  current contract pricing  anticipated future contract pricing changes and claims processing lag time 
hospira estimates the levels of inventory at the wholesalers through analysis of wholesaler purchases and inventory data obtained directly from certain of the wholesalers 
a one percent decrease in end customer contract prices for sales pending chargeback at december  would decrease net sales and income before income taxes by approximately million 
a one percent increase in wholesale units sold subject to chargebacks at december  would decrease net sales and income before income taxes by approximately million 
hospira regularly monitors the provision for chargebacks and makes adjustments when it believes the actual chargebacks may differ from estimates 
at december  and  chargebacks of million and million  respectively  were recorded as a reduction in trade receivables 
the methodology used to estimate and provide for chargebacks was consistent across all periods presented 
rebates hospira primarily offers rebates to direct customers  customers who purchase from certain wholesalers at end customer contract prices and government agencies  which administer various programs such as medicaid 
direct rebates are generally rebates paid to direct purchasing customers based on a contracted discount applied to the direct customer s purchases 
indirect rebates are rebates paid to indirect customers that have purchased hospira products from a wholesaler under a pricing agreement with hospira 
governmental agency rebates are amounts owed based on legal requirements with public sector benefit providers such as medicaid  after the final dispensing of the product by a pharmacy to a benefit plan participant 
rebate amounts are usually based upon the volume of purchases 
hospira estimates the amount of the rebate due at the time of sale  and records the liability and a reduction of gross sales at the same time the product sale is recorded 
settlement of the rebate generally occurs from one to months after sale 
in determining provisions for rebates to direct customers  hospira considers the volume of eligible purchases by these customers and the rebate terms 
in determining rebates on sales through wholesalers  hospira considers the volume of eligible contract purchases  the rebate terms and the estimated level of inventory at the wholesalers that would be subject to a rebate  which is estimated as described above under chargebacks 
upon receipt of a chargeback  due to the availability of product and customer specific information  hospira can then establish a specific provision for fees or rebates based on the specific terms of each agreement 
rebates under governmental programs are based on the estimated volume of products sold subject to these programs 
each period the estimates are reviewed 
table of contents and revised  if necessary  in conjunction with a review of contract volumes within the period 
adjustments related to prior period sales have not been material in any period 
hospira regularly analyzes the historical rebate trends and makes adjustments to recorded reserves for changes in trends and terms of rebate programs 
at december  and  accrued rebates of million and million  respectively  are included in other accrued liabilities 
the methodology used to estimate and provide for rebates was consistent across all periods presented 
the following table is an analysis of chargebacks and rebates for and in each year  the provisions for chargebacks and rebates relating to prior period sales were not material 
dollars in millions chargebacks rebates balance at january  provisions payments balance at december  provisions payments balance at december  returns provisions for returns are provided for at the time the related sales are recognized  and are reflected as a reduction of sales 
the estimate of the provision for returns is primarily based on historical experience of actual returns 
additionally  hospira considers other factors such as levels of inventory in the distribution channel  product dating and expiration period  whether products have been discontinued  and entrance in the market of additional competition 
this estimate is reviewed periodically and  if necessary  revised  with any revisions recognized immediately as adjustments to net sales 
inventories inventories are stated at the lower of cost first in  first out basis or market 
hospira monitors inventories for exposures related to obsolescence  excess  date expiration  non conformance  and loss and damage  and records a charge to cost of products sold for the amount required to reduce the carrying value of inventory to estimated net realizable value 
if conditions are less favorable than estimated  additional charges may be required 
stock based compensation in accordance with sfas no 
r  share based payment sfas no 
r hospira recognizes all share based payment transactions be recognized as compensation cost over the vesting period based on the fair value of the instrument on the date of grant 
hospira uses the black scholes option valuation model and the monte carlo simulation model to determine the fair value of stock options and performance share awards 
the fair value models include various assumptions  including the expected volatility and expected life of the awards 
these assumptions reflect hospira s best estimates  but they involve inherent uncertainties based on market conditions generally outside of hospira s control 
as a result  if other assumptions had been used  stock based compensation expense  as calculated and recorded under sfas no 
r  could have been materially impacted 
furthermore  if hospira uses different assumptions in future periods  stock based compensation expense could be materially impacted in future periods 
see note to the consolidated financial statements included in item for additional information regarding stock based compensation 
pension and post retirement benefits hospira provides pension and post retirement medical and dental benefits to certain of its active and retired employees based both in and outside of the us for financial reporting purposes  hospira develops assumptions  the most significant of which are the discount rate  the expected rate of return on plan assets  and healthcare cost trend rate 
for these assumptions  management consults with actuaries  monitors plan provisions and demographics  and 
table of contents reviews public market data and general economic information 
these assumptions reflect hospira s best estimates  but they involve inherent uncertainties based on market conditions generally outside of hospira s control 
assumption changes could affect the reported funded status of hospira s plans and  as a result  could result in higher funding requirements and or net periodic benefit costs 
the us discount rate estimate for and was developed with the assistance of yield curves developed by third party actuaries  while estimates used moody s aa corporate bond index  with consideration of differences in duration between the bonds in the index and hospira s benefit liabilities 
for non us plans  benchmark yield data for high quality fixed income investments for which the timing and amounts of payments match the timing and amounts of projected benefit payments is used to derive discount rate assumptions 
the expected return on assets for the pension plan represents the average rate of return to be earned on plan assets over the period the benefits are expected to be paid 
the expected return on assets is developed from the expected future return of each asset class  weighted by the expected allocation of pension assets to that asset class 
hospira considers historical performance for the types of assets in which the plans invest  independent market forecasts  and economic and capital market conditions 
sensitivity analysis for us plans which represent the primary portion of obligations is as follows net benefit cost income expense december  benefit obligation increase decrease dollars in millions one percentage point increase one percentage point decrease one percentage point increase one percentage point decrease pension plans us discount rate expected long term return on assets medical and dental plan us discount rate expected health care cost trend rate initial and ultimate in september  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
 employers accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans an amendment of fasb statements no 
   and r sfas no 

one provision of sfas no 
requires full recognition of the funded status of hospira s defined benefit and post retirement plans 
another provision of sfas no 
requires the measurement of hospira s defined benefit plan s assets and its obligations to determine the funded status as of the end of the fiscal year 
the incremental effect of the application of these provisions is provided in note of the consolidated financial statements included in item impairment of long lived and other assets in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  sfas no 
the carrying value of long lived assets  including amortizable intangible assets and property and equipment  are reviewed whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the related carrying amounts may not be recoverable 
impairment is generally determined by comparing projected undiscounted cash flows to be generated by the asset  or appropriate grouping of assets  to its carrying value 
if an impairment is identified  a loss is recorded equal to the excess of the asset s net book value over its fair value  and the cost basis is adjusted 
determining the extent of an impairment  if any  typically requires various estimates and assumptions including using management s judgment  cash flows directly attributable to the asset  the useful life of the asset and residual value  if any 
when necessary  hospira uses internal cash flow 
table of contents estimates  quoted market prices and appraisals as appropriate to determine fair value 
actual results could vary from these estimates 
in addition  the remaining useful life of the impaired asset is revised  if necessary 
hospira regularly reviews its investments to determine whether an other than temporary decline in market value exists 
hospira considers factors affecting the investee  factors affecting the industry the investee operates in  and general equity market trends 
hospira considers the length of time an investment s market value has been below carrying value and the prospects for recovery to carrying value 
when hospira determines that an other than temporary decline has occurred  the carrying basis of the investment is written down to fair value and the amount of the write down is included in other income  net 
in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  sfas no 
goodwill is not amortized but tested for impairment at least annually  or more frequently if an event occurs or circumstances change that would reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value 
hospira s reporting units are the same as its reportable segments americas  emea and apac 
the evaluation is based upon the estimated fair value of hospira s reporting units compared to the net carrying value of assets and liabilities 
the annual assessment occurs in the third quarter of each year 
loss contingencies in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies  loss contingency provisions are recorded for probable losses at management s best estimate of a loss  or when a best estimate cannot be made  a minimum loss contingency amount is recorded 
these estimates are often initially developed substantially earlier than the ultimate loss is known  and the estimates are refined each accounting period  as additional information is known 
accordingly  if hospira is initially unable to develop a best estimate of loss  the minimum amount  which could be zero  is recorded 
income taxes hospira s provision for income taxes is based on taxable income  statutory tax rates  and tax planning opportunities available in the various jurisdictions in which hospira operates 
significant judgment is required in determining the provision for income taxes and in evaluating tax positions that are subject to audits and adjustments 
liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits are established when  despite hospira s belief that the tax return positions are fully supportable  certain positions are likely to be challenged based on the applicable tax authority s determination of the positions 
such liabilities are based on management s judgment  utilizing internal and external tax advisors  and represent the best estimate as to the likely outcome of tax audits 
the provision for income taxes includes the impact of changes to unrecognized tax benefits 
each quarter  hospira reviews the anticipated mix of income derived from the various taxing jurisdictions and its associated liabilities in accordance with fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
fin  which hospira adopted on january  fin prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
deferred income taxes are provided for the tax effect of temporary differences between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and their reported amounts in the financial statements at the enacted statutory rate expected to be in effect when the taxes are paid 
provision for income taxes and foreign withholding taxes are not provided for on undistributed earnings for certain foreign subsidiaries when hospira intends to reinvest these earnings indefinitely to fund foreign acquisitions or to meet working capital and plant and equipment acquisition needs

risk factors  to the annual report on form k 
item a 
qualitative and quantitative disclosures about market risk financial instrument and risk management hospira operates globally  and earnings and cash flows are exposed to market risk from changes in currency exchange rates and interest rates 
upon consideration of management objectives  costs and opportunities  hospira uses derivative instruments  including foreign currency forward exchange contracts and interest rate swaps to manage these risks 
hospira enters into derivative instrument contracts with a diversified group of major financial institutions to limit the amount of credit exposure to nonperformance by any one institution 
hospira does not utilize derivative instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
foreign currency sensitive financial instruments hospira s operations are exposed to currency exchange rate risk  which is mitigated by hospira s use of foreign currency forward exchange contracts forward contracts 
the objective in managing exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates is to reduce volatility on earnings and cash flows associated with these changes 
currency exposures include third party and inter company payables and receivables  and intercompany loans where the asset or liability is denominated in a currency other than the functional currency of the entity 
forward contract gains and losses on these exposures substantially offset the remeasurement of the related asset or liability  and both are included in other income  net 
in addition  currency exposures exist for certain subsidiaries for anticipated intercompany purchases  firm commitments  and third party forecasted transactions expected to be denominated in a 
table of contents foreign currency due to changes in foreign exchange rates 
forward contract gains and losses related to such exposures are also included in other income  net during the term of the forward contract  as they are not formally designated as hedges under sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
net forward contract income expense for the years ended december   and was million  million and million  respectively  and is included in other income  net in the consolidated statements of income 
the carrying value and fair value of forward contracts was a net payable of million and million as of december  and  respectively 
interest rate sensitive financial instruments hospira s primary interest rate exposures relate to cash and cash equivalents  and fixed and variable rate debt 
the objective in managing exposure to changes in interest rates is to reduce volatility on earnings and cash flows associated with these changes 
hospira s investment portfolio of million at december  consists of cash and cash equivalents  equity investments in affiliated companies  and cost investments 
for marketable securities  any gains or losses will not be recognized in hospira s statements of income until the investment is sold or if there is a reduction in fair value that is determined to be an other than temporary impairment 
the carrying value of the investment portfolio approximates fair market value at december  and the value at maturity  as the majority of investments consist of securities with maturities of less than three months 
because hospira s investments consist principally of cash and cash equivalents  a hypothetical one percentage point increase decrease in interest rates  based on average cash and cash equivalents during the year  would increase decrease interest income by approximately million 
hospira has a revolver that allows borrowings up to million for working capital and other requirements 
the revolver allows hospira to borrow funds at variable interest rates as short term cash needs dictate 
the amount of available borrowings under the revolver may be increased to a maximum of million  and the term may be increased for up to two additional years  under certain circumstances 
as of december   hospira had no amounts outstanding under the revolver 
in conjunction with the acquisition of mayne pharma  on march   hospira issued million in principal amount of floating rate notes due in that bear interest at a three month libor plus basis points 
a hypothetical one percentage point increase decrease in interest rates would increase decrease interest expense by million
