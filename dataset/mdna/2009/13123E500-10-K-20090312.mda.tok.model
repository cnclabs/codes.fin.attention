item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview of results we are the market and technology leader in sales performance management spm software solutions designed to align internal sales resources and distribution channels with corporate strategy 
our software enhances core processes in sales management  such as the structuring of sales territories  the management of sales force talent  the establishment of sales targets and the creation and execution of sales incentive plans 
using our spm software solutions  companies can tailor these core processes to further their strategic objectives  including coordinating sales efforts with long range strategies regarding sales and margin targets  growth initiatives  sales force talent development  territory expansion and market penetration 
our customers can also use our spm solutions to address more tactical objectives  such as successful new product launches and effective cross selling strategies 
leading companies worldwide in the financial services  insurance  communications  high technology  
table of contents life sciences and retail industries rely on our solutions for their sales performance management and incentive compensation needs 
our spm solutions can be purchased and delivered as either an on demand service or an on premise software solution 
our on demand service allows customers to use our software products through a web interface rather than purchase computer equipment and install our software at their locations  and we believe the benefits of this deployment method will make our on demand offering our most popular product choice 
we sell our products both directly through our sales force and in conjunction with our strategic partners 
we also offer professional services  including configuration  integration and training  generally on a time and materials basis 
we generate recurring subscription and support revenues from our on demand service and from support and maintenance agreements associated with our product licenses  both of which are recognized ratably over the term of the agreement 
revenue growth our total revenues increased in by to a record million compared to million in these revenues were led by a increase in our recurring revenues 
the increase in recurring revenues reflects the shift in business focus and strategy to emphasize our on demand offering 
recurring revenues accounted for of our total revenues in compared to in during the year we added million in net new annual contract revenue net acv to bring our total on demand acv to million 
the total number of payees being paid through our on demand solution as of december  was  despite the shift to more recurring revenues generated from our on demand offering  we continue to see a mix of how companies want to deploy our solutions 
as such  we will continue to offer and support the traditional software license model that some of our customers still prefer 
the shift in our sales toward on demand services has also affected the growth in our professional services revenues  as the average implementation time for an on demand arrangement is less than half of the average implementation time for an on premise arrangement 
revenues from our on demand offering are more predictable and allow us to better align our cost structure 
cost control during the year we made substantial progress on streamlining our cost model 
these efforts led to improved margins for our on demand offering and a decrease in operating expenses 
for the year  our on demand margin improved to 
this represents substantial improvement from on demand margins of negative recorded in our on demand margins will likely fluctuate from period to period depending upon the nature of services subscribed for and our ongoing investment in new service offerings 
operating expenses decreased by for compared to the decrease in operating expenses in as compared to was net of increases of million in stock based compensation and million in restructuring costs 
the overall decrease was the result of cost saving actions taken in the fourth quarter of  the first quarter of and the fourth quarter of we completed reductions in workforce and recorded charges of approximately million in and million in in connection with severance and termination related costs  most of which were severance related cash expenditures 
we realized cost savings during from the reductions in force  and we expect to realize additional savings in related to these actions 
this cost savings program was substantially completed in the fourth quarter of and will be fully completed in the early part of as of december   accrued restructuring charges were million 
the combined positive effect of higher revenues and lower costs was instrumental in our ability to generate million in cash from operations for the year 
this was a record achievement for the company and represents an improvement of million from the million of cash we used in operations in other business highlights on november   our board of directors authorized a one year program for the repurchase of up to million of our outstanding common stock 
on october   our board of directors re authorized the program for the repurchase of up to million of our outstanding common stock  which represented the unused balance of the program initially approved in during under these repurchase programs we executed the 
table of contents repurchase of  shares for a total cost of approximately million 
the repurchased shares have been constructively retired 
we have adopted a rule b plan that allows us to repurchase shares of our common stock under the repurchase program at times when we would not ordinarily be in the market because of our trading policies 
see note subsequent events for additional discussion 
on january   we completed the acquisition of compensation technologies ct  a leading provider of services for planning  implementing  and supporting incentive compensation processes and tools 
under the terms of the agreement  we paid the former owners of ct million initially and paid an additional final payment of million upon the successful completion of an agreed milestone on december  in addition  we incurred acquisition related transaction costs of million 
the combination of ct s compensation management services cms and callidus on demand offerings provides our customers with a fully managed sales incentive compensation program that includes plan analysis  modeling and design support  plan deployment  reporting  analytics  and ongoing administration 
the acquisition augmented our portfolio of services offerings while at the same time boosted our on demand business 
in connection with the acquisition  we recorded intangible assets of million  which will be amortized to cost of services revenues and sales and marketing expense over their useful lives of one to four years  million of goodwill  which includes the contingent payment of million and net tangible assets of million 
the goodwill will not be amortized but instead will be tested for impairment at least annually 
see note acquisition for further discussion 
challenges and risks in response to market demand  we shifted our primary business focus from the sale of perpetual licenses for our products to the provision of our software as a service through our on demand offering 
our on demand model provides more predictable quarterly revenues 
during we were able to sustain positive margins on this service offering for the first time since launching the offering in however  over recent quarters we have experienced slower growth in our net acv for on demand services than we had previously 
if we are unable to significantly grow our on demand business or continue to provide our on demand services on a consistently profitable basis in the future  our business and operating results may be materially and adversely affected 
from a business perspective  we have a number of sales opportunities in process and additional opportunities coming from our sales pipeline  however  we continue to experience wide variances in the timing and size of our on demand and license transactions and the timing of revenue recognition resulting from greater flexibility in contract terms 
we believe one of our major remaining challenges is increasing prospective customers prioritization of purchasing our products and services over competing it projects 
to address this challenge  we have set goals that include expanding our sales efforts  promoting our on demand services  and continuing to develop new products and enhancements to our truecomp suite of products 
historically  a substantial portion of our revenues have been derived from sales of our products and services to customers in the financial and insurance industries 
the recent substantial disruptions in these industries may result in these customers deferring or cancelling future planned expenditures on our products and services 
further  consolidations and business failures in these industries could result in substantially reduced demand for our products and services 
in addition  the disruptions in these industries and the concurrent international financial crisis may cause other potential customers to defer or cancel future purchases of our products and services as they seek to conserve resources in the face of economic turmoil and the drastically reduced availability of capital in the equity and debt markets 
any of these developments  or the combination of these developments  may materially and adversely affect our revenues  operating results and financial condition in future periods 
if we are unable to grow our revenues  we may be unable to achieve and sustain profitability 
in addition to these risks  our future operating performance is subject to the risks and uncertainties described in risk factors in section a of this annual report on form k 
application of critical accounting policies and use of estimates the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations which follows is based upon our consolidated financial statements prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap 
the application of gaap requires our management to make estimates that 
table of contents affect our reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and the related disclosure regarding these items 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
in many instances  we could have reasonably used different accounting estimates  and in other instances changes in the accounting estimates are reasonably likely to occur from period to period 
accordingly  actual results could differ significantly from the estimates made by our management 
to the extent that there are material differences between these estimates and actual results  our future financial statement presentation of our financial condition or results of operations will be affected 
in many cases  the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by gaap and does not require management s judgment in its application  while in other cases  management s judgment is required in selecting among available alternative accounting standards that allow different accounting treatment for similar transactions 
we believe that the accounting policies discussed below are critical to understanding our historical and future performance  as these policies relate to the more significant areas involving management s judgments and estimates 
our management has reviewed these critical accounting policies  our use of estimates and the related disclosures with our audit committee 
revenue recognition we generate revenues by licensing software  providing related software support  and providing our software application as a service through our on demand subscription offering and providing related professional services to our customers 
we present revenue net of sales taxes and any similar assessments 
we recognize revenues in accordance with accounting standards for software and service companies 
we will not recognize revenue until persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the fee is fixed or determinable and collection is deemed probable 
we evaluate each of these criteria as follows evidence of an arrangement 
we consider a non cancelable agreement signed by us and the customer to be evidence of an arrangement 
delivery 
in on demand arrangements  we consider delivery to have occurred as the service is provided to the customer 
in perpetual licensing arrangements  we consider delivery to have occurred when media containing the licensed programs is provided to a common carrier  or in the case of electronic delivery  the customer is given access to the licensed programs 
our typical end user license agreement does not include customer acceptance provisions 
fixed or determinable fee 
we consider the fee to be fixed or determinable unless the fee is subject to refund or adjustment or is not payable within our standard payment terms 
we consider payment terms greater than days to be beyond our customary payment terms 
if the fee is not fixed or determinable  we recognize the revenue as amounts become due and payable 
in arrangements where the customer is obligated to pay at least of the license amount within normal payment terms and the remaining is to be paid within a year from the contract effective date  we will recognize the license revenue for the entire arrangement upon delivery assuming all other revenue recognition criteria have been met 
this policy is effective as long as we continue to maintain a history of providing similar terms to customers and collecting from those customers without providing any contractual concessions 
collection is deemed probable 
we conduct a credit review for all significant transactions at the time of the arrangement to determine the creditworthiness of the customer 
collection is deemed probable if we expect that the customer will be able to pay amounts under the arrangement as payments become due 
if we determine that collection is not probable  we defer the recognition of revenue until cash collection 
recurring revenue recurring revenues include on demand revenues and maintenance revenues 
on demand revenues are principally derived from technical operation fees earned through our on demand services offering of our on demand truecomp suite  as well as revenues generated from business operations services 
maintenance revenues are derived from maintaining  supporting and providing periodic updates for our software 
customers that own 
table of contents perpetual licenses can receive the benefits of upgrades  updates  and support from either subscribing to our on demand services or our maintenance services 
on demand revenue 
in arrangements where we provide our software application as a service  we considered emerging issues task force issue no 
eitf  application of aicpa statement of position to arrangements that include the right to use software stored on another entity s hardware and eitf no 
eitf  applicability of aicpa statement of position to non software deliverables in an arrangement containing more than incidental software  and concluded that these transactions are considered service arrangements and fall outside of the scope of sop accordingly  we follow the provisions of sec staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition and emerging issues task force issue no 
eitf  revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables 
customers will typically prepay for our on demand services  which amounts we will defer and recognize ratably over the non cancelable term of the customer contract 
in addition to the on demand services  these arrangements may also include implementation and configuration services  which are billed on a time and materials basis and recognized as revenues as the services are performed 
in determining whether the consulting services can be accounted for separately from subscription and support revenues  we consider the following factors for each consulting agreement availability of the consulting services from other vendors  whether objective and reliable evidence of fair value exists for the undelivered elements  the nature of the consulting services  the timing of when the consulting contract is signed in comparison to the on demand service contract and the contractual dependence of the consulting work to the on demand service 
for those arrangements where the elements qualify for separate units of accounting  the on demand revenues are recognized ratably over the contract term  which is typically to months  beginning on the service commencement date 
implementation and configuration services  when sold with the on demand offering  are recognized as the services are rendered for time and material contracts  and are recognized utilizing the proportional performance method of accounting for fixed price contracts 
for arrangements with multiple deliverables  we allocate the total contractual arrangement to the separate units of accounting based on their relative fair values  as determined by the fair value of the undelivered and delivered items when sold separately 
if consulting services for implementation and configuration associated with an on demand arrangement does not qualify as a separate unit of accounting  we will recognize the revenue from implementation and configuration services ratably over the remaining non cancelable term of the subscription contract once the implementation is complete 
in addition  we will defer the direct costs of the implementation and configuration services and amortize those costs over the same time period as the related revenue is recognized 
the deferred costs on our consolidated balance sheets for these consulting arrangements totaled million and million at december  and december   respectively 
as of december  and  million and million  respectively  of the deferred costs are included in prepaid and other current assets  with the remaining amount included in deposits and other assets in the consolidated balance sheets 
included in the deferred costs for on demand arrangements is the deferral of commission payments to our direct sales force  which we amortize over the non cancelable term of the contract as the related revenue is recognized 
the commission payments are a direct and incremental cost of the revenue arrangements 
the deferral of commission expenditures related to our on demand product offerings was million and million at december  and december   respectively 
maintenance revenue 
under perpetual software license arrangements  a customer typically pre pays maintenance for the first twelve months  and the related revenues are deferred and recognized ratably over the term of the initial maintenance contract 
maintenance is renewable by the customer on an annual basis thereafter 
rates for maintenance  including subsequent renewal rates  are typically established based upon a specified percentage of net license fees as set forth in the arrangement 
services revenue professional service revenue 
professional service revenues primarily consist of integration services related to the installation and configuration of our products as well as training 
our installation and configuration services do not involve customization to  or development of  the underlying software code 
generally  our professional services arrangements are on a time and materials basis 
reimbursements  including those related to travel and out 
table of contents of pocket expenses  are included in services revenues  and an equivalent amount of reimbursable expenses is included in cost of services revenues 
for professional service arrangements with a fixed fee  we recognize revenue utilizing the proportional performance method of accounting 
we estimate the proportional performance on fixed fee contracts on a monthly basis utilizing hours incurred to date as a percentage of total estimated hours to complete the project 
if we do not have a sufficient basis to measure progress toward completion  revenue is recognized upon completion of performance 
to the extent we enter into a fixed fee services contract  a loss will be recognized any time the total estimated project cost exceeds project revenues 
in certain arrangements  we have provided for unique acceptance criteria associated with the delivery of consulting services 
in these instances  we have recognized revenue in accordance with the provisions of sab to the extent there is contingent revenue in these arrangements  we will defer the revenue until the contingency has lapsed 
license revenue perpetual licensing 
our perpetual software license arrangements typically include i an end user license fee paid in exchange for the use of our products  generally based on a specified number of payees  and ii a maintenance arrangement that provides for technical support and product updates  generally over renewable twelve month periods 
if we are selected to provide integration and configuration services  then the software arrangement will also include professional services  generally priced on a time and materials basis 
depending upon the elements in the arrangement and the terms of the related agreement  we recognize license revenues under either the residual or the contract accounting method 
certain arrangements result in the payment of customer referral fees to third parties that resell our software products 
in these arrangements  license revenues are recorded  net of such referral fees  at the time the software license has been delivered to a third party reseller and an end user customer has been identified 
residual method 
perpetual license fees are recognized upon delivery whether licenses are sold separately from or together with integration and configuration services  provided that i the criteria described above have been met  ii payment of the license fees is not dependent upon performance of the integration and configuration services  and iii the services are not otherwise essential to the functionality of the software 
we recognize these license revenues using the residual method pursuant to the requirements of statement of position sop  software revenue recognition  as amended by sop  software revenue recognition with respect to certain transactions 
under the residual method  revenues are recognized when vendor specific objective evidence of fair value exists for all of the undelivered elements in the arrangement ie  professional services and maintenance  but does not exist for one or more of the delivered elements in the arrangement ie  the software product 
each license arrangement requires careful analysis to ensure that all of the individual elements in the license transaction have been identified  along with the fair value of each undelivered element 
we allocate revenue to each undelivered element based on its fair value  with the fair value determined by the price charged when that element is sold separately 
for a certain class of transactions  the fair value of the maintenance portion of our arrangements is based on substantive stated renewal rates rather than stand alone sales 
the fair value of the professional services portion of the arrangement is based on the hourly rates that we charge for these services when sold independently from a software license 
if evidence of fair value cannot be established for the undelivered elements of a license agreement  the entire amount of revenue from the arrangement is deferred until evidence of fair value can be established  or until the items for which evidence of fair value cannot be established are delivered 
if the only undelivered element is maintenance  then the entire amount of revenue is recognized over the maintenance delivery period 
contract accounting method 
for arrangements where services are considered essential to the functionality of the software  such as where the payment of the license fees is dependent upon performance of the services  both the license and services revenues are recognized in accordance with the provisions of sop  accounting for performance of construction type and certain production type contracts sop 
we generally use the percentage of completion method because we are able to make reasonably dependable estimates relative to contract costs and the extent of progress toward completion 
however  if we cannot make reasonably dependable estimates  
table of contents we use the completed contract method 
if total cost estimates exceed revenues  we accrue for the estimated loss on the arrangement at the time such determination is made 
in certain arrangements  we have provided for unique acceptance criteria associated with the delivery of consulting services 
in these instances  we have recognized revenue in accordance with the provisions of sop to the extent there is contingent revenue in these arrangements  we measure the level of profit that is expected based on the non contingent revenue and the total expected project costs 
if we are assured of a certain level of profit excluding the contingent revenue  we recognize the non contingent revenue on a percentage of completion basis and we recognize the contingent revenue upon final acceptance 
allowance for doubtful accounts and service remediation reserve we must make estimates of the uncollectibility of accounts receivable 
we record an increase in the allowance for doubtful accounts when the prospect of collecting a specific account receivable becomes doubtful 
management specifically analyzes accounts receivable and historical bad debt experience  customer creditworthiness  current economic trends  international situations such as currency devaluation and changes in our customer payment history when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts 
should any of these factors change  the estimates made by management will also change  which could affect the level of our future provision for doubtful accounts 
specifically  if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  affecting their ability to make payments  an additional provision for doubtful accounts may be required and such provision may be material 
the allowance for doubtful accounts  which is netted against accounts receivable on our consolidated balance sheets  totaled approximately  and  at december  and december   respectively 
the increase in allowance for doubtful accounts from to was primarily attributable to one customer that recently filed for bankruptcy  which resulted in approximately  of bad debt expense 
the remaining increase was comprised of smaller amounts reserved in the normal course of our analysis of uncollectible amounts 
we generally warrant that our services will be performed in accordance with the criteria agreed upon in a statement of work  which we generally execute with each applicable customer prior to commencing work 
should these services not be performed in accordance with the agreed upon criteria  we typically provide remediation services until such time as the criteria are met 
management must use judgments and make estimates of service remediation reserves related to potential future requirements to provide remediation services in connection with current period service revenues 
when providing for service remediation reserves  we analyze historical experience of actual remediation service claims as well as current information on remediation service requests as they are the primary indicators for estimating future service claims 
material differences may result in the amount and timing of our revenues if  for any period  actual remediation claims differ from management s judgments or estimates 
the service remediation reserve balance  which is netted against accounts receivable on our consolidated balance sheets  was approximately  and  at december  and december   respectively 
stock based compensation effective january   we began recording stock based compensation expense associated with stock options and other forms of equity compensation in accordance with fasb statement no 
revised  share based payment sfas r  as interpreted by sec staff accounting bulletin no 
sab  as amended by sec staff accounting bulletin no 
sab 
sfas r requires the recognition of the fair value of stock based compensation in net income 
the application of these principles may be subject to further interpretation and refinement over time 
there are significant differences among valuation models  and there is a possibility that we will adopt different valuation models in the future 
this may result in a lack of consistency in future periods and materially affect the fair value estimate of stock based payments 
it may also result in a lack of comparability with other companies that use different models  methods and assumptions 
refer to note stock based compensation in our 
table of contents notes to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this form k for further discussion of our adoption of sfas r 
income taxes we are subject to income taxes in both the united states and foreign jurisdictions and we use estimates in determining our provision for income taxes 
this process involves estimating actual current tax liabilities together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are recorded on our consolidated balance sheets 
our deferred tax assets consist primarily of net operating loss carry forwards 
we assess the likelihood that deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income  and a valuation allowance is recognized if it is more likely than not that some portion of the deferred tax assets will not be recognized 
with the exception of the net deferred tax assets of one of our foreign subsidiaries  we maintained a full valuation allowance against our net deferred tax assets at december  while we have considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for a valuation allowance  in the event we were to determine that we would be able to realize our deferred tax assets in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax assets would increase net income in the period such determination was made 
we also use estimates in determining income tax positions under financial interpretation fin no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes fin 
although we believe that our tax estimates are reasonable  the ultimate tax determination involves significant judgment and is subject to audit by tax authorities in the ordinary course of business 
goodwill and intangible assets in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  we review our goodwill for impairment annually  or more frequently  if facts and circumstances warrant a review 
in order to estimate the fair value of goodwill  we estimate future revenue  consider market factors and estimate our future cash flows 
we evaluate goodwill for impairment by comparing the carrying amount of the asset group  including the associated goodwill  to its estimated undiscounted future cash flows 
intangible assets with finite lives are amortized over their estimated useful lives in accordance with sfas our intangible assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives of one to five years 
generally  amortization is based on the pattern in which the economic benefits of the intangible asset will be consumed 
based on our assumptions  judgments and estimates  we determine whether we need to record an impairment charge to reduce the value of the asset carried on our consolidated balance sheet to its estimated fair value 
assumptions  judgments and estimates about future values are complex and often subjective 
they can be affected by a variety of factors  including external factors such as industry and economic trends  and internal factors such as changes in our business strategy or internal forecasts 
although we believe the assumptions  judgments and estimates we have made in the past have been reasonable and appropriate  different assumptions  judgments and estimates could materially affect our reported financial results 
impairment of long lived assets we assess impairment of our long lived assets in accordance with the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
sfas no 
requires long lived assets  such as property and equipment and purchased intangibles subject to amortization  to be reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset group may not be recoverable 
recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset group to estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset group 
if the carrying amount of an asset group exceeds its estimated future cash flows  an impairment charge is recognized equal to the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset group exceeds the fair value of the asset group 
upon classification of long lived assets as held for sale  such assets are measured at the lower of their carrying amount or fair value less cost to sell and we cease further depreciation or amortization 
investments we consider all highly liquid instruments with an original maturity on the date of purchase of three months or less to be cash equivalents 
cash equivalents as of december  and consisted of money market funds 
table of contents and corporate notes and obligations 
we determine the appropriate classification of investment securities at the time of purchase and re evaluate such designation as of each balance sheet date 
as of december  and  all investment securities except for auction rate securities are designated as available for sale 
we consider all investments that are available for sale that have a maturity date longer than three months to be short term investments  including those investments with a maturity date of longer than one year that are highly liquid and for which we do not have a positive intent to hold to maturity 
these securities are carried at estimated fair value based on quoted market prices or observable and unobservable inputs  with the unrealized gains losses reported as a separate component of stockholders equity  which was the case for our corporate notes and obligations 
we periodically review the realizable value of our investments in marketable securities 
when assessing marketable securities for other than temporary declines in value  we consider such factors as the length of time and extent to which fair value has been less than the cost basis  the market outlook in general and our intent and ability to hold the investment for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in market value 
if an other than temporary impairment of the investments is deemed to exist  as was the case with our auction rate securities  the carrying value of the investment would be written down to its estimated fair value and the other than temporary impairment recorded to interest and other income  net on the consolidated statement of operations 
we recorded an other than temporary impairment of million related to our auction rate securities at december  all of the auction rate securities carry aaa credit ratings from one or more of the major credit rating agencies 
these investments are education municipal securities substantially collateralized by the us department of education federal family education loan program guarantee 
none of the auction rate securities held by us are mortgage backed debt obligations 
liquidity for these securities is typically provided by an auction process that resets the applicable interest rate at pre determined intervals  usually every days 
recent failed auctions resulted in a lack of liquidity in the securities  but are not an indication of an increased credit risk or a reduction in the underlying collateral 
we will not be able to liquidate any of the remaining auction rate securities until a future auction is successful  a buyer is found outside of the auction process  the notes are redeemed  or the securities are sold back to the financial institutions 
these investments are on deposit with major financial institutions 
we will continue to evaluate the fair value of our investments in auction rate securities for additional other than temporary impairments if further declines in fair value occur  in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities  staff accounting bulletin topic  miscellaneous accounting and financial accounting standards board staff position sfas and  the meaning of other than temporary impairment and its application to certain investments 
valuation of investments and put option our corporate notes and obligations were valued using a pricing matrix from a reputable pricing service in order to calculate the amortized cost of the security level 
we validate the estimated fair value received from the reputable pricing service on a quarterly basis 
our auction rate securities are unable to be valued in this manner for the following reasons 
since early  the auction process used to determine the interest rates for the auction rate securities has failed due to a lack of sufficient buyers in the market 
as a result  investors have recently received the stated maximum interest rate  which is determined based on the applicable average day us treasury rate plus a premium according to provisions outlined in each security s agreement 
the stated maximum interest rate was determined to be below current market rates for publicly traded debt similar to the auction rate securities 
for the purposes of our valuation  the maximum interest rates for the auction rate securities were expected to remain below market for approximately years 
the estimated time to liquidity of years was based on i expectations from industry brokers for liquidity in the market and ii the period over which financial institutions and other broker dealers have agreed to redeem certain auction rate securities at par value 
given the expiration period associated with the put option rights and the expectation of a more liquid auction rate securities market in approximately years  we forecasted the below market interest payments received by the security holder over the approximate years following the valuation date utilizing the income approach 
since the auction rate securities were illiquid and  as of the valuation date brokers believed that these securities could not be sold at par value until the mid timeframe approximately years following the valuation date  
table of contents as described above  it was necessary to apply an adjustment for lack of liquidity to the value obtained from the income approach 
for the purpose of this analysis  we utilized a put option model to calculate an applicable adjustment for lack of liquidity and applied this adjustment to the estimated fair value calculated from the income approach 
we hold auction rate securities at two large financial institutions 
we recorded an other than temporary impairment on the auction rate securities being held at one financial institution given the length of time the fair value has been less than the cost basis and our inability to recover the par value in the near term 
we recorded an other than temporary impairment and a partially offsetting put option gain on the auction rate securities being held at the other financial institution due to the agreement we have to sell our auction rate securities back to the financial institution at par value at a later date as discussed below 
in connection with the auction rate securities  in october  one financial institution where we hold auction rate securities issued certain put option rights to us  which entitle us to sell our auction rate securities to the financial institution for a price equal to the par value plus any accrued and unpaid interest 
these rights to sell the securities are exercisable at any time during the period june  to july   after which the rights will expire 
the financial institution granted us the option to receive a no net cost loan of up to of the market value as determined by the financial institution of the auction rate securities 
this loan would be structured such that our interest payments to the financial institution would be equivalent to the interest received from the auction rate securities 
these options are designed to create liquidity for the auction rate securities and  for the purpose of this analysis  we have assumed that a market participant would exercise the put option as soon as possible  on or around june   and exercise the no net cost loan option immediately 
the value associated with the put option and no net cost loan option lies in i the ability to receive of the market value now and then sell the securities in approximately years to receive the remaining portion of the par value  thereby creating liquidity before the auction rate security market is expected to become liquid and ii the avoidance of receiving a below market coupon rate while the security is illiquid and auctions are failing 
given these two factors  we valued the auction rate securities both i on a standalone basis absent any put rights and ii assuming we exercise the put option approximately years from the valuation date 
the fair value of the put option represents the difference between these two values  since the put option allows for the acceleration of liquidity and the avoidance of a below market coupon rate over the two year time period 
based on the valuation on our auction rate securities  we recorded an other than temporary impairment of million at december  along with a corresponding put option gain of million for the future fair value to be received 
our auction rate securities were recorded as long term investments and the asset associated with the put option was recorded as deposits and other assets on the consolidated balance sheet as of december  recent accounting pronouncements see note of our notes to consolidated financial statements for information regarding the effect of new accounting pronouncements on our financial statements

recurring revenues increased by million  or  in compared to the increase is primarily the result of an increase of million in on demand subscription revenues in this increase is attributable to the increase in the number of on demand customers for which we recognized revenue in compared to support revenues for maintenance services increased by million in compared to  which was a result of license sales to new customers and continued renewal of maintenance support by our existing customers 
services revenues 
services revenues remained essentially flat in as compared to  increasing by million or 
included in services revenues for were one time fees aggregating approximately million paid to us by two of our customers 
these customers were acquired by another company  and as a result stated their intentions to terminate our services 
excluding these one time fees  services revenues decreased in as compared to the decrease was due to a number of factors  including deferrals of services and other revenues as a result of project delays and the completion of a number of projects during that were not immediately replaced 
over time  we expect services revenue to decline as a percentage of overall revenues as a result of our focus on our on demand business  as on demand implementations are generally shorter compared to on premise implementations 

table of contents license revenues 
license revenues decreased million  or  in compared to the decrease was attributable to the shift of our primary business focus from the sale of perpetual licenses for our products to the provision of our software as a service through our on demand offering 
our average license revenue per transaction for was million compared to million in we had three transactions in with a license value over million compared to eight such transactions in we expect our license revenues to continue to fluctuate from quarter to quarter in the near term since we generally complete a relatively small number of transactions in a quarter and the revenue on those software license sales can vary widely 
over time we expect license revenues to comprise a smaller percentage of total revenues as we continue to shift our emphasis towards our saas business model 
cost of revenues and gross margin cost of recurring revenues 
cost of recurring revenues increased by million or in compared to the increase was due to the investment we made to grow our on demand business as well as the increase in related recurring revenues discussed above 
as a percentage of related revenues  cost of recurring revenues improved to in compared to in this improvement is primarily attributable to economies of scale achieved as a result of the increase in the number of on demand customers for which we recognized revenue during as discussed above 
cost of services revenues 
cost of services revenues increased by million or in compared to the increase was attributable to a loss on contract of million related to a customer dispute and acquisition related amortization costs of million  partially offset by a decrease in subcontractor costs 
cost of license revenues 
cost of license revenues increased by  or in compared to the increase was primarily the result of amortization expense for additional purchases of intangible assets comprised of third party software licenses used in our products 
gross margin 
our overall gross margin decreased to in from in the decrease in our gross margin is primarily attributable to the shift in revenue mix away from higher margin license revenues  which represented of our total revenues in compared to in the effect of the revenue mix shift was partially offset by the improvement in our gross margin for recurring revenues 
recurring gross margin improved from in to in as we continued to achieve operational scale in our on demand business 
services gross margin decreased from in to in as a result of the loss related to a customer dispute  acquisition related amortization costs and the increase in stock based compensation 
license gross margin decreased from in to in due to increased amortization expense from additional purchases of intangible assets 
in the future  we expect our gross margins to fluctuate depending primarily on the mix of recurring and services revenues versus license revenues

table of contents driven by a decrease in advertising expenses of million 
the decrease was partially offset by an increase in acquisition related amortization costs of million and an increase in stock based compensation as discussed below 
the reduction in commission expense is  in part  reflective of the shift our business focus to our on demand offering and away from the license model 
commission expenses associated with on demand arrangements are deferred and then amortized over the non cancelable term of the contract as the related revenue is recognized  whereas commission expenses related to license sales are incurred in the period the transaction occurs 
we expect sales and marketing expenses to decrease in as a result of our cost savings action 
research and development 
research and development expenses decreased million  or  for compared to the decrease was primarily due to decreases in personnel costs of million resulting from headcount reductions  partially offset by an increase in professional fees of million for costs related to our new offshore resource center

general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses increased million  or  for compared to the increase was primarily due to an increase in bad debt expense related to one of our customers that recently filed for bankruptcy

cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle was for and  for  which resulted from the change in accounting principle from apb no 
to sfas r 
the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle resulted from the requirement of sfas r to reduce the amount of stock based compensation expense by an estimated forfeiture rate or  in other words  the estimated number of shares that are not expected to vest as a result of an employee terminating prior to becoming fully vested in an award 
prior to the adoption of sfas r  we did not reduce stock based compensation expense based on an estimated forfeiture rate but rather recorded an adjustment to stock based compensation as actual forfeitures occurred 
the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle is generally one time in nature and not expected to occur as part of our normal business on a regular basis

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk 
market risk represents the risk of loss that may impact our financial position due to adverse changes in financial market prices and rates 
our market risk exposure is also a result of fluctuations in interest rates and foreign exchange rates 
see investments under application of critical accounting policies and use of estimates and note investments of our notes to consolidated financial statements for information regarding our auction rate securities 
we do not hold or issue financial instruments for trading purposes  and we invest in investment grade securities 
we limit our exposure to interest rate and credit risk by establishing and monitoring clear policies and guidelines for our investment portfolios  which is approved by our board of directors 
the guidelines also establish credit quality standards  limits on exposure to any one security issue  limits on exposure to any one issuer and limits on exposure to the type of instrument 

table of contents financial instruments that potentially subject us to market risk are short term investments  long term investments  repurchase agreements and trade receivables 
we mitigate market risk by monitoring ratings  credit spreads and potential downgrades for all bank counterparties on at least a quarterly basis 
based on our on going assessment of counterparty risk  we will adjust our exposure to various counterparties 
interest rate risk 
we invest our cash in a variety of financial instruments  consisting primarily of investments in money market accounts  high quality corporate debt obligations  united states government obligations and auction rate securities 
investments in both fixed rate and floating rate interest earning instruments carry a degree of interest rate risk 
the fair market value of fixed rate securities may be adversely affected by a rise in interest rates  while floating rate securities  which typically have a shorter duration  may produce less income than expected if interest rates fall 
due in part to these factors  our investment income may decrease in the future due to changes in interest rates 
at december   the average maturity of our investments was approximately one month  and all investment securities other than auction rate securities had maturities of less than months 
the following table presents certain information about our financial instruments except for auction rate securities at december  that are sensitive to changes in interest rates in thousands  except for interest rates expected maturity total year more than principal total or less year amount fair value available for sale securities weighted average interest rate our exposure to market risk also relates to the increase or decrease in the amount of interest expense we must pay on our outstanding debt instruments 
as of december   we had no outstanding indebtedness for borrowed money 
therefore  we currently have no exposure to market risk related to debt instruments 
to the extent we enter into or issue debt instruments in the future  we will have interest rate market risk 
foreign currency exchange risk 
our revenues and our expenses  except those related to our united kingdom  germany  canada and australia operations  are generally denominated in united states dollars 
for  approximately of our total revenue was denominated in foreign currency 
our exchange risks and foreign exchange losses have been minimal to date 
we expect to continue to transact a majority of our business in united states dollars 
occasionally  we may enter into forward exchange contracts to reduce our exposure to currency fluctuations on our foreign currency transactions 
the objective of these contracts is to minimize the impact of foreign currency exchange rate movements on our operating results 
we do not use these contracts for speculative or trading purposes 
as of december   we had no foreign currency forward exchange contracts 
we had no unrealized gains and losses related to forward exchange contracts for we do not anticipate any material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows resulting from the use of these instruments in the immediate future 
however  we cannot provide any assurance that our foreign exchange rate contract investment strategies will be effective or that transaction losses can be minimized or forecasted accurately 
in particular  generally  we hedge only a portion of our foreign currency exchange exposure 
we cannot assure you that our hedging activities will eliminate foreign exchange rate exposure 
failure to do so could have an adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flow
