our information systems provide us with detailed  actionable information across all facets of our broad network  allowing us to quickly and effectively identify and act on growth  profitability and efficiency related initiatives 

table of contents expand our international operations 
we believe that there is significant additional demand for our products and services outside the united states and canada 
many of our multinational domestic customers are seeking distribution  integrated supply and project management solutions globally 
we follow our established customers and pursue business that we believe utilizes and extends our existing capabilities 
we believe this strategy of working through well developed customer and supplier relationships significantly reduces risk and provides the opportunity to establish profitable incremental business 
competitive strengths we believe that we are one of the largest electrical distributors and the largest provider of integrated supply services for mro goods and services in the united states 
we compete directly with national  regional and local providers of electrical and other industrial mro supplies 
competition is primarily focused on the local service area  and is generally based on product line breadth  product availability  service capabilities and price 
another source of competition is buying groups formed by smaller distributors to increase purchasing power and provide some cooperative marketing capability 
while increased buying power may improve the competitive position of buying groups locally  we believe these groups have not been able to compete effectively with us for national account customers due to the difficulty in coordinating a diverse ownership group 
although certain internet based procurement service companies  auction businesses and trade exchanges remain in the marketplace  the impact on our business from these potential competitors has been minimal to date 
we believe the following strengths are central to the successful execution of our business strategy market leadership 
our ability to manage large construction projects  complex multi site plant maintenance programs  procurement projects that require special sourcing  technical advice  logistical support and locally based service has enabled us to establish leadership positions in our principal markets 
we have utilized these skills to generate significant revenues in industries with intensive use of electrical and mro products  including electrical contracting  utilities  oem and process manufacturing and other commercial  institutional and governmental entities 
we also have extended our position within these industries to expand our customer base 
value added services 
we provide a wide range of services and procurement solutions that draw on our product knowledge  supply and logistics expertise and systems capabilities  enabling our customers with large operations and multiple locations to reduce supply chain costs  eliminate waste  enhance productivity and improve efficiency 
our geographical coverage is essential to our ability to provide these services 
we have an extensive branch network which complements our national sales and marketing activities with local customer service  product information and technical support  order fulfillment and a variety of other on site services 
broad product offering

our broad product offering and stable source of supply enables us to meet virtually all of a customer s electrical product and mro requirements 
extensive distribution network 
we are a full line distributor of electrical supplies and equipment with operations in the united states  canada  mexico  the united kingdom  nigeria  united arab emirates  singapore  australia and china 
we operate approximatley branch locations and seven distribution centers four in the united states and three in canada 
in addition to consolidations in connection with acquisitions  we occasionally open  close or consolidate existing branch locations to improve market coverage and operating efficiency 
our distribution centers add value for our branches  suppliers and customers through the combination of a broad and deep selection of inventory  online ordering  same day shipment and central order handling and fulfillment 
our distribution center network reduces the lead time and cost of supply chain activities through automated replenishment and warehouse management systems and economies of scale in purchasing  inventory management  administration and transportation 
this extensive network  which would be extremely difficult and expensive to duplicate  provides us with a distinct competitive advantage and allows us to maintain localized customer service  technical support and sales coverage  tailor branch products and services to local customer needs  and offer multi site distribution capabilities to large customers and national accounts 

table of contents low cost operator

item a 
risk factors 
the following factors  among others  could cause our actual results to differ materially from the forward looking statements we make 
all forward looking statements attributable to us or persons working on our behalf are expressly qualified by the following cautionary statements our outstanding indebtedness requires debt service commitments that could adversely affect our ability to fulfill our obligations and could limit our growth and impose restrictions on our business 
as of december   we had billion of consolidated indebtedness  including million in aggregate principal amount of senior subordinated notes due the notes  million in aggregate principal amount of convertible senior debentures due the debentures  and million in aggregate principal amount of convertible senior debentures due the debentures and together with the debentures  the debentures  and stockholders equity of million 
we and our subsidiaries may undertake additional borrowings in the future  subject to certain limitations contained in the instruments governing our indebtedness 
these amounts include our revolving credit facility and accounts receivable securitization facility the receivables facility  through which we sell up to million of our accounts receivable to a third party conduit 
our debt service obligations have important consequences  including but not limited to the following a substantial portion of cash flow from our operations will be dedicated to the payment of principal and interest on our indebtedness  thereby reducing the funds available for operations  future business opportunities and acquisitions and other purposes  and increasing our vulnerability to adverse general economic and industry conditions  our ability to obtain additional financing in the future may be limited  we may be hindered in our ability to adjust rapidly to changing market conditions  and we may be required to incur additional interest due to the contingent interest features of the debentures  which are embedded derivatives 
our ability to make scheduled payments of principal and interest on our debt  refinance our indebtedness  make scheduled payments on our operating leases  fund planned capital expenditures or to finance acquisitions will depend on our future performance  which  to a certain extent  is subject to economic  financial  competitive and other factors beyond our control 
there can be no assurance that our business will continue to generate sufficient cash flow from operations in the future to service our debt  make necessary capital expenditures or meet other cash needs 
if unable to do so  we may be required to refinance all or a portion of our existing debt  to sell assets or to obtain additional financing 
our receivables facility has a three year term and is subject to renewal in may there can be no assurance that available funding or any sale of assets or additional financing would be possible at the time of renewal in amounts or terms favorable to us  if at all 
over the next three years  we are obligated to repay approximately million of indebtedness  of which million is related to our receivables facility  million is related to capital leases  million is related to our mortgage credit facility  and million is related to notes payable associated with acquisitions 
see part ii  item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources 

table of contents our debt agreements contain restrictions that may limit our ability to operate our business 
our credit facilities and the indenture governing wesco distribution s senior subordinated indebtedness contain  and any of our future debt agreements may contain  certain covenant restrictions that limit our ability to operate our business  including restrictions on our ability to incur additional debt or issue guarantees  create liens  make certain investments  enter into transactions with our affiliates  sell certain assets  make capital expenditures  redeem capital stock or make other restricted payments  declare or pay dividends or make other distributions to stockholders  and merge or consolidate with any person 
our credit facilities also require us to maintain specific earnings to fixed expenses and debt to earnings ratios and to meet minimum net worth requirements 
in addition  our credit facilities contain additional affirmative and negative covenants 
our ability to comply with these covenants is dependent on our future performance  which will be subject to many factors  some of which are beyond our control  including prevailing economic conditions 
as a result of these covenants  our ability to respond to changes in business and economic conditions and to obtain additional financing  if needed  may be significantly restricted  and we may be prevented from engaging in transactions that might otherwise be beneficial to us 
in addition  our failure to comply with these covenants could result in a default under the debentures  the notes and our other debt  which could permit the holders to accelerate such debt 
if any of our debt is accelerated  we may not have sufficient funds available to repay such debt 
we may be unable to repurchase the debentures or the notes for cash when required by the holders  including following a fundamental change  as defined in the indentures governing the notes and debentures 
holders of the debentures have the right to require us to repurchase the respective debentures on specified dates or upon the occurrence of a fundamental change prior to maturity 
the occurrence of a change of control would also constitute an event of default under our credit facilities  requiring repayment of amounts outstanding thereunder  and the occurrence of a change of control would also enable holders of the notes to require wesco distribution to repurchase such notes at a price equal to of the principal amount thereof  plus accrued and unpaid interest and additional interest  if any 
any of our future debt agreements may contain similar provisions 
we may not have sufficient funds to make the required repayments and repurchases at such time or the ability to arrange necessary financing on acceptable terms 
in addition  our ability to repurchase the debentures or the notes in cash may be limited by law or the terms of other agreements relating to our debt outstanding at the time  including other credit facilities  which may limit our ability to purchase the debentures or notes for cash in certain circumstances 
if we fail to repurchase the debentures or notes in cash as required by the respective indentures  it would constitute an event of default under the applicable indenture  which  in turn  would constitute an event of default under our credit facilities and the other indenture 
provisions of the debentures could discourage an acquisition of the company by a third party 
certain provisions of the debentures could make it more difficult or more expensive for a third party to acquire us 
upon the occurrence of certain transactions constituting a fundamental change  holders of the debentures will have the right  at their option  to require us to repurchase all of their debentures or any portion of the principal amount of such debentures in integral multiples of  in addition  the occurrence of certain change of control transactions may result in the debentures becoming convertible for additional shares or result in antidilution adjustments which may have an effect of making an acquisition of us less attractive 
we may also be required to issue additional shares upon conversion or provide for conversion into the acquirer s capital stock in the event of certain fundamental changes 

table of contents adverse conditions in the global economy and disruptions of financial markets could negatively impact our results of operations 
our results of operations are affected directly by the level of business activity of our customers  which in turn is affected by global economic and market factors impacting the industries and markets that they serve 
the financial markets and overall economies in the united states and abroad are currently undergoing a period of significant uncertainty and volatility 
economic slowdowns in certain markets or an extension of the current credit crisis to additional industries  particularly in the united states  may adversely impact overall demand for our products  which could have a negative effect on our revenues 
further  there can be no assurance that any governmental responses to recent disruptions in the financial markets ultimately will stabilize the markets or increase our customers liquidity or the availability of credit to our customers 
in addition  our ability to access the capital markets may be severely restricted due to market volatility at a time when we would like  or need  to do so  which could have an impact on our flexibility to react to changing economic and business conditions 
the global financial crisis also may have an impact on our business and financial condition in ways that we currently cannot predict 
as a result  there can be no assurance that global economic and market conditions will not adversely impact our results of operations  cash flow or financial position in the future 
if the financial condition of our customers declines  our credit risk could increase 
significant contraction in the construction and industrial markets  coupled with tightened credit availability and financial institution underwriting standards  could adversely affect certain of our customers 
should one or more of our larger customers declare bankruptcy  it could adversely affect the collectibility of our accounts receivable  bad debt reserves and net income 
downturns in the electrical distribution industry have had in the past  and may in the future have  an adverse effect on our sales and profitability 
the electrical distribution industry is affected by changes in economic conditions  including national  regional and local slowdowns in construction and industrial activity  which are outside our control 
our operating results may also be adversely affected by increases in interest rates that may lead to a decline in economic activity  particularly in the construction market  while simultaneously resulting in higher interest payments under our revolving credit facility and receivables facility 
in addition  during periods of economic slowdown our credit losses could increase 
there can be no assurance that economic slowdowns  adverse economic conditions or cyclical trends in certain customer markets will not have a material adverse effect on our operating results and financial condition 
an increase in competition could decrease sales or earnings 
we operate in a highly competitive industry 
we compete directly with national  regional and local providers of electrical and other industrial mro supplies 
competition is primarily focused in the local service area and is generally based on product line breadth  product availability  service capabilities and price 
other sources of competition are buying groups formed by smaller distributors to increase purchasing power and provide some cooperative marketing capability 
some of our existing competitors have  and new market entrants may have  greater financial and marketing resources than us 
to the extent existing or future competitors seek to gain or retain market share by reducing prices  we may be required to lower our prices  thereby adversely affecting financial results 
existing or future competitors also may seek to compete with us for acquisitions  which could have the effect of increasing the price and reducing the number of suitable acquisitions 
in addition  it is possible that competitive pressures resulting from industry consolidation could affect our growth and profit margins 
loss of key suppliers or lack of product availability could decrease sales and earnings 
most of our agreements with suppliers are terminable by either party on days notice or less 
our ten largest suppliers in accounted for approximately of our purchases for the period 
our largest supplier in was eaton corporation  through its eaton electrical division  accounting for approximately of our purchases 
the loss of  or a substantial decrease in the availability of  products from any of these suppliers  or the loss of key preferred supplier agreements  could have a material adverse effect on our business 
supply interruptions could arise from shortages of raw materials  labor disputes or weather conditions affecting products or shipments  transportation disruptions  or other reasons beyond our control 
in addition  certain of our products  such as wire and conduit  are commodity price based products and may be subject to significant price fluctuations which are beyond our control 
an interruption of operations at any of our distribution centers could have a material adverse effect on the operations of branches served by the affected distribution center 
furthermore  we cannot be certain that particular products or product lines will be available to us  or available in quantities sufficient to meet customer demand 
such limited product access could cause us to be at a competitive disadvantage 

table of contents acquisitions that we may undertake would involve a number of inherent risks  any of which could cause us not to realize the benefits anticipated to result 
we have historically expanded our operations through selected acquisitions of businesses and assets 
acquisitions involve various inherent risks  such as uncertainties in assessing the value  strengths  weaknesses  contingent and other liabilities and potential profitability of acquisition candidates  the potential loss of key employees of an acquired business  the ability to achieve identified operating and financial synergies anticipated to result from an acquisition or other transaction  problems that could arise from the integration of the acquired business  and unanticipated changes in business  industry or general economic conditions that affect the assumptions underlying the acquisition or other transaction rationale 
any one or more of these factors could cause us not to realize the benefits anticipated to result from the acquisition of businesses or assets 
goodwill and intangible assets recorded as a result of our acquisitions could become impaired 
as of december   our combined goodwill and intangible assets amounted to million  net of accumulated amortization 
to the extent we do not generate sufficient cash flows to recover the net amount of any investments in goodwill and other intangible assets recorded  the investment could be considered impaired and subject to write off 
we expect to record further goodwill and other intangible assets as a result of future acquisitions we may complete 
future amortization of such other intangible assets or impairments  if any  of goodwill or intangible assets would adversely affect our results of operations in any given period 
a disruption of our information systems could increase expenses  decrease sales or reduce earnings 
a serious disruption of our information systems could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 
our computer systems are an integral part of our business and growth strategies 
we depend on our information systems to process orders  manage inventory and accounts receivable collections  purchase products  ship products to our customers on a timely basis  maintain cost effective operations and provide superior service to our customers 
our business may be harmed by required compliance with anti terrorism measures and regulations 
following the terrorist attacks on the united states  a number of federal  state and local authorities have implemented various security measures  including checkpoints and travel restrictions on large trucks  such as the ones that we and our suppliers use 
if security measures disrupt or impede the timing of our suppliers deliveries of the product inventory we need or our deliveries of our product to our customers  we may not be able to meet the needs of our customers or may incur additional expenses to do so 
there may be future dilution of our common stock 
to the extent options to purchase common stock under our stock option plans are exercised  holders of our common stock will incur dilution 
additionally  our debentures include contingent conversion price provisions and options for settlement in shares  which would increase dilution to our stockholders 
there is a risk that the market value of our common stock may decline 
stock markets have experienced significant price and trading volume fluctuations  and the market prices of companies in our industry have been volatile 
in recent months  volatility and disruption have reached unprecedented levels

company overview in  we expanded and strengthened our organization and talent base  completed an acquisition  and executed new initiatives to reduce costs 
our financial results reflect sales growth in our served markets  along with the positive impact of higher commodity prices  favorable exchange rates  hurricane restoration activity and the acquisitions completed in the latter half of additionally  in january we completed a transaction in which we divested of our ladd operations resulting in a joint venture in which we own a interest 
sales increased million or over the prior year 
last year s comparable period included sales of million related to the ladd operations 
higher commodity prices  favorable exchange rates and hurricane restoration activity also contributed to the higher revenues 
cost of goods sold as a percentage of net sales was and in and  respectively 
operating income decreased to million primarily from the partial divestiture of our ladd operations 
the combination of all these factors led to net income of million  a decrease of over the prior year 
diluted earnings per share was in  compared with in our end markets consist of industrial  construction  utility and commercial  institutional and governmental customers 
our sales to these markets can be categorized as stock  direct ship and special order 
stock orders are filled directly from existing inventory and represent approximately of total sales 
approximately of our total sales are direct ship sales 
direct ship sales are typically custom built products  large orders or products that are too bulky to be easily handled and  as a result  are shipped directly to the customer from the supplier 
special orders are for products that are not ordinarily stocked in inventory and are ordered based on a customer s specific request 
special orders represent the remainder of total sales 
we have historically financed our working capital requirements  capital expenditures  acquisitions  share repurchases and new branch openings through internally generated cash flow  borrowings under our credit facilities and funding through our receivables facility

the revolving credit facility does not mature until november   and the receivables facility matures on may  in addition  our debentures and debentures cannot be redeemed or repurchased until and  respectively 
we increased our cash by million to million  after taking into account million of share repurchases and million of capital expenditures 
we monitor the depository institutions that hold our cash and cash equivalents on a regular basis  and we believe that we have placed our deposits with creditworthy financial institutions 
for further discussions refer to liquidity and capital resources 
outlook we believe that acquisitions and improvements in operations and our capital structure made in  and have positioned us well for we continue to see macroeconomic data and input from internal sales management  customers and suppliers that suggest activity levels in our major end markets will be significantly weaker than that experienced in despite anticipated weakness  we believe that there are opportunities in all our end markets  and that we are well positioned to participate in these large fragmented markets 
our strong market position  broad portfolio of products and services and extensive information technology platform  combined with our continued focus on margin  productivity improvement  and selling and marketing initiatives  should provide us with a competitive advantage and enable us to perform at an above market rate throughout 
table of contents critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to supplier programs  bad debts  inventories  insurance costs  goodwill  income taxes  contingencies and litigation 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional adjustments to reserve items may be required 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition revenues are recognized for product sales when title  ownership and risk of loss pass to the customer  or for services when the service is rendered 
in the case of stock sales and special orders  a sale occurs at the time of shipment from our distribution point  as the terms of our sales are fob shipping point 
in cases where we process customer orders but ship directly from our suppliers  revenue is recognized once product is shipped and title has passed 
for some of our customers  we provide services such as inventory management or other specific support 
revenues are recognized upon evidence of fulfillment of the agreed upon services 
in all cases  revenue is recognized once the sales price to our customer is fixed or is determinable and we have reasonable assurance as to the collectibility in accordance with staff accounting bulletin no 
allowance for doubtful accounts we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
we have a systematic procedure using estimates based on historical data and reasonable assumptions of collectibles made at the local branch level and on a consolidated corporate basis to calculate the allowance for doubtful accounts 
excess and obsolete inventory we write down our inventory for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventory equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated market value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
a systematic procedure is used to determine excess and obsolete inventory reflecting historical data and reasonable assumptions for the percentage of excess and obsolete inventory on a consolidated basis 
supplier volume rebates we receive rebates from certain suppliers based on contractual arrangements with them 
since there is a lag between actual purchases and the rebates received from the suppliers  we must estimate and accrue the approximate amount of rebates available at a specific date 
we record the amounts as other accounts receivable on the balance sheet 
the corresponding rebate income is recorded as a reduction of cost of goods sold 
the appropriate level of such income is derived from the level of actual purchases made by us from suppliers  in accordance with the provisions of emerging issues task force eitf issue no 
 accounting by a reseller for cash consideration received from a vendor 
goodwill and indefinite life intangible assets we test goodwill and indefinite life intangible assets for impairment annually during the fourth quarter using information available at the end of september  or more frequently when events or circumstances occur indicating that their carrying value may not be recoverable 
the evaluation of impairment involves comparing the current fair value of goodwill to the recorded value 
we estimate fair value using discounted cash flow analyses  which involves considerable management judgment 
assumptions used for these estimated cash flows are based on a combination of historical results  current internal forecasts  recent economic events and fluctuations in our stock price 
for our most significant reporting units  two primary assumptions were an average long term revenue growth ranging from to depending on the end market served and a discount rate of 
our recent large acquisitions are most sensitive to changes in assumptions 
a possible indicator of impairment is the relationship of a company s market capitalization to its book value 
as of december  our market capitalization exceeded our book value 
the persistence or further acceleration of the recent downturn in global economic conditions and turbulence in financial markets could have a further negative impact on our market capitalization and or financial performance 
we cannot predict certain events that could adversely affect the reported value of goodwill and trademarks  which totaled million and million at december  and  respectively 
intangible assets we account for certain economic benefits purchased as a result of our acquisitions  including customer relations  distribution agreements and trademarks  as intangible assets 
except for trademarks  which have an indefinite life  we amortize intangible assets over a useful life determined by the expected cash flows produced by such intangibles and their respective tax benefits 
useful lives vary between and years  depending on the specific intangible asset 
insurance programs we use commercial insurance for auto  workers compensation  casualty and health claims as a risk reduction strategy to minimize catastrophic losses 
our strategy involves large deductibles where we must pay all costs up to the deductible amount 
we estimate our reserve based on historical incident rates and costs 

table of contents income taxes we account for income taxes under the provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  which requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in our consolidated financial statements or tax returns 
under this method  deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the difference between the financial reporting and the tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse 
we record our deferred tax assets at amounts that are expected to be realized 
we evaluate future taxable income and potential tax planning strategies in assessing the potential need for a valuation allowance 
should we determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our deferred tax assets in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would be charged to income in the period such determination was made 
we account for uncertainty in income taxes under fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
fin 
fin prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
we frequently review tax issues and positions taken on tax returns to determine the need and amount of contingency reserves necessary to cover any probable audit adjustments 
stock based compensation our stock based employee compensation plans are comprised of fixed non qualified stock options and stock settled stock appreciation rights 
beginning january   we adopted sfas no 
revised sfas r  share based payment  using the modified prospective method 
stock options awarded prior to were accounted for using the measurement provisions of sfas no 
sfas  accounting for stock based compensation 
under sfas r  compensation cost for all stock based awards is measured at fair value on date of grant and compensation cost is recognized  net of estimated forfeitures  over the service period for awards expected to vest 
the fair value of stock based awards is determined using the black scholes valuation model 
expected volatilities are based on historical volatility of our common stock 
we estimate the expected life of the option or stock settled appreciation right using historical data pertaining to option exercises and employee terminations 
the risk free rate is based on the us treasury yields in effect at the time of grant 
the forfeiture assumption is based on our historical employee behavior  which we review on an annual basis 
no dividends are assumed

contractual cash obligations and other commercial commitments the following summarizes our contractual obligations  including interest  at december  and the effect such obligations are expected to have on liquidity and cash flow in future periods 
to to after total in millions contractual cash obligations including interest long term debt current and short term debt interest on indebtedness non cancelable operating and capital leases other acquisition notes acquisition agreements severance charges total contractual cash obligations interest on the variable rate debt was calculated using the rates and balances outstanding at december  purchase orders for inventory requirements and service contracts are not included in the table above 
generally  our purchase orders and contracts contain clauses allowing for cancellation 
we do not have significant agreements to purchase material or goods that would specify minimum order quantities 
also  we do not consider obligations to taxing authorities to be contractual obligations requiring disclosure due to the uncertainty surrounding the ultimate settlement and timing of these obligations 
as such  we have not included million of such liability in the table above 
inflation the rate of inflation  as measured by changes in the consumer price index  did not have a material effect on our sales or operating results during the periods presented 
however  inflation in the future could affect our operating costs 
overall  price changes from suppliers have historically been consistent with inflation and have not had a material impact on the results of operations 
in recent years  prices of certain commodities have increased much faster than inflation 
in most cases we have been able to pass through a majority of these increases to customers 
seasonality our operating results are not significantly affected by seasonal factors 
sales during the first quarter are generally less than below the sales of the remaining three quarters due to a reduced level of activity during the winter months of january and february 
sales typically increase beginning in march with slight fluctuations per month through december 

table of contents impact of recently issued accounting standards in september  the financial accounting standards board the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 fair value measurements sfas which defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value in generally accepted accounting principles  and expands disclosures about fair value measurements 
this statement applies whenever other accounting standards require or permit assets or liabilities to be measured at fair value but does not expand the use of fair value to new accounting transactions and does not apply to pronouncements that address share based payment transactions 
on february   the fasb issued fasb staff position fsp sfas no 
 effective date of sfas no 
the fsp amends sfas to delay the effective date of sfas for all nonfinancial assets and liabilities  except those that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis that is  at least annually to fiscal years beginning after november  except for the delay for nonfinancial assets and liabilities  sfas was effective for fiscal years beginning after november  consistent with its requirements  we adopted sfas for our financial assets and liabilities on january  our financial instruments consist of cash and cash equivalents  accounts receivable  accounts payable  bank overdrafts and debt 
we believe that the recorded values of our financial instruments  except for debt  approximate fair value because of their nature and respective duration 
the partial adoption of sfas did not impact our financial position  results of operations  or cash flows 
nonfinancial assets and liabilities for which we have not applied the provisions of sfas include those measured at fair value in goodwill and indefinite lived intangible asset impairment testing  and assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination 
we have not yet conclusively determined the impact that the implementation of sfas will have on our non financial assets and liabilities  however  we do not anticipate that it will have a significant impact on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
in the event that we acquire a new business or have an impairment issue related to goodwill or indefinite lived intangible assets  the determination of fair value of the assets and liabilities will be subject to sfas in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
revised  business combinations sfas r which establishes additional principles and requirements for how the acquirer in a business combination recognizes and measures in its financial statements the identifiable assets acquired  the liabilities assumed and any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree at the acquisition date fair value 
sfas r is designed to improve the relevance  representational faithfulness and comparability of the financial information that a reporting entity provides in its financial reports about a business combination and its effects 
sfas r applies prospectively to business combinations for which the acquisition date is in or after the beginning of the first annual reporting period beginning after december  aside from the execution of a significant acquisition  we do not anticipate that the adoption of sfas r will have an impact on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
in april  the fasb issued fsp no 
fas  determination of the useful life of intangible assets fsp fas which amends the factors that should be considered in developing renewal or extension assumptions used to determine the useful life of a recognized intangible asset under sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assts sfas  and requires additional disclosure 
the objective of fsp fas is to improve the consistency between the useful life of a recognized intangible asset under sfas and the period of expected cash flows used to measure the fair value of the asset under sfas r and other generally accepted accounting principles 
fsp fas is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  and shall be applied prospectively to intangible assets acquired after the effective date 
we do not anticipate that the adoption of fsp fas will have an impact on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
in may  the fasb issued fsp apb  accounting for convertible debt instruments that may be settled in cash upon conversion including partial cash settlement fsp apb which requires an issuer of certain convertible debt instruments to separately account for the liability and equity components of convertible debt instruments in a manner that reflects the issuer s nonconvertible debt borrowing rate 
fsp apb is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  and requires retrospective application to all periods presented during which any such convertible debt instruments were outstanding 
fsp apb will change the accounting treatment for our and debentures and will result in an increase to non cash interest reported in our historical financial statements as well as our future financial statements as long as we continue to have convertible debentures outstanding 
we estimate that the initial impact to the consolidated balance sheet as of december  will be a decrease in long term debt of approximately million for the recognition of a debt discount  an aggregate increase in equity of approximately million  and an increase in deferred income taxes for the basis differential related to long term debt 
the debt discount will be amortized to interest expense resulting in a decrease in earnings per share in the year of adoption 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk s 
foreign currency risks approximately of our sales are denominated in us dollars and are primarily from customers in the united states 
as a result  currency fluctuations are currently not material to our operating results 
we do have foreign subsidiaries located in north america  europe  asia and australia and may establish additional foreign subsidiaries in the future 
accordingly  we may derive a more significant portion of our sales from international operations  and a portion of these sales may be denominated in foreign currencies 
as a result  our future operating results could become subject to fluctuations in the exchange rates of those currencies in relation to the us dollar 
furthermore  to the extent that we engage in international sales denominated in us dollars  an increase in the value of the us dollar relative to foreign currencies could make our products less competitive in international markets 
we have monitored and will continue to monitor our exposure to currency fluctuations 

table of contents interest rate risk fixed rate borrowings approximately of our debt portfolio is comprised of fixed rate debt 
at various times  we have refinanced our debt to mitigate the impact of interest rate fluctuations 
in  we issued million aggregate principal amount of our notes at and million aggregate principal amount of our debentures at 
in  we issued additional fixed rate debt  which included million aggregate principal amount of debentures at 
as these borrowings were issued at fixed rates  interest expense would not be impacted by interest rate fluctuations  although market value would be 
the aggregate fair value of these debt instruments was million at december  interest expense on our other fixed rate debt also would not be impacted by changes in market interest rates  and for this debt  fair value approximated carrying value see note to the consolidated financial statements 
floating rate borrowings our variable rate borrowings at december  of million include million from the receivables facility and million from the revolving credit facility 
the fair value of these debt instruments at december  was approximately million and million  respectively 
we borrow under our revolving credit facility for general corporate purposes  including working capital requirements and capital expenditures 
during  our average daily borrowing under the facility was million 
borrowings under our facility bear interest at the applicable libor or base rate and therefore we are subject to fluctuations in interest rates 
additionally  we borrow under our receivables facility  which bears interest at the day commercial paper rate plus applicable margin 
a basis point increase or decrease in interest rates would not have a significant impact on future earnings under our current capital structure
