item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview mesa laboratories  inc manufactures and distributes electronic measurement systems and disposable products for various niche applications  including renal treatment  food processing  medical sterilization  pharmaceutical processing and other industrial applications 
our company follows a philosophy of manufacturing a high quality product and providing a high level of on going service for those products 
in order to optimize the performance of our company and to build the value of the company for its shareholders  we continually follow the trend of various key financial indicators 
a sample of some of the most important of these indicators is presented in the following table 
key financial indicators cash and investments trade receivables days sales outstanding inventory net inventory turns working capital current ratio average return on stockholder investment assets invested capital net sales gross profit gross margin operating income operating margin net profit net profit margin earnings per diluted share capital expenditures net head count sales per employee average return on stockholder investment is calculated by dividing total net income by the average of end of year and beginning of year total stockholder s equity 
average return on invested capital invested capital total assets current liabilities cash and short term investments is calculated by dividing total net income by the average of end of year and beginning of year invested capital 
while we continually try to optimize the overall performance and trends  the table above does highlight various exceptions 
most of the indicators above are improving in the most recent fiscal year 
exceptions to the improving trends are days sales outstanding  the average return calculations  and net profit margin 
longer times to payment for our foreign customers have increased the total days sales outstanding average for the total company in fiscal a small decrease in net profit margin combined with increasing balance sheet levels during fiscal caused the average return calculations to decrease slightly in the current fiscal year 
our company saw a small decrease in net profit margin in fiscal due to a small decrease in gross profit margins and decreased interest income on invested cash due to lower interest rates 
results of operations net sales net sales for fiscal increased percent from fiscal  and net sales for fiscal increased percent from fiscal in dollars  net sales of  in fiscal increased  from  in  and net sales of  in fiscal increased  from  in our revenues come from two main sources  which include product revenues and parts and service revenues 
parts and service revenues are derived from on going repair and recalibration or certification of our products 
the certification or recalibration of product is usually a key component of the customer s own quality system and many of our customers operate in regulated industries  such as food processing or medical and pharmaceutical processing 
for this reason  these revenues tend to be fairly stable and grow slowly over time 
during fiscal years  and our company had parts and service revenue of   and  as a percentage of total revenue  parts and service revenues were in  in and in the performance of new product sales is dependent on several factors  including general economic conditions in the united states and abroad  capital spending trends and the introduction of new products 
until the current fiscal year  general economic conditions had been improving  and more specifically  capital spending had been improving  but these trends have reversed during fiscal new products released to the market over the past five fiscal years include the datatrace micropack iii temperature loggers during the middle of fiscal  the datatrace micropack iii humidity and pressure loggers at the end of fiscal  the xl dialysate meter for kidney dialysis was introduced late in fiscal  and the datatrace rf system was introduced in early fiscal for fiscal years  and product sales for our company were   and during fiscal  sales of the company s medical products and services increased for the fiscal year compared to the prior year period 
for the year  medical saw increased sales of meter products  disposables and service  which were partially off set by lower sales of the discontinued dialyzer reprocessor 
sales of our new xl meter continued to progress well during fiscal in addition  we continue to maintain strong relationships with our major customers in this market 
during fiscal  sales of datatrace data logger products preformed at the same level as the prior year 
for the year  datatrace products did not experience an increase in sales due to existing economic trends which influenced some industrial customers to delay their capital equipment purchases 
sales for the twelve month period saw small declines though the various categories of micropack iii products which were off set by sales of the new micropack rf products 
we are optimistic and look forward to improving trends in both new product shipments and service sales in both the domestic and international markets for the later part of fiscal introduction of the new micropack rf products  with their real time reporting capabilities  is expected to further add to datatrace product line sales in the new fiscal year 
fiscal sales of raven biological indicator products increased percent compared to the prior year period 
in fiscal  raven experienced an increase in biological indicator and chemical indicator sales 
sales during fiscal benefited from increased production capabilities and automation  which is allowing our company to better penetrate the market with additional product size configurations and increased production of key products 
during fiscal  sales of the nusonics line of ultrasonic fluid measurement systems increased by three percent 
sales of these products remain stable  but nusonics products currently contribute less than four percent of the company s total sales and are not expected to grow in the future 
during fiscal  sales of the company s medical products and services increased five percent for the fiscal year compared to the prior year period 
for the year  medical saw increased sales of meter products  disposables and service  which were partially off set by lower sales of the discontinued dialyzer reprocessor line and lower repair part sales 
sales of our new xl meter continued to progress well during fiscal in addition  we continued to maintain strong relationships with our major customers in this market 
during fiscal  sales of datatrace data logger products increased compared to the prior year 
for the year  datatrace products continued to see improving trends in both new product shipments and service sales in both the domestic and international markets 
introduction of the new micropack rf products  with their real time reporting capabilities  was expected to further add to datatrace product line sales in the fiscal fiscal sales of raven biological indicator products increased percent compared to the prior year period 
the raven biological indicator products were acquired on may  for this reason  sales of the company s raven biological indicator products benefited from an extra five weeks of sales for the full year when compared to the prior year period 
during fiscal  sales of the nusonics line of ultrasonic fluid measurement systems decreased by three percent 
sales of these products remain stable  but nusonics products currently contribute less than four percent of the company s total sales and are not expected to grow in the future 
cost of sales cost of sales as a percent of net sales in fiscal increased percent from fiscal to percent  and in fiscal decreased percent from fiscal to percent from percent 
most of our products enjoy gross margins in excess of percent 
due to the fact that the dialysis products have sales concentrated with several companies that maintain large chains of treatment centers  the products that are sold to the renal market tend to be slightly more price sensitive than the data logging products 
also  due to the nature of the market for biological indicators  the raven products produce gross margins lower than datatrace and medical 
therefore  shifts in product mix toward higher sales of datatrace and medical products will tend to produce lower cost of goods sold expense and higher gross margins while shifts toward higher sales of raven products will normally produce the opposite effect on cost of goods sold expense and gross margins 
during fiscal  our company saw increases in costs of sales due to flat datatrace sales as result of the economic down turn  and increases in raven and medical products with a resulting increase in cost of sales 
the company continues to monitor and implement cost reduction programs  price increases and improvements in freight cost recovery 
during fiscal  our company saw reductions in costs of sales year over year with the exception of the datatrace line which saw a small increase of one half of one percent as a percent of datatrace sales 
most of the decline in costs of sales percent in the current fiscal year was attributable to an improvement in the medical line  where cost reduction programs  price increases and improvements in freight cost recovery all contributed to the gain 
selling  general and administrative general and administrative expenses tend to be fairly fixed and stable from year to year 
to the greatest extent possible  we work at containing and minimizing these costs 
total administrative costs were  in fiscal   in fiscal and  in fiscal  which represents a  increase from fiscal to fiscal and a  increase from fiscal to fiscal the increase in general and administrative costs for can be attributed to general increases in operating costs and the addition of the controller position 
fiscal general and administrative costs increased due to five additional weeks of raven related costs compared to the prior year along with higher accounting and consulting costs  which mostly can be attributed to the company s efforts to comply with the demands of section of the sarbanes oxley act of our selling and marketing costs tend to be far more variable in relation to sales  although there are various exceptions 
some of these exceptions include the introduction of new products and the mix of international sales to domestic sales 
for a product line experiencing introduction of a new product  costs will tend to be higher as a percent of sales due to higher advertising development and sales training programs 
our company s international sales are usually discounted and recorded at the net discounted price  so that a change in mix between international and domestic sales may influence sales and marketing costs 
one other major influence on sales and marketing costs is the mix of domestic dialysis product sales to all other domestic sales 
domestic dialysis product sales are made by direct telemarketing representatives  which gives us a lower cost structure  when compared to the field salesman and independent representative sales channels utilized by our other products 
through fiscal and fiscal the company continued to focus additional resources on its sales and marketing efforts 
in june of fiscal  the company began a transition from independent manufacturer s representatives to direct sales personnel for domestic sales of its datatrace products 
this change to our sales channels increased our selling costs in recent years  but our domestic sales levels have been rising to compensate for these cost increases 
the past year s continuing transition to direct selling was focused on overall sales management and telemarketing resources for both the datatrace and raven lines 
in dollars  selling costs were  in fiscal   in fiscal and  in fiscal as a percent of sales  selling cost were percent in fiscal  percent in fiscal and percent in fiscal during both fiscal and  sales and marketing costs as a percent of sales declined 
in real dollars  the datatrace and raven costs increased during fiscal due to the expansion of our selling staff and additional sales and marketing expenses to increase the company s customer base  and during fiscal  we experienced an additional five weeks of costs for raven products when compared with fiscal research and development company sponsored research and development cost was  in fiscal   in fiscal and  in fiscal we are currently executing a strategy of increasing the flow of internally developed products 
late in the first quarter of fiscal  the datatrace micropack rf product was introduced  and on going research to introduce this technology into the environmental monitoring segment of the market continued during the remainder of the fiscal year 
most of our work during fiscal and was focused on the development of the new micropack rf products as part of our datatrace line 
net income net income increased to  or per share on a diluted basis in fiscal from  or per share on a diluted basis in fiscal and  or per share on a diluted basis in fiscal for the fiscal year  mesa experienced net income growth of four percent  which was behind the sales growth rate of percent for the fiscal year 
the slower profitability growth was a result of static datatrace sales  and an increase in cost of sales 
in the acceleration of profitability for the fiscal year can be attributed to a gain in gross profits as a percent of net sales  but was partially off set by an increase in the income tax rate as a percent of earnings before income tax 
liquidity and capital resources on march   we had cash and cash equivalents of  in addition  we had other current assets totaling  and total current assets of  current liabilities of our company were  which resulted in a current ratio of for comparison purposes at march   we had cash and short term investments of  other current assets of  total current assets of  current liabilities of  and a current ratio of our company has made capital acquisitions of  in fiscal  and  in fiscal fiscal included approximately  expended on equipment to automate certain manufacturing processes for our raven products

shares purchased will be canceled and repurchases will be made with existing cash reserves 
we do not maintain a set policy for our buyback program 
most of our stock buybacks have occurred during periods when the price to earnings multiple has been near historical low points  or during times when selling activity in the stock is out of balance with buying demand

forward looking statements all statements other than statements of historical fact included in this annual report regarding our company s financial position and operating and strategic initiatives and addressing industry developments are forward looking statements 
where  in any forward looking statement  the company  or its management  expresses an expectation or belief as to future results  such expectation or belief is expressed in good faith and believed to have a reasonable basis  but there can be no assurance that the statement of expectation or belief will result or be achieved or accomplished 
factors which could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated  include but are not limited to general economic  financial and business conditions  competition in the data logging market  competition in the kidney dialysis market  competition in the fluid measurement market  competition in the biological indicator market  the business abilities and judgment of personnel  the impacts of unusual items resulting from ongoing evaluations of business strategies  and changes in business strategy 
we do not intend to update these forward looking statements 
you are advised to review the item a 
risk factors of this report for more information about risks that could affect the financial results of mesa laboratories  inc critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of our financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in our financial statements and accompanying notes 
actual results could differ materially from those estimates 
we believe that there are several accounting policies that are critical to understanding the company s historical and future performance  as these policies affect the reported amounts of revenue and the more significant areas involving management s judgments and estimates 
these significant accounting policies relate to revenue recognition  research and development costs  valuation of inventory  valuation of long lived assets and stock based compensation 
these policies  and the company s procedures related to these policies  are described in detail below 
revenue recognition we sell our products directly through our sales force and through distributors 
revenue from direct sales of our product is recognized upon shipment to the customer 
revenue from ongoing product service and repair is fully recognized upon completion and shipment of serviced product 
accounts receivable at the time the accounts are originated  the company considers a reserve for doubtful accounts based on the creditworthiness of the customer 
the provision for uncollectible amounts is continually reviewed and adjusted to maintain the allowance at a level considered adequate to cover future losses 
the allowance is management s best estimate of uncollectible amounts and is determined based on historical performance that is tracked by the company on an ongoing basis 
the losses ultimately incurred could differ materially in the near term from the amounts estimated in determining the allowance 
research development costs research and development activities consist primarily of new product development and continuing engineering on existing products 
costs related to research and development efforts on existing or potential products are expensed as incurred 
valuation of inventories inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market  using the first in  first out method fifo to determine cost 
the company s policy is to periodically evaluate the market value of the inventory and the stage of product life cycle  and record a reserve for any inventory considered slow moving or obsolete 
as of march  and the company had recorded a reserve of  each year 
valuation of long lived assets the company assesses the realizable value of long lived assets for potential impairment at least annually or when events and circumstances warrant such a review 
the carrying value of a long lived asset is considered impaired when the anticipated fair value is less than its carrying value 
in assessing the recoverability of our long lived assets  we must make assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors to determine the fair value of the respective assets 
in addition  we must make assumptions regarding the useful lives of these assets 
as of march   we evaluated our long lived assets for potential impairment 
based on our evaluation  no impairment charge was recognized 
stock based compensation the company implemented the provisions of sfas r effective april  using the modified prospective method 
under this transition method  stock based compensation expense for the year ended march  includes compensation expense for all stock based compensation awards granted subsequent to april  and previously granted awards not vested as of april  the company uses the black scholes valuation model to value option grants 
we use historical data to estimate the expected price volatility  the expected option life and expected forfeiture rate 
the risk free rate is based on the us treasury yield in effect at the time of the grant for the estimated life of the option 
the dividend yield is estimated based on the dividend payments made during the prior four quarters as a percent of average stock price for that period 
the above listing is not intended to be a comprehensive list of all of our accounting policies 
in many cases  the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by accounting principles  generally accepted in the united states of america  with no need for management s judgment in their application 
there are also areas in which management s judgment in selecting any viable alternative would not produce a materially different result
