executive overview j 
crew is a nationally recognized apparel and accessories brand that we believe embraces a high standard of style  craftsmanship  quality and customer service 
on the basis of data collected on our internet channel customers  we believe our customer base consists primarily of affluent  college educated and professional and fashion conscious women and men 
as of january   we operated retail stores  including five crewcuts stores  one men s store  one women s collection store  and madewell stores  and factory stores  including one crewcuts factory store  throughout the united states 
the following is a summary of fiscal highlights revenues totaled  million  reflecting a increase over prior year revenues of  million 
comparable store sales decreased 
direct net sales increased to million 
income from operations decreased to million  or of revenues 
we collected million of refundable income taxes including interest 
voluntary prepayment of million was made under the term loan 
we opened and closed one j 
crew retail stores  opened and closed one j 
crew factory stores  including one crewcuts standalone factory store and opened four madewell stores 
we implemented certain direct channel systems upgrades including a new platform for our website  a new order management system in our call center and a new warehouse management system 
these systems upgrades impaired our ability to capture  process and ship customer orders  and transfer products between channels during the second  third  and fourth quarters 
we incurred additional costs associated with these upgrades which adversely impacted our operating results in fiscal we made progress in stabilizing our direct channel systems during the second half of fiscal and are continuing our stabilization efforts in the following is a summary of our cost reduction program announced in february on february   the company announced that is has initiated a workforce reduction as part of a cost reduction program that is expected to generate approximately million in annualized pre tax savings 
this program is being implemented in response to the challenging economic environment  which is anticipated to continue through fiscal the workforce reduction impacted approximately positions  including positions that are currently unfilled  primarily in the company s new york offices and support functions in the field and distribution centers 
we expect to incur a pre tax charge of approximately million during the first quarter of fiscal mainly to reflect anticipated severance and related costs for affected individuals 
in addition to the workforce reduction  the company also suspended its k plan company matching contributions through the balance of  eliminated merit based wage increases for the entire workforce and initiated other cost reduction initiatives 
we have two primary sales channels stores  which consists of our retail  crewcuts  madewell and factory stores  and direct  which consists of our catalog and internet website 
the following is a summary of our net sales dollars in millions fiscal fiscal fiscal stores direct net sales our recent growth has led to increased buying and occupancy costs and increased selling  general and administrative expenses 
the most significant components of these increases were occupancy and wage costs  particularly at retail and factory stores due primarily to the opening of new stores  as well as lease renewals 
we expect these other costs particularly our store occupancy costs to increase as we pursue our strategy of expanding our retail and factory store base 
while we believe our growth strategy offers significant opportunities  it also presents significant risks and challenges  including  among others  the risks that we may not be able to hire and train qualified sales associates  that our new product offerings and expanded sales channels may not maintain or enhance our brand identity and that our order fulfillment and distribution facilities and information systems may not be adequate to support our growth plans 
in addition  we must also seek to ensure that implementation of these plans does not divert management s attention from continuing to build on the strengths that we believe have driven our recent success  including  among others  our focus on improving the quality of our products  pursuing a disciplined merchandising strategy and improving our store environments and our customer service 
for a more complete discussion of the risks facing our business  see risk factors 
how we assess the performance of our business in assessing the performance of our business  we consider a variety of performance and financial measures 
a key measure for determining how our business is performing is comparable store sales for stores and net sales for direct 
we also consider gross profit and selling  general and administrative expenses in assessing the performance of our business 
net sales net sales reflect our revenues from the sale of our merchandise less returns and discounts 
we aggregate our merchandise into four sales categories women s  men s  and children s apparel  which consist of items of clothing such as shirts  sweaters  pants  dresses  jackets  outerwear and suits  and accessories  which consists of items such as shoes  socks  jewelry  bags  belts and hair accessories 
the approximate percentage of our sales derived from these four categories  based on our internal merchandising systems  is as follows year ended february  february  january  apparel women s men s children s accessories our crewcuts children s concept was introduced in the first quarter of fiscal with the opening of shops within our j 
crew retail stores followed by the opening of two stand alone stores in the third quarter of fiscal during fiscal we opened a standalone crewcuts factory store and shop in shops within our factory stores 
as of january   we operated crewcuts shop in shops in our j 
crew retail stores  five standalone crewcuts retail stores  one standalone crewcuts factory store  and crewcuts shop in shops within our factory stores 
comparable store sales comparable store sales reflects net sales at stores that have been open for at least twelve months 
therefore  a store is included in comparable store sales on the first day it has comparable prior year sales 
in the first quarter of fiscal  we refined our comparable store sales calculation to include the impact of more significant remodelings of our stores 
stores that have changed their square footage by or more and stores that have been closed for consecutive days are considered non comparable 
non comparable store sales include net sales from new stores that have not been open for twelve months  stores impacted by remodels as discussed above  and net sales from closed stores and temporary stores 
in fiscal  comparable store sales excluded the impact of the rd week 
by measuring the change in year over year net sales in stores that have been open for twelve months or more  comparable store sales allows us to evaluate how our core store base is performing 
various factors affect comparable store sales  including consumer preferences  buying trends and overall economic trends  our ability to anticipate and respond effectively to fashion trends and customer preferences  competition  changes in our merchandise mix  pricing  the timing of our releases of new merchandise and promotional events  the level of customer service that we provide in our stores  changes in sales mix among sales channels  our ability to source and distribute products efficiently  and the number of stores we open  close including for temporary renovations and expand in any period 
as we continue to open new stores  we expect that a greater percentage of our revenues will come from non comparable store sales 
cyclicality and seasonality the industry in which we operate is cyclical  and consequently our revenues are affected by general economic conditions 
purchases of apparel and accessories are sensitive to a number of factors that influence the levels of consumer spending  including economic conditions and the level of disposable consumer income  consumer debt  interest rates and consumer confidence 
our business is seasonal 
as a result  our revenues fluctuate from quarter to quarter 
we have four distinct selling seasons that align with our four fiscal quarters 
revenues are usually substantially higher in our fourth fiscal quarter  particularly december  as customers make holiday purchases 
in fiscal  we realized approximately of our revenues in the fourth fiscal quarter compared to in fiscal this percentage was lower in due to the macroeconomic environment which resulted in increased markdowns in the fourth quarter of fiscal gross profit gross profit is equal to our revenues minus our cost of goods sold 
cost of goods sold includes the direct cost of purchased merchandise  freight  design  buying and production costs  occupancy costs related to store operations such as rent and utilities and all shipping costs associated with our direct business 
our cost of goods sold is substantially higher in the holiday season because cost of goods sold generally increases as revenues increase and cost of goods sold includes the cost of purchasing merchandise that we sell to generate revenues 
cost of goods sold also generally changes as we expand or contract our store base and incur higher or lower store occupancy and related costs 
the primary drivers of the costs of individual goods are the costs of raw materials and labor in the countries where we source our merchandise 
gross margin measures gross profit as a percentage of our revenues 
our gross profit may not be comparable to other specialty retailers  as some companies include all of the costs related to their distribution network in cost of goods sold while others  like us  exclude all or a portion of them from cost of goods sold and include them in selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses include all operating expenses not included in cost of goods sold  primarily catalog production and mailing costs  certain warehousing expenses  administrative payroll  store expenses other than occupancy costs  depreciation and amortization and credit card fees 
these expenses do not necessarily vary proportionally with net sales 
results of operations the following table presents  for the periods indicated  our operating results as a percentage of revenues as well as selected store data fiscal year ended february  february  january  revenues cost of goods sold  including buying and occupancy costs gross profit selling  general and administrative expenses income from operations interest expense  net loss on refinancing of debt income before income taxes provision benefit for income taxes net income fiscal year ended february  february  january  selected store data number of stores open at end of period sales per gross square foot week basis comparable store sales change week basis we exclude a portion of our distribution network costs from the cost of goods sold and include them in selling  general and administrative expenses 
our gross profit therefore may not be directly comparable to that of some of our competitors

we believe the increase in revenues is due to the continuing appeal of our expanded product line in both stores and direct and our continuing commitment to customer service 
given the overall macroeconomic environment during the second half of fiscal  we saw a notable softening of the sales trend  especially during the fourth quarter  in both stores and direct  which contributed to the decreased comparable store sales  and which we expect to continue in fiscal stores sales increased by million  or  to million in fiscal from million in fiscal comparable store sales decreased by to million in fiscal from million in the prior year 
non comparable store sales were million in fiscal direct sales increased by million  or  to million in fiscal from million in fiscal the direct sales increase reflects an increase in our internet revenues of million  partially offset by a decrease in our catalog revenues of million as compared to fiscal the increase in stores and direct sales during fiscal was primarily driven by an increase in sales of women s apparel 
this increase was largely driven by sales of sweaters  knits  and pants 
sales of men s apparel and accessories also increased during the year

gross profit in fiscal  gross profit decreased by million  or  to million from million in fiscal the change in the components of gross profit were as follows dollars in millions increase in revenues decrease in gross margin increase in buying and occupancy costs gross margin decreased from in fiscal to in fiscal the decrease in gross margin was due primarily to a decrease of basis points in merchandise margin  primarily due to increased markdowns during the fourth quarter  and a basis point increase in buying and occupancy costs 
we expect the trend of increased markdowns to continue in the first half of fiscal and increased buying and occupancy costs to continue in fiscal selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses increased by million  or  to million in fiscal from million in fiscal the increase resulted primarily from an increase in stores operating expenses primarily payroll and payroll related expenses associated with our growth in store locations of million  an increase in direct operating expenses primarily payroll  payroll related  and consulting expenses of million  which includes million related to our direct channel stabilization efforts  an increase in catalog costs of million  an increase in non cash asset impairment charges related to underperforming stores of million  offset by a decrease in share based and incentive compensation of million 
as a percentage of revenues  selling  general and administrative expenses increased to in fiscal from in fiscal  resulting primarily from the fact that these expenses increased at a faster rate than revenues during fiscal  which we expect to continue in fiscal see executive overview for discussion of our cost reduction program announced in february interest expense  net interest expense  net decreased million to million in fiscal from million in fiscal this decrease primarily reflects our lower average outstanding debt in fiscal resulting from voluntary prepayments under the term loan and declining interest rates

fiscal consisted of weeks  as compared to fiscal which consisted of weeks 
the impact of the rd week on fiscal revenues was million 
stores sales increased by million  or  to million in fiscal from million in fiscal comparable store sales increased by to million in fiscal from million in the prior year

non comparable store sales were million in fiscal the impact of the rd week on fiscal stores sales was million 
direct sales increased by million  or  to million in fiscal from million in fiscal a lower return rate accounted for percentage points of the increase 
we believe the return rate decreased in part because of improvements in fit and quality as well as an increase in the penetration of categories with lower returns 
the direct sales increase reflects an increase in our internet revenues of million  or  partially offset by a decrease in our catalog revenues of million  or as compared to fiscal the impact of the rd week on fiscal direct sales was million

the effective tax rate in fiscal of was not reflective of a normalized rate due to several factors  including a preferred stock dividends included in interest expense for financial statement purposes but not deductible for income tax purposes  and b the reversal at february  of a valuation allowance which fully reserved net deferred income tax assets 
the income tax provision for fiscal reflects a more normalized effective tax rate of

outlook our short term and long term liquidity needs arise primarily from principal and interest payments on our indebtedness  capital expenditures associated with our expansion plans and growth strategy and working capital requirements 
management anticipates that capital expenditures in fiscal will be approximately million  primarily for opening new stores  information technology enhancements  store renovations and refurbishments and general corporate purposes 
as of january   we were permitted to borrow million under the credit facility 
our annual debt service obligations will change by million per year for each change in the average interest rate we pay based on the million balance of variable interest rate debt outstanding at january  management believes that our current balances of cash and cash equivalents  cash flow from operations and availability under the credit facility will be adequate to finance working capital needs  planned capital expenditures and debt service obligations for the next twelve months 
our ability to fund our operations and make planned capital expenditures  to make scheduled debt payments  to refinance indebtedness and to remain in compliance with the financial covenants under our debt agreements depends on our future financing activities  our future operating performance and our future cash flow  which in turn  are subject to prevailing economic conditions and to financial  business and other factors  some of which are beyond our control 
off balance sheet arrangements we enter into documentary letters of credit to facilitate a portion of our international purchase of merchandise 
we also enter into standby letters of credit as required to secure certain of our obligations  including insurance programs and duties related to import purchases 
as of january   we had the following obligations under letters of credit in future periods 
letters of credit total within year years years after years in millions standby documentary contractual obligations the following table summarizes our contractual obligations as of january  and the effect such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flows in future periods total within year years years after years amounts in millions term loan interest on long term debt operating lease obligations unrecognized tax benefits purchase obligations inventory commitments employment agreements other total purchase obligations total mandatory principal payment requirements are based on  among other things  of original principal balance and annual excess cash flows as defined and subject to certain conditions 
the term loan bears interest at a floating rate of libor or the base rate 
as of january   annual interest expense related to the term loan is expected to be approximately million 
operating lease obligations represent obligations under various long term operating leases entered in the normal course of business for retail and factory stores  warehouses  office space and equipment requiring minimum annual rentals 
operating lease expense is a significant component of our operating expenses 
the lease terms range for various periods of time in various rental markets and are entered into at different times  which mitigates exposure to market changes that could have a material effect on our results of operations within any given year 
operating lease obligations do not include common area maintenance  insurance  taxes and other occupancy costs  which constitute approximately an additional of the minimum lease obligations 
as of january   the company has million in unrecognized tax benefits  which are included in other liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet 
while these tax liabilities may result in future cash outflows  management cannot make reliable estimates of the cash flows by period due to the inherent uncertainty surrounding the effective settlement of these positions 
impact of inflation our results of operations and financial condition are presented based on historical cost 
while it is difficult to accurately measure the impact of inflation due to the imprecise nature of the estimates required  we believe the effects of inflation  if any  on our results of operations and financial condition have not been significant 
recent accounting pronouncements in september  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
 fair value measurements 
sfas no 
establishes a framework for measuring fair value in generally accepted accounting principles and expands disclosures about fair value measurements 
sfas no 
is effective for the company beginning february  the adoption of sfas no 
will not have a significant impact on the financial condition or results of operations of the company 
critical accounting policies management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of our assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
management bases estimates on historical experience and other assumptions it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances and evaluates these estimates on an on going basis 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the following critical accounting policies reflect the significant estimates and judgments used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
with respect to critical accounting policies  even a relatively minor variance between actual and expected experience can potentially have a materially favorable or unfavorable impact on subsequent consolidated results of operations 
for more information on j 
crew s accounting policies  please refer to the notes to consolidated financial statements in this annual report on form k 
revenue recognition we recognize store sales at the time of sale  and direct sales at the time merchandise is shipped to customers 
amounts billed to customers for shipping and handling of catalog and internet sales are classified as other revenues and recognized at the time of shipment 
we must make estimates of future sales returns related to current period sales 
management analyzes historical returns  current economic trends and changes in customer acceptance of our products when evaluating the adequacy of the reserve for sales returns 
we licensed our trademark and know how to itochu corporation in japan through january   for which we received percentage royalty fees 
we defer recognition of advance royalty payments and recognize royalty revenue when sales entitling us to royalty revenue occur 
employee discounts are classified as a reduction of revenue 
we account for gift cards by recognizing a liability at the time a gift card is sold and recognizing revenue at the time the gift card is redeemed for merchandise 
we review our gift card liability on an ongoing basis and recognize our estimate of the unredeemed gift card liability on a ratable basis over the estimated period of redemption 
we defer revenue and recognize a liability for gift cards issued in connection with our customer loyalty program 
any unredeemed loyalty gift cards are recognized as income in the period in which they expire 
inventory valuation merchandise inventories are carried at the lower of average cost or market value 
we capitalize certain design  purchasing and warehousing costs in inventory 
we evaluate all of our inventories to determine excess inventories based on estimated future sales 
excess inventories may be disposed of through our factory stores  internet clearance sales and other liquidations 
based on historical results experienced through various methods of disposition  we write down the carrying value of inventories that are not expected to be sold at or above costs 
additionally  we reduce the cost of inventories based on an estimate of lost or stolen items each period 
deferred catalog costs the costs associated with direct response advertising  which consist primarily of catalog production and mailing costs  are capitalized and amortized over the expected future revenue stream of the catalog mailings  which we currently estimate to be approximately three months 
the expected future revenue stream is determined based on historical revenue trends developed over an extended period of time 
if the current revenue streams were to diverge from the expected trend  our amortization of deferred catalog costs would be adjusted accordingly 
asset impairment we are exposed to potential impairment if the book value of our assets exceeds their expected future cash flows 
the major components of our long lived assets are store fixtures  equipment and leasehold improvements 
the impairment of unamortized costs is measured at the store level and the unamortized cost is reduced to fair value if it is determined that the sum of expected discounted future net cash flows is less than net book value 
income taxes income taxes are calculated in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  which requires the use of the asset and liability method 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized based on the difference between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using current enacted tax rates in effect in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to reverse 
inherent in the measurement of deferred balances are certain judgments and interpretations of enacted tax law and published guidance 
management believes it is more likely than not that forecasted income  together with the tax effects of the deferred tax liabilities  will be sufficient to fully recover the remaining deferred tax assets 
in the event that all or part of the net deferred tax assets are determined not to be realizable in the future  a valuation allowance would be charged to earnings in the period such determination is made 
similarly  if the company subsequently realizes deferred tax assets that were previously determined unrealizable  any valuation allowance would be reversed into income in the period such determination is made 
in addition  the calculation of tax liabilities involves significant judgment in estimating the impact of uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws 
resolution of these uncertainties in a manner inconsistent with management s expectation could have a material impact on the company s results of operations and financial position 
on february   the company adopted fasb interpretation no
