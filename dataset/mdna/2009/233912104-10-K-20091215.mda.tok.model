during fiscal  consolidated pretax income increased by  to  from  in the prior year 
the company s traditional business segment pretax profit increased by  to  from  primarily because of an increase in trustee foreclosure notices and a decrease in personnel costs 
sustain s business segment pretax income decreased to  from reportable segments total results for both segments traditional business sustain fiscal revenues pretax income income tax expense net income fiscal revenues pretax income income tax expense net income consolidated revenues were  and  for fiscal years and  respectively 
this decrease of  was primarily from decreases of  in display advertising revenues and  in classified advertising revenues  partially offset by the increase in public notice advertising revenues of  the company continued to benefit from the large number of foreclosure notices in california and arizona  for which public notice advertising is required by law 
the company s smaller newspapers  those other than the los angeles and san francisco daily journals the daily journals  accounted for about of the total public notice advertising revenues 
public notice advertising revenues and related advertising and other service fees constituted about of the company s total revenues 
total circulation revenues decreased by  
the daily journals accounted for about of the company s total circulation revenues 
the court rule and judicial profile services generated about of the total circulation revenues  with the other newspapers and services accounting for the balance 
advertising service fees and other increased by  due primarily to increased fees generated by the placement of more trustee foreclosure notices in publications not owned by the company 
advertising service fees and other are traditional business segment revenues  which include primarily i agency commissions received from outside newspapers in which the advertising is placed and ii fees generated when filing notices with government agencies 
sustain s information systems and services revenues increased by  primarily because of increases in consulting revenues 
the company s revenues derived from sustain s operations constituted about of the company s total revenues for both fiscal and costs and expenses decreased by  to  from  total personnel costs decreased by  to  primarily due to savings from departmental reorganizations  partially offset by an annual salary adjustment 
newsprint and printing expenses decreased by  primarily resulting from fewer subscribers and paper price decreases 
postage and delivery expenses decreased by  mainly because there were fewer subscribers 
the company s expenditures for the development of new sustain software products are significant and will materially impact overall results at least through fiscal these costs are expensed as incurred until technological feasibility of the product has been established  at which time such costs are capitalized  subject to expected recovery 
sustain s internal development costs  which are primarily incremental labor costs for both employees and outside contractors  aggregated  and  for fiscal and  respectively 
if sustain s internal development programs are not successful  they will significantly and adversely impact the company s ability to maximize its existing investment in the sustain software  to service its existing customers and to compete for new opportunities in the case management software business 
whether the increase in traditional business segment pretax profit will be sustained throughout fiscal is very much dependant on the number of california and arizona foreclosure notices and the offsetting effect of a continuing decline in display and classified advertising 
at some point  the number of foreclosures undoubtedly will slow  and because fewer advertisements will then be required  so will the company s traditional business segment earnings 
whether sustain generates a profit or loss in fiscal likely will be determined based on its consulting revenues  which are subject to uncertainty because they depend on i the timing of the acceptance of the completed consulting tasks  ii the unpredictable needs of sustain s existing customers  and iii sustain s ability to secure new customers 
sustain s consulting revenues are expected to decline substantially in fiscal because governments have reduced budgets
