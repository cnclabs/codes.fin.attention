productivity transformation initiative in december and july  the company announced productivity transformation initiatives pti designed to fundamentally change the way it runs its business to meet the challenges of a changing business environment and to take advantage of the diverse opportunities in the marketplace as the company is transformed into a next generation biopharmaceutical company  and to create a total of billion in annual productivity cost savings and cost avoidance by in connection with pti  the company aims to achieve a culture of continuous improvement to enhance its efficiency  effectiveness and competitiveness and substantially improve its cost base 
key productivity initiatives include reducing general and administrative operations by simplifying  standardizing and outsourcing  where appropriate  processes and services  rationalizing the company s mature brands portfolio  consolidating its global manufacturing network while eliminating complexity and enhancing profitability  simplifying its geographic footprint and implementing a more efficient go to market model 
the charges associated with the previously announced pti are estimated to be an aggregate range of billion to billion  which includes million of costs already incurred 
the incurred costs are net of million of gains related to the sale of mature product lines and business 
also  included in these charges are net termination benefits of million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively  and other exit costs of million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the exact timing of the recognition of pti charges cannot be predicted with certainty and will be affected by the existence of triggering events for expense recognition  among other factors 
sources and availability of raw materials in general  the company purchases its raw materials  medical devices and supplies required for the production of the company s products in the open market 
for some products  the company purchases its raw materials  medical devices and supplies from a single source  which in certain circumstances is specified in the company s product registrations  thereby requiring the company to obtain such raw materials and supplies from that particular source 
the company attempts  if possible  to mitigate raw material supply risks to the company  through inventory management and alternative sourcing strategies 
for further discussion of sourcing  see manufacturing and quality assurance below and discussions of particular products 

table of contents manufacturing and quality assurance to meet all expected product demand  the company operates and manages its manufacturing network  including its third party contract manufacturers  and the inventory related thereto  in a manner that permits the company to improve efficiency while maintaining flexibility in its ability to reallocate manufacturing capacity 
pharmaceutical production processes are complex  highly regulated and vary widely from product to product 
given that shifting or adding manufacturing capacity can be a lengthy process requiring significant capital and out of pocket expenditures and regulatory approvals  the company maintains and operates its flexible manufacturing network  consisting of internal and external resources  that minimizes unnecessary product transfers and inefficient uses of manufacturing capacity 
for further discussion of the regulatory impact on the company s manufacturing  see government regulation and price constraints below 
pharmaceutical manufacturing facilities require significant ongoing capital investment for both maintenance and compliance with increasing regulatory requirements 
in addition  as the company adds to its product line and realigns its focus over the next several years  the company expects to modify its existing manufacturing network to meet complex processing standards that may be required for newly introduced products  including biologics 
biologics manufacturing involves more complex processes than those of traditional pharmaceutical operations 
during  the board of directors approved capital expenditures of approximately million for a bulk biologics manufacturing facility in the us in february  the company completed the land purchase of an acre site to locate its large scale multi product bulk biologics manufacturing facility in devens  massachusetts 
construction of the devens  massachusetts facility began in early  and the facility is projected to be operationally complete by the end of the company expects to submit the site for regulatory approval in commercial production of biologic compounds is anticipated to begin by the company relies on third parties to manufacture  or to supply it with active ingredients necessary for it to manufacture certain products  including plavix  baraclude  avalide  reyataz  pravachol  abilify  erbitux  the sustiva franchise and  orencia 
to maintain a stable supply of these products  the company takes a variety of actions including inventory management and maintenance of additional quantities of materials  when possible  designed to provide for is a reasonable level of these ingredients held by the third party supplier  the company or both  so that the company s manufacturing operations are not interrupted 
as an additional protection  in some cases  the company takes steps to maintain an approved back up source where available 
for example  the company will rely on the combined capacity of its devens  massachusetts  syracuse  new york  and manati  puerto rico  facilities  and the capacity available at its third party contract manufacturers to manufacture orencia and the commercial quantities of the company s other investigational biologics compounds in late stage development should those compounds receive regulatory approval 
if the company or any third party manufacturer that the company relies on for existing or future products is unable to maintain a stable supply of products  operate at sufficient capacity to meet its order requirements  comply with government regulations for manufacturing pharmaceuticals or meet the heightened processing requirements for biologics  the company s business performance and prospects could be negatively impacted 
additionally  if the company or any of its third party suppliers were to experience extended plant shutdowns or substantial unplanned increases in demand or suspension of manufacturing for regulatory reasons  the company could experience an interruption in supply of certain products or product shortages until production could be resumed or expanded 
in connection with divestitures  licensing arrangements or distribution agreements of certain of the company s products  or in certain other circumstances  the company has entered into agreements under which the company has agreed to supply such products to third parties 
in addition to liabilities that could arise from the company s failure to supply such products under the agreements  these arrangements could require the company to invest in facilities for the production of non strategic products  result in additional regulatory filings and obligations or cause an interruption in the manufacturing of its own products 
the company s success depends in great measure upon customer confidence in the quality of its products and in the integrity of the data that support their safety and effectiveness 
product quality arises from a total commitment to quality in all parts of the company s operations  including research and development  purchasing  facilities planning  manufacturing  and distribution 
the company maintains quality assurance procedures relating to the quality and integrity of technical information and production processes 
control of production processes involves detailed specifications for ingredients  equipment and facilities  manufacturing methods  processes  packaging materials  and labeling 
the company performs tests at various stages of production processes and on the final product to ensure that the product meets regulatory requirements and the company s standards 
these tests may involve chemical and

quality control is provided by business unit site quality assurance groups that monitor existing manufacturing procedures and systems used by the company  its subsidiaries and third party suppliers 
intellectual property and product exclusivity the company owns or licenses a number of patents in the us and foreign countries primarily covering its products 
the company has also developed many brand names and trademarks for products in all areas 
the company considers the overall protection of its patent  trademark  license and other intellectual property rights to be of material value and acts to protect these rights from infringement 
in the pharmaceutical industry  the majority of an innovative product s commercial value is usually realized during the period in which the product has market exclusivity 
in the us and some other countries  when market exclusivity expires and generic versions of a product are approved and marketed  there can often be substantial and rapid declines in the product s sales 
the rate of this decline varies by country and by therapeutic category 
for a discussion of how generic versions of a product can impact that product s sales  see generic competition below 
a product s market exclusivity is generally determined by two forms of intellectual property patent rights held by the innovator company and any regulatory forms of exclusivity to which the innovative drug is entitled 
patents are a key determinant of market exclusivity for most branded pharmaceuticals 
patents provide the innovator with the right to exclude others from practicing an invention related to the medicine 
patents may cover  among other things  the active ingredient s  various uses of a drug product  pharmaceutical formulations  drug delivery mechanisms and processes for or intermediates useful in the manufacture of products 
protection for individual products extends for varying periods in accordance with the expiration dates of patents in the various countries 
the protection afforded  which may also vary from country to country  depends upon the type of patent  its scope of coverage and the availability of meaningful legal remedies in the country 
market exclusivity is also sometimes influenced by regulatory intellectual property rights 
many developed countries provide certain non patent incentives for the development of medicines 
for example  the us  the eu and japan each provide for a minimum period of time after the approval of a new drug during which the regulatory agency may not rely upon the innovator s data to approve a competitor s generic copy 
regulatory intellectual property rights are also available in certain markets as incentives for research on new indications  on orphan drugs and on medicines useful in treating pediatric patients 
regulatory intellectual property rights are independent of any patent rights that the company may possess and can be particularly important when a drug lacks broad patent protection 
however  most regulatory forms of exclusivity do not prevent a competitor from gaining regulatory approval prior to the expiration of regulatory data exclusivity on the basis of the competitor s own safety and efficacy data on its drug  even when that drug is identical to that marketed by the innovator 
the company estimates the likely market exclusivity period for each of its products on a case by case basis 
it is not possible to predict the length of market exclusivity for any of the company s products with certainty because of the complex interaction between patent and regulatory forms of exclusivity  and inherent uncertainties concerning patent litigation 
there can be no assurance that a particular product will enjoy market exclusivity for the full period of time that the company currently estimates or that the exclusivity will be limited to the estimate 
for a discussion on market exclusivity  see pharmaceuticals segment above 
in addition to patents and regulatory forms of exclusivity  the company also holds intellectual property in the form of trademarks on products such as enfamil 
trademarks have no effect on market exclusivity for a product  but are considered to have marketing value 
worldwide  all of the company s important products are sold under trademarks that are considered in the aggregate to be of material importance 
trademark protection continues in some countries as long as used  in other countries  as long as registered 
registration is for fixed terms and can be renewed indefinitely 
specific aspects of the law governing market exclusivity for pharmaceuticals vary from country to country 
the following summarizes key exclusivity rules in markets representing significant company sales united states a company seeking to market an innovative pharmaceutical in the us must file a complete set of safety and efficacy data to the fda 
the type of application filed depends on whether the drug is a chemical a small molecule or a biological product a large molecule 
if the innovative pharmaceutical is a chemical  the company files a new drug application nda 
if the medicine is a biological product  a biologic license application bla is filed 
the type of application filed affects regulatory exclusivity rights 

table of contents a competitor seeking to launch a generic substitute of a chemical innovative drug in the us must file an anda with the fda 
in the anda  the generic manufacturer needs to demonstrate only bioequivalence between the generic substitute and the approved nda drug 
the anda relies upon the safety and efficacy data previously filed by the innovator in its nda 
medicines approved under a nda can receive several types of regulatory data protection 
an innovative chemical pharmaceutical also known as a new chemical entity is entitled to five years of regulatory data protection in the us  during which an anda cannot be filed with the fda 
if an innovator s patent is challenged  as described below  the generic manufacturer may file its anda after the fourth year of the five year data protection period 
a pharmaceutical drug product that contains an active ingredient that has been previously approved in a nda  but is approved in a new formulation or for a new indication on the basis of new clinical trials  receives three years of data protection 
finally  a nda that is designated as an orphan drug  which is a drug that gains an indication for treatment of a condition that occurs only rarely in the us  can receive seven years of exclusivity for the orphan indication 
during this time period  neither ndas nor andas for the same drug product can be approved for the same orphan use 
because a significant portion of patent life can be lost during the time it takes to obtain regulatory approval  the innovator can extend one patent to compensate the innovator for the lost patent term  at least in part 
more specifically  the innovator may identify one patent  which claims the product or its approved method of use  and  depending on a number of factors  may extend the expiration date of that patent 
there are two limits to these extensions 
first  the maximum term a patent can be extended is five years  and second  the extension cannot cause the patent to be in effect for more than years from the date of nda approval 
a company may also earn six months of additional exclusivity for a drug where specific clinical trials are conducted at the written request of the fda to study the use of the medicine to treat pediatric patients  and submission to the fda is made prior to the loss of basic exclusivity 
this six month period extends most forms of exclusivity patent and regulatory that are listed with the fda at the time the studies are completed and submitted to the fda  but not against products already finally approved 
currently  generic versions of biological products cannot be approved under us law 
however  the law could change in the future 
even in the absence of new legislation  the fda is taking steps toward allowing generic versions of certain biologics 
competitors seeking approval of biological products must file their own safety and efficacy data  and address the challenges of biologics manufacturing  which involves more complex processes and are more costly than those of traditional pharmaceutical operations 
many but not all innovative drugs are also covered by patents held by the nda sponsor beyond the minimum period of regulatory exclusivity provided by us law 
the innovator company is required to list certain of its patents covering the medicine with the fda in what is commonly known as the orange book 
absent a successful patent challenge  the fda cannot approve an anda until after the innovator s listed patents expire 
however  after the innovator has marketed its product for four years  a generic manufacturer may file an anda and allege that one or more of the patents listed in the orange book under an innovator s nda is either invalid or not infringed 
this allegation is commonly known as a paragraph iv certification 
the innovator then must decide whether to file a patent infringement suit against the generic manufacturer 
if one or more of the nda listed patents are successfully challenged  or if the innovator chooses not to sue  the first filer of a paragraph iv certification or first filers if more than one generic qualifies may be entitled to a day period of market exclusivity against all other generic manufacturers 
from time to time  andas  including paragraph iv certifications  are filed with respect to certain of the company s products 
the company evaluates these andas on a case by case basis and  where warranted  files suit against the generic manufacturer to protect its patent rights 
in the us  the increased likelihood of generic challenges to innovators intellectual property has increased the risk of loss of innovators market exclusivity 
first  generic companies have increasingly sought to challenge innovators basic patents covering major pharmaceutical products
