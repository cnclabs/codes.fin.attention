item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations for a cautionary note regarding forward looking statements 
the adverse impact of the continuing worldwide economic downturn on the demand for cruises could adversely impact our operating results  cash flows and financial condition 
the demand for cruises is affected by international  national and local economic conditions 
the current worldwide economic downturn has had an adverse effect on vacationers discretionary income and consumer confidence which has resulted in cruise booking slowdowns  decreased cruise prices and lower onboard revenues for us and for the others in the cruise industry 
we cannot predict the extent or duration of this downturn or the timing or strength of a subsequent economic recovery 
however  if the downturn continues for an extended period of time or worsens  we could experience a prolonged period of booking slowdowns  depressed cruise prices and reduced onboard revenues 
this could adversely impact our operating results  cash flows and financial condition including the impairment of the value of our ships  goodwill and other intangible assets 
we may not be able to obtain sufficient financing or capital for our needs or may not be able to do so on terms that are acceptable or consistent with our expectations 
to fund our capital expenditures and scheduled debt payments  we have historically relied on a combination of cash flows provided by operations  drawdowns under available credit facilities  the incurrence of additional indebtedness and the sale of equity or debt securities in private or public securities markets 
the decrease in consumer cruise spending as a result of the current economic environment is adversely impacting our cash flows from operations 
the disruption in the credit markets has resulted in a lack of liquidity worldwide which may affect our ability to successfully raise capital or to do so on acceptable terms 
these factors may prevent us from having sufficient available capital or financing to meet our needs or to do so on acceptable terms 
during  our credit rating was lowered from bbb with a negative outlook to bb with a negative outlook by standard and poor s 
in january  standard and poor s placed our credit rating on credit watch with negative implications 
in addition  our credit rating was lowered from ba with a stable outlook to ba with a negative outlook by moody s 
there is no assurance that our credit ratings will not be lowered further 
the lowering of our credit ratings may increase our cost of financing and can make it more difficult for us to access the financial markets 
see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources 
as of december   we had two ships of a new oasis class designated for royal caribbean international and four solstice class ships designated for celebrity cruises on order 
we expect to take delivery of celebrity equinox and oasis of the seas in july and november  respectively 
we have committed financing for all of the solstice class ships and have commitments for government financing guarantees from finnvera  the export credit agency of finland for of the financed amount of the oasis class ships 
we must still secure financing for oasis of the seas and allure of the seas  and  although we believe that we will be able to do so  there can be no assurance that we will be able to do so or that we will be able to do so on acceptable terms 
the impact of disruptions in the global financial markets may affect the ability of our counterparties and others to perform their obligations to us 
the economic events over the past several months  including recent failures of financial service companies and the related liquidity crisis  have disrupted the capital and credit markets 
these disruptions could cause our counterparties and others to breach their obligations to us under our contracts with them 
this could include failures of banks or other financial service companies to fund required borrowings under our loan agreements or to pay us amounts that may become due under our derivative contracts for hedging of fuel prices  interest rates and foreign currencies or other agreements 
if this occurs it may have a negative impact on our cash flows including our ability to meet our obligations  results of operations and financial condition 

table of contents the increase in capacity resulting from delivery of newbuilds currently on order within the cruise industry could further adversely impact the demand for cruises or cruise pricing 
a total of new ships are on order for delivery through in the cruise industry  six of which are ours 
the current worldwide economic downturn and tighter credit markets have already resulted in a weaker demand environment which has led to lower cruise prices and lower onboard purchases  all of which have adversely affected our revenues 
the further growth in capacity from these new ships  without an increase in the cruise industry s share of the vacation market  could further depress cruise prices  compounding with the current adverse economic environment to hinder our ability for a quick recovery 
we may lose business to competitors throughout the vacation market 
we operate in the vacation market and cruising is one of many alternatives for people choosing a vacation 
we therefore risk losing business not only to other cruise lines  but also to other vacation operators  which provide other leisure options including hotels  resorts and package holidays and tours 
we face significant competition from other cruise lines  both on the basis of cruise pricing and also in terms of the nature of ships and services we offer to passengers 
our principal competitors within the cruise vacation industry include carnival corporation plc  which owns  among others  aida cruises  carnival cruise lines  costa cruises  cunard line  holland america line  p o cruises and princess cruises and has a joint venture with orizonia corporation under which they operate iberocruceros  disney cruise line  msc cruises  norwegian cruise line and oceania cruises 
in the event that we do not compete effectively with other vacation alternatives and cruise companies  our results of operations and financial position could be adversely affected 
fears of terrorist and pirate attacks  war  and other hostilities and the spread of contagious diseases could have a negative impact on our results of operations 
events such as terrorist and pirate attacks  war  and other hostilities and the resulting political instability  travel restrictions  the spread of contagious diseases and concerns over safety  health and security aspects of traveling have had  and could have in the future  a significant adverse impact on demand and pricing in the travel and vacation industry 
these events could also impact our ability to source qualified crew from throughout the world at competitive costs and  therefore  increase our shipboard employee costs 
incidents or adverse publicity concerning the cruise vacation industry or unusual weather conditions could affect our reputation and harm our future sales and results of operations 
the operation of cruise ships involves the risk of accidents  illnesses and other incidents which may bring into question passenger safety  health  security and vacation satisfaction and create a perception that cruising is more dangerous than other vacation alternatives 
incidents involving cruise ships  adverse media publicity concerning the cruise vacation industry or unusual weather patterns or natural disasters  such as hurricanes and earthquakes  could impact demand and consequently have an adverse impact on our results of operations and on future industry performance 
environmental  health and safety  financial responsibility and other maritime regulations could affect operations and increase operating costs 
the united states and various state and foreign government or regulatory agencies have enacted or are considering new environmental regulations or policies  such as requiring the use of low sulfur fuels  increasing fuel efficiency requirements or further restricting emissions  that could adversely impact the cruise vacation industry 
some environmental groups have also lobbied for more stringent regulation of cruise ships and have generated negative publicity about the cruise vacation industry and its environmental impact 
in addition  we are subject to various international  national  state and local laws  regulations and treaties that govern  among 
table of contents other things  safety standards applicable to our ships  health and sanitary standards applicable to our passengers  security standards on board our ships and at the ship port interface areas  and financial responsibilities to our passengers 
these issues are  and we believe will continue to be  an area of focus by the relevant authorities throughout the world 
this could result in the enactment of more stringent regulation of cruise ships that would subject us to increasing compliance costs in the future 
conducting business internationally may result in increased costs and other risks 
we operate our business internationally and plan to continue to develop our international presence 
operating internationally exposes us to a number of risks 
examples include unstable local political or economic conditions and risk of increases in duties and taxes as well as changes in laws and policies affecting cruising  vacation or maritime businesses  or governing the operations of foreign based companies 
additional risks include currency fluctuations  interest rate movements  imposition of trade barriers and restrictions on repatriation of earnings 
if we are unable to address these risks adequately  our financial position and results of operations could be adversely affected 
we have ship construction contracts  which are denominated in euros 
while we have entered into euro denominated forward contracts to manage a portion of the currency risk associated with these ship construction contracts  we are exposed to fluctuations in the euro exchange rate for the portion of the ship construction contracts that has not been hedged 
if the shipyard is unable to perform under the related ship construction contract  any foreign currency hedges that were entered into to manage the currency risk would need to be terminated 
termination of these contracts could result in a significant loss 
our attempts to expand our business into new markets may not be successful 
historically our focus has been to serve the north american cruise market  which continues to be our primary source of cruise passengers 
we have expanded our focus to increase our international passenger sourcing  most recently  in the brazilian and australian markets 
expansion into new markets requires significant levels of investment 
there can be no assurance that these markets will develop as anticipated or that we will have success in these markets  and if we do not  we may be unable to recover our investment  which could adversely impact our business  financial condition and results of operations 
ship construction delays or mechanical faults may result in cancellation of cruises or unscheduled drydocks and repairs and thus adversely affect our results of operations 
we depend on shipyards to construct and deliver our cruise ships on a timely basis and in good working order 
the sophisticated nature of building a ship involves risks 
delays or mechanical faults in ship construction have in the past and may in the future result in delays or cancellation of cruises or necessitate unscheduled drydocks and repairs of ships 
we have  for example  experienced mechanical problems with the pod propulsion units on certain ships and there can be no assurance that we will not experience such problems in the future 
these events and any related adverse publicity could result in lost revenue  increased operating expenses  or both  and thus adversely affect our results of operations 
the current worldwide economic downturn is resulting in financial difficulties for shipyards and their subcontractors 
this may cause or result in delivery delays  ship cancellations or increases in shipbuilding costs that could adversely affect our results of operations 
the current downturn in the worldwide economy is causing a loss of business for shipyards and their subcontractors which could result in financial difficulties  liquidations or closures 
these events could adversely affect the timely delivery or costs of new ships or the ability of shipyards to repair and refurbish our existing fleet in accordance with our needs or expectations 
delivery delays and cancelled deliveries can adversely affect our results of operations  as can any constraints on our ability to repair and maintain our ships on a timely basis 
in addition  the cruise shipyard industry is undergoing consolidation  which could result in stronger bargaining power on the part of the shipyards  and thus higher prices for our future ship orders 

table of contents our operating costs and taxes could increase due to market forces and economic or geo political factors beyond our control 
our operating costs  including fuel  food  payroll  airfare for our shipboard personnel  insurance and security costs are subject to increases due to market forces and economic or political instability or other factors beyond our control 
increases in these operating costs could adversely affect our profitability 
in addition  the recent volatility in the price of fuel is making our ability to predict fuel prices extremely difficult 
united states  state and local authorities as well as foreign authorities periodically consider increases in taxes 
any such tax increases could also cause an increase in our costs 
unavailability of ports of call may adversely affect our results of operations 
we believe that port destinations are a major reason why passengers choose to go on a particular cruise or on a cruise vacation 
the availability of ports is affected by a number of factors  including  but not limited to  existing capacity constraints  security concerns  adverse weather conditions and natural disasters  financial limitations on port development  exclusivity arrangements that ports may have with our competitors  local governmental regulations and local community concerns about port development and other adverse impacts on their communities from additional tourists 
any limitations on the availability of our ports of call or on the availability of shore excursion and other service providers at such ports could adversely affect our results of operations 
price increases for commercial airline service for our passengers or major changes or reduction in commercial airline service could adversely impact the demand for cruises and undermine our ability to provide reasonably priced vacation packages to our passengers 
many of our passengers depend on scheduled commercial airline services to transport them to or from the ports where our cruises embark or disembark 
increases in the price of airfare would increase the overall price of the cruise vacation to our passengers which may adversely impact demand for our cruises 
in addition  changes in the availability of commercial airline services could adversely affect our passenger s ability to obtain airfare as well as our ability to fly our passengers to or from our cruise ships which could adversely affect our results of operations 
changes or disruptions to external distribution channels for our guest bookings could adversely affect our results of operations 
we rely on travel agencies to generate the majority of bookings for our ships 
if the current worldwide economic downturn continues for an extended period of time or worsens  these agencies could be adversely impacted and significant disruptions or contractions could occur to these businesses 
this could reduce the distribution channels available for us to market and sell our cruises 
if this were to occur  it could have an adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations 
the loss of key personnel or our inability to recruit or retain qualified personnel could adversely affect our results of operations 
our success depends  in large part  on the skills and contributions of key executives and other employees  and on our ability to recruit and retain high quality employees 
we must continue to recruit  retain and motivate management and other employees sufficient to maintain our current business and support our projected growth 
a loss of key employees could adversely affect our results of operations 
a change in our tax status under the united states internal revenue code  or other jurisdictions  may have adverse effects on our income 
we and a number of our subsidiaries are foreign corporations that derive income from a united states trade or business and or from sources within the united states 
drinker biddle reath llp  our united states tax counsel  has delivered to us an opinion  based on certain representations and assumptions set forth in it  to the effect that this income  to the extent derived from or incidental to the international operation of a ship or ships  is exempt from united states income tax pursuant to section of the internal revenue code 
we believe that most of our income including that of our subsidiaries is derived from or incidental to the international operation of a ship or ships 

table of contents it should also be noted that the provisions of section are subject to change at any time by legislation 
moreover  changes could occur in the future with respect to the identity  residence or holdings of our direct or indirect shareholders  or relevant foreign tax laws  that could affect our eligibility for the section exemption 
accordingly  there can be no assurance that we will continue to be exempt from united states income tax on united states source shipping income in the future 
if we were not entitled to the benefit of section  we and our subsidiaries would be subject to united states taxation on a portion of the income derived from or incidental to the international operation of our ships  which would reduce our net income 
see taxation of the company above for a discussion of such taxation in the absence of an exemption under section finally  changes in the income tax laws affecting our operations in malta  the united kingdom or elsewhere could result in higher income taxes being charged against our operations  resulting in lower net income 
we are controlled by principal shareholders that have the power to determine our policies  management and actions requiring shareholder approval 
as of february   a 
wilhelmsen as  a norwegian corporation indirectly owned by members of the wilhelmsen family of norway  owned approximately of our common stock and cruise associates  a bahamian general partnership indirectly owned by various trusts primarily for the benefit of certain members of the pritzker family and a trust primarily for the benefit of certain members of the ofer family  owned approximately of our common stock 
a sale of shares by a 
wilhelmsen as 
or cruise associates could cause a drop in our share prices 
a 
wilhelmsen as 
and cruise associates are parties to a shareholders agreement and have the power to determine  among other things our policies  the persons who will be our directors and officers  and actions requiring shareholder approval 
the shareholders agreement provides that our board of directors will consist of four nominees of a 
wilhelmsen as  four nominees of cruise associates and our chief executive officer 
during the term of the shareholders agreement  certain corporate actions require the approval of at least one director nominated by a 
wilhelmsen as 
and one director nominated by cruise associates 
our principal shareholders are not prohibited from engaging in a business that may compete with our business  subject to certain exceptions 
if any person other than a 
wilhelmsen as 
and cruise associates  our two principal shareholders  acquires ownership of more than of our common stock and our two principal shareholders  in the aggregate  own less of our common stock than such person and do not collectively have the right to elect  or to designate for election  at least a majority of the board of directors  we may be obligated to prepay indebtedness outstanding under the majority of our credit facilities  which we may be unable to replace on similar terms 
if this were to occur  it could have an adverse impact on our liquidity and operations 
we are not a united states corporation and our shareholders may be subject to the uncertainties of a foreign legal system in protecting their interests 
our corporate affairs are governed by our restated articles of incorporation and by laws and by the business corporation act of liberia 
the provisions of the business corporation act of liberia resemble provisions of the corporation laws of a number of states in the united states 
however  while most states have a fairly well developed body of case law interpreting their respective corporate statutes  there are very few judicial cases in liberia interpreting the business corporation act of liberia 
as such  the rights and fiduciary responsibilities of directors under liberian law are not as clearly established as the rights and fiduciary responsibilities of directors under statutes or judicial precedent in existence in certain united states jurisdictions 
for example  the right of shareholders to bring a derivative action in liberian courts may be more limited than in united states jurisdictions 
there may also be practical difficulties for shareholders attempting to bring suit in liberia and liberian courts may or may not recognize and enforce foreign judgments 
thus  our public shareholders may have more difficulty in protecting their interests with respect to actions by management  directors or controlling shareholders than would shareholders of a corporation incorporated in a united states jurisdiction 

table of contents litigation  enforcement actions  fines or penalties could adversely impact our financial condition or results of operations and or damage our reputation 
our business is subject to various united states and international laws and regulations that could lead to enforcement actions  fines  civil or criminal penalties or the assertion of litigation claims and damages 
in addition  improper conduct by our employees or agents could damage our reputation and or lead to litigation or legal proceedings that could result in civil or criminal penalties  including substantial monetary fines 
in certain circumstances it may not be economical to defend against such matters and or a legal strategy may not ultimately result in us prevailing in a matter 
such events could lead to an adverse impact on our financial condition or results of operations
