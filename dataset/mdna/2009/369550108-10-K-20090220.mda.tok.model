management overview general dynamics offers a broad portfolio of products and services in business aviation  combat vehicles  weapons systems and munitions  shipbuilding design and construction  and information systems  technologies and services 
we operate through four business groups aerospace  combat systems  marine systems and information systems and technology 
our primary customers are the us military  other us government organizations  the armed forces of other nations  and a diverse base of corporate  government and individual buyers of business aircraft 
we operate in two primary markets defense and business aviation 
the majority of our revenues derive from contracts with the us military 
logo the nation s engagement in the global war on terror  coupled with the need to modernize us military forces  has driven steady department of defense funding increases since in particular  procurement and research and development r d budgets  also known as investment accounts  provide the majority of our revenues 
defense department total  or top line  funding has increased at a compound annual growth rate of percent from fiscal through  while procurement and r d spending has grown nearly percent annually during that period 
for fiscal year  the congress appropriated billion for the department of defense  including approximately billion for procurement and r d 
budget expenditures generally lag congressional funding  and we expect that expenditures applied toward programs over the next few years will be consistent with defense funding appropriated in recent years 
our future growth potential in the us defense market is driven by the size of the defense budget  the allocation of that budget to investment accounts  the diversity of our exposure to different programs and customers within the budget  and our successful execution of the contracts we are awarded 
during this period of war  defense budgets have included the president s budget submission  as well as supplemental funds requested over the course of the fiscal year to meet the emergent needs of the warfighter 
for fiscal year  the congress appropriated billion in emergency spending  including approximately billion  or percent  for investment accounts 
for fiscal year  the congress has appropriated billion in supplemental funding  primarily for battlefield operational requirements 
the defense department has indicated that it will request at least another billion of supplemental funding in to include funds for procuring additional weaponry 
if this second supplemental is approved  defense funding for fiscal year will total approximately billion  a percent increase since looking ahead  we expect defense core budget top line growth to moderate 
in the near term  top line funding should remain at or near current well funded levels  led by the need to continue to support ongoing war operations 
while the landscape will continue to evolve in conjunction with the new administration s defense strategy as well as dynamic macroeconomic and geopolitical conditions  we expect near term defense funding levels to be driven primarily by the following continued support for the warfighter from the administration and the congress in the face of threats posed by an uncertain global security environment  the number of troops deployed in afghanistan and iraq  coupled with the increase in the overall size of the us military  the need to reset and replenish equipment and supplies damaged and consumed during the war  the need to maintain thousands of jobs that support the health of our nation s military infrastructure  and the need to modernize that infrastructure to address the evolving requirements of modern day warfare 
future supplemental funding levels will likely decrease in tandem with the administration s current plan to reduce troop levels in iraq  offset somewhat by an increased footprint in afghanistan 
as this supplemental spending decreases  some of the supplemental funding that had previously been used to finance core procurement programs will likely shift back to the base budget 
beyond our us defense market  governments around the world continue to fund weapons and equipment modernization programs  leading to significant defense export opportunities 
we are committed to pursuing international opportunities presented by international demand for military hardware and information technologies 
while the revenue upside can be significant  european and other international defense budgets are subject to unpredictable issues of contract award timing  defense priorities and overall fiscal spending pressures 
as we broaden the customer base for our defense products around the world  we expect growing international sales 
the business aviation market remained strong for much of while mid size order activity moderated from past years  gulfstream enjoyed continued strong order activity for its long range and ultra long range business jet offerings  including its new g product 
market conditions changed significantly  however  in the fourth quarter of as credit and financial markets seized in reaction to deteriorating global economic conditions 
this severe dislocation caused new aircraft order activity to slow 
this sudden financial turmoil affected some of gulfstream s customers who either sought deferral or defaulted on their aircraft orders 
general dynamics annual report 
table of contents these perturbations in the group s backlog had no impact to financial performance in due largely to the willingness of customers in the backlog to move up to earlier availabilities 
if the market continues to erode  additional defaults and deferrals may occur 
however  we believe the diversity and duration of the business jet order book positions the aerospace group to bridge the current market turmoil 
aircraft service revenues  which grew percent in  provide the group diversified exposure to after market sales fueled by recent growth in the global installed business jet fleet 
we believe continued investment in new aircraft products will drive long term growth  particularly when the aerospace group begins delivering its newest aircraft offerings  the g in and the g in we are committed to creating shareholder value through ethical business practices  disciplined program management and continuous operational improvements 
our solid performance is measured in our sustained revenue and earnings growth and strong cash flow 
general dynamics record as an industry leader in cash flow generation has provided our management the flexibility to execute our operational strategy  and enabled us to consistently deploy resources to further enhance shareholder returns through strategic and tactical acquisitions  payment of dividends and share repurchases 
consolidated overview the following discussion of our results of operations is based on operating performance at the business group level 
the disclosures focus on the material financial measures our management uses to evaluate the performance of each of our four business groups  including sales  operating earnings and margins  cash flow  and orders and backlog 
for the defense business groups  the discussion of results of operations is based on specific contracts and programs that drive the group s results rather than types of products and services  which often comprise multiple contracts with different customers 
for the aerospace group  the results are analyzed with respect to specific lines of products and services  consistent with how the group is managed 
in the defense business groups  the majority of the sales are generated by long term government contracts 
as discussed further in the application of critical accounting policies section  we account for sales under these contracts using the percentage of completion method of accounting 
under this method  revenue is recognized as work progresses  either as products are produced and delivered or as services are rendered  as applicable 
as a result  changes in sales are generally discussed in terms of volume 
volume indicates increases or decreases in sales due to changes in production or construction activity levels  changes in delivery schedules or levels of services on individual contracts 
in the aerospace group  we recognize revenue using the percentage of completion method 
sales contracts for new aircraft have two major phases the manufacture of the green aircraft and the aircraft s completion  which includes exterior painting and installation of customer selected interiors and optional avionics 
we record revenues on these contracts at two milestones when green aircraft are delivered to and accepted by the customer  and when the customer accepts final delivery of the aircraft 
revenues in the aerospace group s jet aviation aircraft outfitting business are recognized as work progresses  similar to our defense businesses 
aircraft services revenues are recognized upon delivery of services 
changes in sales in this group result from the number of new aircraft deliveries both green and completion  the progress toward completion of aircraft outfitting activities  the level of service activity during the period and the number of pre owned aircraft sold 
operating earnings and margins in the defense business groups are generally discussed in terms of changes in sales volume  performance  or the mix of contracts eg  fixed price cost reimbursable and the phases of work within those contracts eg  development production 
performance refers to changes in contract earnings rates during the term of the contract based on revisions to estimates of profit at completion on individual contracts 
these revisions result from increases or decreases to the estimated value of the contract and or the estimated costs required to complete the contract 
the following discussion of results provides additional disclosure to the extent that a material or unusual event causes a change in the profitability of a contract 
operating earnings and margins in the aerospace group are generally a function of the prices we are able to charge for our various aircraft models  the operational efficiency of the group in the manufacture and completion of the aircraft  and the mix of aircraft deliveries among the higher margin large cabin and lower margin mid size aircraft 
additional factors affecting the group s earnings and margins include the volume and profitability of services work performed  the number and type of pre owned aircraft sold  and the level of general and administrative costs incurred by the group  which include selling expenses and research and development costs

table of contents results of operations year ended december variance net sales operating earnings operating margin in  we achieved solid growth in sales and a significant increase in operating earnings compared with this strong performance during the year resulted in our highest operating margin in eight years backed by continued strong cash flows from operations 
we received a record level of orders in  ending the year with the highest backlog in our history 
each of our four business groups produced increases in sales in over the prior year 
sales growth in the aerospace and marine systems groups was particularly strong in as a result of continued increases in business jet aircraft deliveries and increased activity on us navy and commercial shipbuilding programs 
in the combat systems group  strong demand for us military vehicles and related support services drove the increase in sales 
higher activity in tactical and strategic mission systems contributed the majority of the sales growth in the information systems and technology group 
our operating earnings increased at more than double the rate of sales growth in  and three of our four business groups reported earnings in excess of billion 
growth in operating earnings exceeded the sales growth in all of our business groups due to strong program execution and a continued focus on operating performance 
overall  our operating margins increased basis points to percent in  the fifth consecutive year of margin expansion 
year ended december variance net sales operating earnings operating margin we produced significant sales growth in on the strength of rising sales in each of our business groups 
in particular  the combat systems and aerospace groups generated substantial sales growth in on us military vehicle sales and increased business jet deliveries 
sales in the information systems and technology group increased primarily as a result of the acquisition of anteon international corporation in mid sales were up slightly in the marine systems group compared with our operating earnings grew at a higher rate than sales in  as three of our four business groups achieved significant operating leverage 
the aerospace group s earnings and margins reflected the strength of improved pricing and ongoing productivity improvements 
operating earnings and margins were up in combat systems and marine systems due to improved operational execution across a variety of programs 
our overall operating margins improved basis points in to percent 
cash flow cash flows from operations in exceeded net earnings for the tenth consecutive year 
net cash provided by operating activities was billion in  billion in and billion in in addition  we generated over in cash in from the sale of several non core businesses 
over the three year period  we used our cash to fund acquisitions and capital expenditures  repurchase our common stock  pay dividends and repay maturing debt 
our net debt debt less cash and equivalents and marketable securities was billion at the end of compared with a net surplus of at the end of our net debt increased by billion during the year after billion spent on acquisitions  over billion of share repurchases  of dividends paid  of capital expenditures and more than of company sponsored research and development during the year 
other financial information general and administrative g a expenses as a percentage of sales declined to percent in from percent in and percent in  reflecting our continued emphasis on operating leverage 
g a was billion in  billion in and billion in we expect g a as a percent of sales to approximate the rate 
net interest expense was in compared with in and in interest income generated by our strong cash position has increased during each of the past three years while scheduled repayments of our long term debt have steadily reduced interest expense 
we expect net interest expense to increase to approximately to in due to the issuance of additional debt in our effective tax rate was percent in  percent in and percent in in  our taxes were reduced by a refund associated with the settlement of outstanding litigation 
this resulted in a  or approximately per share  benefit that reduced our tax rate by basis points

backlog and estimated potential contact value logo our total backlog increased almost percent in to billion at the end of the year 
funded backlog was billion at year end  up percent over we received billion of new orders in  the highest level in our history 
order activity was significant across each of our business groups  resulting in backlog growth in each group in the total backlog for our defense businesses increased percent in to billion  compared with billion at the end of the defense backlog represents the estimated remaining sales value of work to be performed under firm contracts 
the funded portion of this backlog was billion at the end of  up percent over this includes items that have been authorized and appropriated by the congress and funded by the customer  as well as commitments by international customers that are similarly approved and funded by their governments 
the unfunded backlog for the defense businesses represents firm orders that do not meet these criteria 
while there is no guarantee that future budgets and appropriations will provide funding for a given program  we have included in the backlog only firm contracts we believe are likely to receive funding 
the aerospace group s total backlog reached a record level of billion at year end compared with billion at the end of  an increase of more than percent 
the group s funded backlog increased almost percent during the year to billion at the end of the funded backlog represents orders for which we have definitive purchase contracts and deposits from the customer 
the aerospace unfunded backlog of at the end of consists of agreements to provide future aircraft maintenance and support services 
our backlog does not include work awarded under unfunded indefinite delivery  indefinite quantity idiq contracts  unexercised options associated with existing firm contracts or options to purchase new aircraft  which we refer to collectively as estimated potential contract value 
idiq contracts are used when the customer has not defined the exact timing and quantity of deliveries that will be required at the time the contract is executed 
these agreements  which set forth the majority of the contractual terms  including prices  are funded as delivery orders are placed 
a significant portion of our idiq value represents contracts for which we have been designated as the sole source supplier to design  develop  produce and integrate complex products and systems over several years for the military or other government agencies 
management believes the customers intend to fully implement these systems 
the estimated potential contract value also includes our estimate of the value we will receive under multiple award idiq contracts in which we are one of several companies competing for task orders under the contract 
because the value of these arrangements is subject to the customer s future exercise of an indeterminate quantity of delivery orders  we recognize these contracts in backlog only when they are funded 
contract options in our defense businesses represent agreements to perform additional work beyond the products and services associated with firm contracts  if the customer exercises the option 
these options are negotiated in conjunction with a firm contract and provide the terms under which the customer may elect to procure additional units or services at a future date 
contract options in the aerospace group represent options to purchase new aircraft  including long term option agreements with fleet customers 
we recognize options in backlog when the customer exercises the option and establishes a firm order 
as of december   the estimated potential value associated with these idiq contracts and contract options was approximately billion  up from billion at the end of we expect to realize this value over the next to years 
this represents management s estimate of the potential value we will receive 
the actual amount of funding received in the future may be higher or lower 
review of operating segments aerospace results of operations and outlook year ended december variance net sales operating earnings operating margin aircraft deliveries in units green completion general dynamics annual report 
table of contents the aerospace group generated significant sales growth in  attributable primarily to increased aircraft deliveries compared with the group increased aircraft production rates for the fifth consecutive year in in response to a steadily growing aircraft backlog 
as a result  new aircraft sales increased percent in sequential years of higher new aircraft deliveries have expanded the group s worldwide installed base of business jet aircraft 
as a result  demand in the group s aircraft services business grew in  with volume up percent compared to our november acquisition of jet aviation  a business jet outfitting and aviation services company  also contributed to the group s sales growth 
approximately one quarter of the group s increase in sales in came from the addition of jet aviation 
pre owned aircraft sales were in  down from in the group had four pre owned aircraft available for sale on december  the aerospace group s operating earnings increased at a significantly higher rate than sales in the following factors impacted the group s growth in operating earnings during the year increased aircraft deliveries pricing  delivery mix and productivity improvements increased aircraft services pre owned aircraft activity general and administrative expenses total increase in operating earnings operating earnings and margins on the group s aircraft deliveries were up compared with the units delivered in  the result of improved pricing on aircraft orders over the past several years 
the group also continued to generate productivity improvements in the aircraft assembly and outfitting processes  which further improved earnings in in late  the number of pre owned aircraft transactions was significantly curtailed in response to the deterioration of the global economic environment 
as a result  the group wrote down the carrying value of the four pre owned aircraft available for sale at year end 
the group s earnings growth was also tempered by increased selling expenses from strong order activity and higher product development costs associated with the introduction of two new aircraft models in the net effect of these factors was a basis point increase in operating margins in  following two years of basis point improvement 
the significant deterioration in the economic environment in late weakened the global demand for business jets  particularly in the mid size aircraft segment 
as a consequence of these conditions and the relatively short duration of the group s mid size backlog  we plan to significantly reduce mid size aircraft production in given the substantial level and duration of the large cabin aircraft backlog  we expect to increase production of these models in however  we assess aircraft production requirements quarterly and will modify the group s production and delivery schedule as necessary based on the state of our backlog and market conditions 
we also expect more pre owned activity in than we experienced in or of the contracts for aircraft deliveries  approximately include aircraft trade in options  which the customers may elect to exercise 
including the effect of a full year of results of jet aviation  we expect the aerospace group s sales to increase between and percent over we expect the group s operating margins to be to basis points lower than those achieved in due primarily to the increase in aircraft services volume associated with the jet aviation acquisition 
year ended december variance net sales operating earnings operating margin aircraft deliveries in units green completion the aerospace group s sales and operating earnings increased significantly in over to meet growing global demand  the group increased aircraft production in resulting in new aircraft sales growth of percent compared with the prior year 
aircraft services volume also increased percent over sales of pre owned aircraft decreased to in from in as favorable market conditions led more customers to sell their own aircraft rather than trade them in 
operating earnings in increased approximately as a result of the higher new aircraft and aircraft services volume 
the earnings growth was also driven by improved pricing on units delivered in compared with as well as labor efficiencies and productivity improvements  particularly in the aircraft completion process 
these factors contributed a increase in earnings in higher selling and g a costs and product development spending reduced the group s earnings growth by approximately  and lower sales of pre owned aircraft reduced the earnings growth by backlog and estimated potential contract value logo general dynamics annual report 
table of contents the aerospace group s backlog increased percent in to billion at year end  the largest backlog in the group s history 
the group s funded backlog was billion at year end  up percent over in  the group received billion in new orders  a record level for the fifth consecutive year and an increase of percent over in addition  the acquisition of jet aviation in the fourth quarter added approximately to the group s backlog related to agreements to perform outfitting work for other equipment manufacturers 
in the second quarter of  the group began taking orders for the gulfstream g  a new ultra long range  ultra large cabin business jet that is scheduled to enter service in in the fourth quarter  the group introduced and began taking orders for the gulfstream g  a new super mid size business jet that is scheduled to enter service in the group experienced strong demand in north america as well as a growing proportion of international orders in over percent of the group s orders in were from customers outside north america for the second year in a row 
the group s backlog includes scheduled aircraft deliveries for large cabin models through periods ranging from to the backlog does not include options to purchase new aircraft  including long term agreements with fleet customers 
these options totaled billion at the end of and are included in estimated potential contract value 
as a result of the sharp decline in global economic conditions in  the group had some customers default on their contracts late in the fourth quarter 
these defaults had no impact on the group s deliveries 
we were able to fill those production slots with other customers who were interested in moving forward in the delivery queue 
despite the defaults  the backlog grew in as the group achieved a book to bill ratio aircraft orders divided by deliveries greater than one for the fifth consecutive year 
while the backlog continues to have some risk  particularly if the economic climate worsens  we will continue to work with customers to minimize the future impact to the group s performance 
logo represents ratio of new aircraft orders to deliveries in units during the year 
the following table summarizes key unit data for gulfstream aircraft orders and backlog year ended december new orders options exercised firm orders as of december firm contracts in backlog completions in backlog represents aircraft that have moved from green production to the completion process as of year end 
the backlog includes only the value of the completion effort on these aircraft 
combat systems results of operations and outlook year ended december variance net sales operating earnings operating margin the combat systems group s net sales increased in compared with the group s sales growth was driven by its us military vehicle business us military vehicles weapons systems and munitions european military vehicles total increase in sales the increase in us military vehicle sales was driven primarily by higher activity on the group s mine resistant  ambush protected mrap vehicle program and several contracts in support of the group s abrams main battle tank modernization efforts 
under the mrap program  which emerged in late  the group produces rg and cougar armored vehicles for the us department of defense 
the group is scheduled to complete deliveries of its remaining rg mrap vehicles under contract in the first quarter of under the abrams program  volume was up most notably in on the system enhancement package sep upgrade and on contracts to repair and reset battle damaged m tanks 
sales in the group s weapons systems business decreased in due to fewer deliveries of systems that help protect us combat forces from improvised explosive devices ieds 
sales increased slightly on the group s munitions programs over  particularly on its large and medium caliber munitions supply contracts for the united states and canada 
general dynamics annual report 
table of contents in the group s european military vehicles business  volume was lower during the year on several international military vehicle programs including the leopard tank program with the spanish government 
the decrease in sales in on these programs was offset slightly by increased volume on the group s piranha wheeled armored vehicle contract for belgium and higher activity within the group s mobile bridge business 
in december  the group received a notice of termination from the czech republic regarding its contract to deliver pandur ii military vehicles 
in the second quarter of  we entered into a memorandum of understanding and a testing agreement with the czech republic regarding the testing and acceptance of vehicles that had been completed by the group 
we are negotiating a revised contract for the purchase of vehicles  including the completed vehicles 
we do not believe the outcome of the negotiations will have a material effect on the group s operating results 
due to ongoing negotiations  there were no sales recognized under this contract in  but we expect to continue production upon finalization of the revised contract 
the combat systems group s operating earnings grew significantly in  increasing at more than four times the rate of sales growth during the year 
while the most significant driver of the group s earnings growth was improved performance in the us military vehicle business  particularly on the mrap and abrams programs  each of the group s businesses generated at least a basis point increase in margins in the operating leverage achieved across combat systems operations in produced an overall basis point improvement in the group s operating margins compared with on december   we acquired axletech international axletech of troy  michigan 
axletech is a global manufacturer and supplier of highly engineered axles  suspensions  brakes and aftermarket parts for heavy payload vehicles for a variety of military and commercial customers 
we expect combat systems to produce sales growth of approximately to percent in  including the addition of axletech s revenues 
we expect the group s operating margins to return to a more sustainable mid percent level in year ended december variance net sales operating earnings operating margin in  combat systems generated the greatest growth in sales and operating earnings among our four business groups 
each of the group s businesses experienced double digit sales and earnings growth over more than half of the growth resulted from increased volume in the group s us military vehicle business  including higher activity on abrams related contracts and the stryker wheeled combat vehicle program  the ramp up of production of light armored vehicles lavs for the us marine corps  and increased production of mrap military vehicles 
sales increased almost percent in the group s munitions business in due to strong volume in its large and medium caliber munitions supply contracts and the acquisition of snc technologies inc in january in the group s weapons systems business  sales grew percent in due primarily to increased activity on its counter ied contract 
the european military vehicle business experienced sales growth of almost percent in this growth resulted primarily from increased activity on pandur and piranha wheeled vehicle contracts for several european governments 
the group s operating margins increased basis points in compared with due to a shift in contract mix and improved performance across a number of the group s wheeled military vehicle programs 
the margin growth was limited somewhat by the inclusion of lower margin acquisitions in the munitions business  increased supplier costs on the group s small caliber munitions contract and costs recognized in connection with our exit from the group s european commercial trading business 
backlog and estimated potential contract value logo the combat systems group s total backlog was billion at the end of  an increase of percent over funded backlog grew percent in to billion at year end 
the group s backlog consists primarily of long term production contracts that have scheduled deliveries through the group s backlog on december   included approximately billion for m abrams main battle tank modernization and upgrade programs 
these include the ma sep  abrams integrated management aim and tank urban survivability kit tusk programs 
under the sep program  we retrofit ma abrams main battle tanks with improved electronics  command and control capabilities and armor enhancements that are designed to improve the tank s effectiveness

the growth in the group s sales consisted of the following mature navy ship production commercial ship production navy design and early stage production other total increase in sales approximately percent of the marine systems group s sales in both and were produced by three mature ship production programs for the us navy the virginia class submarine  the t ake combat logistics ship and the arleigh burke class ddg destroyer 
activity increased on the virginia program in as the group continued construction on its cost reimbursable block i contract and its fixed price block ii contract

deliveries are scheduled through activity on the arleigh burke destroyer program decreased slightly in compared with the group delivered two destroyers in  and construction is in process on the remaining four ships under contract with deliveries scheduled through the group s product carrier program produced the increase in commercial shipbuilding volume in construction of the first three ships ramped up in  and the first ship was delivered in early the next two ships are scheduled to be delivered in the second half of in addition to the large ship construction programs  sales increased on the group s design and early stage production contracts for the navy 
most notably  volume increased on the group s ddg next generation destroyer program 
the completion of the group s ssgn submarine conversion contract in the fourth quarter of slightly offset the other volume increases in the group in the marine systems group improved its performance significantly in  increasing operating earnings at double the rate of sales growth 
as a result of operational efficiencies realized at each of its shipyards  the group increased program earnings rates in on the virginia  ddg  t ake and commercial product carrier programs 
these improvements generated an overall basis point increase in the group s operating margins over we expect sales growth in the marine systems group of approximately to percent in as the group continues to deliver on its record backlog 
we expect the group s operating margins to increase slightly with continued operating efficiencies at each of the shipyards 
year ended december variance net sales operating earnings operating margin the marine systems group s sales were up slightly in compared with combined sales from the virginia class  t ake and arleigh burke destroyer programs in were essentially unchanged compared with activity was up significantly on the t ake contract  but volume on the virginia and arleigh burke programs declined in volume was up across the group s ship design  engineering  repair and overhaul  and early stage construction programs for the navy  including the detail design of the ddg and the construction of the first littoral combat ship lcs 
volume on these two programs increased more than percent in compared with additionally  activity was up more than percent on the group s engineering  repair and overhaul contracts for the navy in  particularly in the group s nuclear submarine support and logistics services business 
combined sales on the group s ssgn submarine conversion program and commercial ship construction programs decreased more than percent during the year as the group completed its fourth and final ssgn submarine conversion in and its four ship commercial tanker program in the marine systems group s operating earnings and margins grew significantly in on steady sales 
the group generated operating efficiencies that led to improved performance on several of its key programs  including the virginia class submarine  the arleigh burke class destroyer and the ssgn submarine conversions 
additionally  we reached an agreement with the navy in to restructure the t ake contract 
the agreement included a resolution of an outstanding request for equitable adjustment rea  which resulted in revised pricing on ships one through nine and the addition of five option ships 
prior to the agreement  we recognized revenue on the t ake program at a break even level pending the resolution of the rea 
after the contract restructuring  the program estimate at completion was revised  and we began recognizing profit on the contract in the second quarter of backlog and estimated potential contract value logo the marine systems group s backlog consists of long term submarine and ship construction programs  as well as numerous repair and engineering contracts 
at the end of  the group s backlog reached an all time high of billion  more than double the billion backlog at the end of the group s funded backlog increased percent in to billion at the end of the year 
the group generally receives large contract awards that provide backlog for several years 
the current backlog includes shipbuilding deliveries through the virginia class submarine program is the largest contract in the group s backlog 
the group s backlog at year end included billion for virginia class submarines to be delivered through the group received billion in virginia class orders in  including a billion block iii award for the construction of eight submarines 
the contract included billion of funding for construction of the first ship and long lead materials for the second ship

information systems and technology results of operations and outlook year ended december variance net sales operating earnings operating margin the information systems and technology group s net sales exceeded billion for the first time in  with the most significant growth over coming from the group s tactical and strategic mission systems business 
the group s increase in sales in was attributable to the following us defense commercial wireless united kingdom total increase in sales the group s us defense market consists of the tactical and strategic mission systems  information technology it and mission services  and intelligence mission systems businesses 
the tactical and strategic mission systems business generated double digit sales growth in this growth resulted from increased activity on several key us military programs  such as the warfighter information network tactical win t program and the common hardware software iii chs program  as well as higher volume on the group s ground based satellite communications programs 
the group provides fast  secure  mobile command and control capabilities to warfighters under win t  and commercial and ruggedized computers  network equipment and software to the us armed forces and other federal agencies worldwide under chs sales were up in the group s core it services business due primarily to the ramp up of activity on several new programs  including the group s contract to provide technology operations and maintenance infrastructure support tomis services for the us bureau of citizenship and immigration and the warfighter field operations customer support focus contract 
under the warfighter focus program  the group provides support for the army s live  virtual and constructive training operations 
sales in the group s intelligence mission systems business remained steady compared with the group s commercial wireless operations experienced significantly lower activity in due to reduced demand in the market 
however  sales in the commercial wireless business appeared to stabilize in the second half of sales decreased in the group s united kingdom business due to a scheduled decline in activity on the bowman communications program for the uk armed forces  offset in part by higher activity on other command  control  communications  computing and intelligence systems ci programs 
the bowman program has reached a steady state level of volume for the foreseeable future as the group continues ongoing logistics support and sustainment activity 
the information systems and technology group s operating earnings increased at a rate consistent with sales growth 
as a result  the group was able to maintain a percent operating margin  equaling despite an increased proportion of lower margin service work 
we expect percent sales growth in the information systems and technology group in with contributions from each of the group s businesses 
we expect operating margins to be down to basis points compared with based on the scheduled contract mix in year ended december variance net sales operating earnings operating margin sales in the information systems and technology group improved in compared with  and operating earnings topped billion for the first time 
the group experienced percent organic growth in its core north american tactical and strategic mission systems and it and general dynamics annual report 
table of contents mission services businesses 
the strong performance in the tactical and strategic mission systems business was due to higher activity on programs such as combat operations centers coc  chs and mobile user objective system muos as well as increased volume on the group s ground based satellite communications programs 
the it and mission services business benefited from the acquisition of anteon international corporation anteon in june and higher volume in its core defense market on the strength of such programs as intelligence information  command and control equipment and enhancements ice and network centric solutions netcents 
these increases were offset partially by an expected decline in volume on the uk bowman program  reduced activity in the group s intelligence mission systems business and a decline in activity in the commercial wireless market 
the group s operating margins were down by basis points compared with due to the group s shift to include more it services content  including the acquisition of anteon 
backlog and estimated potential contract value logo the information systems and technology group s backlog grew percent in to billion at year end  reflecting a book to bill ratio in dollars of for the year 
the group s funded backlog on december increased slightly compared with to billion  representing approximately percent of the group s total backlog 
unlike our other defense businesses  the information systems and technology group s backlog consists of thousands of contracts that have to be reconstituted each year with new program and task order awards  and relatively few large scale  long term programs 
some of the more significant programs are highlighted below 
the army s win t program comprised over of the group s backlog at the end of information systems and technology is the prime contractor on this battlefield communications network program that is designed to provide warfighters with fast  secure  mobile command and control capabilities 
in  the group received approximately of awards for win t  including a contract to provide specialized satellite communications earth terminals and technical support services for the first increment of the program 
the group s backlog at year end also included approximately for the ice program 
ice was the information systems and technology group s largest single program in and supports critical intelligence and command and control systems and networks for us defense and intelligence operations worldwide 
in  the group received ice orders of  bringing the total contract value since inception to billion 
approximately of the group s backlog at year end was for the canadian maritime helicopter project mhp 
under the mhp program  the group provides integrated mission systems for state of the art helicopters that are intended to replace canada s aging fleet of marine helicopters 
other programs that made up a significant portion of the group s year end backlog include approximately for chs  for netcents and for rescue  the search and rescue system for the us coast guard 
the group received in orders under chs and over of orders under the rescue program in in addition to these programs  the group received a number of significant contract awards in  including the following a contract from the national geospatial intelligence agency worth approximately to plan  engineer  design  install  test and operate the agency s it infrastructure 
the contract has a total potential value of approximately if all options are exercised 
a contract worth approximately for the system development and demonstration of the integrated computer system for the army s fcs program  bringing the total contract value to approximately a contract from the us marine corps worth to produce units of the next generation tactical data network tdn data distribution systems modular dds m  which provides secure  networked communication capabilities for deployed forces

an award valued at to develop and integrate the maritime and fixed site joint tactical radio capabilities and provide information assurance services for the airborne maritime and fixed site amf joint tactical radio system jtrs 
the contract has a potential value of over a order to build the spacecraft for nasa s landsat data continuity mission 
the group is designing and fabricating the spacecraft as well as providing testing and on orbit engineering support 
the group s backlog does not include approximately billion of estimated potential contract value associated with its anticipated share of idiq contracts and unexercised options 
the value of these arrangements may be realized over the next years 
in  funding under idiq contracts and options contributed over billion  more than percent of the group s orders  to the group s backlog  most notably from ice  chs and win t 
information systems and technology was awarded several significant idiq contracts during the group was awarded a contract with a potential value of over billion for the warfighter focus program

operating activities we generated cash from operating activities of billion in  billion in and billion in in each year  the two primary drivers of our cash flow were net earnings and increasing levels of customer deposits in the aerospace group 
in  the cash flows from operating activities included the collection of approximately of contract funds upon resolution of the marine systems group s request for equitable adjustment on the t ake contract 
in  net earnings generated the majority of our operating cash flows  though approximately of the net earnings related to a net gain on the sale of non core businesses 
the cash flow from these sales is reported in investing activities 
termination of a program 
as discussed further in note o to the consolidated financial statements  litigation on the a program termination has been ongoing since if  contrary to our expectations  the default termination ultimately is sustained  we  along with the boeing company  could collectively be required to repay the us government as much as billion for progress payments received for the a contract  plus interest  which was approximately billion at december  if this were the outcome  we would owe half of the total  or approximately billion pretax 
our after tax cash obligation would be approximately we believe we have sufficient resources  including access to capital markets  to pay such an obligation  if required 
investing activities we used billion in  in and billion in for investing activities 
the primary uses of cash in investing activities were business acquisitions and capital expenditures 
in and  these uses of cash were partially reduced by proceeds from divestiture activities 
business acquisitions 
in  we completed five acquisitions for a total of billion

net sales of these securities were in compared with net purchases of in and in financing activities we used in  in and in for financing activities 
our typical financing activities are issuances and repayments of debt  payment of dividends and repurchases of common stock 
net cash from financing activities also includes proceeds received from stock option exercises 
debt proceeds  net 
on december   we issued billion of five year fixed rate debt pursuant to a form s registration statement filed with the securities and exchange commission under the securities act of on december  we used the proceeds for general corporate purposes  including working capital requirements  capital expenditures  refinancing of existing indebtedness including commercial paper  and financing of acquisitions 
we received net proceeds from commercial paper issuances in of  which were used primarily to fund business acquisitions 
we had no commercial paper outstanding at the end of or we have approximately billion in bank credit facilities that have not been drawn upon 
these facilities provide backup liquidity to our commercial paper program

there were no material debt repayments in in  we repaid of our fixed rate debt on the scheduled maturity date 
there are no material repayments of long term debt scheduled until the third quarter of dividends 
our board of directors declared an increased quarterly dividend of per share on march   the th consecutive annual increase 
the board had previously increased the quarterly dividend to per share in march and per share in march share repurchases

we repurchased million shares in and million shares in on the open market 
as of december   approximately million shares were authorized for repurchase by our board of directors about percent of our total shares outstanding 
non gaap management metrics our management emphasizes the efficient conversion of net earnings into cash and the deployment of that cash to maximize shareholder returns 
in  for the tenth consecutive year  net cash provided by operating activities exceeded net earnings 
we deployed this cash to complete acquisitions  continue our trend of annual dividend increases and repurchase our outstanding shares 
as a result of this continued focus on cash generation and disciplined capital deployment  our return on invested capital roic increased by basis points during to percent 
our roic has grown basis points since logo we believe roic is a useful measure for investors  because it reflects our ability to generate returns from the capital we have deployed in our operations 
we use roic to evaluate investment decisions and as a performance measure in evaluating management 
we define roic as net operating profit after taxes divided by the sum of the average debt and shareholders equity for the year 
net operating profit after taxes is defined as earnings from continuing operations plus after tax interest and amortization expense

we believe free cash flow from operations is a useful measure for investors  because it portrays our ability to generate cash from our core businesses for purposes such as repaying maturing debt  funding business acquisitions  repurchasing our common stock and paying dividends 
we use free cash flow from operations to assess the quality of our earnings and as a performance measure in evaluating management

application of critical accounting policies management s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles gaap 
the preparation of financial statements in accordance with gaap requires that we make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements  as well as the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to long term contracts and programs  goodwill and other intangible assets  income taxes  pensions and other post retirement benefits  workers compensation  warranty obligations  pre owned aircraft inventory  and contingencies and litigation 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
the results of these estimates form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily available from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following policies are critical and require the use of significant business judgment in their application revenue recognition 
we account for sales and earnings in our defense and aerospace businesses using the percentage of completion method of accounting 
under the percentage of completion method  we recognize contract revenue as the work progresses either as the products are produced and delivered or as services are rendered  as applicable 
we estimate profit as the difference between total estimated revenue and total estimated cost of a contract and recognize that profit over the remaining life of the contract based on either input measures eg  costs incurred or output measures eg  contract milestones or units delivered  as appropriate to the circumstances 
where an interim output measure is reliably determinable and representative of progress toward completion  we use such output measures 
otherwise  we use input measures 
we generally measure progress toward completion on contracts in our defense businesses based on the proportion of costs incurred to date relative to total estimated costs at completion or based on unit deliveries under the contract 
our contracts for the manufacture of business jet aircraft usually provide for two major phases the manufacture of the green aircraft ie  before exterior painting and installation of customer selected interiors and optional avionics and its completion 
we record revenue at two contractual milestones when green aircraft are delivered to  and accepted by  the customer and when the customer accepts final delivery of the fully outfitted aircraft 
we do not recognize revenue at green delivery unless a contract has been executed with the customer and the customer can be expected to satisfy its obligations under the contract  as evidenced by the receipt of deposits from the customer and other factors 
we follow the guidelines of american institute of certified public accountants aicpa statement of position  accounting for performance of construction type and certain production type contracts 
however  we include revisions of estimated profits on contracts in earnings under the reallocation method  in accordance with accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting changes which has been superseded by statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting changes and error corrections  rather than the cumulative catch up method 
under the reallocation method  the impact of revisions in estimates is recognized prospectively over the remaining contract term  while under the cumulative catch up method such impact would be recognized immediately 
if a revised estimate of contract profitability reveals an anticipated loss on the contract  we recognize the loss in the period it is identified 
anticipated losses cover all costs allocable to the contracts  including g a expenses on government contracts 
we use the reallocation method because we believe the majority of factors that typically result in changes in estimates of total contract revenue  total costs or the extent of progress toward completion on our long term contracts affect both the period in which the change is identified and future periods 
we believe these changes generally reflect expectations as to future performance and  therefore  the reallocation method is the method that best matches our revenues and earnings in the periods in which they are earned 
while we have applied this method consistently for more than years  most contractors use the cumulative catch up method 
the percentage of completion method of accounting involves the use of various estimating techniques to project costs at completion  and in some cases includes estimates of recoveries asserted against the customer for changes in specifications 
contract estimates involve various assumptions and projections relative to the outcome of future events over a period of several years  including future labor productivity and availability  the nature and complexity of the work to be performed  the cost and availability of materials  the impact of delayed performance  the availability and timing of funding from the customer  and the timing of product deliveries 
these estimates are based on our best judgment 
a significant change in one or more of these estimates could affect the profitability of one or more general dynamics annual report 
table of contents of our contracts 
we review our contract estimates periodically to assess revisions in contract values and estimated costs at completion and reflect changes in estimates in the current and future periods under the reallocation method 
we recognize revenue arising from claims either as income or as an offset against a potential loss only when the amount of the claim can be estimated reliably and its realization is probable 
in evaluating these criteria  we consider the contractual legal basis for the claim  the cause of any additional costs incurred  the reasonableness of those costs and the objective evidence available to support the claim 
we recognize revenue from award or incentive fees when there is a basis to reasonably estimate the amount of the fee 
estimates of award or incentive fees are based on actual award experience and anticipated performance 
goodwill 
since  we have acquired businesses at a total cost of almost billion  including five in in connection with these acquisitions  we have recognized billion of goodwill 
goodwill represents the purchase price paid in excess of the fair value of identifiable net tangible and intangible assets acquired 
goodwill is not amortized but is subject to an impairment test on an annual basis and when circumstances indicate that an impairment is more likely than not 
the test for goodwill impairment is a two step process that requires a significant level of estimation by management  particularly the estimate of the fair value of our reporting units 
these estimates require the use of judgment 
we estimate the fair value of our reporting units based on the discounted projected cash flows of the underlying operations 
this requires numerous assumptions  including the timing of work embedded in our backlog  our performance and profitability under our contracts  our success in securing future business  and the appropriate interest rate used to discount the projected cash flows 
this discounted cash flow analysis is corroborated by top down analyses  including a market assessment of our enterprise value 
beyond the annual impairment test  factors that may lead us to perform a goodwill impairment test include a significant adverse change in the business climate for one of our reporting units or a decision to dispose of a reporting unit or a significant portion of a reporting unit 
we have recorded no goodwill impairment to date and do not anticipate any reasonably possible circumstances that would lead to an impairment in the foreseeable future 
commitments and contingencies 
we are subject to litigation and other legal proceedings arising either out of the ordinary course of our business or under provisions relating to the protection of the environment 
estimating liabilities and costs associated with these matters requires the use of judgment 
we record a charge against earnings when a liability associated with claims or pending or threatened litigation matters is probable and when our exposure is reasonably estimable 
the ultimate resolution of our exposure related to these matters may change as further facts and circumstances become known 
deferred contract costs 
certain costs incurred in the performance of our government contracts are recorded under gaap but are not currently allocable to contracts 
such costs include a portion of our estimated workers compensation  other insurance related assessments  pension and other post retirement benefits  and environmental expenses 
these costs will become allocable to contracts generally when they are paid 
as permitted by aicpa audit and accounting guide  federal government contractors  we have elected to defer or inventory these costs in contracts in process until they are paid  at which time the costs are charged to contracts and recovered from the government 
we expect to recover these costs through ongoing business  including existing backlog and probable follow on contracts 
this business base includes numerous contracts for which we are the sole source or one of two suppliers on long term defense programs 
we regularly assess the probability of recovery of these costs under our current and probable follow on contracts 
this assessment requires that we make assumptions about future contract costs  the extent of cost recovery under our contracts and the amount of future contract activity 
these estimates are based on our best judgment 
if the backlog in the future does not support the continued deferral of these costs  the profitability of our remaining contracts could be adversely affected 
retirement plans 
our defined benefit pension and other post retirement benefit costs and obligations depend on various assumptions and estimates 
the key assumptions relate to the interest rates used to discount estimated future liabilities and projected long term rates of return on plan assets 
we determine the discount rate used each year based on the rate of return currently available on a portfolio of high quality fixed income investments with a maturity that is consistent with the projected benefit payout period 
we determine the long term rate of return on assets based on historical returns and the current and expected asset allocation strategy 
these estimates are based on our best judgment  including consideration of current and future market conditions 
in the event a change in any of the assumptions is warranted  future pension and post retirement benefit cost could increase or decrease 
the following hypothetical changes in the discount rate and expected long term rate of return on plan assets for our commercial pension and post retirement benefit plans would have had the following impact on increase bps decrease bps increase decrease to net pension cost from change in discount rate change in long term rate of return on plan assets increase decrease to post retirement benefit cost from change in discount rate change in long term rate of return on plan assets as discussed under deferred contract costs  our contractual arrangements with the us government provide for the recovery of contributions to our government retirement plans 
as permitted by aicpa audit and accounting guide  federal government contractors  we have elected to defer recognition of the cumulative net unfunded benefit cost in our government plans to provide a better matching of revenues and expenses 
as such  the impact on the retirement benefit cost for these plans that general dynamics annual report 
table of contents results from annual changes in assumptions does not impact our future earnings either positively or negatively 
we believe that our judgment is applied consistently and produces financial information that fairly depicts the results of operations for all periods presented

in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
revised  business combinations 
sfas r changes the requirements for accounting for business combinations  including the determination of purchase price and assignment of purchase price to acquired assets and assumed liabilities 
the primary effect of sfas r is to increase earnings volatility associated with business combinations  including a requirement to charge acquisition and restructuring costs to earnings rather than including the costs in the purchase price  and a modification of the guidelines for recognizing intangible assets  which may increase the value assigned to intangible assets and the resulting amortization expense associated with future acquisitions 
sfas r is effective for our acquisitions that are completed after december  item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risk  primarily from foreign currency exchange rates  interest rates  commodity prices and investments 
foreign currency risk our foreign currency exchange rate risk relates to receipts from customers  payments to suppliers and certain inter company transactions denominated in currencies other than our or one of our subsidiaries functional currency 
we may enter into foreign currency forward contracts from time to time to fix  or limit the adverse impact on  the amount of firmly committed and forecasted non functional payments  receipts and inter company transactions related to our ongoing business and operational financing activities 
these contracts are designed to minimize our risk when we enter into transactions outside our functional currency 
we do not use derivatives for trading or speculative purposes 
on december  and  we had billion and billion  respectively  in notional forward and option contracts outstanding 
a percent unfavorable exchange rate movement in our portfolio of foreign currency forward contracts would have resulted in an incremental recognized pretax loss of in and in  and an incremental unrecognized pretax loss of in and in this exchange rate sensitivity relates primarily to changes in the us dollar canadian dollar  euro swiss franc  pound sterling euro and us dollar euro exchange rates 
we believe these hypothetical recognized and unrecognized losses would be offset by corresponding gains in the remeasurement of the underlying transactions being hedged 
we believe these forward and option contracts and the offsetting underlying commitments  when taken together  do not create material market risk 
interest rate risk financial instruments subject to interest rate risk include fixed rate long term debt obligations  variable rate commercial paper and short term investments 
on december   we had billion par value of fixed rate debt and in commercial paper outstanding 
our fixed rate debt obligations are not putable  and we do not trade these securities in the market 
a percent unfavorable interest rate movement would not have a material impact on the fair value of our debt obligations 
we have credit facilities with major banks of billion expiring in july and expiring in december these facilities are required by rating agencies to support the a p rating of our commercial paper issuances 
we may renew or replace  in whole or in part  the facility that expires in july commodity price risk we are also subject to risk of rising labor and commodity prices  primarily on long term fixed price contracts 
to the extent possible  we include terms in our contracts that are designed to protect us from this risk 
some of the protective terms included in our contracts are considered derivatives but are not accounted for separately because they are clearly and closely related to the host contract 
we have not entered into commodity hedging contracts but may do so as circumstances warrant 
we do not believe that changes in labor or commodity prices will have a material impact on our results of operations or cash flows 
investment risk our investment policy allows for purchases of fixed income securities with an investment grade rating and a maximum maturity of five years 
we held billion in cash and equivalents and marketable securities to be used for general corporate purposes on december  our marketable securities have an average duration of two months and an average credit rating of aa 
given that our investments had an aggregate weighted average maturity of days as of december   a percent unfavorable interest rate movement would have no immediate material impact on the value of the holdings in either year 
historically  we have not experienced material gains or losses on these instruments due to changes in interest rates or market values
