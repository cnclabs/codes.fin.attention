table of contents introduction the following management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is intended to assist readers in understanding the consolidated results of operations and financial condition of the hanover insurance group  inc the holding company and its subsidiaries collectively thg and should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related footnotes included elsewhere herein 
our results of operations include the accounts of the hanover insurance company hanover insurance and citizens insurance company of america citizens  our principal property and casualty companies first allmerica financial life insurance company faflic  our former life insurance and annuity company  and certain other insurance and non insurance subsidiaries 
as of december  and for all prior periods presented  operations from faflic have been classified as discontinued operations and the related assets and liabilities as held for sale due to the sale of faflic on january  to commonwealth annuity and life insurance company commonwealth annuity  a subsidiary of the goldman sachs group  inc goldman sachs 
see discontinued operations life companies on pages of this form k for further information 
hanover insurance and citizens are domiciled in the states of new hampshire and michigan  respectively 
executive overview our property and casualty business constitutes our primary ongoing operations and includes our personal lines segment  our commercial lines segment and our other property and casualty segment 
as noted above  on january   we sold faflic to commonwealth annuity 
based on the december  asset and liability values  including a pre close dividend from faflic consisting of designated assets with a statutory book value of approximately million  total net proceeds from the sale after estimated transaction expenses were approximately million 
coincident with the sale transaction  hanover insurance and faflic entered into a reinsurance contract whereby hanover insurance assumed faflic s discontinued accident and health insurance business 
during  unprecedented capital market events  including the failure of several large financial institutions  have resulted in a deterioration in the overall credit environment and caused the market value of both investment and below investment grade securities to depreciate 
concerns about asset quality expanded well beyond exposure to the residential mortgage market  causing one of the sharpest declines in financial asset values in recent history 
additionally  the uncertainty in the financial markets has resulted in the contraction of credit market liquidity 
our investment holdings consist primarily of fixed maturities  cash and cash equivalents  which totaled billion at december   excluding those assets held for sale in connection with the faflic transaction 
approximately of our fixed maturity holdings are investment grade securities 
in our investment grade bonds  credit spreads widened most significantly in the financial sector 
in our below investment grade portfolio  corporate bonds with lower ratings experienced the most marked decline in value 
during  we recognized impairment charges of million  including million related to our discontinued faflic business  primarily related to credit related losses on fixed maturities in the financial sector  including our holdings in securities issued by lehman brothers and washington mutual  and to a lesser extent  the industrial sector 
as of december   we held securities with net unrealized loss positions of approximately million 
we expect that the markets will continue to be volatile in the near term 
there is uncertainty regarding what effect government programs will have on the financial markets and the time that is required for companies to successfully execute meaningful actions that will provide relief to the markets 
we believe  however  that recent and ongoing government actions to support the banking and financial sectors  the quality of the assets we hold  and our relatively strong capital position will allow us  over time  to realize the anticipated long term economic value related to securities we hold that are in an unrealized loss position 
additionally  we have a substantially liquid portfolio with a laddered duration structure which provides for periodic maturities and thus expect to have the ability to hold such securities for the period of time anticipated to allow for a recovery in fair value 
during  we incurred million of catastrophe losses on a pre tax basis 
this year was marked by several catastrophe events  with hurricanes ike and gustav being the most significant 
this catastrophe activity also generated significant losses for the industry 
hurricane gustav s damage was concentrated in louisiana  where our overall losses were lower than our respective market share due in part to specific catastrophe management initiatives undertaken over the past three years 
hurricane ike was an unusually far reaching and long lasting storm  affecting our central and midwest regions  and even impacting michigan 
we expect that our losses associated 
table of contents with ike are consistent with our market share in the affected states 
we believe that we have made significant progress with respect to effectively managing our catastrophe exposure by strengthening our underwriting guidelines and pro actively utilizing catastrophe modeled data where appropriate 
personal lines in our personal lines business  we are focused on making investments that are intended to help us maintain profitability  build a distinctive position in the market and provide us with profitable growth opportunities 
we have continued to implement catastrophe management actions in coastal states  including florida and louisiana that  while reducing premium in our homeowners line  has improved our risk profile 
additionally  current market conditions continue to be challenging as pricing pressures and economic conditions remain difficult  especially in michigan  impacting our ability to grow and retain business in this  our largest state and elsewhere 
we are working closely with our partner agents in michigan to remain a significant writer with strong margins 
also  in we continued our mix management initiatives relating to our connections auto product to improve the overall profitability of the business 
we are focused on reducing our growth in less profitable automobile segments and increasing our multi car and account business consistent with our strategy 
we believe that market conditions will remain challenging and competitive in personal lines 
despite these challenges and transitions  we experienced relatively flat growth levels in personal lines and expect that trend to continue in the near term as the industry continues to respond to the difficult economic environment 
our connections auto product is available in eighteen states 
we believe that this product will help us to profitably grow our market share over time 
the connections auto product is designed to be competitive for a wide spectrum of drivers through its multivariate rating application  which calculates rates based upon the magnitude and correlation of multiple risk factors 
at the same time  a core strategy is to broaden our portfolio offerings and write total accounts  which are accounts that include multiple personal line coverages for the same customer 
our homeowners product  connections home  is available in sixteen states 
it is intended to improve our competitiveness for total account business by significantly improving ease of doing business for our agents and by providing better packaging of coverages for policyholders 
having implemented a broader portfolio of products  we continue to refine these products and to work closely with high potential agents to increase the percentage of business they place with us and to ensure that it is consistent with our preferred mix of business 
additionally  we remain focused on diversifying our state mix beyond our four core states of michigan  massachusetts  new york and new jersey 
we expect these efforts to contribute to profitable growth and improved retention in our personal lines segment over time 
commercial lines in the commercial lines business  the market remains competitive 
price competition requires us to continue to be highly disciplined in our underwriting process to ensure that we grow the business only at acceptable margins 
we continue to target  through mid sized agents  small and first tier middle markets  which encompass clients whose premiums are generally below  we also continue to develop our specialty businesses  which on average are expected to offer higher margins over time and enable us to deliver a more complete product portfolio to our agents and policyholders 
our specialty lines now account for approximately one third of our commercial lines business 
additional growth in our specialty lines continues to be a significant part of our strategy 
our ongoing focus on expanding our product offerings in specialty businesses during was evidenced by our acquisitions of verlan holdings  inc verlan  which we market as hanover specialty property  a specialty company providing property insurance to small and medium sized manufacturing and distribution companies that are highly protected fire risks  and aix holdings  inc aix  a specialty property and casualty insurance carrier that focuses on underwriting and managing program business that utilizes alternative risk transfer techniques 
in the fourth quarter of  we acquired professionals direct  inc pdi  which we market as hanover professionals  providing professional liability coverage for small to medium sized legal practices 
additionally  over the two prior years  we developed our niche insurance programs  such as for schools  religious institutions and moving and storage companies 
we believe these acquisitions and the development of our niche businesses provide us with better breadth and diversification of products and improve our competitive position with our agents 
in  we internally developed another specialty niche for human services organizations  which was introduced in january in states 
as a complimentary initiative  we have established a business focused on management liability  specifically non profit directors and officers liability  employment practices liability and eventually private company directors and officers liability 
in addition  
table of contents we have made a number of enhancements to our core products and technology platforms that are intended to drive more total account placements in our small commercial business  which we believe will enhance margins 
our focus continues to be on improving and expanding our partnerships with agents 
we believe our specialty capabilities and small commercial platform  coupled with distinctiveness in the middle market  enables us to deliver significant value to our agents and policyholders in our target markets 
description of operating segments our primary business operations include insurance products and services in three property and casualty operating segments 
these segments are personal lines  commercial lines and other property and casualty 
as of december   due to the sale of faflic on january   the operations of our life companies have been classified as discontinued operations 
certain ongoing expenses have been reclassified from our life companies segment to our property and casualty business 
we present the separate financial information of each segment consistent with the manner in which our chief operating decision maker evaluates results in deciding how to allocate resources and in assessing performance 
the property and casualty group manages its operations principally through three segments personal lines  commercial lines and other property and casualty 
personal lines includes personal automobile  homeowners and other personal coverages  while commercial lines includes commercial multiple peril  commercial automobile  workers compensation and other commercial coverages  such as bonds and inland marine business 
in addition  the other property and casualty segment consists of opus investment management  inc opus  which markets investment management services to institutions  pension funds and other organizations  earnings on holding company assets  and voluntary pools business in which we have not actively participated since prior to its sale on june   amgro  inc amgro  our premium financing business  was also included in the other property and casualty segment 
we report interest expense related to our corporate debt separately from the earnings of our operating segments 
corporate debt consists of our junior subordinated debentures and our senior debentures 
results of operations our consolidated net income includes the results of our three operating segments segment income  which we evaluate on a pre tax basis  and our interest expense on corporate debt 
in addition  segment income excludes certain items which we believe are not indicative of our core operations 
the income of our segments excludes items such as federal income taxes and net realized investment gains and losses  including net gains or losses on certain derivative instruments  because fluctuations in these gains and losses are determined by interest rates  financial markets and the timing of sales 
also  segment income excludes net gains and losses on disposals of businesses  discontinued operations  restructuring costs  extraordinary items  the cumulative effect of accounting changes and certain other items 
although the items excluded from segment income may be significant components in understanding and assessing our financial performance  we believe segment income enhances an investor s understanding of our results of operations by highlighting net income attributable to the core operations of the business 
however  segment income should not be construed as a substitute for net income determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles gaap 
catastrophe losses are a significant component in understanding and assessing the financial performance of our business 
however  catastrophic events  such as hurricanes katrina  ike and gustav make it difficult to assess the underlying trends in this business 
management believes that providing certain financial metrics and trends  excluding the effects of catastrophes  help investors to understand the variability in periodic earnings and to evaluate the underlying performance of our operations 
our consolidated net income was million in  compared to million in the million decrease in earnings is primarily due to net realized investment losses of million  and loss from operations of our discontinued faflic business  including the million estimated loss on the sale of faflic  and million of additional net realized investment losses from faflic 
additionally  there were increased after tax catastrophe losses of million in partially offsetting these decreases was a million increase in non catastrophe related pre tax segment income and a million net gain on the sale of amgro 
our consolidated net income was million in  compared to a net income of million in 
table of contents the million increase in earnings primarily reflects increased after tax segment results of million  and the absence of million of losses incurred in related to the disposal  in  of our variable life insurance and annuity business 
the increase in segment results primarily reflects a decrease in catastrophe related activity  as well as higher net investment income 
the following table reflects segment income loss as determined in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no

the segment results are presented before taxes and other items which management believes are not indicative of our core operations  including realized gains and losses

in addition  segment income was positively affected by a litigation settlement that resulted in an million benefit 

table of contents excluding the impact of all catastrophe related activity and the litigation settlement in  segment income would have increased million for the year ended december   as compared to this increase is due primarily to higher net investment income  more favorable current accident year results and lower expenses 
net investment income increased million  primarily due to earnings on invested assets transferred from our life companies and higher partnership income  partially offset by non recurring call premiums and prepayment fees received in and lower income due to the sale of securities to fund our stock repurchase program 
current accident year results increased approximately million in  primarily in commercial lines 
underwriting  loss adjustment and other operating expenses decreased approximately million  primarily due to lower employee benefit and variable compensation expenses  partially offset by increased costs in our specialty business  including our recently acquired subsidiaries 
included in employee benefit costs is an approximate million pension expense adjustment 
compared to the property and casualty group s segment income increased million  to million for the year ended december   compared to million in catastrophe related activity decreased million  from million in to million in such activity includes an increase in our catastrophe reserves for hurricane katrina  net of reinsurance  of million and million  respectively 
in addition  segment income was positively affected by litigation settlements that benefited and results by million and million  respectively 
excluding the impact of all catastrophe related activity and the litigation settlements  segment income would have increased million for the year ended december   as compared to this increase is due primarily to higher net investment income  lower losses and lower underwriting and loss adjustment expenses 
net investment income increased million 
this was primarily due to higher average invested assets resulting from favorable operational cash flows and additional holding company assets 
losses were lower in due to higher favorable development on prior years loss and lae reserves that were partially offset by higher accident year losses 
favorable development on prior years reserves increased million  to million in  from million in current accident year results decreased approximately million in underwriting and loss adjustment expenses decreased approximately million  primarily due to lower technology  variable compensation  legal and independent adjusters costs  partially offset by higher salaries and employee benefit costs  principally in our commercial lines segment 
included in employee benefit costs is an approximate million pension expense adjustment

catastrophe loss ratio reflects incurred catastrophe claims compared to premiums earned 
gaap combined ratio is a common industry measurement of the results of property and casualty insurance underwriting 
this ratio is the sum of incurred claims  claim expenses and underwriting expenses incurred to premiums earned 
our gaap combined ratios also include the impact of catastrophes 
federal income taxes  net investment income and other non underwriting expenses are not reflected in the gaap combined ratio

we allocate net investment income to each of our property and casualty segments based on actuarial information related to the underlying business 
compared to personal lines personal lines net premiums written increased million  or  to  million for the year ended december  the most significant factor contributing to this increase was a favorable impact from changes in our reinsurance structure as discussed under reinsurance on pages and in description of business by segment property and casualty of this form k  which increased net written premium by million for the year ended december  in the personal automobile and homeowners lines of business  rate increases in all states except for massachusetts also contributed to the increase 
additionally  net written premium benefited from an increase in new personal automobile policies issued in massachusetts and from increases in new homeowners policies issued across most states 
these increases were partially offset by decreases in net written premium related to our non renewal of homeowners business in florida  the impact of personal automobile rate decreases in massachusetts and a decrease in net written premium in michigan which we attribute to the difficult economy in the state 
policies in force in the personal automobile line of business decreased during driven by a decrease in michigan  which we attribute to the difficult economic conditions in that state  partially offset by net growth in policies in force in massachusetts 

table of contents policies in force in the homeowners line of business decreased during  primarily as a result of exposure management actions taken in coastal states  particularly in florida  where we have non renewed all homeowners policies 
partially offsetting these reductions is an increase in policies in force outside of florida  primarily in our targeted growth states 
our underwriting profit  excluding prior year reserve development and catastrophes  decreased million  to million in  from million in this decrease was primarily due to less favorable current accident year results of approximately million  attributable to higher frequency of non catastrophe weather related claims  partially offset by the benefit of changes in our reinsurance programs 
additionally  underwriting expenses and loss adjustment expenses were approximately million higher primarily due to expenses being reduced by the aforementioned litigation settlement of million 
this was partially offset by lower variable compensation and lower employee benefit costs 
favorable development on prior years loss and lae reserves excluding hurricane katrina decreased million  to million in  from million in this decrease was driven primarily by lower favorable development in the personal automobile line of business  particularly from bodily injury 
the pre tax effect of catastrophes increased million  to million in from million in this increase was driven primarily by hurricane gustav  and to a lesser extent  hurricane ike 
we increased our catastrophe reserves  net of reinsurance  for hurricane katrina by million in we did not increase our reserves for hurricane katrina in our ability to maintain and increase personal lines net written premium and to maintain and improve underwriting results is expected to be affected by increasing price competition  regulatory actions and the difficult economic conditions  particularly in michigan  which is our largest state 
new business generally experiences higher loss ratios than our other business  and is more difficult to predict 
we have experienced loss ratios with our connections auto business  which are higher than expected  particularly in states in which we have less experience and data 
in  we initiated several actions to improve our results in new business  however  our ability to maintain or increase earnings and continue to grow could be adversely affected should the loss ratios for new business prove to be higher than our pricing and profitability expectations  or if required adjustments to enhance risk segmentation and related agency management actions result in making our products less price competitive 
in michigan  for example  the governor has undertaken initiatives intended to freeze personal automobile rates and eliminate the use of credit scores for underwriting and ratings purposes 
it is difficult to predict the impact that the current recessionary environment will have on our personal lines business 
our ability to increase pricing may be impacted as agents and consumers may become more price sensitive  customers may shop for policies more frequently or aggressively  utilize comparative rating models or turn to direct sales channels rather than independent agents 
additionally  new business premiums  retention levels and renewal premiums may decrease as policyholders reduce coverages or change deductibles to reduce premiums  home values decline  foreclosures increase and policyholders retain older or less expensive automobiles and purchase or insure fewer ancillary items such as boats  trailers and motor homes for which we provide coverages 
additionally  claims frequency could increase as policyholders submit and pursue claims more aggressively than in the past  fraud incidences may increase  or we may experience higher incidents of abandoned properties or poorer maintenance which may also result in more claims activity 
our personal lines segment could also be affected by an ensuing consolidation of independent insurance agencies 
in addition  as discussed under contingencies and regulatory matters other regulatory matters  certain coastal states may take actions which significantly affect the property and casualty insurance market  including ordering rate reductions for homeowners insurance products and subjecting insurance companies that do business in that state to potentially significant assessments in the event of catastrophic losses that are insured or reinsured by state sponsored insurance or reinsurance entities 
such state actions or our responses thereto could have a significant impact on our underwriting margins and growth prospects  as well as our ability to manage exposures to hurricane losses 
notwithstanding these concerns  we believe that our agency distribution strategy  the strength of our market share in key states  our account rounding strategy  the relatively inelastic demand for insurance products and our capital position  place us in a good position to manage these issues and concerns relative to many of our peer competitors 

table of contents commercial lines commercial lines net premiums written increased million  or  to  million for the year ended december  this increase primarily resulted from the benefit of changes in our reinsurance programs and the effect of net premiums written related to recently acquired subsidiaries 
during and as discussed under reinsurance on page in description of business by segment property and casualty of this form k  we renewed our property and casualty reinsurance program with changes to the reinsurance structure 
these changes resulted in an increase in net written premium of million in  of which million is a non recurring amount related to the termination of our umbrella excess of loss reinsurance treaty 
net written premium attributable to our recent acquisitions of pdi  verlan and aix  was million 
the remaining premium increase was primarily in our bond business 
our underwriting profit  excluding prior year reserve development and catastrophes  increased million  to million in from million in this increase was primarily due to more favorable current accident year results of approximately million  primarily attributable to growth in specialty lines and the benefit of changes in our reinsurance programs 
these increases were partially offset by higher underwriting and loss adjustment expenses of approximately million 
this was primarily attributable to increased expenses associated with our specialty lines of business  including our recently acquired subsidiaries  partially offset by lower variable compensation and employee benefit costs 
favorable development on prior years loss and lae reserves  excluding hurricane katrina  increased million  to million in from million in this increase primarily relates to the commercial multiple peril and workers compensation lines of business  partially offset by decreases in the commercial automobile and other commercial lines of business 
the pre tax effect of catastrophes increased million  to million in from million in this increase was driven primarily by hurricane ike  and to a lesser extent  hurricane gustav 
in and  we increased our catastrophe reserves  net of reinsurance  for hurricane katrina by million and million  respectively 
we continue to experience significant price competition in all lines of business in our commercial lines segment 
premium has decreased modestly on renewal policies  most notably in our middle market and commercial automobile business 
we have also experienced relatively flat pricing in our small commercial business 
the industry is also generally experiencing overall rate decreases 
our ability to increase commercial lines net premiums written while maintaining or improving underwriting results is expected to be affected by price competition and the difficult economic conditions  particularly in michigan 
it is difficult to predict the impact of the current economic environment on our commercial lines segment  but businesses may become more price sensitive 
we may also experience decreased new business levels  retention and renewal rates and renewal premiums 
the overall decline in the economy is likely to result in reductions in demand for insurance products and services as more companies cease to do business and there are fewer business start ups  particularly as small businesses are affected by a decline in overall consumer and business spending 
in addition  businesses may seek to reduce or eliminate coverages to reduce costs and there will likely be a reduction in payroll levels  which would reduce workers compensation premiums and may result in an increase in workers compensation claims 
our commercial lines segment could also be affected by an ensuing consolidation of independent insurance agencies 
notwithstanding these concerns  we believe that our agency distribution strategy  our broad product offerings  the strength of our growing specialty businesses  disruptions in the marketplace which may result in improved pricing  the relatively inelastic demand for insurance products and our capital position  place us in a good position to manage these issues and concerns relative to many of our peer competitors 
other property and casualty segment income of the other property and casualty segment increased million  to million for the year ended december   from million in the increase is primarily due to lower pension related costs 
compared to personal lines personal lines net premiums written increased million  or  to  million for the year ended december  compared to the prior year 
this net written premium growth was primarily attributable to rate increases in the personal automobile and homeowners lines 
in the personal automobile line  rate increases in all states except for massachusetts contributed to overall growth of 
massachusetts rates declined in accordance with the commissioner s mandated and rate decreases effective april  and january   respectively 
in the homeowners line  growth of was driven by rate increases across most of our states and primarily in louisiana  florida  and michigan 
total personal lines new business in was million  a decrease of million from million in 
table of contents partially offsetting these favorable items was lower retention  primarily in our michigan business  which we believe was partially driven by a weakening general economy 
additionally  management actions were taken to improve connections auto profitability  which adversely affected retention and new business 
also offsetting our premium growth in were coastal exposure management actions which resulted in the non renewal of certain homeowners policies in hurricane prone states 
policies in force in the personal automobile line of business increased in compared to the end of the increase was driven by business from connections auto  our multivariate auto product first introduced in and available in states during  and by the appointment of new agents in states where we previously had little or no business 
policies in force in the homeowners line of business decreased in  compared to the end of  primarily as a result of declines in michigan  which we attribute to the declining economy in the state 
policies in force also decreased due to exposure management actions taken in coastal states 
partially offsetting this reduction is an increase in policies in force in newer  growth targeted states 
our underwriting profit  excluding prior year reserve development and catastrophes  declined million  from million in to million in this decline was primarily due to a reduction in accident year profit of approximately million  primarily due to higher property losses in the homeowners line and to an increase in the frequency of losses in the personal automobile line 
these decreases were partially offset by the aforementioned litigation settlement of million and higher other income of million  primarily due to increased policyholder installment fee income 
favorable development on prior years loss and lae reserves  excluding hurricane katrina  increased million  from million in to million in this increase was driven by favorable personal automobile liability experience  primarily in the through accident years 
the pre tax effect of catastrophes decreased million  from million in to million in in  we increased our catastrophe reserves  net of reinsurance  for hurricane katrina by million 
in  there were no changes to our catastrophe reserves for hurricane katrina 
net investment income was million for the year ended december   an increase of million compared to the same period in the prior year  primarily due to increased operating cash flows 
commercial lines commercial lines net premiums written increased million  or  to million for the year ended december  compared to the prior year 
this increase is primarily attributable to growth in our other commercial lines business  primarily inland marine and bonds 
for our more traditional lines of business  such as workers compensation  commercial automobile and commercial multiple peril  net written premiums for the year ended december  were relatively consistent with net written premiums in  as we sought to be disciplined in our underwriting process to maintain acceptable margins in an increasingly competitive pricing environment 
our underwriting profit  excluding prior year reserve development and catastrophes  increased million in  to a profit of million in from a loss of million in this increase was primarily due to continued growth in our inland marine and bonds lines of business and improved current accident year losses primarily in our workers compensation line 
these were partially offset by increased frequency of property losses greater than  in our commercial multiple peril and marine lines of business and increased expenses 
expenses were higher primarily due to increased investments in our inland marine and bond lines of business  partially offset by lower technology  variable compensation and legal costs 
favorable development on prior years loss and lae reserves  excluding hurricane katrina  increased million  from million in to million in this increase primarily relates to the other commercial lines of business 
the pre tax effect of catastrophes decreased million  to million in from million in in and  we increased our catastrophe reserves  net of reinsurance  for hurricane katrina by million and million  respectively 
other property and casualty segment income of the other property and casualty segment decreased million  to million for the year ended december   from million in segment income in includes a payment to opus in the amount of million in settlement of claims which opus alleged in a lawsuit filed in against various parties 
excluding this settlement  other property and casualty segment income would have decreased million in as compared to 
table of contents investment results net investment income before taxes was million for the year ended december   million for the year ended december  and million for the year ended december  the increase in net investment income in was primarily due to earnings on pension and benefit related invested assets transferred from our former life companies segment to the property and casualty group 
effective january   hanover insurance became the common employer of all employees of thg and its subsidiaries and sponsorship of all employee benefit plans was transferred from faflic to hanover insurance 
accordingly  we transferred assets to hanover insurance with corresponding liabilities associated with these benefit plans 
additionally  net investment income increased due to higher partnership income in these increases were partially offset by non recurring call premiums and prepayment fees received in and lower income due to the sale of securities to fund our stock repurchase program 
the increase in net investment income in compared to was primarily due to higher average invested assets resulting from increased operational cash flows and additional holding company assets 
average pre tax yields on fixed maturities were for the year ended december  and for the years ended december  and reserve for losses and loss adjustment expenses overview of loss reserve estimation process we maintain reserves for our property and casualty products to provide for our ultimate liability for losses and loss adjustment expenses with respect to reported and unreported claims incurred as of the end of each accounting period 
these reserves are estimates  taking into account actuarial projections at a given point in time  of what we expect the ultimate settlement and administration of claims will cost based on facts and circumstances then known  estimates of future trends in claim severity and frequency  judicial theories of liability and policy coverage  and other factors 
we determine the amount of loss and loss adjustment expense reserves the loss reserves based on an estimation process that is very complex and uses information obtained from both company specific and industry data  as well as general economic information 
the estimation process is judgmental  and requires us to continuously monitor and evaluate the life cycle of claims on type of business and nature of claim bases 
using data obtained from this monitoring and assumptions about emerging trends  our actuaries develop information about the size of ultimate claims based on historical experience and other available market information 
the most significant assumptions used in the actuarial estimation process  which vary by line of business  include determining the expected consistency in the frequency and severity of claims incurred but not yet reported to prior years claims  the trend in loss costs  changes in the timing of the reporting of losses from the loss date to the notification date and expected costs to settle unpaid claims 
this process assumes that past experience  adjusted for the estimated effects of current developments and anticipated trends  is an appropriate basis for predicting future events 
on a quarterly basis  our actuaries provide to management a point estimate for each significant line of our direct business to summarize their analysis 
in establishing the appropriate loss reserve balances for any period  management carefully considers these actuarial point estimates  which are the principal bases for establishing our reserve balances  along with a qualitative evaluation of business trends  environmental changes  and numerous other factors 
in general  such additional factors may include  but are not limited to  improvement or deterioration of the actuarial indications in the period  the maturity of the accident year  trends observed over the recent past such as changes in the mix of business or the impact of regulatory or litigation developments  the anticipated impact of new product introductions or expansion into new geographic areas  the level of volatility within a particular line of business  and the magnitude of the difference between the actuarial indication and the recorded reserves 
regarding our indirect business from voluntary and involuntary pools  we are provided loss estimates by managers of each pool 
we adopt reserve estimates for the pools that consider this information and other facts 
management s review of judgments and key assumptions there is greater inherent uncertainty in estimating insurance reserves for certain types of property and casualty insurance lines  particularly workers compensation and other liability lines  where a longer period of time may elapse before a definitive determination of ultimate liability and losses may be made 
in addition  the technological  judicial  regulatory and political climates involving these types of claims change regularly 
there is also greater uncertainty in establishing reserves with respect to new business  particularly new business which is generated with respect to newly introduced product lines  by newly appointed agents or in geographies in which we 
table of contents have less experience in conducting business 
in such cases  there is less historical experience or knowledge and less data upon which the actuaries can rely 
historically  we have limited the issuance of long tailed other liability policies  including directors and officers d o liability  errors and omissions e o liability and medical malpractice liability 
with the acquisition of pdi  which writes lawyers professional errors and omissions coverage  and the introduction of new specialty coverages  we are modestly increasing our exposure to longer tailed liability lines 
we regularly update our reserve estimates as new information becomes available and further events occur which may impact the resolution of unsettled claims 
reserve adjustments are reflected in the results of operations as adjustments to losses and lae 
often  these adjustments are recognized in periods subsequent to the period in which the underlying policy was written and the loss event occurred 
these types of subsequent adjustments are described separately as prior year reserve development 
such development can be either favorable or unfavorable to our financial results and may vary by line of business 
inflation generally increases the cost of losses covered by insurance contracts 
the effect of inflation varies by product 
our property and casualty insurance premiums are established before the amount of losses and lae and the extent to which inflation may affect such expenses are known 
consequently  we attempt  in establishing rates and reserves  to anticipate the potential impact of inflation and increasing medical costs in the projection of ultimate costs 
we have experienced increasing medical costs  including those associated with personal automobile personal injury protection claims  particularly in michigan  as well as in our workers compensation line in most states 
this increase is reflected in our reserve estimates  but continued increases could contribute to increased losses and lae in the future 
we regularly review our reserving techniques  our overall reserving position and our reinsurance 
based on i our review of historical data  legislative enactments  judicial decisions  legal developments in impositions of damages and policy coverage  political attitudes and trends in general economic conditions  ii our review of per claim information  iii our historical loss experience and that of the industry  iv the relatively short term nature of most policies written by us  and v our internal estimates of required reserves  we believe that adequate provision has been made for loss reserves 
however  establishment of appropriate reserves is an inherently uncertain process and there can be no certainty that current established reserves will prove adequate in light of subsequent actual experience 
a significant change to the estimated reserves could have a material impact on our results of operations and financial position 
an increase or decrease in reserve estimates would result in a corresponding decrease or increase in financial results 
for example  each one percentage point change in the aggregate loss and lae ratio resulting from a change in reserve estimation is currently projected to have an approximate million impact on property and casualty segment income  based on full year premiums 
as discussed below  estimated loss and lae reserves for claims occurring in prior years  excluding development related to hurricane katrina  developed favorably by million  million  and million for  and  respectively  which represents  and of net loss reserves held  respectively 
the major causes of material uncertainty relating to ultimate losses and loss adjustment expenses risk factors generally vary for each line of business  as well as for each separately analyzed component of the line of business 
in some cases  such risk factors are explicit assumptions of the estimation method and in others  they are implicit 
for example  a method may explicitly assume that a certain percentage of claims will close each year  but will implicitly assume that the legal interpretation of existing contract language will remain unchanged 
actual results will likely vary from expectations for each of these assumptions  resulting in an ultimate claim liability that is different from that being estimated currently 
some risk factors will affect more than one line of business 
examples include changes in claim department practices  changes in settlement patterns  regulatory and legislative actions  court actions  timeliness of claim reporting and ultimate settlement  state mix of claimants  and degree of claimant fraud 
additionally  there is also a higher degree of uncertainty due to growth in our newly acquired companies  for which we have limited historical claims experience 
the extent of the impact of a risk factor will also vary by components within a line of business 
individual risk factors are also subject to interactions with other risk factors within line of business components 
thus  risk factors can have offsetting or compounding effects on required reserves 
in  and  trends in claims activity caused us to re evaluate and increase our estimate of hurricane katrina net loss and loss adjustment reserves  net of reinsurance  by million  million and million  respectively 
in  we increased our estimate of 
table of contents hurricane katrina reserves due to a higher loss estimate for certain open litigation cases 
in  we increased our estimate of commercial lines net losses primarily due to an increase in litigation activity 
we believe this increase in litigation activity was due to suits being filed in anticipation of the expiration  on august   of the two year limit for a policyholder to challenge hurricane katrina claims 
we also increased our hurricane katrina estimate in commercial lines in both and for supplemental payments on previously closed claims caused by the development of latent damages as well as inflationary pressures on repair costs 
the estimate of loss adjustment expenses related to hurricane katrina increased million and million in and  respectively 
we believe the increase in litigation activity in resulted from the previously mentioned expiration of the two year limit on a policyholders ability to challenge claims 
we are also defendants in various litigation  including putative class actions  which claim punitive damages or claim a broader scope of policy coverage than our interpretation  all in connection with losses incurred from hurricane katrina 
the reserves established with respect to hurricane katrina assume that we will prevail with respect to these matters see contingencies and regulatory matters 
although we believe our current hurricane katrina reserves are adequate  there can be no assurance that our ultimate costs associated with this event will not substantially exceed these estimates 
we have fully utilized all of our available reinsurance with respect to losses and lae related to hurricane katrina 
loss and lae reserves by line of business we perform actuarial reviews on certain detailed line of business coverages 
these individual estimates are summarized into nine broader lines of business including personal automobile  homeowners  workers compensation  commercial automobile  commercial multiple peril  and other personal and other commercial lines 
asbestos and environmental reserves and pools business are separately analyzed 
the process of estimating reserves involves considerable judgment by management and is inherently uncertain 
actuarial point estimates by lines of business are the primary bases for determining ultimate expected losses and lae and the level of net reserves required  however  other factors are considered as well 
in general  such additional factors may include  but are not limited to  improvement or deterioration of the actuarial indications in the period  the maturity of the accident year  trends observed over the recent past such as changes in the mix of business or the impact of regulatory or litigation developments  the amount of data or experience we have with respect to a particular product or geographic area  the level of volatility within a particular line of business  and the magnitude of the difference between the actuarial indication and the recorded reserves 
the table below shows our recorded reserves  net of reinsurance  and the related actuarial reserve point estimates by line of business at december  and december in millions recorded net reserves actuarial point estimate recorded net reserves actuarial point estimate personal automobile homeowners other personal lines workers compensation commercial automobile commercial multiple peril other commercial lines asbestos and environmental pools and other total the principal factors considered by management in addition to the actuarial point estimates in determining the reserves at december  and vary by line of business 
in our commercial lines segment  management considered the growth and product mix changes and recent adverse property related frequency trends in certain coverages 
in addition  management also considered the significant growth in our inland marine and bond businesses for which we have limited actuarial data to estimate losses and the product mix change in our bond business towards a greater proportion of contract surety bonds where losses tend to emerge over a longer period of time and are cyclical related to general economic conditions 
moreover  in our commercial lines segment  management considered the potential for adverse development in the workers compensation line where losses tend to emerge over long periods of time and rising medical costs  while moderating  have continued to be a concern 
also  higher retentions on our reinsurance program compared to prior years may impact the 
table of contents emergence of trends in underlying data that could add to the uncertainty and variability of our actuarial estimates going forward 
in our personal lines segment  management considered the adverse personal automobile personal injury development and related potential for adverse trends due to costs shifting from health insurers to property and casualty insurers resulting from economic concerns and health insurance coverage trends  developments in personal automobile property costs in the accident year and an increase in physical damage frequency  all of which have added additional uncertainty to future development in our personal automobile line 
additionally  management considered the significant growth in our new business with our connections auto product and related growth in a number of states where there is additional uncertainty in the ultimate profitability and development of reserves due to the unseasoned nature of our new business and new agency relationships in these markets  as well as emerging loss trends which are higher than expected 
although our experience and data in these areas is growing with the passage of time  a sufficient number of years of actuarial data is not yet available to base loss estimates solely on this data in new geographical areas and agency relationships and with new products which results in less certainty when estimating ultimate reserves and requires more judgment by management 
also in personal lines  management considered the significant improvement in frequency trends the industry experienced during through in these lines of business which were unanticipated and remain to some extent unexplained 
management also considered the likelihood of future adverse development related to significant catastrophe losses experienced in regarding our indirect business from voluntary and involuntary pools  we are provided loss estimates by managers of each pool 
we adopt reserve estimates for the pools that consider this information and other factors 
at december  and  total recorded net reserves were and greater than actuarially indicated reserves  respectively

table of contents the total reserve for losses and lae as disclosed in the above tables increased by million in and increased by million in the increase for is primarily due to our recently acquired subsidiaries  partially offset by favorable development of prior years loss reserves and payments related to hurricane katrina claims 
prior year development by line of business when trends emerge that we believe affect the future settlement of claims  we adjust our reserves accordingly 
reserve adjustments are reflected in the consolidated statements of income as adjustments to losses and lae 
often  we recognize these adjustments in periods subsequent to the period in which the underlying loss event occurred 
these types of subsequent adjustments are disclosed and discussed separately as prior year reserve development 
such development can be either favorable or unfavorable to our financial results 
the following table summarizes the change in provision for insured events of prior years  excluding those related to hurricane katrina see management s review of judgments and key assumptions on pages to of this form k for a further discussion of hurricane katrina by line of business 
for the years ended december in millions decrease increase in loss provision for insured events of prior years personal automobile homeowners and other total personal workers compensation commercial automobile commercial multiple peril other commercial total commercial voluntary pools decrease in loss provision for insured events of prior years decrease in lae provision for insured events of prior years decrease in total loss and lae provision for insured events of prior years estimated loss reserves for claims occurring in prior years developed favorably by million  million  and million during  and  respectively 
the favorable loss reserve development during the year ended december  is primarily the result of lower than expected severity of bodily injury in the personal automobile line  primarily in the through accident years  and lower than expected severity of liability claims in the commercial multiple peril line for the though accident years 
in addition  lower than expected severity in the workers compensation line  primarily in the through accident years  contributed to the favorable development 
the favorable loss reserve development during the year ended december  is primarily the result of lower than expected bodily injury and personal injury protection claim severity in the personal automobile line  primarily in the through accident years  and lower than expected severity of liability claims in the commercial multiple peril line for the and prior accident years 
in addition  lower than expected severity in the workers compensation and other commercial lines  also primarily in the through accident years  contributed to the favorable development 
the favorable loss reserve development during the year ended december  was primarily the result of lower than expected bodily injury claim frequency in the personal automobile line  primarily in the and accident years  and lower than expected severity in the workers compensation line  primarily in the and accident years 
in addition  lower than expected frequency of liability claims in the commercial multiple peril line for the  and accident years and lower than expected frequency of bodily injury claims in the commercial automobile line  primarily in the and accident years  contributed to the favorable loss development 
during the years ended december   and  estimated lae reserves for claims occurring in prior years developed favorably by million  million  and million  respectively 
the favorable development in was primarily attributable to the aforementioned improvement in ultimate loss activity on prior accident years  primarily in the commercial multiple peril line 
the favorable development in is primarily attributable to improvements in ultimate loss activity on prior accident years  primarily in the commercial multiple peril line  partially offset by an adverse litigation settlement in the first quarter of  primarily impacting 
table of contents the personal automobile line 
the favorable development in was primarily attributable to the aforementioned improvement in ultimate loss activity on prior accident years which results in the decrease of ultimate loss adjustment expenses  primarily related to workers compensation and personal automobile bodily injury 
although we have experienced significant favorable development in both losses and lae in recent years  there can be no assurance that this level of favorable development will occur in the future 
we believe that we will experience less favorable prior year development in future years than we experienced recently 
the factors that resulted in the favorable development of prior year reserves are considered in our ongoing process for establishing current accident year reserves 
in light of our recent years of favorable development  the factors driving this development were considered to varying degrees in setting the more recent years accident year reserves 
as a result  we expect the current and most recent accident year reserves not to develop as favorably as they have in the past 
in light of the significance  in recent periods  of favorable development to our property and casualty segment income  declines in favorable development could be material to our results of operations 
asbestos and environmental reserves although we attempt to limit our exposures to asbestos  environmental damage and toxic tort liability through specific policy exclusions  we have been and may continue to be subject to claims related to these exposures 
the following table summarizes our business asbestos and environmental reserves net of reinsurance and excluding pools 
for the years ended december in millions asbestos environmental total asbestos environmental total asbestos environmental total beginning reserves incurred losses and lae paid reimbursed losses and lae ending reserves ending loss and lae reserves for all direct business written by our property and casualty companies related to asbestos  environmental damage and toxic tort liability  included in the reserve for losses and lae  were million  million and million  net of reinsurance of million  million and million in  and  respectively 
during  our asbestos and environmental reserves decreased by million  primarily due to a favorable cash recovery from a reinsurer on a prior year environmental claim 
during  we reduced our asbestos and environmental reserves by million 
in recent years average asbestos and environmental payments have declined modestly 
as a result of our historical direct underwriting mix of commercial lines policies toward smaller and middle market risks  past asbestos  environmental damage and toxic tort liability loss experience has remained minimal in relation to our total loss and lae incurred experience 
in addition  and not included in the numbers above  we have established loss and lae reserves for assumed reinsurance pool business with asbestos  environmental damage and toxic tort liability of million  million and million in  and  respectively 
these reserves relate to pools in which we have terminated our participation  however  we continue to be subject to claims related to years in which we were a participant 
a significant part of our pool reserves relates to our participation in the excess and casualty reinsurance association ecra voluntary pool from to in  the pool was dissolved and since that time  the business has been in runoff 
our percentage of the total pool liabilities varied from to during these years 
our participation in this pool has resulted in average paid losses of approximately million annually over the past ten years 
because of the inherent uncertainty regarding the types of claims in these pools  we cannot provide assurance that our reserves will be sufficient 

table of contents we estimate our ultimate liability for asbestos  environmental and toxic tort liability claims  whether resulting from direct business  assumed reinsurance or pool business  based upon currently known facts  reasonable assumptions where the facts are not known  current law and methodologies currently available 
although these outstanding claims are not significant  their existence gives rise to uncertainty and are discussed because of the possibility that they may become significant 
we believe that  notwithstanding the evolution of case law expanding liability in asbestos and environmental claims  recorded reserves related to these claims are adequate 
nevertheless  the asbestos  environmental and toxic tort liability reserves could be revised  and any such revisions could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations for a particular quarterly or annual period or on our financial position 
reinsurance our property and casualty group maintains a reinsurance program designed to protect against large or unusual losses and lae activity 
we utilize a variety of reinsurance agreements that are intended to control our exposure to large property and casualty losses  stabilize earnings and protect capital resources  including facultative reinsurance  excess of loss reinsurance and catastrophe reinsurance 
we determine the appropriate amount of reinsurance based upon our evaluation of the risks insured  exposure analyses prepared by consultants and or reinsurers and on market conditions  including the availability and pricing of reinsurance 
reinsurance contracts do not relieve us from our primary obligations to policyholders 
failure of reinsurers to honor their obligations could result in losses to us 
we believe that the terms of our reinsurance contracts are consistent with industry practice in that they contain standard terms with respect to lines of business covered  limit and retention  arbitration and occurrence 
based on an ongoing review of our reinsurers financial statements  reported financial strength ratings from rating agencies  and the analysis and guidance of our reinsurance advisors  we believe that our reinsurers are financially sound 
catastrophe reinsurance serves to protect us  as the ceding insurer  from significant losses arising from a single event such as snow  ice storm  windstorm  hail  hurricane  tornado  riot or other extraordinary events 
under our catastrophe reinsurance agreements  we had ceded losses and lae of million in  primarily as a result of hurricane katrina  and to a lesser extent  hurricane rita 
there were million and million of ceded losses under our catastrophe reinsurance agreements in and  respectively 
in  we purchased catastrophe reinsurance coverage  which provided for maximum loss coverage limits of million and a combined co participation and retention level of million of losses for a single event 
also  effective july   for a twelve month term  we purchased an additional million layer and a co participation of million of losses for a single event in the northeast 
our catastrophe coverage provided maximum loss coverage limits of million with a combined co participation and retention level of million of losses for a single event 
the program contains an automatic reinstatement premium provision in the event we exhaust this maximum coverage 
although we believe our million retention for and is appropriate given our surplus level and the current reinsurance pricing environment  there can be no assurance that our reinsurance program will provide coverage levels that will prove adequate should we experience losses from one significant or several large catastrophes during additionally  as a result of the current economic environment as well as losses incurred by reinsurers in recent years  the availability and pricing of appropriate reinsurance programs may be adversely affected in future renewal periods 
we may not be able to pass these costs on to policyholders in the form of higher premiums or assessments 
we also are subject to concentration of risk with respect to reinsurance ceded to various residual market mechanisms 
as a condition to conduct certain businesses in various states  we are required to participate in residual market mechanisms and pooling arrangements which provide insurance coverage to individuals or other entities that are otherwise unable to purchase such coverage 
these market mechanisms and pooling arrangements include  among others  the michigan assigned claims facility and the michigan catastrophic claims association

in our determination of other than temporary impairments  we consider several factors and circumstances  including the issuer s overall financial condition  the issuer s credit and financial strength ratings  the issuer s financial performance  including earnings trends  dividend payments  and asset quality  any specific events which may influence the operations of the issuer including governmental actions such as the enactment of the emergency economic stabilization act of and receipt of related funds  a weakening of the general market conditions in the industry or geographic region in which the issuer operates  the length of time and the degree to which the fair value of an issuer s securities remains below our cost  and with respect to fixed maturity investments  any factors that might raise doubt about the issuer s ability to pay all amounts due according to the contractual terms 
we apply these factors to all securities 
other than temporary impairments are recorded as a realized loss  which reduces net income and earnings per share 
temporary declines in market value are recorded as unrealized losses  which do not affect net income and earnings per share  but reduce other comprehensive income  which is reflected on our consolidated balance sheets 
we cannot provide assurance that the other than temporary impairments will  in fact  be adequate to cover future losses or that we will not have substantial additional impairments in the future

spreads widened most notably in the industrial  financial and commercial mortgage backed security sectors as investors evaluated the length and severity of a global economic slowdown within the context of impaired credit markets and continuing concerns of poor quality assets on bank balance sheets

obligations of states and political subdivisions  the us treasury  us government and agency securities had associated gross unrealized losses of million at december  and million at december  at december  and december   substantially all below investment grade securities with an unrealized loss had been rated by the naic  standard poor s or moody s 

table of contents we view the gross unrealized losses on fixed maturities and equity securities as being temporary since it is our assessment that these securities will recover in the near term 
management believes that recent and ongoing government actions  including the emergency economic stabilization act of  the american recovery and reinvestment act and other us and global government programs and the quality of our assets will allow us to realize the securities anticipated long term economic value 
furthermore  as of december   we had the intent and ability to retain such investments for the period of time anticipated to allow for this expected recovery in fair value 
see also liquidity and capital resources on pages to of this form k 
the risks inherent in our assessment methodology include the risk that  subsequent to the balance sheet date  market factors may differ from our expectations  government actions do not have the intended affect of stabilizing financial institutions and financial markets  the global economic slowdown is longer or more severe than we expect  we may decide to subsequently sell a security for unforeseen business needs  or changes in the credit assessment or equity characteristics from our original assessment may lead us to determine that a sale at the current value would maximize recovery on such investments 
to the extent that there are such adverse changes  the unrealized loss would then be realized and we would record a charge to earnings 
although unrealized losses are not reflected in the results of financial operations until they are realized or deemed other than temporary  the fair value of the underlying investment  which does reflect the unrealized loss  is reflected in our consolidated balance sheets 
the following table sets forth gross unrealized losses for fixed maturities by maturity period and for equity securities at december  and actual maturities may differ from contractual maturities because borrowers may have the right to call or prepay obligations  with or without call or prepayment penalties  or we may have the right to put or sell the obligations back to the issuers 
mortgage backed securities are included in the category representing their ultimate maturity 
in millions december  december  due in one year or less due after one year through five years due after five years through ten years due after ten years total fixed maturities equity securities total fixed maturities and equity securities includes discontinued accident and health pools of million and million in gross unrealized losses at december  and  respectively 
our investment portfolio and shareholders equity can be and has been significantly impacted by the changes in market values of our securities 
as noted in the previous tables  during  there were significant declines in the market values of our fixed maturity securities  particularly in the industrial and financial sectors 
additionally  subsequent to december   through the date of this report  conditions in the financial markets remained volatile  market values have continued to fluctuate and defaults on corporate fixed income securities are expected to increase significantly in as a result  depending on market conditions  we could incur additional realized and unrealized losses in future periods  which could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and or financial position 
recent developments continue to illustrate that the us and global financial markets and economies are in an unprecedented period of uncertainty and instability 
many issuers face rapidly changing adverse business and liquidity circumstances  increasing the likelihood of unanticipated defaults during while we may experience a significant increase in defaults on corporate fixed income securities in  particularly with respect to non investment grade securities  it is difficult to foresee what issuers  industries or markets could be affected 
as a result  the value of our fixed maturity portfolio could change rapidly in ways we cannot currently anticipate 
depending on market conditions  we could incur additional realized and unrealized losses in future periods 
due to the volatile credit markets  we experienced defaults in on certain fixed maturities of issuers  primarily in the financial sector 
the carrying value of fixed maturity securities on non accrual status at december  and was not material 
the effect of non accruals for the year ended december   compared with amounts that would have been recognized in accordance with the original terms of the fixed maturities  was a reduction in net investment income of million 
the effect of non accruals in was not material 
any defaults in the fixed maturities portfolio in future periods may negatively affect investment income 
market risk and risk management policies interest rate sensitivity our operations are subject to risk resulting from interest rate fluctuations which may adversely impact the valuation of the investment portfolio 
in a rising interest rate environment  the value of the fixed income sector  which comprises of our total continuing portfolio  may decline as a result of decreases in the fair market value of the securities 
our intent is to hold securities to maturity 
table of contents and recover the decline in valuation as prices accrete to par 
however  our intent may change prior to maturity due to changes in the financial markets or our analysis of an issuer s credit metrics and prospects 
interest rate fluctuations may also reduce net investment income and as a result  profitability 
the portfolio may realize lower yields and therefore lower net investment income on securities because the securities with prepayment and call features may prepay at a different rate than originally projected 
in a declining interest rate environment  prepayments and calls may increase as issuers exercise their option to refinance at lower rates 
the resulting funds would be reinvested at lower yields 
in a rising interest rate environment  the funds may not be available to invest at higher interest rates 
for our property and casualty business  we developed an investment strategy that is intended to maximize investment income with consideration towards driving long term growth of shareholders equity and book value 
the determination of the appropriate asset allocation is a process that focuses on the types of business written and the level of surplus required to support our different businesses and the risk return profiles of the underlying asset classes 
we look to balance the goals of capital preservation  stability  liquidity and after tax return 
the majority of our assets are invested in the fixed income markets 
through fundamental research and credit analysis  our investment professionals seek to identify a combination of stable income producing higher quality us agency  corporate and mortgage backed securities and undervalued securities in the credit markets 
we have a general policy of diversifying investments both within and across all portfolios to mitigate credit and interest rate risk 
we monitor the credit quality of our investments and our exposure to individual markets  borrowers  industries  sectors and  in the case of direct commercial mortgages and commercial mortgage backed securities  property types and geographic locations 
in addition  we currently carry long term debt which is subject to interest rate risk 
the majority of this debt was issued at fixed interest rates of and 
current market conditions do not allow for us to invest assets at similar rates of return  and  therefore our earnings on a similar level of assets are not sufficient to cover our current debt interest costs 
the following tables for the years ended december  and provide information about our financial instruments used for purposes other than trading that are sensitive to changes in interest rates 
the tables present principal cash flows and related weighted average interest rates by expected maturities  unless otherwise noted below 
expected maturities may differ from contractual maturities because borrowers may have the right to call or prepay obligations with or without call or prepayment penalties  or we may have the right to put or sell the obligations back to the issuers 
mortgage backed and asset backed securities are included in the category representing their expected maturity 
available for sale securities include both us and foreign denominated fixed maturities  but exclude foreign currency swap contracts 
additionally  we have assumed our available for sale securities are similar enough to aggregate those securities for presentation purposes 
specifically  variable rate available for sale securities comprise an immaterial portion of the portfolio and do not have a significant impact on weighted average interest rates 
therefore  the variable rate investments are not presented separately  instead they are included in the tables at their current interest rate 
for liabilities that have no contractual maturity  the tables present principal cash flows and related weighted average interest rates based on our historical experience  management s judgment  and statistical analysis  as applicable  concerning their most likely withdrawal behaviors 
in addition  long term debt is presented at contractual maturities  except for our long term debt for recently acquired subsidiaries 
we have presented this debt in the category that reflects the more likely payments of this debt  which is expected to be earlier than their contractual maturities

income taxes we file a consolidated united states federal income tax return that includes the holding company and its subsidiaries including non insurance operations 
we segregate the entities included within the consolidated group into either a life insurance or a non life insurance company subgroup 
the consolidation of these subgroups is subject to certain statutory restrictions on the percentage of eligible non life tax losses that can be applied to offset life company taxable income 
the provision for federal income taxes from continuing operations were expenses of million  million and million in  and  respectively 
these provisions resulted in consolidated effective federal tax rates of   and on pre tax income for   and  respectively 
the provision reflects a million benefit resulting from the settlement with the irs of tax years through the provision reflects a million benefit due to reductions in our federal income tax reserves resulting from clarification of outstanding issues for prior years in the course of ongoing irs audits 
absent the aforementioned benefits  the effective tax rates in and would have been and  respectively 
the increase in the tax rate is primarily due to the non recognition of tax benefits  in  related to our realized investment losses as it is our opinion that it is more likely than not that we will be unable to realize these benefits 
the slight increase from to is primarily due to higher underwriting income and a reduced level of tax exempt interest income in compared to our federal income tax expense on segment income was million for compared to million in and million in the decrease in was primarily due to lower segment income  whereas  the increase in was primarily due to higher underwriting income in our property and casualty business 
in addition to the aforementioned benefits from ongoing irs audits  we also realized other tax benefits in our discontinued operations related to ongoing irs audits 
during  we reached an agreement with the irs on our to audit cycle 
a benefit of million was recognized in discontinued operations as income from our discontinued variable life insurance and annuity business and a tax expense of million was recognized in our discontinued faflic business 
in december  we reached an agreement with the irs on our to audit cycle 
the resulting assessment of federal income tax was offset by the utilization of net operating loss carryforwards from our discontinued variable life insurance and annuity business 
the recognition of these net operating loss carryforwards resulted in a million tax benefit recorded in discontinued operations as an adjustment to the loss on the disposal of our variable life insurance and annuity business 
a benefit of million  also related to variable life insurance and annuity items from to was recognized in discontinued operations as income from our former life insurance subsidiary 
also in  a benefit of million resulting from the settlement with the irs of interest claims for through was recognized in discontinued operations as income from discontinued faflic business 
lastly  both and reflect benefits of million and million  respectively  due to reductions in our federal income tax reserves from clarification of outstanding issues for prior years in the course of ongoing irs audits 
the recognition of these benefits was recorded in discontinued operations as income in discontinued faflic business 
the irs audit for tax years through commenced in december during  we increased our valuation allowance related to our deferred tax asset by million  from million to million 
the increase in this valuation allowance resulted primarily from unrealized depreciation in our investment portfolio and our realized capital losses 

accordingly  we recorded a valuation allowance of million as an adjustment to accumulated other comprehensive loss and a valuation allowance of million as a component of net income in our consolidated statements of income included in the million valuation allowance was million related to the loss on the sale of faflic  on january  in accordance with statement no 
 we recognized this loss in included in our deferred tax net asset as of december  is an asset of million related to capital losses 
our pre tax capital losses carried forward are million  including million resulting from the sale of our variable life insurance and annuity business in and million resulting from the sale of faflic  discussed above 
a full valuation allowance has been recorded against our gross capital losses  since it is our opinion that it is more likely than not that this asset will not be fully realized 
our estimate of the gross amount and likely realization of capital loss carryforwards may change over time 
in addition  at 
table of contents december   we had a deferred tax asset of million  of which million relates to alternative minimum tax credit carryforwards and million relates to low income housing tax credit carryforwards 
the alternative minimum tax credit carryforwards have no expiration date and the low income housing credit carryforwards will expire beginning in we may utilize the credits to offset regular federal income taxes due from future income  and although we believe that these assets are fully recoverable  there can be no certainty that future events will not affect their recoverability 
effective january   we adopted the provisions of fasb interpretation no

as a result of the implementation of fin  we recognized an million decrease in the liability for unrecognized tax benefits  which was reflected as an increase in the january  balance of retained earnings 
a corporation is entitled to a tax deduction from gross income for a portion of any dividend which was received from a domestic corporation that is subject to income tax 
this is referred to as a dividends received deduction 
in this and in prior years  we have taken this dividends received deduction when filing our federal income tax return 
many separate accounts held by life insurance companies receive dividends from such domestic corporations  and therefore  were regarded as entitled to this dividends received deduction 
in its revenue ruling  issued on september   the irs announced its intention to issue regulations with respect to certain computational aspects of the dividends received deduction on separate account assets held in connection with variable annuity contracts 
revenue ruling suspended a revenue ruling issued in august that purported to change accepted industry and irs interpretations of the statutes governing these computational questions 
any regulations that the irs ultimately proposes for issuance in this area will be subject to public notice and comment  at which time insurance companies and other members of the public will have the opportunity to raise legal and practical questions about the content  scope and application of such regulations 
as a result  the ultimate timing and substance of any such regulations are not yet known  but they could result in the elimination of some or all of the separate account dividends received deduction tax benefit that we receive 
we believe that it is more likely than not that any such regulation would apply prospectively only  and application of this regulation is not expected to be material to our results of operations in any future annual period 
however  there can be no assurance that the outcome of the revenue ruling will be as anticipated and should retroactive application be required  our results of operations may be adversely affected in a quarterly or annual period 
we believe that retroactive application would not materially affect our financial position 
critical accounting estimates the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon the consolidated financial statements 
these statements have been prepared in accordance with gaap  which requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amount of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
the following critical accounting estimates are those which we believe affect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements 
additional information about our other significant accounting policies and estimates may be found in note summary of significant accounting policies in the notes to consolidated financial statements included in financial statements and supplementary data on pages to of this form k 
property casualty insurance loss reserves we determine the amount of loss and loss adjustment expense reserves the loss reserves  as discussed in segment results property and casualty  overview of loss reserve estimation process based on an estimation process that is very complex and uses information obtained from both company specific and industry data  as well as general economic information 
the estimation process is judgmental  and requires us to continuously monitor and evaluate the life cycle of claims on type of business and nature of claim bases 
using data obtained from this monitoring and assumptions about emerging trends  our actuaries develop information about the size of ultimate claims based on historical experience and other available market information 
the most significant assumptions used in the actuarial estimation process  which vary by line of business  include determining the expected consistency in the frequency and severity of claims incurred but not yet reported to prior years claims  the trend in loss costs  changes in the timing of the reporting of losses from the loss date to the notification date and expected costs to settle unpaid claims 
this process 
table of contents assumes that past experience  adjusted for the effects of current developments and anticipated trends  is an appropriate basis for predicting future events 
on a quarterly basis  our actuaries provide to management a point estimate for each significant line of our direct business to summarize their analysis 
in establishing the appropriate loss reserve balances for any period  management carefully considers these actuarial point estimates  which are the principal bases for establishing our reserve balances  along with a qualitative evaluation of business trends  environmental changes  and numerous other factors 
in general  such additional factors may include  but are not limited to  improvement or deterioration of the actuarial indications in the period  the maturity of the accident year  trends observed over the recent past such as changes in the mix of business or the impact of regulatory or litigation developments  the level of volatility within a particular line of business  and the magnitude of the difference between the actuarial indication and the recorded reserves 
specific factors considered by management in determining the reserves at december  and included the current extent to which growth and product mix changes in our commercial lines segment have affected our ultimate loss trends  the significant growth in our personal lines new business in and related growth in a number of states  the significant improvement in personal lines frequency and severity trends the industry has experienced over the past couple of years which were unanticipated and remain to some extent unexplained  significant growth and product mix changes in our surety bond and inland marine businesses for which we have limited actuarial data to estimate ultimate losses  and the potential for adverse development in the workers compensation line  where losses tend to emerge over long periods of time and rising medical costs  while moderating  continue to be a concern 
additionally  management considered the likelihood of future adverse development related to significant catastrophe losses experienced in and regarding our indirect business from voluntary and involuntary pools  we are provided loss estimates by managers of each pool 
we adopt reserve estimates for the pools that consider this information and other facts 
at december  and  total recorded reserves were and greater than actuarially indicated point estimates  respectively 
we exercise judgment in estimating all loss reserves based upon our knowledge of the property and casualty business  review of the outcome of actuarial studies  historical experience and other facts to record an estimate which reflects our expected ultimate loss and loss adjustment expenses 
we believe that adequate provision has been made for loss reserves 
however  establishment of appropriate reserves is an inherently uncertain process and there can be no certainty that current established reserves will prove adequate in light of subsequent actual experience 
a significant change to the estimated reserves could have a material impact on our results of operations and financial position 
an increase or decrease in reserve estimates would result in a corresponding decrease or increase in financial results 
for example  each one percentage point change in the loss and lae ratio resulting from a change in reserve estimation is currently projected to have an approximate million impact on property and casualty segment income  based on full year premiums 
when trends emerge that we believe affect the future settlement of claims  we adjust our reserves accordingly see segment results property and casualty  management s review of judgments and key assumptions on pages to of this form k for further explanation of factors affecting our reserve estimates  our review process and our process for determining changes to our reserve estimates 
reserve adjustments are reflected in the consolidated statements of income as adjustments to losses and loss adjustment expenses 
often  we recognize these adjustments in periods subsequent to the period in which the underlying loss event occurred 
these types of subsequent adjustments are disclosed and discussed separately as prior year reserve development 
such development can be either favorable or unfavorable to our financial results 
as discussed in segment results property and casualty  management s review of judgments and key assumptions on pages to of this form k  estimated loss and lae reserves for claims occurring in prior years  excluding those related to hurricane katrina  developed favorably by million  million  and million for the years ended december   and  respectively  which represents   and of net loss reserves held  respectively 
also in  and  net loss and loss adjustment reserves for hurricane katrina developed unfavorably by million  million and million  respectively 
see also analysis of losses and loss adjustment expenses reserve development in item business on pages and of this form k  for guidance related to the annual development of our loss and lae reserves 
the major causes of material uncertainty relating to ultimate losses and loss adjustment expenses risk factors generally vary for each line of business  as well as for each separately analyzed component of the line of business 
in some cases  such risk factors are explicit 
table of contents assumptions of the estimation method and in others  they are implicit 
for example  a method may explicitly assume that a certain percentage of claims will close each year  but will implicitly assume that the legal interpretation of existing contract language will remain unchanged 
actual results will likely vary from expectations for each of these assumptions  resulting in an ultimate claim liability that is different from that being estimated currently 
some risk factors will affect more than one line of business 
examples include changes in claim department practices  changes in settlement patterns  regulatory and legislative actions  court actions  timeliness of claim reporting  state mix of claimants  and degree of claimant fraud 
additionally  there is also a higher degree of uncertainty due to growth in our newly acquired companies  for which we have limited historical claims experience 
the extent of the impact of a risk factor will also vary by components within a line of business 
individual risk factors are also subject to interactions with other risk factors within line of business components 
thus  risk factors can have offsetting or compounding effects on required reserves 
we are also defendants in various litigation  including putative class actions  which dispute the scope or enforceability of the flood exclusion  claim punitive damages or claim a broader scope of policy coverage than our interpretation  all in connection with losses incurred from hurricane katrina 
the reserves established with respect to hurricane katrina assume that we will prevail with respect to these matters see contingencies and regulatory matters litigation and certain regulatory matters on pages to of this form k 
although we believe our current hurricane katrina reserves are adequate  there can be no assurance that our ultimate costs associated with this event will not substantially exceed these estimates 
property casualty reinsurance recoverables we share a significant amount of insurance risk of the primary underlying contracts with various insurance entities through the use of reinsurance contracts 
as a result  when we experience loss events that are subject to the reinsurance contract  reinsurance recoveries are recorded 
the amount of the reinsurance recoverable can vary based on the size of the individual loss or the aggregate amount of all losses in a particular line  book of business or an aggregate amount associated with a particular accident year 
the valuation of losses recoverable depends on whether the underlying loss is a reported loss  or an incurred but not reported loss 
for reported losses  we value reinsurance recoverables at the time the underlying loss is recognized  in accordance with contract terms 
for incurred but not reported losses  we estimate the amount of reinsurance recoverable based on the terms of the reinsurance contracts and historical reinsurance recovery information and apply that information to the gross loss reserve estimates 
the most significant assumption we use is the average size of the individual losses for those claims that have occurred but have not yet been recorded by us 
the reinsurance recoverable is based on what we believe are reasonable estimates and is disclosed separately on the financial statements 
however  the ultimate amount of the reinsurance recoverable is not known until all losses are settled 
pension benefit obligations prior to  we provided pension retirement benefits to substantially all of our employees based on a defined benefit cash balance formula 
in addition to the cash balance allocation  certain transition group employees  who had met specified age and service requirements as of december   were eligible for a grandfathered benefit based primarily on the employees years of service and compensation during their highest five consecutive plan years of employment 
as of january   the defined benefit pension plans were frozen 
we account for our pension plans in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 employers accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans an amendment of fasb statements    and r and statement of financial accounting standards no 
 employers accounting for pensions statement no 

in order to measure the liabilities and expense associated with these plans  we must make various estimates and key assumptions  including discount rates used to value liabilities  assumed rates of return on plan assets  employee turnover rates and anticipated mortality rates 
these estimates and assumptions are reviewed at least annually and are based on our historical experience  as well as current facts and circumstances 
in addition  we use outside actuaries to assist in measuring the expenses and liabilities associated with this plan 
the discount rate enables us to state expected future cash flows as a present value on the measurement date 
we also use this discount rate in the determination of our pre tax pension expense or benefit 
a lower discount rate increases the present value of benefit obligations and increases pension expense 
as of december   we 
table of contents determined our discount rate utilizing an independent yield curve which provides for a portfolio of high quality bonds that are expected to match the cash flows of our pension plan 
bond information used in the yield curve was provided by standard and poor s and included only those rated aa or better as of december  as of december   we utilized the citigroup pension discount curve 
we changed yield curves in the current year as a result of the impact that the current sector weightings had on the citigroup pension discount curve  specifically the impact of a relative lack of financial sector issues at longer durations 
at december   based upon our qualified plan assets and liabilities in relation to this discount curve  we increased our discount rate to  from at december  to determine the expected long term return on plan assets  we consider the historical mean returns by asset class for passive indexed strategies  as well as current and expected asset allocations and adjust for certain factors that we believe will have an impact on future returns 
for the years ended december  and  the expected rate of return on plan assets was and  respectively 
actual returns on plan assets in excess of these expected returns will generally reduce our net actuarial losses that are reflected in our accumulated other comprehensive income balance in shareholders equity  whereas actual returns on plan assets which are less than expected returns will generally increase our net actuarial losses that are reflected in accumulated other comprehensive income 
these gains or losses are amortized into expense in future years 
holding all other assumptions constant  sensitivity to changes in our key assumptions are as follows discount rate a basis point increase in discount rate would decrease our pension expense in by million and decrease our projected benefit obligation by approximately million 
a basis point reduction in the discount rate would increase our pension expense by million and increase our projected benefit obligation by approximately million 
expected return on plan assets a basis point increase or decrease in the expected return on plan assets would decrease or increase our pension expense in by million 
other than temporary impairments we employ a systematic methodology to evaluate declines in fair values below amortized cost for all investments 
the methodology utilizes a quantitative and qualitative process ensuring that available evidence concerning the declines in fair value below amortized cost is evaluated in a disciplined manner 
in determining whether a decline in fair value below amortized cost is other than temporary  we evaluate the length of time and the extent to which the fair value has been less than amortized cost  the financial condition and near term prospects of the issuer  the issuer s credit and financial strength ratings  the issuer s financial performance  including earnings trends  dividend payments  and asset quality  any specific events which may influence the operations of the issuer  including governmental actions such as the recent enactment of the emergency economic stabilization act of  general market conditions  the financial condition and prospects of the issuer s market and industry  and  our ability and intent to hold the investment 
we apply judgment in assessing whether the aforementioned factors have caused an other than temporary decline in value 
when an other than temporary decline in value is deemed to have occurred  we reduce the cost basis of the investment to fair value 
this reduction is permanent and is recognized as a realized investment loss see investment portfolio for further discussion regarding other than temporary impairments and securities in an unrealized position

the total adjusted statutory capital position of hanover insurance decreased during  from billion at 
table of contents december  to billion at december  this decrease is primarily due to the million dividend paid to thg in the fourth quarter of  an increase in the additional minimum pension liability associated primarily with our qualified defined benefit pension plan  and unrealized losses 
these decreases were partially offset by improved underwriting results and a million capital contribution from thg declared in december liquidity and capital resources liquidity is a measure of our ability to generate sufficient cash flows to meet the cash requirements of business operations 
as a holding company  our primary ongoing source of cash is dividends from our insurance subsidiaries 
however  dividend payments to us by our insurance subsidiaries are subject to limitations imposed by state regulators  such as the requirement that cash dividends be paid out of unreserved and unrestricted earned surplus 
the payment of extraordinary dividends  as defined  from any of our insurance subsidiaries is restricted 
in the first quarter of  a dividend of million was declared and paid by faflic  while in the fourth quarter of  a million dividend was declared and paid by our property and casualty business  both of which provided additional cash and securities to the holding company 
we declared no dividends from our property and casualty businesses to the holding company in or additional dividends from our property and casualty insurance subsidiaries prior to september would be considered extraordinary and would require prior approval from the respective state regulators 
in  the division approved a dividend from faflic of million effective december   which was paid to the holding company in dividends were paid in in connection with the sale of the variable life insurance and annuity business to goldman sachs 
the dividends included both a cash dividend from faflic of million  including the million ceding commission related to the reinsurance of of faflic s variable life insurance and annuity business  and the distribution of other non insurance subsidiaries  from which the holding company received an additional million of funds 
additionally  in connection with the sale of faflic to commonwealth annuity on january   the division approved a net dividend from faflic to thg  which totaled approximately million 
this dividend consisted primarily of property and equipment  which was subsequently purchased by hanover insurance from thg at fair value 
sources of cash for our insurance subsidiaries primarily include premiums collected  investment income and maturing investments 
primary cash outflows are paid claims  losses and loss adjustment expenses  policy acquisition expenses  other underwriting expenses and investment purchases 
cash outflows related to claims  losses and loss adjustment expenses can be variable because of uncertainties surrounding settlement dates for liabilities for unpaid losses and because of the potential for large losses either individually or in the aggregate 
we periodically adjust our investment policy to respond to changes in short term and long term cash requirements 
net cash provided by operating activities was million  million and million for the three years ended december   and  respectively 
the million increase in cash provided by operating activities primarily resulted from cash received related to a commutation of a block of our accident and health voluntary pools  lower contributions to our qualified defined benefit pension plan during and from lower federal income tax payments made in the million increase in cash provided by operating activities in compared to primarily resulted from higher net written premium in our property and casualty business 
in addition  lower payments in associated with hurricane katrina also contributed to the increase in cash from operations 
these increases were partially offset by increased non hurricane katrina loss and loss adjustment expense payments 
net cash provided by investing activities was million in as compared to net cash used of million in and million in during  cash was primarily provided by net sales and maturities of fixed maturity securities 
due to the uncertainty in the capital markets  we held a high level of cash and cash equivalents during the fourth quarter 
partially offsetting this increase was cash payments made in connection with the acquisitions of aix holdings  inc and verlan holdings  inc during  we used cash primarily to fund net purchases of fixed maturity securities  resulting from improved underwriting results in our property and casualty business  partially offset by the run off of our life companies operations 
additionally  in  we purchased professionals direct  inc in  approximately million of the cash provided resulted from proceeds received from the sale of our variable life insurance and annuity business and financial profiles  inc additionally  we received cash in from collections related to mortgage loans 
net cash used in financing activities was million  million and million in  and  respectively 
during  cash used in financing activities primarily resulted from net repurchases of 
table of contents million of treasury stock  million of net repayments related to our securities lending program  million in dividends paid to shareholders and million related to the maturity of a trust instrument supported by a funding obligation 
during  cash used in financing activities resulted from a net repayment of million related to our securities lending program and dividend payments of million  partially offset by million of proceeds from option exercises 
cash used in was primarily due to the maturity of certain long term funding agreements in our life companies segment and to fund our share repurchase program  in which we repurchased million shares at an aggregate cost of approximately million 
at december   thg  as a holding company  held million of fixed maturities and cash  which includes million of trust preferred capital securities of a thg affiliated entity that have a face value of million  and thus are not available to meet liquidity requirements 
we believe our holding company assets are sufficient to meet our future obligations  which currently consist primarily of interest on both our senior debentures and our junior subordinated debentures  and our dividend to shareholders as discussed below 
we also expect that the holding company may be required to make payments in related to indemnification of liabilities associated with the sale of various subsidiaries 
we currently do not expect that it will be necessary to dividend funds from our insurance subsidiaries in order to fund holding company obligations 
in  we paid an annual dividend of forty five cents per share to our shareholders totaling million 
we believe that our holding company assets are sufficient to provide for future shareholder dividends should the board of directors declare them 
the sale of faflic provided net cash to the holding company of approximately million as follows proceeds from sale of in kind dividended assets to hanover insurance additional pre close contributions to faflic gross proceeds from commonwealth annuity net cost related to exchange of investments between hanover insurance and faflic transaction costs estimated indemnification payments within one year total cash from the sale of faflic and related intercompany settlements including the aforementioned faflic sale transactions  the majority of which settled just subsequent to december   the aforementioned million of trust preferred capital securities and a million capital contribution provided to hanover insurance in january  our holding company cash would have been million 
we expect to continue to generate sufficient positive operating cash to meet all short term and long term cash requirements  including the funding of our qualified defined benefit pension plan 
based on current law  we are required to contribute million in based upon december  values and taking into consideration recent government relief actions associated with pension plan funding  we may be required to make significant cash contributions to our qualified defined benefit pension plan for several years beginning in  which we currently estimate to range from approximately million to million annually 
effective january   hanover insurance assumed faflic s responsibilities as the common employer of all employees of the holding company and its subsidiaries and as such  the funding of these plans is now the responsibility of hanover insurance 
our insurance subsidiaries maintain a high degree of liquidity within their respective investment portfolios in fixed maturity and short term investments 
recently  the financial markets have experienced unprecedented declines in value  including many securities currently held by thg and its subsidiaries 
we believe that recent and ongoing government actions  including the emergency economic stabilization act of  the american recovery and reinvestment act and other us and global government programs and the quality of the assets we hold will allow us to realize these securities anticipated long term economic value 
furthermore  as of december   we had the intent and ability to retain such investments for the period of time anticipated to allow for this expected recovery in fair value 
we do not anticipate the need to sell these securities to meet our insurance subsidiaries cash requirements 
we expect our insurance subsidiaries to generate sufficient operating cash to meet all short term and long term cash requirements 
however  there can be no assurance that unforeseen business needs or other items will not occur causing us to have to sell securities before their values fully recover  thereby causing us to recognize additional impairment charges in that time period 
on october   our board of directors authorized a share repurchase program of up to million 

table of contents under this repurchase authorization  we may repurchase our common stock from time to time  in amounts and prices and at such times as we deem appropriate  subject to market conditions and other considerations 
we are not required to purchase any specific number of shares or to make purchases by any certain date under this program 
through december   we repurchased approximately million shares for a cost of approximately million 
we have not purchased any shares since june we may repurchase shares under this program in future periods upon the stabilization of the financial markets and when management deems appropriate 
from time to time we may also repurchase senior debt or capital securities on an opportunistic basis 
through december   we have repurchased million of trust preferred securities of an affiliated entity  which have a face value of million 
in june  we entered into a million committed syndicated credit agreement which expires in june borrowings  if any  under this agreement are unsecured and incur interest at a rate per annum equal to  at our option  a designated base rate or the eurodollar rate plus applicable margin 
the agreement provides covenants  including  but not limited to  maintaining a certain level of equity and an rbc ratio in our primary property and casualty companies of at least based on the industry scale 
we are in compliance with the covenants of this agreement 
we had no borrowings under this line of credit during and prior 
additionally  we had no commercial paper borrowings as of december  and we do not anticipate utilizing commercial paper in our financing obligations generally include repayment of our senior debentures and junior subordinated debentures and operating lease payments 
the following table represents our annual payments related to the principal payments of these financing obligations as of december  and operating lease payments reflect expected cash payments based upon lease terms 
in addition  we also have included our estimated payments related to our policy and claim reserves and our current expectation of payments to be made to support the obligations of our benefit plans 
actual payments may differ from the contractual and or estimated payments in the table 
december  in millions maturity less than year maturity years maturity years maturity in excess of years total long term debt interest associated with long term debt operating lease commitments qualified pension plan funding obligations non qualified pension and post retirement benefit obligations investment commitments loss and lae obligations long term debt includes our senior debentures due in  which pay annual interest at a rate of  and our junior subordinated debentures due in  which pay cumulative dividends at an annual rate of

our insurance subsidiaries are lessees with a number of operating leases 
qualified pension plan funding obligations represent estimated amounts necessary to be contributed to the plan to satisfy minimum funding obligations in accordance with the employee retirement income security act of these payments have been estimated until final payment of all plan benefits 
additional contributions may be required based on the level of pension assets and liabilities in future periods 
these estimated payments are based on several assumptions  including  but not limited to  the rate of return on plan assets  the discount rate for benefit obligations  mortality experience  and interest crediting rates 
differences between actual plan experience and our assumptions are likely and will result in changes to our minimum funding obligations in future periods 
non qualified pension and postretirement benefit obligations reflect estimated payments to be made through plan year for pension  postretirement and postemployment benefits 
estimates of these payments and the payment patterns are based upon historical experience 
unlike many other forms of contractual obligations  loss and lae reserves do not have definitive due dates and the ultimate payment dates are subject to a number of variables and uncertainties 
as a result  the total loss and lae reserve payments to be made by period  as shown above  are estimates based principally on historical experience 

table of contents other matters we have a qualified defined benefit pension plan and several non qualified pension plans that were frozen as of january  several factors and assumptions affect the amount of costs associated with the plans and contributions required to be provided to the trust for the qualified plan  including  among others  assumed long term rates of return on plan assets 
to determine the expected long term return on plan assets  we consider the historical mean returns by asset class for passive indexed strategies  as well as current and expected asset allocations and adjust for certain factors that we believe will have an impact on future returns 
actual returns on plan assets in any given year seldom result in the achievement of the expected rate of return on assets 
actual returns that are in excess of these expected returns will generally reduce the net actuarial losses that are reflected in our accumulated other comprehensive income balance in shareholders equity  whereas actual returns on plan assets which are less than expected returns will generally increase our net actuarial losses that are reflected in accumulated other comprehensive income 
these gains or losses are amortized into expense in future years 
expenses related to these plans are generally calculated based upon information available at the beginning of the plan year 
for  our pre tax expense related to our defined benefit plans was million 
the assets held by the qualified benefit plan are subject to the current global economic crisis see investment portfolio on pages to of this form k 
these investment assets have generated significant levels of negative returns during the market decline in resulted in actual returns of plan investments totaling approximately million of losses related to our qualified plan 
these losses  compounded by a long term return assumption of  partially offset by a slightly higher discount rate than that of the prior year  resulted in increased actuarial losses as of december  of approximately million  which are reflected in our accumulated other comprehensive income 
this increase in actuarial losses will be amortized into expense in future years and will result in pension related expenses in that are significantly higher than our costs in accordingly  we expect our pre tax pension expense to increase by approximately million in  from million in to million in funding shortages are another impact that the severe decline in market values will have on companies that have defined benefit plans 
the decline in pension asset values is expected to cause severe underfunded positions as of january  for many companies  who have sought and received recently  government relief associated with the funding aspect of their plans 
we have traditionally funded our qualified benefit plan based upon at least the erisa minimum level 
this results in an estimated minimum funding requirement of million during subsequent to and as discussed in liquidity and capital resources on pages to of this form k  we expect the funding for our qualified plan to increase significantly in order to maintain what management deems to be appropriate funding levels in light of the current economic environment 
off balance sheet arrangements we currently do not have any material off balance sheet arrangements that are reasonably likely to have an effect on our financial position  revenues  expenses  results of operations  liquidity  capital expenditures  or capital resources 
contingencies and regulatory matters litigation and certain regulatory matters durand litigation on march   a putative class action suit captioned jennifer a 
durand v 
the hanover insurance group  inc  the allmerica financial cash balance pension plan was filed in the united states district court for the western district of kentucky 
the named plaintiff  a former employee who received a lump sum distribution from our cash balance plan at or about the time of her termination  claims that she and others similarly situated did not receive the appropriate lump sum distribution because in computing the lump sum  we understated the accrued benefit in the calculation 
we filed a motion to dismiss on the basis that the plaintiff failed to exhaust administrative remedies  which motion was granted without prejudice in a decision dated november  plaintiff filed a notice of appeal of this dismissal to the united states court of appeals for the sixth circuit  oral arguments on the plaintiff s appeal took place on october   and we are awaiting the court s decision 
in our judgment  the outcome is not expected to be material to our financial position  although it could have a material effect on the results of operations for a particular quarter or annual period 
hurricane katrina litigation we have been named as a defendant in various litigations  including putative class actions  relating to 
table of contents disputes arising from damages which occurred as a result of hurricane katrina in as of december   there were approximately such cases 
these cases have been filed in both louisiana state courts and federal district courts 
these cases generally involve  among other claims  disputes as to the amount of reimbursable claims in particular cases eg how much of the damage to an insured property is attributable to flood and therefore not covered  and how much is attributable to wind  which may be covered  as well as the scope of insurance coverage under homeowners and commercial property policies due to flooding  civil authority actions  loss of landscaping  business interruption and other matters 
certain of these cases claim a breach of duty of good faith or violations of louisiana insurance claims handling laws or regulations and involve claims for punitive or exemplary damages 
on august   the state of louisiana individually and on behalf of the state of louisiana  division of administration  office of community development filed a putative class action in the civil district court for the parish of orleans  state of louisiana  entitled state of louisiana  individually and on behalf of state of louisiana  division of administration  office of community development ex rel the honorable charles c

the complaint named as defendants over foreign and domestic insurance carriers  including us 
plaintiff seeks to represent a class of current and former louisiana citizens who have applied for and received or will receive funds through louisiana s road home program 
on august   plaintiff filed an amended petition in this case  asserting myriad claims  including claims for breach of contract  the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing  fiduciary duty and louisiana s bad faith statutes 
plaintiff seeks relief in the form of  among other things  declarations that a the efficient proximate cause of losses suffered by putative class members was windstorm  a covered peril under their policies  b the second efficient proximate cause of their losses was storm surge  which plaintiff contends is not excluded under class members policies  c the damage caused by water entering affected parishes of louisiana does not fall within the definition of flood  d the damages caused by water entering orleans parish and the surrounding area was a result of a man made occurrence and are properly covered under class members policies  e many class members suffered total losses to their residences  and f many class members are entitled to recover the full value for their residences stated on their policies pursuant to the louisiana valued policy law 
in accordance with these requested declarations  plaintiff seeks to recover amounts that it alleges should have been paid to policyholders under their insurance agreements  as well as penalties  attorneys fees  and costs 
the case has been removed to the federal district court for the eastern district of louisiana 
we have established our loss and lae reserves on the assumption that we will not have any liability under the road home or similar litigation  and that we will otherwise prevail in litigation as to the causes of certain large losses and not incur extra contractual or punitive damages 
other matters we have been named a defendant in various other legal proceedings arising in the normal course of business  including two suits with respect to which we are obligated to indemnify commonwealth annuity and goldman sachs in connection with the sale in of our variable life insurance and annuity business  which challenge our former life companies imposition of certain restrictions on trading funds invested in separate accounts 
regulatory and industry developments unfavorable economic conditions may contribute to an increase in the number of insurance companies that are under regulatory supervision 
this may result in an increase in mandatory assessments by state guaranty funds  or voluntary payments by solvent insurance companies to cover losses to policyholders of insolvent or rehabilitated companies 
mandatory assessments  which are subject to statutory limits  can be partially recovered through a reduction in future premium taxes in some states 
we are not able to reasonably estimate the potential impact of any such future assessments or voluntary payments 
over the past three years  state sponsored insurers  reinsurers or involuntary pools have increased significantly  particularly those states which have atlantic or gulf coast exposures 
as a result  the potential assessment exposure of insurers doing business in such states and the attendant collection risks have increased  particularly  in our case  in the states of massachusetts  
table of contents louisiana and florida 
such actions and related regulatory restrictions may limit our ability to reduce the potential exposure to hurricane related losses 
it is possible that other states may take action similar to those taken in the state of florida  which has significantly restricted the ability to raise rates on homes and other properties  authorized a state sponsored insurer of last resort to compete with private insurers  mandated the use of certain state sponsored reinsurance mechanisms  and subjected insurers writing business in the state to significant assessments in the event such state sponsored entities are unable to fund claims against them 
at this time  we are unable to predict the likelihood or impact of any such potential assessments or other actions 
in february  the governor of michigan called upon every automobile insurer operating in the state to freeze personal automobile insurance rates for months to allow time for the legislature to enact comprehensive automobile insurance reform 
in addition  she endorsed a number of proposals by her appointed automobile and home insurance consumer advocate which would  among other things  change the current rate approval process from the current file and use system to prior approval  mandate affordable rates  reduce the threshold for lawsuits to be filed in at fault incidents  and prohibit the use of certain underwriting criteria such as credit scores 
the office of financial and insurance regulation had previously issued regulations prohibiting the use of credit scores to rate personal lines insurance policies  which regulations are the subject of litigation which is expected to be reviewed by the michigan supreme court 
at this time  we are unable to predict the likelihood of adoption or impact on our business of any such proposals or regulations  but any such restrictions could have an adverse effect on our results of operations 
from time to time  proposals have been made to establish a federal based insurance regulatory system and to allow insurers to elect either federal or state based regulation optional federal chartering 
in light of the current economic crisis and the focus on increased regulatory controls  particularly with regard to financial institutions  we expect renewed interest in such proposals 
we cannot predict the impact that any such change will have on our business 
in addition  we are involved  from time to time  in investigations and proceedings by governmental and self regulatory agencies 
the potential outcome of any such action or regulatory proceedings in which we have been named a defendant  and our ultimate liability  if any  from such action or regulatory proceedings  is difficult to predict at this time 
in our opinion  based on the advice of legal counsel  the ultimate resolutions of such proceedings will not have a material effect on our financial position  although they could have a material effect on the results of operations for a particular quarter or annual period 
residual markets we are required to participate in residual markets in various states  which generally pertain to high risk insureds  disrupted markets or lines of business or geographic areas where rates are regarded as excessive 
the results of the residual markets are not subject to the predictability associated with our own managed business  and are significant to the workers compensation line of business  the homeowners line of business and both the personal and commercial automobile lines of business 
rating agency actions insurance companies are rated by rating agencies to provide both industry participants and insurance consumers information on specific insurance companies 
higher ratings generally indicate the rating agencies opinion regarding financial stability and a stronger ability to pay claims 
we believe that strong ratings are important factors in marketing our products to our agents and customers  since rating information is broadly disseminated and generally used throughout the industry 
insurance company financial strength ratings are assigned to an insurer based upon factors deemed by the rating agencies to be relevant to policyholders and are not directed toward protection of investors
