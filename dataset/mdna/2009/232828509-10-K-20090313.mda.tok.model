item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations should be read together with the discussion under selected financial data and our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report 
this discussion contains forward looking statements  based on current expectations and related to future events and our future financial performance  that involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of many important factors  including those set forth under the caption risk factors and elsewhere in this annual report 
overview cytrx corporation we are a biopharmaceutical research and development company engaged in the development of high value human therapeutics 
our drug development pipeline includes two product candidates in clinical development for cancer indications  including registration studies of tamibarotene for the treatment of acute promyelocytic leukemia  or apl 
in addition to our core oncology programs  we are developing treatments for neurodegenerative and other disorders based upon our small molecule molecular chaperone amplification technology 
we also are engaged in new drug discovery research at our laboratory facility in san diego  california  utilizing our master chaperone regulator assay  or macra  technology 
apart from our drug development programs and new drug discovery research activities  we currently maintain a equity interest in our former subsidiary  rxi pharmaceuticals corporation  or rxi nasdaq rxii 
we have relied primarily upon selling equity securities and upon proceeds received upon the exercise of options and warrants and  to a much lesser extent  upon payments from our strategic partners and licensees  to generate funds needed to finance our business and operations 
at december   we had cash  cash equivalents and short term investments of million 
we believe that cytrx s current resources will be sufficient to support its currently planned level of operations through the first quarter of this estimate is based  in part  upon our currently projected expenditures for of approximately million  including approximately million for our clinical program for tamibarotene  approximately million for our clinical program for inno  approximately million for our clinical program for inno  approximately million for our animal toxicology studies and related activities for arimoclomol  approximately million for operating our clinical programs  approximately million for research activities at its laboratory in san diego  california  and approximately million for other general and administrative expenses 
projected expenditures are based upon numerous assumptions and subject to many uncertainties  and our actual expenditures may be significantly different from these projections 
we will be required to obtain additional funding in order to execute its long term business plans  although we do not currently have commitments from any third parties to provide us with capital 
we cannot assure that additional funding will be available on favorable terms  or at all 
if we fail to obtain additional funding when needed  we may not be able to execute our business plans and our business may suffer  which would have a material adverse effect on our financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
our separation from rxi pharmaceuticals corporation rxi pharmaceuticals corporation was founded in april by us and four researchers in the field of rnai  including dr 
craig mello  recipient of the nobel prize for medicine for his co discovery of rnai 
rnai is a naturally occurring mechanism for the regulation of gene expression that has the potential to selectively inhibit the activity of any human gene 
in january  we transferred to rxi substantially all of our rnai related technologies and assets  and rxi began operating on a stand alone basis for the purpose of accelerating the discovery of rnai therapeutics previously sponsored by us 
rxi s initial focus is on developing rnai based product candidates for treating neurological and metabolic disorders and cancer 
until early  we owned approximately of the outstanding shares of common stock of rxi and our financial statements  including our financial statements as of and for the year ended december   included the consolidated financial condition and results of operations of rxi 
on february   our board of directors declared a dividend of one share of rxi common stock for each approximately shares of our common stock held by such stockholders  which was paid on march  and which reduced our ownership of rxi shares to less than 
for periods beginning with the first quarter of  if cytrx owns more than but less than of the outstanding shares of rxi  cytrx will account for its investment in rxi using the equity method 
under the equity method  cytrx will record its pro rata share of the gains or losses of rxi against its historical basis investment in rxi 
research and development expenditures for research and development activities related to continuing operations were million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively  with research and development expenses representing approximately  and of our total expenses for the years ended december   and  respectively 
research and development expenses are further discussed below under critical accounting policies and estimates and results of operations 
our currently projected expenditures for include approximately million for our clinical program for tamibarotene  approximately million for our clinical program for inno  approximately million for our inno program  approximately million for our animal toxicology studies and related activities for arimoclomol  approximately million for operating our clinical programs  and approximately million for research activities at our laboratory in san diego  california 
the actual cost of our clinical programs could differ significantly from our current projections due to any additional requirements or delays imposed by the fda in connection with our planned trials  or if actual costs are higher than current management estimates for other reasons  including complications with manufacturing 
in the event that actual costs of our clinical program  or any of our other ongoing research activities  are significantly higher than our current estimates  we may be required to significantly modify our planned level of operations 
there is a risk that any drug discovery and development program may not produce revenue because of the risks inherent in drug discovery and development 
the successful development of any product candidate is highly uncertain 
we cannot reasonably estimate or know the nature  timing and costs of the efforts necessary to complete the development of  or the period in which material net cash inflows are expected to commence from any product candidate  due to the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with developing drugs  including the uncertainty of our ability to advance product candidates into pre clinical and clinical trials  the scope  rate and progress of our pre clinical trials and other research and development activities  the scope  rate of progress and cost of any clinical trials we commence  the cost of filing  prosecuting  defending and enforcing any patent claims and other intellectual property rights  future clinical trial results  the terms and timing of any collaborative  licensing and other arrangements that we may establish  the cost and timing of regulatory approvals  the cost and timing of establishing sales  marketing and distribution capabilities  the cost of establishing clinical and commercial supplies of our product candidates and any products that we may develop  and the effect of competing technological and market developments 
any failure to complete any stage of the development of our products in a timely manner could have a material adverse effect on our operations  financial position and liquidity 
a discussion of the risks and uncertainties associated with our business is set forth in the risk factors section of this annual report 
critical accounting policies and estimates management s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  management evaluates its estimates  including those related to revenue recognition  stock options  impairment of long lived assets  including finite lived intangible assets  accrued liabilities and certain expenses 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
our significant accounting policies are summarized in note of the notes to financial statements included in this annual report 
we believe the following critical accounting policies are affected by our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements revenue recognition biopharmaceutical revenues consist of license fees from strategic alliances with pharmaceutical companies as well as service and grant revenues 
service revenues consist of contract research and laboratory consulting 
grant revenues consist of government and private grants 
monies received for license fees are deferred and recognized ratably over the performance period in accordance with staff accounting bulletin sab no 
 revenue recognition 
milestone payments will be recognized upon achievement of the milestone as long as the milestone is deemed substantive and we have no other performance obligations related to the milestone and collectability is reasonably assured  which is generally upon receipt  or recognized upon termination of the agreement and all related obligations 
deferred revenue represents amounts received prior to revenue recognition 
revenues from contract research  government grants  and consulting fees are recognized over the respective contract periods as the services are performed  provided there is persuasive evidence or an arrangement  the fee is fixed or determinable and collection of the related receivable is reasonably assured 
once all conditions of the grant are met and no contingencies remain outstanding  the revenue is recognized as grant fee revenue and an earned but unbilled revenue receivable is recorded 
in august  we received approximately million in proceeds from the privately funded als charitable remainder trust alscrt in exchange for the commitment to continue research and development of arimoclomol and other potential treatments for als and a one percent royalty in the worldwide sales of arimoclomol 
under the arrangement  we retain the rights to any products or intellectual property funded by the arrangement and the proceeds of the transaction are non refundable 
further  the alscrt has no obligation to provide any further funding to us 
we have concluded that due to the research and development components of the transaction that it is properly accounted for under statement of financial accounting standards no 
 research and development arrangements 
accordingly  we have recorded the value received under the arrangement as deferred service revenue and will recognize service revenue using the proportional performance method of revenue recognition  meaning that service revenue is recognized on a dollar for dollar basis for each dollar of expense incurred for the research and development of arimoclomol and other potential als treatments 
we believe that this method best approximates the efforts expended related to the services provided 
we adjust our estimates of expense incurred for this research and development on a quarterly basis 
for the years ended december   and  we recognized approximately million  million and million  respectively  of service revenue related to this transaction 
any significant change in als related research and development expense in any particular quarterly or annual period will result in a change in the recognition of revenue for that period and consequently affect the comparability or revenue from period to period 
the amount of deferred revenue  current portion is the amount of deferred revenue that is expected to be recognized in the next twelve months and is subject to fluctuation based upon management s estimates 
management s estimates include an evaluation of what pre clinical and clinical trials are necessary  the timing of when trials will be performed and the estimated clinical trial expenses 
these estimates are subject to changes and could have a significant effect on the amount and timing of when the deferred revenues are recognized 
research and development expenses research and development expenses consist of costs incurred for direct and overhead related research expenses and are expensed as incurred 
costs to acquire technologies  including licenses  that are utilized in research and development and that have no alternative future use are expensed when incurred 
technology developed for use in its products is expensed as incurred until technological feasibility has been established 
clinical trial expenses clinical trial expenses  which are included in research and development expenses  include obligations resulting from our contracts with various clinical research organizations in connection with conducting clinical trials for our product candidates 
we recognize expenses for these activities based on a variety of factors  including actual and estimated labor hours  clinical site initiation activities  patient enrollment rates  estimates of external costs and other activity based factors 
we believe that this method best approximates the efforts expended on a clinical trial with the expenses we record 
we adjust our rate of clinical expense recognition if actual results differ from our estimates 
if our estimates are incorrect  clinical trial expenses recorded in any particular period could vary 
stock based compensation our share based employee compensation plans are described in note of the notes to our financial statements 
effective january   we adopted the provisions of sfas r  share based payment 
sfas r  which requires that companies recognize compensation expense associated with stock option grants and other equity instruments to employees in the financial statements 
sfas r applies to all grants after the effective date and to the unvested portion of stock options outstanding as of the effective date 
we adopted sfas r using the modified prospective method and use the black scholes valuation model for valuing share based payments 
we will continue to account for transactions in which services are received in exchange for equity instruments based on the fair value of such services received from non employees  in accordance with sfas r  emerging issues task force issue no 
eitf  accounting for equity instruments that are issued to other than employees for acquiring  or in conjunction with selling goods or services and eitf  accounting recognition for certain transactions involving equity instruments granted to other than employees  as amended 
our statement of operations as of and for the years ended december   and reflects the impact of sfas r 
in accordance with the modified prospective transition method  our results of operations for prior periods have not been restated to reflect the impact of sfas r 
prior to january   we accounted for share based compensation under the recognition and measurement provisions of accounting principles board no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees apb  and related interpretations for all awards granted to employees 
under apb  when the exercise price of options granted to employees under these plans equals or exceeds the market price of the common stock on the date of grant  no compensation expense is recorded 
when the exercise price of options granted to employees under these plans is less than the market price of the common stock on the date of grant  compensation expense is recognized over the vesting period 
non employee share based compensation charges generally are amortized over the vesting period on a straight line basis 
in certain circumstances  option grants to non employees are immediately vested and have no future performance or service requirements by the non employee and the total share based compensation charge is recorded in the period of the measurement date 
the fair value of each cytrx and rxi common stock option grant is estimated using the black scholes option pricing model  which uses certain assumptions related to risk free interest rates  expected volatility  expected life of the common stock options and future dividends 
compensation expense is recorded based upon the value derived from the black scholes option pricing model  based on an expected forfeiture rate that is adjusted for actual experience 
if our black scholes option pricing model assumptions or our actual or estimated forfeiture rate are different in the future  that could materially affect compensation expense recorded in future periods 
impairment of long lived assets we review long lived assets  including finite lived intangible assets  for impairment on an annual basis  as of december  or on an interim basis if an event occurs that might reduce the fair value of such assets below their carrying values 
an impairment loss would be recognized based on the difference between the carrying value of the asset and its estimated fair value  which would be determined based on either discounted future cash flows or other appropriate fair value methods 
if our estimates used in the determination of either discounted future cash flows or other appropriate fair value methods are not accurate as compared to actual future results we may be required to record an impairment charge 
earnings per share basic and diluted loss per common share are computed based on the weighted average number of common shares outstanding 
common share equivalents which consist of options and warrants are excluded from the computation of diluted loss per share since the effect would be antidilutive 
common share equivalents which could potentially dilute basic earnings per share in the future  and which were excluded from the computation of diluted loss per share  totaled approximately million shares  million shares and million shares at december   and  respectively 
in connection with our adjustment to the exercise terms of certain outstanding warrants to purchase common stock on march  and march   we recorded deemed dividends of  and  respectively 
these deemed dividends are reflected as an adjustment to net loss for the first quarter of and the first quarter of to arrive at net loss applicable to common stockholders on the consolidated statement of operations and for purposes of calculating basic and diluted earnings per shares 
quarterly financial data the following table sets forth unaudited consolidated statements of operations data for each quarter during our most recent two fiscal years 
this quarterly information has been derived from our unaudited consolidated financial statements and  in the opinion of management  includes all adjustments  consisting only of normal recurring adjustments  necessary for a fair presentation of the information for the periods covered 
the quarterly financial data should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes 
the operating results for any quarter are not necessarily indicative of the operating results for any future period 
quarters ended march june september december in thousands  except per share data total revenues net loss deemed dividend for anti dilution adjustments made to outstanding common stock warrants net loss applicable to common stockholders basic and diluted loss per share applicable to common stock total revenues net loss deemed dividend for anti dilution adjustments made to outstanding common stock warrants net loss applicable to common stockholders basic and diluted loss per share applicable to common stock quarterly and yearly loss per share amounts are computed independently of each other 
therefore  the sum of the per share amounts for the quarters may not equal the per share amounts for the year 
in  we adopted sfas r  and in and we incurred and million  respectively  in employee non cash compensation expenses 
in connection with our adjustment to the exercise terms of certain outstanding warrants to purchase common stock on march   we recorded deemed dividends of  these deemed dividends are reflected as an adjustment to net loss for the first quarter of to arrive at net loss applicable to common stockholders on the consolidated statement of operations and for purposes of calculating basic and diluted earnings per shares 
fourth quarter adjustment during the fourth quarter of  the company recorded adjustments for i additional compensation expense of  related to previously granted non employee stock options  ii additional compensation expense of  related to stock options previously granted to directors and iii additional general and administrative expense of  related to legal fees rendered during the third quarter 
management concluded the effect of these adjustments was not material to any previously reported quarterly period 
liquidity and capital resources general at december   we had cash  cash equivalents and short term investments of million  compared to million at december  our working capital totaled million and our total assets were million at december   compared to million and million  respectively  at december  we have relied primarily upon selling equity securities and upon proceeds received upon the exercise of options and warrants and  to a much lesser extent  upon payments from our strategic partners and licensees  to generate funds needed to finance our business and operations 
we believe that our current resources will be sufficient to support our currently planned level of operations through the first quarter of this estimate is based  in part  upon our currently projected expenditures for of approximately million  including approximately million for our clinical program for tamibarotene  approximately million for our clinical program for inno  approximately million for our clinical program for inno  approximately million for our animal toxicology studies and related activities for arimoclomol  approximately million for operating our clinical programs  approximately million for research activities at our laboratory in san diego  california  and approximately million for other general and administrative expenses 
these projected expenditures are based upon numerous assumptions and subject to many uncertainties  and our actual expenditures may be significantly different from these projections 
we have no significant revenue  and we expect to have no significant revenue and to continue to incur significant losses over the next several years 
our net losses may increase from current levels primarily due to expenses related to our ongoing and planned clinical trials  research and development programs  possible technology acquisitions  and other general corporate activities 
we anticipate  therefore  that our operating results will fluctuate for the foreseeable future and period to period comparisons should not be relied upon as predictive of the results in future periods 
discussion of operating  investing and financing activities net loss for the year ended december  was million  and cash used for operating activities for that period was million 
the net loss for the year reflects million of non cash revenue recognized under the agreement with alscrt  a non cash expense of million related to the acquisition of innovive s in process research and development  a non cash equity loss in our non consolidated rxi subsidiary of million and million for stock option and warrant expense 
net loss for the year ended december  was million  and cash used for operating activities for that period was million 
the net loss for the year reflects million of non cash revenue recognized under the agreement with alscrt and million for stock option and warrant expense 
net loss for the year ended december  was million  and cash provided from operating activities for that period was million 
the cash provided from operating activities includes net proceeds of million received from alscrt reflected in august in connection with the sale of a one percent royalty interest in our worldwide sales of arimoclomol for als 
reflected in the net loss of million is million of revenue recognized in in connection with that sale 
the remaining million of the net proceeds from that sale were recorded as deferred revenues 
other non cash items included in our net loss necessary to reconcile cash provided from operating activities include million in stock option expense related to options granted to employees and consultants  of which million of expenses for employee options recorded under sfas r  which we adopted in  and accordingly no corresponding amount was recorded in earlier periods 
for the year ended december   million was used in investing activities 
the year included million of rxi funds resulting from converting short term investments to cash equivalents 
however  rxi s cash of million inclusive of this million is not available to us due to the deconsolidation 
the total cash outlay to acquire innovive totaled million  which related primarily to the payment of innovive s accounts payable 
the other million was used for the purchase of equipment and furnishings  primarily associated with equipping the san diego laboratory 
for the year ended december   million was used in investing activities 
of this amount  million was used by rxi for the purchase of short term investments 
the other million was used for the purchase of equipment and furnishings  primarily associated with equipping our san diego laboratory 
we intend to assess periodically the costs and potential commercial value of our new drug discovery activities 
depending on these assessments  we may determine to modify  out source  partner or suspend these activities 
for the year ended december   only a small amount of cash was used in investing activities 
other investing activities consisted primarily of the purchase of small amounts of computers and laboratory equipment 
cash provided by financing activities for the year ended december  was million 
during  we received million from the exercise of stock options and warrants 
cash provided by financing activities for the year ended december  was million compared to million and million in the years ended december  and  respectively 
during  we raised million in a private placement of our common stock and an additional million from the exercise of previously outstanding stock options and warrants 
during  we raised million through a private placement of our common stock and an additional million from the exercise of stock options and warrants 
during the year ended december   we raised million through a private placement of common stock 
we believe that we have adequate working capital to allow us to operate at our currently planned levels through the first quarter of we may require additional capital in order to fund the completion of our clinical programs  and the other ongoing research and development related to our molecular chaperone amplification drug candidates 
we may incur substantial additional expense and our clinical programs may be delayed if the fda requires us to generate additional pre clinical or clinical data in connection with the clinical trials  or the fda requires us to revise significantly our planned protocols for our planned clinical trials 
at december   our equity investment in rxi of  common stock had an approximate fair value of million  based on the closing price of rxi common stock nasdaq rxii on that date 
sale of a portion or all of this investment would generate additional cash 
we also intend to pursue other sources of capital  although we do not currently have commitments from any third parties to provide us with capital 
our ability to obtain future financings through joint ventures  product licensing arrangements  equity financings  gifts  and grants or otherwise is subject to market conditions and out ability to identify parties that are willing and able to enter into such arrangements on terms that are satisfactory to us 
depending upon the outcome of our fundraising efforts  the accompanying financial information may not necessarily be indicative of future operating results or future financial condition 
we expect to incur significant losses for the foreseeable future and there can be no assurance that we will become profitable 
even if we become profitable  we may not be able to sustain that profitability 
off balance sheet arrangements we have no off balance sheet arrangements that have a material current effect or that are reasonably likely to have a material future effect on our financial condition  changes in financial condition  revenues or expenses  results of operations  liquidity  capital expenditures  or capital resources 
contractual obligations we sometimes acquire assets still in development and enter into research and development arrangements with third parties that often require milestone and royalty payments to the third party contingent upon the occurrence of certain future events linked to the success of the asset in development 
milestone payments may be required  contingent upon the successful achievement of an important point in the development life cycle of the pharmaceutical product eg  approval of the product for marketing by a regulatory agency 
if required by the arrangement  we may have to make royalty payments based upon a percentage of the sales of the pharmaceutical product in the event that regulatory approval for marketing is obtained 
because of the contingent nature of these payments  they are not included in the table of contractual obligations 
these arrangements may be material individually  and in the unlikely event that milestones for multiple products covered by these arrangements were reached in the same period  the aggregate charge to expense could be material to the results of operations in any one period 
in addition  these arrangements often give us the discretion to unilaterally terminate development of the product  which would allow us to avoid making the contingent payments  however  we are unlikely to cease development if the compound successfully achieves clinical testing objectives 
we also note that  from a business perspective  we view these payments as positive because they signify that the product is successfully moving through development and is now generating or is more likely to generate cash flows from sales of products 
cytrx s current contractual obligations that will require future cash payments are as follows non cancelable operating leases employment agreements subtotal research and development total and thereafter total operating leases are primarily facility lease related obligations  as well as equipment and software lease obligations with third party vendors 
employment agreements include management contracts  which have been revised from time to time  provide for minimum salary levels  adjusted annually at the discretion of the company s compensation committee  as well as for minimum bonuses that are payable 
research and development obligations relate primarily to clinical trials 
most of these purchase obligations are cancelable 
net operating loss carryforwards at december   we had united states federal and state net operating loss carryforwards of million and million  respectively  available to offset against future taxable income  which expire in through as a result of a change in control that occurred in our shareholder base in july  approximately million in federal net operating loss carryforwards became limited in their availability to million annually 
management currently believes that the remaining million in federal net operating loss carryforwards  and the million in state net operating loss carryforwards  are unrestricted 
however  we are reviewing our recent equity transactions to determine if they may have resulted in any further restrictions on our net operating loss carryforwards 
additionally  due to the change in control  approximately million of research and development tax credits will not be available for utilization and were written off 
as of december   we also had research and development and alternative minimum tax credits for federal and state purposes of approximately million and million  respectively  available for offset against future income taxes  which expire in through based on an assessment of all available evidence including  but not limited to  our limited operating history in our core business and lack of profitability  uncertainties of the commercial viability of our technology  the impact of government regulation and healthcare reform initiatives  and other risks normally associated with biotechnology companies  we have concluded that it is more likely than not that these net operating loss carryforwards and credits will not be realized and  as a result  a deferred income tax valuation allowance has been recorded against these assets 
results of operations we recorded net losses of million  million and million during the years ended december   and  respectively 
during fiscal  we recognized million in service revenues relating to our million sale to the alscrt of a one percent royalty interest in the worldwide sales of arimoclomol in august this compares to million and million in service revenues in the years ended december  and  respectively 
during  and  we earned an immaterial amount of license fees and grant revenue 
all future licensing fees under our current licensing agreements are dependent upon successful development milestones being achieved by the licensor 
during fiscal  we are not anticipating the receipt of any significant service or licensing fees  although we estimate that we will recognize an additional million in service revenues from that arimoclomol royalty transaction 
we will continue to recognize the balance of the deferred revenue recorded from the royalty transaction with the als charitable remainder trust based on actual research and development costs incurred over the development period of our arimoclomol research 
research and development years ended december  in thousands research and development expense non cash research and development expense employee stock option expense research expenses are expenses incurred by us in the discovery of new information that will assist us in the creation and the development of new drugs or treatments 
development expenses are expenses incurred by us in our efforts to commercialize the findings generated through our research efforts 
research and development expenses incurred during  and relate to our various development programs 
in  only the months of january and february included rxi related expenses totaling approximately million  which accounts for the significant decrease in research and development expenses  and non cash research and development expenses 
in the year  our development costs associated with our phase ii clinical program for arimoclomol in als were million  the costs of our program for arimoclomol in stroke recovery and related studies were million  the costs of our program for iroxanadine for diabetic complications were million  the costs of operating our development programs were million  and the cost of operations in our research laboratory were million 
in september   cytrx acquired clinical stage oncology product candidates including tamibarotene from innovive pharmaceuticals  inc and our development costs associated with the innovive compounds were million 
none of our research and development costs have ever been capitalized 
as compensation to scientific advisory board sab members and consultants  and in connection with the acquisition of technology  we and rxi sometimes issue shares of common stock  stock options and warrants to purchase shares of common stock 
for financial statement purposes  we value these shares of common stock  stock options  and warrants at the fair value of the common stock  stock options or warrants granted  or the services received  whichever is more reliably measurable 
we recorded a recovery of million resulting from the application of marked to market accounting of the value of the non employee option grants in  and charges of million and million in this regard during and  respectively 
included in the research and development charges for were million of expense related to rxi s issuance of  shares of common stock to umms for certain license agreement rights and a new invention disclosure agreement and million for non qualifying stock options to sab members of rxi 
in  we recorded million of employee stock option expense as compared to million in and million in we also incurred an expenditure of million in related to the acquisition of innovive s in process research and development  which has been reflected as a separate line item on our consolidated statements of operations 
in  we expect our research and development expenses to increase as a result of our clinical programs with tamibarotene and inno general and administrative expenses years ended december  in thousands general and administrative expenses stock  stock option and warrant expenses to non employees and consultants employee stock option expense general and administrative expenses include all administrative salaries and general corporate expenses  including legal expenses associated with the prosecution of our intellectual property 
our general and administrative expenses  excluding common stock  stock options and warrants issued  and excluding depreciation expense  were million in  million in and million in general and administrative expenses in included million of rxi related expenses  whereas  in  the rxi related expenses for january and february totaled million 
the general and administrative expenses in  excluding rxi related expenses  increased by  as compared to this increase is a net result of an increase in legal and professional fees of approximately  primarily due to costs associated with the acquisition of innovive  offset by a reduction of  in legal and accounting fees as compared to  primarily due to the costs associated with the spin off of rxi in from time to time  we issue shares of our common stock or warrants or options to purchase shares of our common stock to consultants and other service providers in exchange for services 
for financial statement purposes  we value these shares of common stock  stock options  and warrants at the fair value of the common stock  stock options or warrants granted  or the services received  whichever we can measure more reliably 
since our adoption of sfas r in  we recorded employee stock option expense of million in fiscal  million in fiscal and million in the increase in over both and primarily related to stock options granted by rxi to recruit and retain directors  officers and additional employees 
depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization expenses were   and  in  and  respectively 
the depreciation expense reflects the depreciation of our fixed assets and the amortization expenses related to our molecular library 
other income in march  we recognized a non cash gain of  on the bonus paid to certain employees and directors in rxi shares 
in june  we recognized million of income arising from a fee received pursuant to a change in control provision included in the purchase agreement for our sale of its animal pharmaceutical unit 
interest income interest income was million in  million in and million in the variances between years are attributable primarily to the amount of funds available for investment each year and  to a lesser extent  changes in prevailing market rates 
minority interest in losses of subsidiary we offset  of minority interest in losses of rxi against our net loss for the months of january and february for the remainder of the year  rxi s gain and losses were accounted for under the equity method  because we owned less than of rxi following our march  distribution to our stockholders of rxi shares
