executive overview we develop  manufacture and market string ribbon solar panels utilizing our proprietary wafer manufacturing technology 
our technology involves a unique process to produce multi crystalline silicon wafers by growing thin strips of multi crystalline silicon that are then cut into wafers 
this unique process substantially reduces the amount of silicon and other processing costs required to produce a wafer when compared to wafer manufacturers utilizing conventional sawing processes 
with current silicon consumption of less than five grams per watt  we believe we are the industry leader in efficient silicon consumption and use approximately of the silicon used by wafer manufacturers utilizing conventional sawing processes 
the wafers we produce are the primary components of photovoltaic pv cells which  in turn  are used to produce our string ribbon solar panels 
we believe that our proprietary and patented technologies  combined with our integrated manufacturing process know how  offer significant cost and manufacturing advantages over competing silicon based pv technologies 
through intensive research and design efforts we have significantly enhanced our wafer manufacturing technology and our ability to manufacture multi crystalline silicon wafers 
our devens facility is using our quad wafer furnace equipment  which grows four thin strips of multi crystalline silicon from one furnace as compared to the dual strip furnaces historically used in the marlboro pilot facility 
our quad wafer furnace incorporates a state of the art automated wafer cutting technology that improves our manufacturing process 
we began production of solar panels in our first devens facility during the third quarter of upon reaching full production capacity  which is scheduled to occur in the second half of  the devens facility is expected to be operating at an annual production capacity of approximately mw 
since april we have entered into multi year silicon supply agreements with four suppliers 
silicon is the key raw material in manufacturing multi crystalline silicon wafers 
under our silicon supply agreements with dc chemical co  ltd 
or dc chemical  wacker chemie ag or wacker  solaricos trading  ltd or nitol  and silicium de provence sas or silpro  we have silicon under contract that provides over  metric tons of silicon through including metric tons in during  dc chemical is expected to provide approximately of our expected requirements 
our revenues today are primarily derived from the sale of solar panels  which are assemblies of pv cells that have been electrically interconnected and laminated in a physically durable and weather tight package 
we sell our products using distributors  systems integrators and other value added resellers  who often add value through system design by incorporating our panels with electronics  structures and wiring systems 
applications for our products primarily include on grid generation  in which supplemental electricity is provided to an electric utility grid 
our products are currently sold to customers primarily in europe and the united states 
during the year ended december  we entered into seven multi year solar panel supply agreements  a portion of which are denominated in euros 
the combined current estimated sales value for all seven agreements is approximately billion at december  exchange rates  with deliveries scheduled through on february   we completed an underwritten public offering of million shares of our common stock  which included the exercise of an underwriters option to purchase million additional shares 
we received net proceeds of approximately million net of underwriting discounts 
the shares of common stock were sold at a per share price to the public of 
in addition  on june   we entered into an underwriting agreement for the sale by us to the public of million aggregate principal amount of senior convertible notes due we granted to the underwriters a day option to purchase up to an additional million aggregate principal amount of the senior convertible notes 
on july   we completed our public offering of million aggregate principal amount of the senior convertible notes which included the underwriter s exercise of their option 
we received net proceeds from the offering  including the cost of the capped call transaction see capped call included in note of our consolidated financial statements  of approximately million 

table of contents on december   as part of ongoing efforts to lower overhead costs and reduce overall cash requirements  we committed to a plan to cease operations at our pilot manufacturing facility in marlboro  massachusetts 
production at the facility ceased on december  future advanced manufacturing piloting activities will be performed at our devens manufacturing facility 
almost all of the marlboro pilot manufacturing facility employees have transferred to the devens manufacturing facility to fill open positions associated with the second phase of devens 
as a result of the cessation of manufacturing in marlboro  we recorded restructuring costs  principally non cash charges  of approximately million associated with the write off of manufacturing and development equipment  inventory and leasehold improvements of the marlboro pilot facility 
we may also incur occupancy  location restoration and moving costs of approximately to million during we believe that closing the marlboro pilot facility and better utilizing existing equipment and facilities at our research and development center and at our devens manufacturing facility will result in lower overhead costs and reduce overall cash requirements 
at december   we had approximately million of cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities  of which approximately million was due to sovello as their sales agent 
through mid  the completion of the devens factory  the first phase of our midland factory and debt service interest payments will require approximately million  leaving approximately million available to fund our operations 
throughout the first half of  we expect our working capital requirements will increase substantially as production and shipments increase from our devens facility 
assuming we are able to execute our business plan as currently envisioned  we believe that our cash on hand combined with our expected large working capital balances will provide us with sufficient liquidity or access to liquidity to fund our operations and planned capital programs for the next months 
we also believe that given the current state of the worldwide economy and credit markets  it is prudent to pursue short term financing options  including but not limited to renegotiation of existing or new working capital lines of credit  in order to provide us with the most flexible liquidity protection possible 
if adequate capital does not become available when needed on acceptable terms  our ability to fund our operations  further develop and expand our manufacturing operations and distribution network  or otherwise respond to competitive pressures would be significantly limited 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of consolidated financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principals requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities  if applicable 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
accounting for sovello ag on december   we became equal partners in sovello with q cells and rec and now share equally in its prospective net income or loss 
as a result of our reduction in ownership to one third  we are required to account for our interest in sovello under the equity method of accounting  as opposed to consolidating the operating results of sovello as we had in the past 
under the equity method of accounting  we report our one third share of sovello s net income or loss as a single line item in our statement of operations and our investment in sovello as a single line item in our balance sheet 
we began applying the equity method with respect to sovello on december  until december   we marketed and sold all solar panels manufactured by sovello under the evergreen solar brand  and managed customer relationships and contracts related to the sale of sovello manufactured product 
we receive selling fees from sovello in connection with our sales of sovello manufactured product and do not report gross revenue or cost of goods sold resulting from the sale of sovello s solar panels 
during and  we received a fee of and of gross sovello revenue relating to the sales and marketing of solar panels 
in addition  we received royalty payments for our ongoing technology agreement with sovello 
taken together  the sales and marketing fee and royalty payments totaled approximately and of gross sovello revenue for fiscal and  respectively 
we also received payments from sovello of approximately million and  in fiscal and  respectively  to reimburse us for certain research and development and other support costs we incurred that could benefit sovello 
income statement classification of these research and development reimbursement payments depend on how we are reimbursed 
the best efforts arrangement we maintain with sovello allows for the reimbursement to offset expenses whereas a specific performance arrangement requires us to record both revenue and an offsetting cost of revenue 
these reimbursements in fiscal are therefore shown as a reduction of our expenses 

table of contents revenue recognition and allowance for doubtful accounts we recognize product revenue if there is persuasive evidence of an agreement with the customer  shipment has occurred  risk of loss has transferred to the customer  the sales price is fixed or determinable  and collectability is reasonably assured 
the market for solar power products is emerging and rapidly evolving 
we currently sell our solar power products primarily to distributors  system integrators and other value added resellers within and outside of north america  who typically resell our products to end users throughout the world 
for new customers requesting credit  we evaluate creditworthiness based on credit applications  feedback from provided references  and credit reports from independent agencies 
for existing customers  we evaluate creditworthiness based on payment history and any known changes in their financial condition 
royalty and fee revenue are recognized at contractual rates upon shipment of product by sovello 
product revenues represented  and for the years ended december   and  respectively 
international product sales accounted for approximately  and for the years ended december   and  respectively 
we also evaluate the facts and circumstances related to each sales transaction and consider whether risk of loss has passed to the customer upon shipment 
we consider whether our customer is purchasing our product for stock  and whether contractual or implied rights to return the product exist or whether our customer has an end user contractually committed 
to date  we have not offered rights to return our products other than for normal warranty conditions 
we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  such that their ability to make payments was impaired  additional allowances could be required 
warranty our current standard product warranty includes a five year warranty period for defects in material and workmanship and a year warranty period for declines in power performance 
when we recognize revenue  we accrue a liability for the estimated future costs of meeting our warranty obligations 
we make and revise this estimate based on the number of solar panels shipped and our historical experience with warranty claims 
during  we re evaluated potential warranty exposure as a result of the substantial increase in production volumes at our devens  massachusetts manufacturing facility 
as such  we increased our estimated future warranty costs to approximately million as of december  we engage in product quality programs and processes  including monitoring and evaluating the quality of component suppliers  in an effort to ensure the quality of our product and reduce our warranty exposure 
our warranty obligation will be affected not only by our product failure rates  but also the costs to repair or replace failed products and potential service and delivery costs incurred in correcting a product failure 
if our actual product failure rates  repair or replacement costs  or service or delivery costs differ from these estimates  accrued warranty costs would be adjusted in the period that such events or costs become known 
stock based compensation we measure compensation cost arising from the grant of share based payments to employees at fair value and recognize such cost in income over the period during which the employee is required to provide service in exchange for the award  usually the vesting period  in accordance with the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 
revised  share based payment sfas r 
we selected the modified prospective method for implementing sfas r and began applying the provisions to stock based awards granted on or after january   plus any unvested awards granted prior to january  total equity compensation expense recognized during the years ended december   and  was approximately million  million and million  respectively 
stock based compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized as expense on a straight line basis over the awards service periods  which are the vesting periods  less estimated forfeitures 
estimated compensation for grants that were outstanding as of january  will be recognized over the remaining service period using the compensation cost estimated for the sfas r pro forma disclosures for prior periods 
during and  we granted  shares and  shares  respectively  of performance based restricted stock  all of which immediately vest upon the achievement of specific financial performance targets prior to and  respectively 
of the million shares granted   shares have since been cancelled due to an employee termination 
we have assumed that none of these performance based awards will vest and accordingly have not provided for compensation expense associated with the awards 
we periodically evaluate the likelihood of reaching the performance 
table of contents requirements and will be required to recognize compensation expense of approximately million associated with these performance based awards if such awards should vest 
see note of our consolidated financial statements for further information regarding our stock based compensation assumptions and expenses 
inventory inventory is valued at the lower of cost or market determined on a first in  first out basis 
certain factors may impact the net realizable value of our inventory including  but not limited to  technological changes  market demand  changes in product mix strategy  new product introductions and significant changes to our cost structure 
estimates of reserves are made for obsolescence based on the current product mix on hand and its expected net realizable value 
if actual market conditions are less favorable or other factors arise that are significantly different than those anticipated by management  additional inventory write downs or increases in obsolescence reserves may be required 
we consider lower of cost or market adjustments and inventory reserves as an adjustment to the cost basis of the underlying inventory 
accordingly  favorable changes in market conditions are not recorded to inventory in subsequent periods 
in addition  we have made non refundable prepayments under several of our multi year polysilicon supply agreements which are presented on the balance sheet in prepaid cost of inventory 
these prepayments will be amortized as an additional cost of inventory as we receive and utilize the silicon 
the prepayments are classified as short term based upon the value of silicon contracted to be delivered during the next twelve months 
the company carries these prepayments on its balance sheet at cost and periodically evaluates the status of the vendor s underlying project intended to fulfill the silicon contract 
impairment of long lived assets our policy regarding long lived assets is to evaluate the recoverability or usefulness of these assets when the facts and circumstances suggest that these assets may be impaired 
this analysis relies on a number of factors  including changes in strategic direction  business plans  regulatory developments  economic and budget projections  technological improvements  and operating results 
the test of recoverability or usefulness is a comparison of the asset value to the undiscounted cash flow of its expected cumulative net operating cash flow over the asset s remaining useful life 
if such a test indicates that an impairment exists  then the asset is written down to its estimated fair value 
any write downs would be treated as permanent reductions in the carrying amounts of the assets and an operating loss would be recognized 
to date  we have had recurring operating losses and the recoverability of our long lived assets is contingent upon executing our business plan that includes further reducing our manufacturing costs and significantly increasing sales 
if we are unable to execute our business plan  we may be required to write down the value of our long lived assets in future periods 
income taxes we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate as part of our consolidated financial statements 
this involves estimating the actual current tax in addition to assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatments for tax and financial accounting purposes 
these differences together with net operating loss carryforwards and tax credits may be recorded as deferred tax assets or liabilities on the balance sheet 
a judgment must then be made of the likelihood that any deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income 
to the extent that we determine that it is more likely than not that deferred tax assets will not be utilized  a valuation allowance is established 
taxable income in future periods significantly different from that projected may cause adjustments to the valuation allowance that could materially increase or decrease future income tax expense 
results of operations description of our revenues  costs and expenses revenues 
our total revenues consist of revenues from the sale of products  royalty revenue associated with our ongoing technology agreement with sovello  and fees from sovello for our marketing and selling activities associated with sales of product manufactured by sovello under the evergreen solar brand 
product revenues consist of revenues primarily from the sale of solar cells  panels and systems 
reported product revenues represented  and of total revenues  in  and  respectively 
international product sales accounted for approximately  and of total product revenues for the years ended december   and  respectively 

table of contents cost of revenues 
cost of product revenues consists primarily of material expenses  salaries and related personnel costs  including stock based compensation  depreciation expense  maintenance  rent and other support expenses associated with the manufacture of our solar power products 
research and development expenses 
research and development expenses consist primarily of salaries and related personnel costs  including stock based compensation costs  consulting expenses and prototype costs related to the design  engineering  development  testing and enhancement of our products  manufacturing equipment and manufacturing technology 
we expense our research and development costs as incurred 
we also may receive payments from sovello and other third parties as reimbursement of certain research and development costs we will incur 
we believe that research and development is critical to our strategic objectives of enhancing our technology  reducing manufacturing costs and meeting the changing requirements of our customers 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and related personnel costs  including stock based compensation costs  employee recruiting costs  accounting and legal fees  rent  insurance and other selling and administrative expenses 
we expect that selling expenses will continue to increase substantially in absolute dollars as we increase our sales efforts to support our anticipated growth  hire additional sales personnel and initiate additional marketing programs 
facility start up 
facility startup expenses consist primarily of salaries and personnel related costs and the cost of operating a new facility before it has been qualified for full production 
it also includes all expenses related to the selection of a new site and the related legal and regulatory costs and the costs to maintain our plant expansion program  to the extent we cannot capitalize these expenditures 
we expect to incur significant facility start up expenses as we continue to plan and qualify new facilities 
restructuring charges 
restructuring charges consist of costs associated with the closure of our marlboro pilot manufacturing facility on december  the charges primarily include severance costs  and the write off of manufacturing equipment  leasehold improvements and inventory 
other income expense  net 
other income expense consists of interest income primarily from interest earned on the holding of short term marketable securities  bond premium amortization or discount accretion  interest expense on outstanding debt and net foreign exchange gains and losses 
equity income from interest in sovello ag 
as of december   we began accounting for our share of sovello s results under the equity method of accounting  which requires us to record our one third share of sovello s net income or loss as one line item in our consolidated statement of operations 
during the period from december  to december   sovello recorded approximately million in net income  of which we recorded approximately  in our consolidated statement of operations 
for the years ended december  and  sovello recorded approximately million and million in net income  respectively  of which we recorded approximately million and million net of withholding taxes  respectively  in our consolidated statement of operations 
minority interest 
through december   we consolidated the financial results of sovello in our financial statements 
through december   sovello incurred losses of million  which are consolidated in our financial statements 
however   of those losses represents the portion of sovello losses attributable to the q cells and rec minority interests for the period ended december  comparison of years ended december  and revenues 
our product revenues for the year ended december  were million  an increase of or million from million for the year ended december  this increase in product revenues resulted from an increase in sales volume of which was generated from our new devens facility which began shipping product late in the third quarter 
to a lesser extent  product revenues benefited from higher average selling prices of approximately that primarily resulted from a geographic shift in sales to europe 
royalty revenue and marketing and selling fees from sovello for the year ended december  were million  an increase or million from million for the year ended december  the increase in royalty revenue and marketing and selling fees from sovello was mainly due to the increased sales volume at sovello which started production at its second facility in the second quarter of 
table of contents international product revenues accounted for and of total product revenues for the years ended december  and  respectively 
throughout most of orders were largely fulfilled based upon geography 
more than half of the product produced at sovello was distributed to customers in europe and the majority of the product produced at our marlboro facility was distributed to customers in the united states which allowed us to efficiently manage worldwide distribution of product 
however  during approximately of our product shipments have been to europe in order to respond to specific customer demand 
as we increase our own capacity with the completion of our devens facility  we expect that we will continually adjust our distribution strategy as markets for solar energy rapidly develop and change 
the following table summarizes the concentration of our product revenues by geography and customer by geography united states germany all other by customer sunpower corporation ralos verriebs gmbh sunedison grosolar all other cost of product revenues and gross margin 
our cost of product revenues for the year ended december  was million  an increase of approximately million  or  from million for the year ended december  gross margin for the year ended december  was as compared to for the year ended december  the decrease in gross margin primarily resulted from higher costs associated with the initial production at our new devens facility and lower support costs allocated to research and development supporting pilot programs 
these higher costs were offset by higher royalty and selling fees associated with the increase in sovello s sales volume  higher silicon scrap sales and the increase in the volume of our product sales 
these higher initial production costs are temporary and resulted from inefficiencies we anticipated during the initial stages of our significant capacity expansion 
we do anticipate that gross margins will improve as the devens facility continues to increase its output and expects to reach its full production capacity during the second half of research and development expenses 
our research and development expenses for the year ended december  were million net of  of reimbursements from sovello  an increase of million  or approximately  from million net of million of reimbursements from sovello  for the comparable period 
the increase was primarily attributable to higher depreciation expense of approximately million associated with the expanded r d facilities and associated equipment additions 
this increase was offset primarily by lower compensation and related costs of approximately  the majority of which relates to realignment of personnel to directly support manufacturing and the devens ramp  lower material usage of approximately  lower travel cost of approximately  in addition to lower allocated manufacturing support costs 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
our selling  general and administrative expenses for the year ended december  were approximately million  an increase of million  or approximately  from million in in general  our selling  general and administrative costs have increased as a result of our overall expansion of operations 
as we continue to execute our expansion plans  we expect our selling  general and administrative expenses will increase to support such growth 
specifically  the increase in selling  general and administrative expense was primarily attributable to increased compensation and related costs of approximately  associated with additional personnel  
table of contents higher marketing and communication costs of  associated with increased advertising and the grand opening of our new devens facility  increased it costs of approximately  to support the growth of our operations  higher insurance costs of  associated with our expanded facilities  higher depreciation costs of  and generally higher public company and regulatory compliance fees 
equipment write offs 
in conjunction with refocusing our research and development efforts  we incurred charges of approximately million during the year ended december  as a result of the write off of r d equipment that supported now obsolete technologies 
facility start up 
facility start up costs for the year ended december  were approximately million  an increase of million from million in these expenses  which included salaries and personnel related costs  consulting costs  recruitment costs  consumable material costs  and miscellaneous other costs  were associated with the start up of our new facility in devens  massachusetts on which construction began in september with the first solar panels produced late in the third quarter of in addition  these charges include similar costs associated with the start up of our new manufacturing facility located in midland  michigan 
when the devens facility is completed in  we expect that our total start up costs for devens will be approximately million 
string factory start up in is expected to be approximately million 
restructuring charges 
we recorded a charge to continuing operations  principally non cash  of approximately million for the year ended december  these charges were incurred in conjunction with the closing of our marlboro  massachusetts pilot manufacturing facility on december   part of our ongoing efforts to lower overhead costs and reduce overall cash requirements 
virtually all of the marlboro pilot manufacturing facility employees have transferred to the devens manufacturing facility to fill open positions associated with its second phase 
future advanced manufacturing piloting activities will be performed at our devens manufacturing facility 
the charges we recorded were comprised primarily of leasehold improvements and other related building costs of million  equipment of approximately million  inventory and spare parts of million  and salaries and personal related costs associated with severance of approximately million 
we may also incur occupancy  location restoration and moving costs of approximately to million during other income expense net 
other income  net of million for the year ended december  comprised million in interest income  offset by million of net foreign exchange losses  and million in interest expense 
other income  net of million for the year ended december  comprised  net foreign exchange gains  million in interest income  and million in interest expense 
the increase in net foreign exchange losses was due to the timing of our euro denominated transactions in addition to the mark to market adjustment on our euro denominated loan to a silicon supplier 
the increase in interest income is attributable to our higher average cash balance that resulted from the cash raised from our equity offering in the first quarter of and the senior convertible notes offering during the third quarter of  in addition to interest earned on our loans receivable 
the higher interest expense is attributable to our higher debt obligations which increased by approximately million to support our capacity expansion plans offset by a slightly lower interest rate on the new borrowings and higher capitalized interest costs resulting primarily from the on going construction of our devens facility and our new facility in midland  michigan 
equity income from interest in sovello ag 
equity income from our interest in sovello of million  net of withholding taxes  for the year ended december   which represents our one third share of sovello s net income  increased million over the year ended december  the increase in sovello s net income resulted primarily from incremental production volume associated with its expanded facilities 
net loss 
as a result of the foregoing  net loss was million for the year ended december  net loss per share  basic and diluted compared to a net loss of million for the year ended december  net loss per share  basic and diluted 
comparison of years ended december  and through december   we owned of sovello and consolidated the financial statements of sovello 
as a result of our reduction in ownership in sovello to one third on december   we have applied the equity method of accounting for our share of sovello s operating results from december  this change in accounting has significantly impacted year over year comparability 

table of contents revenues 
our product revenues for the year ended december  were million  a decrease of million  or  from million for the year ended december  this decrease in reported revenues was attributable to sovello product revenues  which we consolidated with our product revenues through december  but are not consolidated with our product revenues in sovello  which began shipping product in  accounted for approximately million of consolidated revenues for the year ended december  the decline in product revenues is partially offset by royalty revenue and marketing and selling fees from sovello in of approximately million 
in order to efficiently manage worldwide distribution of product manufactured based on our proprietary technology  we fulfill orders largely based on geography 
more than half of the product produced at sovello is distributed to customers in europe and the majority of the product produced at our marlboro facility was distributed to customers in the united states 
international product revenues accounted for approximately and of total revenues for the years ended december  and  respectively 
this decline in international revenues is attributable to sovello which began product shipments in the second quarter of and primarily fulfilled european customer orders in the following table summarizes the concentration of our product revenues by geography and customer by geography united states germany spain all other by customer sunpower corporation sunedison grosolar donauer solartechnik all other cost of product revenues and gross margin 
our cost of product revenues for the year ended december  was million  a decrease of approximately million  or  from million for the same period in cost of product revenue for the year ended december  included approximately million in costs associated with sovello 
none of sovello s cost of product revenue was included in our financial statements for the year ended december  gross margin for the year ended december  was as compared to for the year ended december  the increase in gross margin primarily resulted from the royalty and selling fees earned from sovello in the year ended december   in addition to improved operating efficiencies and higher production volumes at our marlboro pilot manufacturing facility and costs allocated to research and development supporting pilot programs 
the main purpose of our marlboro facility was to develop and prototype new manufacturing process technologies which  when developed  would be employed in new factories 
as such  our manufacturing costs incurred in marlboro were substantially burdened by additional engineering costs and also reflected inefficiencies typically inherent in pilot and development operations 

table of contents research and development expenses 
our research and development expenses for the year ended december  were million net of million of reimbursements from sovello  an increase of million  or  from million for the same period in the increase was primarily attributable to increased compensation and related costs  including costs supporting piloting programs  and higher depreciation and operating costs associated with expanded r d facilities 
loss on disposal of fixed assets 
during the year ended december   as a result of the successful introduction of new manufacturing technology  we disposed of equipment with a total net book value of million in order to replace them with more technologically advanced equipment expected to improve the operational performance of our technology 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
our selling  general and administrative expenses for the year ended december  were approximately million  a decrease of million  or  from million in sovello costs  which were approximately million for the year ended december   were included in our consolidated selling  general and administrative expenses for the year ended december   and are not included in the comparable period for this decline was primarily offset by increases in compensation and related costs associated with additional personnel and higher management incentive compensation 
in addition  increased costs associated with marketing communications  including our effort to re brand evergreen solar with a new logo  and increased insurance and legal costs associated with the growth of our operations and routine regulatory filings were incurred 
facility start up 
facility start up costs for the year ended december  of million were comprised primarily of salaries and personnel related costs and legal costs associated with the construction of our new facility in massachusetts which began in september other income expense net 
other income  net of million for the year ended december  was comprised of  in net foreign exchange gains  million in interest income  and million in interest expense 
other income for the period ended december  consisted of million in net foreign exchange gains  million in interest income and million in interest expense 
the increase in interest income was attributable to our higher cash balance that resulted from additional capital raised during the year ended december  the decline in interest expense was primarily due to the interest cost associated with the sovello loan facility with deutsche bank  which we consolidated with our interest expense for the year ended december  but was not consolidated with our interest expense in the comparable period in in addition  we had higher capitalized interest costs in associated with our on going infrastructure improvement initiatives 
equity income from interest in sovello ag 
the equity income from our interest in sovello of million for the year ended december  represents our one third share of sovello s net income of million 
sovello s increased net income resulted primarily from incremental production volume 
net loss 
as a result of the foregoing  net loss was million for the year ended december  net loss per share  basic and diluted compared to a net loss of million for the year ended december  net loss per share  basic and diluted 
liquidity and capital resources we have historically financed our operations and met our capital expenditure requirements primarily through sales of our capital stock  issuance of debt and  to a lesser extent  product revenues  and beginning in  fees from sovello for our marketing and sale of sovello panels and royalty payments for our technology contribution to sovello 
research and development expenditures have historically been partially funded by government research contracts 
at december   we had working capital of million  including cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities of million 

table of contents net cash used in operating activities was million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the use of cash for operating activities in the year ended december  was due primarily to losses from our operations of million  net of non cash charges  increases in inventory levels of million as we begin to scale devens  increases in prepaid cost of inventory of million which was mainly the result of nonrefundable payments required under our silicon supply agreements  and increases in our accounts receivable of approximately million associated with our increase in revenue 
these uses were offset by the receipt of million of grants  an increase in other current liabilities of million due to the timing of payments  and a decrease in other current assets of million  the majority of which relates to the refund of vat taxes 
the use of cash for operating activities in the year ended december  was due primarily to losses from our operations of million  net of non cash charges  increases in inventory levels of million  primarily silicon  in addition to prepaid cost of inventory of million associated with new silicon supply agreements  and increases in other current assets  primarily vat receivables 
these uses were offset by reductions in accounts receivable of approximately million associated with customer payments  and increases in accounts payable of million 
the use of cash for operating activities in the year ended december  was due primarily to our loss of million  increases in accounts receivable of million  increases in inventory of million  and increases in other current assets of million offset by a net increase in deferred grants funding of million  increases in accrued expenses of million and depreciation expense and losses on fixed assets disposals of million 
in general  net cash used in operating activities for the year ended december  was primarily due to supporting the increase in working capital requirements of sovello as the first manufacturing facility ramped to full production by the end of the third quarter of net cash used in investing activities was million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the net cash used in each of these years was primarily due to purchases of equipment and marketable securities  in addition to the construction of our manufacturing facility in devens  massachusetts most of which occurred in these use of funds were offset by proceeds from the sale and maturity of marketable securities 
in addition  during the year ended december  two loans totaling million were advanced to sovello 
as part of our silicon supply agreement with silpro we provided a loan to them of euro million 
the first installment of approximately million was advanced to them at the end of and the second installment of million advanced to them during also  during the year ended december   we deposited approximately million with deutsche bank associated with the guarantee of a sovello loan 
the restriction on the deposit  which was reported as restricted cash on our december  balance sheet  was released in as of december   we no longer consolidate the balance sheet of sovello and therefore  our cash balance at december  excludes sovello s cash balances  and the decrease in sovello s cash balance is reflected as a use of cash in investing activities 
capital expenditures were million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
capital expenditures for the year ended december  were primarily for equipment needed for our marlboro manufacturing facility and equipment for sovello 
the and expenditures were primarily for facility improvements and equipment for our marlboro manufacturing facility in addition to expenditures for the construction of our new devens  massachusetts manufacturing facility which will ultimately increase our production capacity in massachusetts to approximately mw in two mw phases and increase our employee base to approximately  by mid the commonwealth of massachusetts support program has provided a low cost  year land lease in addition to approximately million in grants 
during  we also began construction of our new high temperature filament manufacturing facility in midland  michigan 
as of december   we had outstanding commitments for capital expenditures of approximately million 
most of our commitments for capital expenditures are associated with our new devens and midland facilities 
net cash provided by financing activities was million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the cash provided by financing activities for the year ended december  resulted primarily from net proceeds of million from the issuance of our senior convertible debt offering which closed during the third quarter of and the net proceeds of million shares of our common stock sold in a public offering at per share which closed in february these proceeds were offset by the up front initial premium payment of million associated with the capped call which was entered into concurrent with the senior convertible debt offering 
the cash provided by financing activities for the year ended december  resulted primarily from the net proceeds of  shares of our common stock sold in a public offering at per share and which closed on may  an additional million shares of our common stock were sold to dc chemical for per share in conjunction with a stock purchase agreement 
the cash provided by financing activities for the year ended december  primarily represents an increase in sovello debt through december  and cash received upon the exercise of stock options and warrants 

table of contents on june   we entered into an underwriting agreement for the sale to the public of million aggregate principal amount of senior convertible notes due or senior notes 
we granted to the underwriters a day option to purchase up to an additional million aggregate principal amount of senior notes 
on july   we completed the public offering of million aggregate principal amount of senior notes which includes the underwriter s exercise of their option 
net proceeds to us from the offering  including the cost of the capped call transaction  were approximately million 
our financing costs associated with the senior notes are being amortized over the five year term 
in june  we issued convertible subordinated notes or notes in the aggregate principal amount of million with interest on the notes payable semiannually at an annual rate of 
we had received proceeds of million  net of offering costs  and the financing costs of approximately million were being amortized over the seven year term of the notes 
all of the notes were converted to shares of our common stock and we issued  shares of common stock to the note holders on july  for the years ended december   and  we recorded approximately million  million and million  respectively  in interest expense associated with the notes and senior notes  net of capitalized interest of approximately   and million  respectively 
in connection with our senior notes offering  we entered into a capped call transaction with respect to our common stock  the capped call  with an affiliate of the lead underwriter in order to reduce the dilution that would otherwise occur as a result of new common stock issuances upon conversion of the senior notes 
the capped call was designed to reduce the potential dilution resulting from the conversion of the senior notes into shares of our common stock 
the total premium for the capped call was approximately million of which million was paid contemporaneously with the closing of the senior notes offering and the remaining million was required to be paid in nine equal semi annual installments beginning january  in addition  we entered into a common stock lending agreement with a second affiliate of the lead underwriter pursuant to which we loaned  shares of our common stock to this affiliate 
these shares were considered issued and outstanding for corporate law purposes at the time they were loaned  however  at the time of the loan they were not considered outstanding for the purpose of computing and reporting earnings per share because these shares were to be returned to us no later than july   the maturity date of the senior notes 
on september  and october   respectively  the lead underwriter and its affiliate filed for protection under chapter of the federal bankruptcy code 
the bankruptcy filings represented events of default under the capped call 
as a result of the defaults  our obligations under the agreement were suspended and the remaining premium liability was reversed against equity 
in the event the defaults are cured  the remaining premium liability would be owed pursuant to the installment payment schedule 
unless we choose to implement a new capped call arrangement or the defaults are cured and we do not terminate the capped call as we believe we are entitled to under the terms of the capped call  the dilutive impact of conversion of the senior notes may be greater  based on the actual conversion price of per share 
the bankruptcy filing and the placement of the second lehman affiliate into administration in the united kingdom also contractually required the lead underwriter s second affiliate to return to us the shares loaned under the common stock lending agreement 
we have since demanded the return of all outstanding borrowed shares  however  the shares have not yet been returned 
while we are exercising all of our legal remedies  including litigation against various lehman brothers entities and barclays entities  we have included these shares in our per share calculation on a weighted average basis due to the uncertainty surrounding the recovery of the shares 
sovello debt guarantee and undertaking on april   we entered into a guarantee and undertaking agreement with q cells and rec in connection with sovello entering into a loan agreement with a syndicate of lenders led by deutsche bank ag  the guarantee 
the loan agreement provides sovello with aggregate borrowing availability of up to million euros 
pursuant to the guarantee  we along with q cells and rec  each agreed to guarantee a one third portion of the loan outstanding  up to million euros of sovello s repayment obligations 
table of contents under the loan agreement 
at december  we had million deposited in a deutsche bank account fulfilling our obligation under the guarantee  which was classified as restricted cash on the balance sheet 
effective september  the guarantee and associated restriction on our million of cash deposited with deutsche bank were released 
as of december   the total amount of debt outstanding under the loan agreement was million euros approximately million at december  exchange rates of which million euros was current approximately million at december  exchange rates 
repayment of the loan is due in quarterly installments through december  in october in connection with a bank loan to sovello  we provided an undertaking to the bank syndicate that may require us to provide additional funding to sovello under the following circumstances in the event that the cost of completing sovello exceeds budget  if any government grants are required to be repaid by sovello or are not provided to sovello as previously approved  or under certain conditions  in the event that sovello is in violation of its financial covenants associated with its loan with the bank syndicate 
as of december   sovello is in violation of one of its bank loan financial covenants 
the financial covenant violation allows the bank to exercise its termination rights and call the loan 
however  the bank has temporarily waived the financial covenant violation and is negotiating with sovello and its shareholders to amend the loan agreement 
in accordance with an undertaking made by us to the bank  we could be required to provide our pro rata share of any additional funding required to complete sovello under certain circumstances 
based on the current negotiation with the bank  we anticipate providing additional funds to sovello in the form of a loan or additional equity investment 
if we  sovello  and sovello s other shareholders cannot obtain an amendment to sovello s loan agreement  this could adversely impact sovello s liquidity  require us to make additional investments in sovello and potentially impact the net realizable value of our investment in sovello 
for additional information regarding the undertaking  the grants and potential obligations to fund sovello see note to our consolidated financial statements 
evergreen solar loans to sovello in january  we  rec and q cells entered into a new shareholder loan agreement with sovello 
under the terms of the shareholder loan agreement  sovello repaid all outstanding shareholder loans at that time  plus accrued interest  in exchange for a new shareholder loan of million euros from each shareholder 
in addition  we  rec and q cells entered into a shareholder agreement with sovello in june for a total of approximately million euros from each shareholder with our share denominated in us dollars 
also in december  we  rec and q cells entered into an additional shareholder agreement with sovello for a total of approximately million euros from each shareholder with our share denominated in us dollars 
as of december  we had advanced one half of the dollar denominated million euros

liquidity risk and uncertainty at december   we had approximately million of cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities  of which million was due to sovello that we collected as sovello s sales agent 
through mid  the completion of the devens factory  the first phase of the midland factory and debt service interest payments will require about million  resulting in a cash balance available to support operations of approximately million 
although our current business plan indicates we will have adequate liquidity for the next months  we are subject to risks common to companies in the high technology and alternative energy industry including  but not limited to  the difficulty of successfully developing new technological innovations  competition from a number of qualified and better funded companies  dependence on key personnel  dependence on key or sole source suppliers for materials  the challenge of protecting proprietary technology and complying with government regulations we have incurred net losses from operations and negative cash flow from operations since inception 
we plan to increase our devens production significantly in  from mw in the fourth quarter of to approximately mw in the first quarter of  mw in the second quarter  and between mw to mw in both the third and fourth quarters  resulting in annual production of between mw to mw 
we have sales contracts for approximately mw of product to be manufactured at our devens facility for delivery in at an average selling price of approximately assuming a us dollar euro exchange rate of  which is about less than our average selling price of about in our sales plan assumes there should be sufficient market demand to sell the remaining expected devens manufacturing capacity 
we expect to moderate our production levels depending on changes in market demands as the year progresses 
we also plan to significantly reduce our manufacturing cost from approximately per watt in the fourth quarter of to approximately per watt by the end of  primarily through increased volume and improved yields and cell conversion efficiency 
we believe that our business plan will provide sufficient cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities to fund our planned capital programs  our share of any potential funding requirements related to our investment in sovello and our operating needs for the next months 
while our business plan anticipates certain levels of potential risk  particularly in light of the difficult and uncertain current economic environment  we are exposed to particular risks and uncertainties including  but not limited to possible delays in the completion of our devens plant  budget overruns or failure to meet expected production levels  selling less than approximately mw to mw of devens manufactured product at an average selling price of to per watt to credit worthy customers  higher than planned manufacturing costs and failing to achieve expected devens operating metrics  with any delays in our plan to scale capacity resulting in increased costs that could impair business operations  further weakening of the euro against the us dollar  as a substantial portion of the contracted sales are denominated in euros  and increased funding requirements for sovello to complete its third manufacturing facility and achieve its planned manufacturing cost and operating metrics  or to potentially address the loss of any prior or expected government grant funding for sovello 
although our current business plan indicates we have adequate liquidity to operate under expected operating conditions  the risks noted above could result in liquidity uncertainty 
our plan with regard to this uncertainty includes  among other actions continually monitoring our operating results against expectations and  if required  further restrict operating costs and capital spending if events warrant  possibly hedging our exposure to fluctuations in the us dollar euro exchange rate to limit any adverse exposure  but there can be no assurance that hedges can be put in place at terms acceptable to us or that such hedging activities will be effective  and negotiating with a number of banks to secure a borrowing base line of credit  without a minimum cash requirement  as is the case with our current line of credit  supported by the expected significant increase in our accounts receivable  inventory and overall working capital 
if adequate capital does not become available if needed on acceptable terms  our ability to fund operations  further develop and expand our manufacturing operations and distribution network or otherwise respond to competitive pressures would be significantly limited

when the transfer restriction on these shares lapse  we will record an additional cost of inventory equal to the value of the discount associated with the restriction at that time if the stock price on that date is higher than which will be amortized as an incremental cost of inventory as silicon is delivered by dc chemical and utilized by us

we adopted the provisions of financial accounting standards board interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes fin an interpretation of fasb statement no 
sfas on january  as a result of the implementation of fin  there was no adjustment to accumulated deficit or the liability for uncertain tax positions 
as of the adoption date of january  and at december   we had no accrued interest related to uncertain tax positions 
we have evaluated the positive and negative evidence bearing upon the realization of our deferred tax assets 
we have considered our history of losses and  in accordance with the applicable accounting standards  have fully reserved the deferred tax asset 
recent accounting pronouncements in june  the fasb issued fsp eitf  determining whether instruments granted in share based payment transactions are participating securities fsp eitf 
fsp eitf clarified that all outstanding unvested share based payment awards that contain rights to nonforfeitable dividends participate in undistributed earnings with common shareholders 
awards of this nature are considered participating securities and the two class method of computing basic and diluted earnings per share must be applied 
fsp eitf is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  we are currently assessing the impact of fsp eitf on our consolidated financial position and results of operations 
in may  the fasb issued fsp no 
apb  accounting for convertible debt instruments that may be settled in cash upon conversion including partial cash settlement fsp no 
apb  which clarifies the accounting for convertible debt instruments that may be settled in cash including partial cash settlement upon conversion 
the fsp no 
apb requires issuers to account separately for the liability and equity components of certain convertible debt instruments in a manner that reflects the issuer s nonconvertible debt unsecured debt borrowing rate when interest cost is recognized 
the fsp no 
apb requires bifurcation of a component of the debt  classification of that component in equity and the accretion of the resulting discount on the debt to be recognized as part of interest expense in a company s consolidated statement of operations 
the fsp no 
apb requires retrospective application to the terms of instruments as they existed for all periods presented 
the fsp no 
apb is effective as of january  and early adoption is not permitted 
we believe that fsp no 
apb is applicable to our senior convertible notes which will primarily result in the recognition of additional interest expense 
as a result  the adoption will be reflected in our first quarter financial statements 
in february  the fasb issued sfas no 
 the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities  including an amendment of sfas no 
sfas no 

this statement permits entities to choose to measure certain financial instruments and other items at fair value 
this statement is expected to expand the use of fair value measurement  which is consistent with the fasb s long term measurement objectives for accounting for financial instruments 
we adopted sfas no 
effective january  upon adoption  we did not elect the fair value option for any items within the scope of sfas no 
and  therefore  the adoption of sfas no 
did not have an impact on our consolidated financial statements 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk we do not use derivative financial instruments to manage interest rate risk 
interest income earned on our cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities is subject to interest rate fluctuations  but we believe that the impact of these fluctuations will not have a material effect on our financial position due to the liquidity and short term nature of these financial instruments 
for these reasons  a hypothetical basis point adverse change in interest rates would not have a material effect on our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
foreign currency exchange rate risk as we expand our manufacturing operations and distribution network internationally  our exposure to fluctuations in currency exchange rates may increase 
during and  we entered into multi year silicon supply agreements with four suppliers 
the agreements have varied start and end dates 
additionally  from time to time we may agree to purchase equipment and materials internationally with delivery dates as much as six to twelve months in the future 
for the year ended december   approximately of our product revenues were denominated in euros 
the portion of our sales that are denominated in euros are expected to increase in future periods 
during the year ended december  we entered into seven multi year solar panel supply agreements  a portion of which are denominated in euros 
the combined current estimated sales value for all seven agreements is approximately billion at december  exchange rates 
these panel supply agreements provide the general terms and conditions pursuant to which certain customers will purchase from us specified annual quantities of solar panels which began in the second half of and continue through we endeavor to denominate the purchase price of our equipment and materials and the selling price for our products outside of the european union in us dollars but are not always successful in doing so 
to the extent that our purchases or sales are made in foreign currency  we will be exposed to currency gains or losses 
to date  we have not entered into any hedging transactions in an effort to reduce our exposure to foreign currency exchange risk 
while we may enter into hedging transactions in the future  given that the availability and effectiveness of these transactions may be limited  we may not be able to successfully hedge our exposure
