non performing assets include non accrual loans  mortgage loans delinquent days or more and still accruing interest and real estate owned  or reo 
total non performing assets increased million to million at december   from million at december  non performing loans  the most significant component of non performing assets  increased million to million at december   from million at december  the increases in non performing assets and non performing loans were primarily due to increases in non performing one to four family and multi family mortgage loans 
in addition  reo increased during  contributing to the increase in non performing assets 
during  the continued deterioration of the housing and real estate markets  as well as the overall weakness in the economy  contributed to an increase in our non performing loans and net loan charge offs 
as a geographically diversified residential lender  we have been affected by negative consequences arising from the ongoing economic recession and  in particular  the sharp downturn in the housing industry nationally  as well as economic and housing industry weaknesses in the new york metropolitan area specifically 
we are particularly vulnerable to the impact of a severe job loss recession 
we continue to closely monitor the local and national real estate markets and other factors related to risks inherent in our loan portfolio 
despite the increase in non performing loans at december   our non performing loans continue to remain at low levels in relation to the size of our loan portfolio 
the ratio of non performing loans to total loans increased to at december   from at december  our ratio of non performing assets to total assets increased to at december   from at december  the allowance for loan losses as a percentage of total non performing loans decreased to at december   from at december  for further discussion of our non performing assets and non performing loans and the allowance for loan losses  see item  md a 
during the year ended december   we sold million of delinquent and non performing mortgage loans  primarily one to four family and multi family loans 
the sale of these loans did not have a material impact on our non performing loans  non performing assets and related ratios at december  we may from time to time agree to modify the contractual terms of a borrower s loan 
in cases where such modifications represent a concession to a borrower experiencing financial difficulty  the modification is considered a troubled debt restructuring 
loans modified in a troubled debt restructuring are placed on non accrual status until we determine that future collection of principal and interest is reasonably assured  which generally requires that the borrower demonstrate a period of performance according to the restructured terms of six months 
at december   loans modified in a troubled debt restructuring which are included in non accrual loans totaled million 
we discontinue accruing interest on loans when such loans become days delinquent as to their payment due date missed three payments 
in addition  we reverse all previously accrued and uncollected interest through a charge to interest income 
while loans are in non accrual status  interest due is monitored and income is recognized only to the extent cash is received until a return to accrual status is warranted 
prior to january   we discontinued accruing interest on mortgage loans when such loans became days delinquent as to their interest due  even though in many instances the borrower had only missed two payments  and we discontinued accruing interest on consumer and other loans when such loans became days delinquent as to their payment due date 
in some circumstances  we continue to accrue interest on mortgage loans delinquent days or more as to their maturity date  but not their interest due 
such loans totaled  at december  and  at december  in general  days prior to a loan s maturity  the borrower is reminded of the maturity date 
where the borrower has continued to make monthly payments to us and where we do not have a reason to believe that any loss will be incurred on the loan  we have treated these loans as current and have continued to accrue interest 
reo represents real estate acquired as a result of foreclosure or by deed in lieu of foreclosure and is carried in other assets  net of allowances for losses  at the lower of cost or fair value less estimated selling costs 
write downs required at the time of acquisition are charged to the allowance for loan losses 
thereafter  we maintain an allowance for losses representing decreases in value which are charged to income along with any additional expenses incurred on the property 
fair value is estimated through current appraisals in conjunction with a drive by inspection and comparison of the property securing the loan with similar properties in the area by either a licensed appraiser or real estate broker 
as these properties are actively marketed  estimated fair value is periodically adjusted to reflect current market conditions 
the net carrying value of our reo totaled million  net of an allowance for losses of million  at december  and million  net of an allowance for losses of  at december  classified assets our asset review department reviews and classifies our assets and independently reports the results of its reviews to our board of directors quarterly 
our asset classification committee establishes policy relating to the internal classification of loans and also provides input to the asset review department in its review of our assets 
federal regulations and our policy require the classification of loans and other assets  such as debt and equity securities considered to be of lesser quality  as special mention  substandard  doubtful or loss 
an asset classified as special mention has potential weaknesses  which  if uncorrected  may result in the deterioration of the repayment prospects or in our credit position at some future date 
an asset classified as substandard is inadequately protected by the current net worth and paying capacity of the obligor or the collateral pledged  if any 
substandard assets include those characterized by the distinct possibility that we will sustain some loss if the deficiencies are not corrected 
assets classified as doubtful have all of the weaknesses inherent in those classified as substandard  with the added characteristic that the weaknesses present make collection or liquidation in full satisfaction of the loan amount  on the basis of currently existing facts  conditions  and values  highly questionable and improbable 
assets classified as loss are those considered uncollectible and of such little value that their continuance as assets without the establishment of a specific loss reserve is not warranted 
those assets classified as substandard  doubtful or loss are considered adversely classified 
if a loan is adversely classified  an updated estimate of collateral value is obtained through an appraisal  where practical 
in instances where we have not taken possession of the property or do not otherwise have access to the premises and therefore cannot obtain a complete appraisal  an estimated value of the property is obtained based primarily on a drive by inspection and a comparison of the property securing the loan with similar properties in the area  by either a licensed appraiser or real estate broker for one to four family properties 
for multi family and commercial real estate properties  we estimate the collateral value based on an internal cash flow analysis when current financial information is available  coupled with  in most cases  an inspection of the property 
in circumstances for which we have determined that repayment of the loan will be based solely on the collateral and the unpaid balance of the loan is greater than the estimated fair value of such collateral  a specific valuation allowance is established for the difference between the carrying value and the fair value less estimated selling costs 
impaired loans a loan is generally deemed impaired when it is probable we will be unable to collect both principal and interest due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement 
loans we individually classify as impaired include multi family mortgage loans  commercial real estate loans and construction loans with balances of over million which have been classified by our asset review department as either substandard our lowest substandard category or doubtful  certain loans modified in a troubled debt restructuring and mortgage loans where a portion of the outstanding principal has been charged off 
a valuation allowance is established when the current estimated fair value of the property that collateralizes the impaired loan  if any  is less than the recorded investment in the loan 
our impaired loans at december   net of their related allowance for loan losses of million  totaled million 
interest income recognized on impaired loans amounted to million for the year ended december  for further detail on our impaired loans  see note and note of notes to consolidated financial statements in
