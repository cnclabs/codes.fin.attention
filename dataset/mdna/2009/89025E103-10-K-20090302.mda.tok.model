table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations you should read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations together with selected consolidated financial data and our financial statements and accompanying notes included elsewhere in this annual report 
in addition to the historical information  the discussion in this annual report contains certain forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated by the forward looking statements due to our critical accounting estimates discussed below and important factors set forth in this annual report  including under risk factors in item a of this annual report 
overview we are a global pharmaceutical company focused on advancing the treatment of critical care patients through the delivery of innovative  cost effective medicines to the worldwide hospital marketplace 
we have two marketed products  angiomax bivalirudin and cleviprex clevidipine butyrate injectable emulsion  two products in late stage development  cangrelor and oritavancin  and one compound  cu  scheduled to enter clinical development in we market angiomax primarily in the united states and europe where we use the name angiox bivalirudin to interventional cardiology customers for its approved uses in patients undergoing pci  including in patients with or at risk of hit hitts 
in europe  we also market angiox for use in adult patients with acs 
we market cleviprex to anesthesiology surgery  critical care and emergency department practitioners in the united states for its approved use for the reduction of blood pressure when oral therapy is not feasible or not desirable 
cleviprex is not approved for sale outside the united states 
we intend to continue to develop angiomax and cleviprex for use in additional patient populations 
we market and sell angiomax and cleviprex in the united states with a joint sales force that  as of december   consisted of representatives and managers experienced in selling to hospital customers 
in europe  we market and sell angiox with a sales force that we are currently building 
our revenues to date have been generated principally from sales of angiomax in the united states 
we are increasing our sales force in the united states and europe in connection with the expansion of our sales and marketing efforts in europe  the approval of the label expansion for angiox for acs in europe that occurred in january  and the approval by the fda of cleviprex in the united states in august for the reduction of blood pressure when oral therapy is not feasible or not desirable 
research and development expenses represent costs incurred for product acquisition  clinical trials  activities relating to regulatory filings and manufacturing development efforts 
we outsource much of our clinical trials and all of our manufacturing development activities to third parties to maximize efficiency and minimize our internal overhead 
we expense our research and development costs as they are incurred 
selling  general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and related expenses  general corporate activities and costs associated with marketing and promotional activities 
research and development expense  selling  general and administrative expense and cost of revenue also include stock based compensation expense  which we allocate based on the responsibilities of the recipients of the stock based compensation 
except for and  we have incurred net losses on an annual basis since our inception 
as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of approximately million 
we expect to make substantial expenditures to further develop and commercialize our products  including costs and expenses associated with clinical trials  regulatory approvals and commercialization 
although we achieved profitability in and in and expect to be profitable in  we were not profitable in primarily as a result of the costs incurred in connection with our acquisition of curacyte discovery in august and were not profitable in  primarily as a result of the costs incurred in connection with the nycomed transaction 
we will likely need to generate significantly greater revenue in future periods to achieve and maintain profitability in light of our planned expenditures 
in march  we entered into an agreement with a third party to distribute angiomax in the united states through a sole source distribution model 
cleviprex  which we launched in the united states in september  is distributed under the same sole source distribution model with the same third party 
under 
table of contents this model  we sell angiomax and cleviprex to our sole source distributor  which then sells angiomax and cleviprex to a limited number of national medical and pharmaceutical wholesalers with distribution centers located throughout the united states and  in certain cases  directly to hospitals 
prior to adopting this sole source distribution model  we sold angiomax to these wholesalers directly and these wholesalers then sold angiomax to hospitals 
we began selling angiomax under this revised distribution system during the quarter ended march  outside the united states  we sell angiomax either directly to hospitals or to wholesalers or international distributors  which then sell angiomax to hospitals 
the reacquisition of all development  commercial and distribution rights for angiox from nycomed in was our first step directly into international markets and gives us a direct presence in european markets 
in july  we entered into a series of agreements with nycomed pursuant to which we terminated the prior distribution agreement with nycomed and re acquired all development  commercial and distribution rights for angiox in the european union excluding spain  portugal and greece and the former soviet republics  which we refer to as the nycomed territory 
prior to entering into the nycomed agreements  nycomed served as the exclusive distributor of angiox in the nycomed territory pursuant to a sales  marketing and distribution agreement  dated march   as amended 
pursuant to the nycomed agreements  we and nycomed agreed to transition the angiox rights held by nycomed to us 
under these arrangements  including a transitional distribution agreement  we assumed control of the marketing of angiox immediately and nycomed provided  on a transitional basis  sales operations services  until december  and product distribution services until the second half of we assumed control of the distribution of angiox in the majority of the countries in the nycomed territory during the third quarter of and the remainder of the countries in the nycomed territory by december  under the terms of the transitional distribution agreement with nycomed  upon the sale by nycomed to third parties of vials of angiox purchased by nycomed from us prior to july   which we refer to as existing inventory  nycomed agreed to pay us a specified percentage of nycomed s net sales of angiox  less the amount previously paid by nycomed to us for the existing inventory 
under the transitional distribution agreement  upon the termination of the agreement  nycomed had the right to return any existing inventory for the price paid by nycomed to us for such inventory 
we recorded a reserve of million in the fourth quarter of for the existing inventory at nycomed which we did not believe would be sold prior to the termination of the transitional distribution agreement and would be subject to purchase in accordance with the agreement 
during  we reduced the reserve by million as nycomed sold a portion of its existing inventory during the year 
we will reimburse nycomed million for the final amount of inventory held by nycomed at december  the transitional distribution agreement terminated on december  under the transitional services agreement we entered into with nycomed  nycomed performed detailing and other selling  sales management  product marketing management  medical advisor  international marketing and certain pharmacovigilance services in accordance with an agreed upon marketing plan through december  nycomed remained responsible for safety reporting as long as it sold angiox in the nycomed territory 
pursuant to the agreement  we agreed to pay nycomed s personnel costs  plus an agreed upon markup  for the performance of the services  in accordance with a budget detailed by country and function 
in addition  we have agreed to pay nycomed s costs  in accordance with a specified budget  for performing specified promotional activities during the term of the services agreement 
the transitional services agreement terminated on december  we incurred total costs of million in connection with the reacquisition of the rights to develop  distribute and market angiox in the nycomed territory 
this total costs amount includes transaction fees of approximately million and agreed upon milestone payments of million paid to nycomed on june   million paid to nycomed on january  and million paid to nycomed on july   as well as an additional million paid to nycomed on july  in connection with our obtaining european commission approval to market angiox for acs in january during the third quarter of  we allocated million of these costs as expense attributable to the termination of the prior distribution agreement with nycomed and million to intangible assets 
the million expense was offset in part by the write off of approximately million of deferred revenue  
table of contents which amount represented the unamortized portion of deferred revenue related to milestone payments received from nycomed in and we included such amounts in selling  general and administrative expense on the consolidated statements of operations for the year ended december  we allocated approximately million of the costs associated with the reacquisition of the rights to develop  distribute and market angiox in the european union to intangible assets 
we are amortizing these intangible assets over the remaining patent life of angiox  which expires in the period in which amortization expense will be recorded reflects the pattern in which we expect the economic benefits of the intangible assets to be consumed 
to support the marketing  sales and distribution efforts of angiomax  we are taking the necessary steps to develop our business infrastructure outside the united states 
we initiated research to understand the pci market  as well as the hypertension market  on a global basis  including profiling hospitals and identifying key opinion leaders 
since reacquiring these rights  we have developed a business infrastructure to conduct the international sales and marketing of angiox  including the formation of subsidiaries in switzerland  germany  france and italy in addition to our pre existing subsidiary in the united kingdom 
we also obtained all the licenses and authorizations necessary to distribute the product in the various countries in europe  hired new personnel and entered into third party arrangements to provide services  such as importation  packaging  quality control and distribution 
we believe that by establishing operations in europe for angiox  we will be positioned to commercialize our pipeline of critical care product candidates  including cleviprex  cangrelor  oritavancin and cu in august  we acquired curacyte discovery 
curacyte discovery was primarily engaged in the discovery and development of small molecule serine protease inhibitors including cu in connection with the acquisition  we paid curacyte ag an initial payment of million approximately million and agreed to pay a contingent milestone payment of million if we elect to proceed with clinical development of cu at the earlier of four months after enrollment and follow up of the last subject of a phase i clinical program or october  which will be automatically extended to march  if the phase i clinical program has been initiated by march  
in addition  our agreement with curacyte ag provides for possible future sales royalty payments and a commercial milestone payment 
the total cost of the acquisition was approximately million  which consisted of a purchase price of approximately million and direct acquisition costs of million 
since the acquisition date  we have included results of curacyte discovery s operations in our consolidated financial statements 
we allocated the purchase price to the estimated fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on a preliminary valuation and management estimates 
we allocated approximately million of the purchase price to in process research and development  which we expensed upon completion of the acquisition 
we recorded this amount as research and development in the consolidated statements of operations 
we allocated the remaining portion of the purchase price to net tangible assets 
we expect to complete the purchase price allocation within one year from the date of the acquisition 
in february  we acquired targanta 
under the terms of our agreement with targanta  we paid targanta shareholders in cash at closing for each common share of targanta common stock tendered  or approximately million in aggregate and agreed to pay contingent cash payments up to an additional per share as described below if we or a mdco affiliated party meaning an affiliate of ours  a successor or assigns of ours  or a licensee or collaborator of ours obtain approval from the emea for a maa for oritavancin for the treatment of csssi on or before december   each former targanta shareholder will be entitled to receive a cash payment equal to per share if such approval is granted on or before december   per share if such approval is granted between january  and june   or per share if such approval is granted between july  and december   a payment of approximately million in the aggregate  approximately million in the aggregate  or approximately million in the aggregate  respectively 
if we or a mdco affiliated party obtain final approval from the fda for a new drug application  or nda  for oritavancin for the treatment of csssi within months after the date the first patient is 
table of contents enrolled in a phase iii clinical trial of csssi that is initiated by us or a mdco affiliate party after the date of our merger agreement with targanta and on or before december   each former targanta shareholder will be entitled to receive a cash payment equal to per share  or approximately million in the aggregate 
if we obtain final fda approval for an nda for the use of oritavancin for the treatment of csssi administered by a single dose intravenous infusion within months after the date the first patient is enrolled in a phase iii clinical trial of csssi that is initiated by us or a mdco affiliated party after the date of our merger agreement with targanta and on or before december   each former targanta shareholder will be entitled to receive a cash payment equal to per share  or approximately million in the aggregate 
this payment may become payable simultaneously with the payment described in the previous bullet above 
if aggregate net sales of oritavancin in four consecutive calendar quarters ending on or before december  reach or exceed million  each former targanta shareholder will be entitled to receive a cash payment equal to per share  or approximately million in the aggregate 
we expect to account for this transaction in accordance with sfas no 
r  business combinations sfas no 
r and expect to complete the allocation of the purchase price within one year from the date of the acquisition 
we have accrued for us and state income taxes  for state taxes based on net worth and for a certain amount of income tax in international jurisdictions in our financial statements to the extent these taxes apply 
at december   net operating losses available to offset future taxable income for federal income tax purposes were approximately million 
if not utilized  federal net operating loss carryforwards will expire at various dates beginning in and ending in during  we reduced a portion of our valuation allowance associated with the deferred tax assets because at that time we considered the realization of these assets to be more likely than not 
the future utilization of net operating losses and credits may be subject to limitation based upon changes in ownership under the rules of the internal revenue code  or irc 
we experienced changes in ownership as defined by section of the irc during the years ended december  and based on the market value of our common stock at the time of those changes  we believe there will be no impact on our ability to utilize our net operating losses and credits 
of the million of our federal net operating losses  million is subject to limitations through as a result of our acquisition of targanta  we are a party to an asset purchase agreement with intermune 
under the agreement  we are obligated to use commercially reasonable efforts to develop oritavancin and to make a million cash payment to intermune if and when we receive from the fda all approvals necessary for the commercial launch of oritavancin 
we have no other milestone or royalty obligations to intermune in connection with targanta s december acquisition of the worldwide rights to oritavancin from intermune

this statement is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning on or after december  with earlier adoption prohibited 
while there will be no impact to our financial statements on the accounting for acquisitions completed prior to december   such as the curacyte discovery acquisition  the adoption of sfas no

sfas no 

sfas no 
establishes accounting and reporting standards for the noncontrolling interest in a subsidiary and for the retained interest and gain or loss when a subsidiary is deconsolidated 
this statement is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years 
table of contents beginning on or after december  with earlier adoption prohibited 
we do not expect the adoption of sfas no 
to have a material impact on our financial statements as we currently do not have any noncontrolling interests 
however  the adoption of sfas could materially change the accounting for such interests outstanding as of  or subsequent to  the date of adoption 
in april  the fasb issued fsp no 
fas  determination of the useful life of intangible assets fas 
in determining the useful life of intangible assets  fas removes the requirement to consider whether an intangible asset can be renewed without substantial cost or material modifications to the existing terms and conditions and  instead  requires an entity to consider its own historical experience in renewing similar arrangements 
fas also requires expanded disclosure related to the determination of intangible asset useful lives 
fas is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after december  we are currently evaluating the impact  if any  of fas on our results of operations or financial position 
in may  the fasb issued sfas no 
 the hierarchy of generally accepted accounting principles sfas no 

the new standard is intended to improve financial reporting by identifying a consistent framework or hierarchy for selecting accounting principles to be used in preparing financial statements that are presented in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles  or gaap for nongovernmental entities 
prior to the issuance of sfas no 
 gaap hierarchy was defined in the american institute of certified public accountants aicpa statement on auditing standards sas no 
 the meaning of present fairly in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles 
sfas no 
is effective days following the sec s approval of the public company accounting oversight board auditing amendments to au section  the meaning of present fairly in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles 
we do not expect our adoption of sfas no

we are currently evaluating the impact  if any  of eitf on our results of operations or financial position 
application of critical accounting estimates the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with us gaap 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect our reported assets and liabilities  revenues and expenses  and other financial information 
actual results may differ significantly from these estimates under different assumptions and conditions 
in addition  our reported financial condition and results of operations could vary due to a change in the application of a particular accounting standard 
we regard an accounting estimate or assumption underlying our financial statements as a critical accounting estimate where the nature of the estimate or assumption is material due to the level of subjectivity and judgment necessary to account for highly uncertain matters or the susceptibility of such matters to change  and the impact of the estimates and assumptions on financial condition or operating performance is material 

table of contents our significant accounting policies are more fully described in note to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form k 
not all of these significant accounting policies  however  require that we make estimates and assumptions that we believe are critical accounting estimates 
we have discussed our accounting policies with the audit committee of our board of directors  and we believe that our estimates relating to revenue recognition  inventory  stock based compensation and income taxes described below are critical accounting estimates 
revenue recognition product sales 
we distribute angiomax and cleviprex in the united states through a sole source distribution model 
under this model  we sell angiomax and cleviprex to our sole source distributor  which then sells angiomax and cleviprex to a limited number of national medical and pharmaceutical wholesalers with distribution centers located throughout the united states and in certain cases  directly to hospitals 
prior to march  we sold angiomax to these wholesalers directly and these wholesalers then sold angiomax to hospitals 
outside of the united states  we sell angiomax either directly to hospitals or to wholesalers or to international distributors  which then sell angiomax to hospitals 
as of december   we had deferred revenue of million associated with sales to wholesalers outside of the united states 
we recognize revenue from such sales when hospitals purchase the product 
we do not recognize revenue from product sales until there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement  delivery has occurred  the price is fixed and determinable  the buyer is obligated to pay us  the obligation to pay is not contingent on resale of the product  the buyer has economic substance apart from us  we have no obligation to bring about the sale of the product  the amount of returns can be reasonably estimated and collectibility is reasonably assured 
initial gross wholesaler orders of cleviprex in the united states in the third quarter of totaled million 
we recorded this amount as deferred revenue as we could not estimate certain adjustments to gross revenue  including returns 
under this deferred revenue model  we do not recognize revenue upon product shipment to our sole source distributor 
instead  upon product shipment  we invoice our sole source distributor  record deferred revenue at gross invoice sales price  classify the cost basis of the product held by the sole source distributor as finished goods inventory held by others and include such cost basis amount within prepaid expenses and other current assets on our consolidated balance sheets 
we recognized million of revenue associated with cleviprex during the fourth quarter of related to purchases by hospitals 
we expect to recognize revenue when hospitals purchase product 
we expect that we will recognize cleviprex revenue upon shipment to our sole source distributor in the same manner as we recognize angiomax revenue when we have sufficient information to develop reasonable estimates of expected returns and other adjustments to gross revenue 
we record allowances for chargebacks and other discounts or accruals for product returns  rebates and fee for service charges at the time of sale  and report revenue net of such amounts 
in determining the amounts of certain allowances and accruals  we must make significant judgments and estimates 
for example  in determining these amounts  we estimate hospital demand  buying patterns by hospitals and group purchasing organizations from wholesalers and the levels of inventory held by wholesalers and by our sole source distributor 
making these determinations involves estimating whether trends in past wholesaler and hospital buying patterns will predict future product sales 
we receive data periodically from our sole source distributor and wholesalers on inventory levels and levels of hospital purchases and we consider this data in determining the amounts of these allowances and accruals 
the nature of our allowances and accruals requiring critical estimates  and the specific considerations we use in estimating their amounts are as follows 
product returns 
our customers have the right to return any unopened product during the month period beginning six months prior to the labeled expiration date and ending months after the labeled expiration date 
as a result  in calculating the accrual for product returns  we must estimate the likelihood that product sold might not be used within six months of expiration and analyze the likelihood that such product will be returned within months after expiration 

table of contents in estimating the likelihood of product being returned  we rely on information from our sole source distributor and wholesalers regarding inventory levels  measured hospital demand as reported by third party sources and internal sales data 
we also consider the past buying patterns of our sole source distributor and wholesalers  the estimated remaining shelf life of product previously shipped and the expiration dates of product currently being shipped 
at december  and december   our accrual for product returns was million and million  respectively 
included within the accrual at december  and december  is a reserve of million and million  respectively  that we established for existing inventory at nycomed that nycomed has the right to return at any time 
a change in our accrual for product returns would have had an approximate million effect on our reported net revenue for the year ended december  chargebacks and rebates 
although we primarily sell products to a sole source distributor in the united states  we typically enter into agreements with hospitals  either directly or through group purchasing organizations acting on behalf of their hospital members  in connection with the hospitals purchases of products 
based on these agreements  most of our hospital customers have the right to receive a discounted price for product and volume based rebates on product purchases 
in the case of discounted pricing  we typically provide a credit to the sole source distributor  or a chargeback  representing the difference between the sole source distributor s acquisition list price and the discounted price 
in the case of the volume based rebates  we typically pay the rebate directly to the hospitals 
as a result of these agreements  at the time of product shipment  we estimate the likelihood that products sold to the sole source distributor might be ultimately sold to a contracting hospital or group purchasing organization 
we also estimate the contracting hospital s or group purchasing organization s volume of purchases 
we base our estimates on certain industry data  hospital purchases and the historic chargeback data we receive from our sole source distributor  most of which the sole source distributor receives from wholesalers  which detail historic buying patterns and sales mix for particular hospitals and group purchasing organizations  and the applicable customer chargeback rates and rebate thresholds 
our allowance for chargebacks for products was million and million at december  and december   respectively 
a change in our allowance for chargebacks would have had an approximate million effect on our reported net revenue for the year ended december  our accrual for product rebates was million at december  and million at december  a change in our accrual for rebates would have had an approximate million effect on our reported net revenue for the year ended december  fees for service 
we offer discounts to certain wholesalers and our sole source distributor based on contractually determined rates for certain services 
we estimate our fee for service accruals and allowances based on historical sales  wholesaler and distributor inventory levels and the applicable discount rate 
our discounts are accrued at the time of the sale and are typically settled with the wholesalers or sole source distributor within days after the end of each respective quarter 
our fee for service accruals and allowances were million and million at december  and december   respectively 
a change in our fee for service accruals and allowances would have had an approximate million effect on our reported net revenue for the year ended december  we have adjusted our allowances for chargebacks and accruals for product returns  rebates and fees for service in the past based on actual sales experience  and we will likely be required to make adjustments to these allowances and accruals in the future 
we continually monitor our allowances and accruals and makes adjustments when we believe actual experience may differ from our estimates 
the allowances included in the table below reflect these adjustments 

table of contents the following table provides a summary of activity with respect to our sales allowances and accruals during  and amounts in thousands fees for returns chargebacks rebates service balance at january  allowances actual credits issued for prior years sales actual credits issued for sales during balance at december  allowances actual credits issued for prior years sales actual credits issued for sales during balance at december  allowances actual credits issued for prior years sales actual credits issued for sales during balance at december  included within the allowances above is the reserve of million that we recorded during the fourth quarter of for the existing inventory at nycomed which we did not believe would be sold prior to the termination of the transitional distribution agreement and would be subject to purchase in accordance with the agreement 
during  we reduced the reserve by million as nycomed sold a portion of its existing inventory during the year 
such amount is included within the allowances above 
we will reimburse nycomed million for the final amount of inventory held by nycomed at december  international distributors 
under our agreements with our primary international distributors  including nycomed under the distribution agreement that was terminated in july  we sell angiomax to these distributors at a fixed transfer price 
the established transfer price is typically determined once per year  prior to the first shipment of angiomax to the distributor each year 
the minimum selling price used in determining the transfer price is of the average net unit selling price 
revenue from the sale of distribution rights during includes the amortization of milestone payments 
these milestone payments are recorded as deferred revenue until contractual performance obligations have been satisfied  and they are typically recognized ratably over the term of these agreements 
when the period of deferral cannot be specifically identified from the contract  we must estimate the period based upon other critical factors contained within the contract 
we review these estimates at least annually  which could result in a change in the deferral period 
in connection with the nycomed transaction described in note of the notes to our consolidated financial statements included in this report  we wrote off approximately million of deferred revenue during the third quarter of  which amount represented the unamortized portion of deferred revenue related to milestone payments received from nycomed in and revenue associated with sales of angiomax to our international distributors during  and was million  million and million  respectively 
during  international net revenue was reduced by million  which represented a reserve for existing inventory at nycomed that we did not believe would be sold prior to the termination of our transitional distribution agreement with nycomed and would be subject to purchase under such agreement 
during  we reduced the nycomed inventory reserve by million as nycomed sold a portion of its existing inventory during the year 
such amount is included in the million of revenue associated with sales to our international distributors in reimbursement revenue 
in collaboration with a third party  in we paid fees for services rendered by a research organization and other out of pocket costs for which we were reimbursed at cost  without mark up or profits 
we account for these arrangements using fasb eitf income statement 
table of contents characterization of reimbursements received for out of pocket expenses incurred and fasb eitf reporting revenue gross as a principal versus net as an agent 
we have reported the reimbursements received as part of net revenue on our consolidated statements of operations 
we have included the fees for the services rendered and the out of pocket costs in research and development expenses 
revenue from collaborations 
under the terms of the transitional distribution agreement with nycomed  we were entitled to receive a specified percentage of nycomed s net sales of angiox to third parties 
in the event the angiox sold was purchased by nycomed from us prior to july   the amount we were entitled to receive in connection with such sale was reduced by the amount previously paid by nycomed to us for such product 
accordingly  revenue related to the transitional distribution agreement with nycomed was not recognized until the product is sold by nycomed to a hospital customer 
for the year ended december   we recorded million of net revenue from sales made by nycomed of approximately million under the transitional distribution agreement 
inventory we record inventory upon the transfer of title from our vendors 
inventory is stated at the lower of cost or market value and valued using first in  first out methodology 
angiomax and cleviprex bulk substance is classified as raw materials and its costs are determined using acquisition costs from our contract manufacturers 
we record work in progress costs of filling  finishing and packaging against specific product batches 
we obtain all of our angiomax bulk drug substance from lonza braine  sa under the terms of our agreement with lonza braine  we provide forecasts of our annual needs for angiomax bulk substance months in advance 
we also have a separate agreement with ben venue laboratories  inc for the fill finish of angiomax drug product 
we obtain all of our cleviprex bulk drug substance from johnson matthey pharma services and also have a separate agreement with hospira  inc for the fill finish of cleviprex drug product 
we review inventory  including inventory purchase commitments  for slow moving or obsolete amounts based on expected revenues 
as of december   we have an inventory obsolescence reserve of million related to cleviprex 
if annual revenues are less than expected  we may be required to make additional allowances for excess or obsolete inventory in the future 
stock based compensation we have established equity compensation plans for our employees  directors and certain other individuals 
all grants and terms are authorized by our board of directors or the compensation committee of our board of directors  as appropriate 
we may grant non qualified stock options  restricted stock awards  stock appreciation rights and other stock based awards under our amended restated stock incentive plan 
from january to may  we granted non qualified stock options under our equity inducement plan to new employees as an inducement to their entering into employment with us 
effective january   we adopted the fair value recognition provisions of sfas no 
r  and recognize expense using the accelerated expense attribution method specified in fasb interpretation no 
fin  accounting for stock appreciation rights and other variable stock option or award plans 
sfas no 
r requires companies to recognize compensation expense in an amount equal to the fair value of all share based awards granted to employees 
we estimate the fair value of each option on the date of grant using the black scholes closed form option pricing model based on assumptions for the expected term of the stock options  expected volatility of our common stock  and prevailing interest rates 
sfas r also requires us to estimate forfeitures in calculating the expense relating to stock based compensation as opposed to only recognizing forfeitures and the corresponding reduction in expense as they occur 

table of contents we have based our assumptions on the following assumption method of estimating estimated expected term of options employees historical exercise experience and  at times  estimates of future exercises of unexercised options based on the midpoint between the vesting date and end of the contractual term expected volatility historic price of our common stock and the implied volatility of the stock of our peer group risk free interest rate yields of us treasury securities corresponding with the expected life of option grants forfeiture rates historical forfeiture data of these assumptions  the expected term of the option and expected volatility of our common stock are the most difficult to estimate since they are based on the exercise behavior of the employees and expected performance of our common stock 
increases in the term and the volatility of our common stock will generally cause an increase in compensation expense 
income taxes effective january   we adopted fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes  which requires the use of a two step approach for recognizing and measuring tax benefits taken or expected to be taken in a tax return and disclosures regarding uncertainties in income tax positions 
the first step is recognition we determine whether it is more likely than not that a tax position will be sustained upon examination  including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes  based on the technical merits of the position 
in evaluating whether a tax position has met the more likely than not recognition threshold  we presume that the position will be examined by the appropriate taxing authority that has full knowledge of all relevant information 
the second step is measurement a tax position that meets the more likely than not recognition threshold is measured to determine the amount of benefit to recognize in the financial statements 
the tax position is measured at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement 
our annual effective tax rate is based on pre tax earnings  existing statutory tax rates  limitations on the use of tax credits  net operating loss carryforwards and tax planning opportunities available in the jurisdictions in which we operate 
significant judgment is required in evaluating our tax position 
on a periodic basis  we evaluate the realizability of our deferred tax assets and liabilities and will adjust such amounts in light of changing facts and circumstances  including but not limited to future projections of taxable income  tax legislation  rulings by relevant tax authorities  tax planning strategies and the progress of ongoing tax audits 
settlement of filing positions that may be challenged by tax authorities could impact the income tax position in the year of resolution 
our current tax liability is presented in the consolidated balance sheets within accrued expenses 
at december   we had million of gross deferred tax assets before valuation allowance  which included the tax effect of net operating loss carryforwards of million  research and development credits of million and other items of million 
these assets are offset by a million valuation allowance since the realization of these future benefits is not considered more likely than not as our ability to estimate long term future taxable income with a high level of certainty is limited 
in assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets  we consider whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the period in which those temporary differences become deductible or the net operating losses and credit carryforwards can be utilized 
when considering the reversal of the valuation allowance  we consider the level of past and anticipated future taxable income and the utilization of the carryforwards 

table of contents we expect that future periods will include income taxes at a higher effective rate 
revisions to the estimated net realizable value of the deferred tax asset could cause our provision for income taxes to vary significantly from period to period 
factors that could significantly impact our valuation allowance include future projections of taxable income  tax legislation  rulings by relevant tax authorities  the progress of ongoing audits  the regulatory approval of products currently under development  extension of the patent rights relating to angiomax  failure to achieve future anticipated revenues or the implementation of tax planning strategies in connection with our european expansion 
should we further reduce or increase the valuation allowance on deferred tax assets  a current year tax benefit or expense would be recognized and future periods would then include income taxes at a higher or lower rate than the effective rate in the period that the adjustment is made 
results of operations years ended december  and net revenue 
net revenue increased to million for as compared to million for the following table reflects the components of net revenue for the years ended december  and net revenue year ended december  of total of total net revenue revenue revenue in thousands in thousands angiomax and cleviprex us sales international net revenue revenue from collaborations  net total net revenue us sales during increased million compared to primarily due to increased sales of angiomax as a result of increased demand by existing hospital customers  the addition of new hospital customers and the price increases we implemented in august and january the increase in sales of angiomax in the united states also reflects a million credit from our domestic wholesalers in connection with our price increase announced in january of the increase in united states sales of angiomax during compared to  approximately was attributable to price increases  was related to hospital demand by existing hospital customers and the addition of new hospital customers and was related to the million credit from our domestic wholesalers 
the increase in us sales in also includes million of net revenue from cleviprex sales 
international net revenue increased million during compared to primarily as a result of a million increase in direct sales we made after assuming control of the distribution of angiox in the nycomed territory during the third quarter of and the million decrease of our reserve for existing inventory at nycomed 
during the fourth quarter of  we recorded a million reserve for existing inventory at nycomed which reduced international net revenue in by million 
we reserved for this inventory because we did not believe that such inventory would be sold by nycomed prior to the termination of our transitional distribution agreement with nycomed and because such inventory was subject to return 
during  nycomed sold approximately million of its existing inventory 
as a result  we reduced our reserve for existing inventory to million and such adjustment resulted in an increase to international net revenue 
we will reimburse nycomed million for the final amount of inventory held by nycomed at december  as of december   we assumed control of the distribution of angiox in the countries previously serviced by nycomed 
the remaining increase in international net revenue is primarily related to increased orders for angiomax from our canadian distributor 

table of contents during  we recognized as revenue from collaborations approximately million of net revenue from sales made by nycomed of approximately million under our transitional distribution agreement with nycomed 
under the terms of this transitional distribution agreement  upon the sale by nycomed to third parties of vials of angiox  nycomed pays us a specified percentage of nycomed s net sales of angiox  less the amount previously paid by nycomed to us for the existing inventory 
during  we recognized as revenue from collaborations approximately million of net revenue from sales of angiox made by nycomed of approximately million under the transitional distribution agreement 
the increase in revenue from collaborations is primarily due to the timing of when the nycomed agreements were entered into and timing of when we assumed control of distribution of angiox in the nycomed territories 
cost of revenue 
as shown in the table below  cost of revenue in was million  or of net revenue  compared to million  or of net revenue  in cost of revenue consisted of expenses in connection with the manufacture of angiomax and cleviprex sold  royalty expenses under our agreements with biogen idec  health research inc and astrazeneca and the logistics costs of selling angiomax and cleviprex  such as distribution  storage  and handling 
cost of revenue year ended december  of total of total cost of revenue cost cost in thousands in thousands manufacturing royalty logistics total cost of revenue cost of revenue increased million during compared to approximately million of the total cost of revenue increase related to an increase in royalty expense due to higher angiomax sales and approximately million of the increase related to an increase in logistics costs primarily related to higher sales of angiomax and our costs associated with establishing our european distribution network 
manufacturing expenses increased million during compared to approximately million of the increase was due to a write off of one batch of angiomax  million related to the inventory obsolescence reserve for cleviprex and the remaining increase is primarily a result of producing more angiomax to accommodate for higher sales 
the decrease in cost of revenue as a percentage of net revenue is attributable to an increase in revenue from collaborations  net and an increase in us sales of angiomax 
we expect our cost of revenue to increase in as a result of higher anticipated sales and expect our cost of revenue as a percentage of net revenue to also increase in as we expect to have a higher effective royalty rate for sales of angiomax under our agreement with biogen idec 
research and development expenses 
research and development expenses increased by to million for  compared to million for the increase primarily reflects the acquisition of curacyte discovery in august  which resulted in the inclusion in research and development expenses of million of acquisition related in process research and development 
the remaining increase in research and development expenses resulted primarily from increased expenses associated with our cangrelor clinical trials and increased business development expenses 
the increase in research and development expenses was partially offset by decreased expenditures in connection with the development of angiomax for additional indications and decreased research and development expenditures in connection with cleviprex 

table of contents the following table identifies  for each of our major research and development projects  our spending for and spending for past periods is not necessarily indicative of spending in future periods 
we expect that this table will include oritavancin in future periods 
research and development spending year ended december  of of research and development total r d total r d in thousands in thousands angiomax clinical trials manufacturing development administrative and headcount costs total angiomax cleviprex clinical trials manufacturing development administrative and headcount costs total cleviprex cangrelor clinical trials manufacturing development administrative and headcount costs total cangrelor cu clinical trials manufacturing development administrative and headcount costs acquisition related in process research and development t total cu other total angiomax research and development spending related to angiomax during decreased by approximately million compared to angiomax clinical trial costs decreased by approximately million primarily due to decreased expenditures in connection with the investigator initiated trial called horizons ami to study angiomax use in adult ami patients that we supported 
during the third quarter of  we incurred million in costs related to the final milestone payment in connection with horizons ami 
the decrease in angiomax clinical trial expenses was also due to decreased expenditures in connection with our  patient phase iii acuity trial 
in  clinical trial expenses incurred related to our phase iii acuity trial primarily related to data analysis 
we incurred no clinical trial expense in related to acuity 
clinical trial expenses also decreased during due to reduced research and development expenses that we incurred in connection with a study of angiomax in the pediatric setting that we began in the first half of in connection with a written 
table of contents request by the fda 
the study consists of a single trial to clarify the pediatric dose that provides a pharmacodynamic response equivalent to that observed in the adult population at the approved adult dose 
we completed the enrollment of patients during the third quarter of and expect to file a clinical study report for the pediatric extension with the fda in the second quarter of costs incurred in connection with the pediatric study were approximately million less during compared to angiomax manufacturing development expenses during increased million compared to  primarily due to product lifecycle management activities 
administrative and headcount costs decreased in primarily related to our efforts in to seek approval from the fda of an additional indication for angiomax for the treatment of patients with acs based on results of our phase iii acuity trial 
the fda accepted this application to file in september in may  we received a non approvable letter from the fda 
in its letter  the fda indicated that the basis of its decision involved the appropriate use and interpretation of the non inferiority trials we relied on in support of our nda  including acuity trial 
we disagree with the fda on these issues and have initiated discussions with the fda to address them 
we plan to continue to incur research and development expenses relating to angiomax in connection with our efforts to further develop angiomax for use in additional patient populations and to increase our product lifecycle management activities  we expect spending for angiomax in to continue to decrease as a percentage of our research and development expense 
cleviprex research and development expenditures for cleviprex decreased approximately million during compared the decrease in research and development expenditures primarily reflected higher spending during in preparation for filing our nda with the fda  which we submitted in july on august   the fda approved cleviprex for the reduction of blood pressure when oral therapy is not feasible or not desirable and we launched the product in the united states in september cangrelor research and development expenditures related to cangrelor increased by approximately million in compared to as enrollment continued in the two pivotal phase iii clinical trials that we continue to conduct for the evaluation of cangrelor s effectiveness and safety in preventing ischemic events in patients who require pci 
research and development spending associated with our champion pci and chamption platform trials increased during primarily due to an increase in the number of countries in which we are recruiting patients through contract research organizations for these trials 
in march  we commenced enrollment of our champion pci trial  which we designed to evaluate whether use of intravenous cangrelor is superior to use of clopidrogrel tablets in patients undergoing pci 
we commenced enrollment in october of a second trial  called champion platform  which compares cangrelor plus usual care to placebo plus usual care in patients who require pci 
we currently expect to enroll approximately  patients in the champion pci trial and  patients in the champion platform trial 
as of december   we had enrolled approximately  patients in our champion pci trial and approximately  patients in our champion platform trial 
we expect to complete patient enrollment in both trials by the end of the third quarter of if we complete these trials on a timely basis and the results of these trials are favorable  we anticipate making submissions for marketing approvals in the united states in and in the european union and selected markets thereafter 
cu in august  we acquired curacyte discovery and its lead compound cu  which we are developing for the prevention of blood loss during surgery 
we allocated approximately million of 
table of contents the purchase price for the acquisition to in process research and development and expensed it during the third quarter of we expect to initiate phase i clinical trials of cu in other spending in this category consists of infrastructure costs in support of our product development efforts  which includes expenses for data management  statistical analysis  analysis of pre clinical data  analysis of pharmacokinetic pharmacodynamic pk pd data and product safety as well as expenses related to business development activities 
we also incur business development expenses in connection with our efforts to evaluate early stage and late stage compounds for development and commercialization and other strategic opportunities 
in  spending in this category increased by million compared to the same period in  primarily related to an increase in business development activities and increased headcount in our business development department 
in order to support the continued development of angiomax  cleviprex  cangrelor and cu  we expect our annual research and development expenses to decrease in  which does not include expenses related to oritavancin 
we expect these research and development expenses to reflect costs associated with the costs of enrollment of our ongoing phase iii champion pci trial and champion platform trial for cangrelor  our phase iv trials for cleviprex  additional manufacturing development costs for cleviprex and cangrelor and costs of our anticipated phase i clinical trial of cu in addition  we expect to incur additional research and development expenses in in connection with our anticipated phase iii clinical trial of oritavancin 
our success in further developing angiomax  obtaining marketing approval for cleviprex outside the united states  or developing and obtaining marketing approval for cangrelor  oritavancin and cu  is highly uncertain 
we cannot predict expenses associated with ongoing data analysis or regulatory submissions  if any 
nor can we reasonably estimate or know the nature  timing and estimated costs of the efforts necessary to complete the development of  or the period in which material net cash inflows are expected to commence from  cleviprex outside the united states  cangrelor  oritavancin or cu due to the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with developing and commercializing drugs  including the uncertainty of the scope  rate of progress and cost of our clinical trials and other research and development activities  future clinical trial results  the terms and timing of any collaborative  licensing and other arrangements that we may establish  the cost and timing of regulatory approvals  the cost and timing of establishing and maintaining sales  marketing and distribution capabilities  the cost of establishing and maintaining clinical and commercial supplies of our product candidates  the effect of competing technological and market developments  and the cost of filing  prosecuting  defending and enforcing any patent claims and other intellectual property rights 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased by million to million for  from million for the increase in selling  general and administrative expenses of million includes million of expenses incurred in preparation for the launch of cleviprex  a million increase in expenses relating to marketing of angiomax  million in fees related to the building of our business infrastructure in europe  a million increase in costs related to headcount expansion  including the expansion of medical science  sales management and international operations teams and a million increase in stock based compensation expense 
the increase in selling  general and administrative expenses in was partially offset by the million of expenses incurred during the third quarter of related to the termination of the prior distribution agreement with nycomed and our reacquisition of all the rights to develop  distribute and market angiox in the nycomed territory that we recorded as selling  general and administrative expenses in 
table of contents we expect selling  general and administrative expenses to increase in from levels primarily due to increased headcount and related expenses  expenses related to our european expansion and additional expenses related to the relocation of our principal executive offices in january other income 
other income  which is comprised of interest income and gains and losses on foreign currency transactions  decreased million to million for  from million for approximately million of the decrease in other income related to a decrease in interest income due to lower rates of return on our available for sale securities in the remaining decrease in other income related to losses on foreign currency transactions 
provision for income tax 
during we recorded a million provision for income taxes based on a loss before taxes of million during the period 
the provision for income taxes was recorded based upon us taxable income as no benefit from income taxes related to our losses from international operations was recorded as it is not more likely than not that we will recognize a benefit from the international deferred tax assets 
during  we recorded a provision for income tax of million based upon loss before income taxes of million 
we did not record a deferred tax benefit for the losses incurred in  as we believed that the realization of the deferred tax assets associated with those losses was not more likely than not 
we will continue to evaluate the realizability of our deferred tax assets and liabilities on a periodic basis  and will adjust such amounts in light of changing facts and circumstances  including but not limited to future projections of taxable income  tax legislation  rulings by relevant tax authorities  the progress of ongoing tax audits  the regulatory approval of products currently under development  extension of the patent rights relating to angiomax  failure to achieve future anticipated revenues or the implementation of tax planning strategies in connection with our european expansion 
if we further reduce or increase the valuation allowance of deferred tax assets in future years  we would recognize a tax benefit or expense

of the increase in net revenue in compared to  approximately was attributable to price increases and approximately was related to hospital demand 
the increase also reflected the completion in the first quarter of of the wholesaler inventory reduction program  which commenced in the third quarter of in conjunction with the entrance 
table of contents into fee for service agreements with our three largest wholesalers at the time and concluded in the first quarter of we estimate that our wholesalers reduced their aggregate inventories of angiomax during the first quarter of by approximately million 
international net revenue decreased approximately million in compared to approximately million related to a decrease in international sales resulting from a curtailment of orders from nycomed during the decrease in international net revenue also includes a reserve of million that we established in the fourth quarter of for existing inventory at nycomed because we did not believe such inventory would be sold by nycomed prior to the termination of our transitional distribution agreement with nycomed and because such inventory was subject to return 
the remaining decrease in international sales relates primarily to decreases in sales to our other international distributors due to decreased demand 
also included within international net revenue was the amortization of milestone payments related to million in non refundable fees received from nycomed 
during and  we recognized million and million  respectively  of amortization related to such milestone payments 
we recorded these milestone payments as deferred revenue in and  and recognized them ratably over the remaining life of the angiox patent 
as a result of our arrangements with nycomed  during the third quarter of  we wrote off approximately million of deferred revenue  which represented the unamortized portion of deferred revenue related to milestone payments received from nycomed in and this amount was recorded in selling  general and administrative expenses 
in  we did not generate any reimbursement revenue  compared to reimbursement revenue of million in we generated this revenue during in connection with the performance of services in collaboration with a third party under a contract research agreement 
in  we recognized as revenue from collaborations approximately million of net revenue from sales made by nycomed of approximately million under our transitional distribution agreement with them 
under the terms of this transitional distribution agreement  upon the sale by nycomed to third parties of vials of angiox  nycomed pays us a specified percentage of nycomed s net sales of angiox  less the amount previously paid by nycomed to us for the existing inventory

table of contents research and development expenses 
research and development expenses increased by to million for  from million for the increase in research and development expenses resulted primarily from increased investment in our cangrelor development program  which was offset in part by decreased expenditures in connection with the development of angiomax 
the following table identifies  for each of our major research and development projects  our spending for and spending for past periods is not necessarily indicative of spending in future periods

we continued to have research and development expenses during for acuity relating primarily to data analysis  but at significantly reduced rates compared to those incurred in the decrease in clinical trial expenses also reflects a decrease in post marketing trial related expenses 
we expect research and development spending for angiomax to continue to decrease as a percentage of our research and development expense 
expenses incurred in included expenses for collection of month patient follow up results in the acuity trial 
the decrease in angiomax research and development spending was offset by an increase in administrative and headcount costs primarily due to our application to the fda seeking approval of an additional indication for angiomax for the treatment of patients with acs based on the results of our phase iii acuity trial 
the fda accepted this application to file in september we also continued to incur research and development expenses relating to angiomax in connection with our efforts to expand the indications for which angiomax is approved beyond patients undergoing pci 
table of contents and patients with acs 
in october  we received a non approvable letter from the fda in connection with our application to market angiomax in patients with or at risk of heparin induced thrombocytopenia and thrombosis syndrome  or hit hitts  undergoing cardiac surgery 
in the letter  the fda stated that it does not consider the data we submitted in support of the application adequate to support approval for this indication because it did not consider the evidence used to qualify patients for inclusion in the trials as a persuasive indicator for the risk of hit hitts 
we are evaluating potential next steps 
in july  canadian health authorities approved the use of angiomax in canada for the treatment of patients with hit hitts undergoing cardiac surgery 
in  we began a study of angiomax in the pediatric setting in connection with the written request we received from the fda 
the study consists of a single trial to clarify the pediatric dose that provides a pharmacodynamic response equivalent to that observed in the adult population at the approved adult dose 
during  we enrolled patients for the pediatric study 
in  we also supported an investigator initiated trial called horizons ami to study angiomax use in adult ami patients 
horizons ami was designed to evaluate whether angiomax with provisional use of gpiib iiia inhibitors was as safe and effective as heparin with planned use of gpiib iiia inhibitors in ami patients 
cleviprex research and development expenditures for cleviprex remained relatively consistent in and in july  we submitted our nda for cleviprex for approval to market cleviprex for patients receiving an intravenous antihypertensive agent in the critical care setting when oral therapy is not desirable or feasible 
the fda accepted this nda to file in september research and development expense for cleviprex that we incurred in the year ended december  included million of administrative and headcount costs primarily related to the preparation of the nda  compared to million in during  expenditures for cleviprex clinical trials decreased by million  primarily related to decreased expenditures on our eclipse trials  which are our three phase iii clinical trials to evaluate the safety of cleviprex in approximately  patients in comparison to sodium nitroprusside  nicardipine and nitroglycerine  three leading blood pressure reducing agents  before  during and following cardiac surgery  and decreased expenditures on our velocity trial 
we completed the eclipse studies and the velocity study in the first half of we incurred million of expenses in in connection with the development of the processes to manufacture cleviprex upon its approval for sale by the fda 
cangrelor we are developing cangrelor for potential use as an antiplatelet agent in the critical care settings of the cardiac catheterization laboratory  the operating room and or the emergency department 
research and development expenditures related to cangrelor increased in compared to as a result of the two pivotal phase iii clinical trials that we continue to conduct for the evaluation of cangrelor s effectiveness and safety in preventing ischemic events in patients who require pci 
in march  we commenced enrollment of our champion pci trial

selling  general and administrative expenses increased by million to million for  from million for the increase in selling  general and administrative expenses primarily related to costs incurred and recognized in connection with the termination of the prior distribution agreement with nycomed and our reacquisition of all the rights to develop  distribute and market angiox in the nycomed territory 
in the third quarter of  we recorded million of expense attributable to the termination of the prior distribution agreement with nycomed 
the million expense was offset by the write off of approximately million of deferred revenue  which amount represented the unamortized portion of deferred revenue relating to milestone payments received from nycomed in and in  we incurred approximately million of external consulting fees related to our european expansion and million of additional costs under the nycomed transition services agreement  which terminated december  the additional costs related to the transition services agreement include reimbursing nycomed for selling  management  marketing and certain personnel costs 
the increase in selling  general and administrative expenses is also attributable to cleviprex expenses of million that we incurred in preparation for the anticipated launch of the product and a million increase in stock based compensation expense 
other income 
other income  which is primarily comprised of interest income  increased approximately to million for  from million for the increase in other income of million was primarily due to higher rates of return on our available for sale securities in  combined with higher levels of cash to invest as a result of our generation of operating and financing cash flows 
provision for benefit from income tax 
the tax provision for was million as compared to a tax benefit for of million 
during  we increased our net deferred tax asset by million in connection with an excess tax benefit recorded in additional paid in capital attributable to stock compensation plans 
however  we did not recognize a benefit from income taxes on our pretax loss as we determined the future recognition of additional deferred tax assets is not currently considered more likely than not 
the net loss we incurred during is primarily attributable to the nycomed transaction 
we did not believe this one time transaction would impact our ability to realize the balance of deferred tax assets currently recorded 
the benefit for was a result of our decision to reduce approximately million of our valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets because we believed it more likely than not that we would realize a benefit from these assets 
this was partially offset by a provision for us alternative minimum taxes  which can not be entirely offset with our nol carryforwards  and state taxes based on net worth 
liquidity and capital resources sources of liquidity 
since our inception  we have financed our operations principally through the sale of common and preferred stock  sales of convertible promissory notes and warrants  interest income and revenues from sales of angiomax 
except for and  we have incurred losses on an annual basis since our inception 
we had million in cash  cash equivalents and available for sale securities as of december  in february  in connection with our acquisition of targanta  we used existing cash to pay targanta shareholders in cash at closing for each common share of targanta common stock tendered  or approximately million in aggregate 
cash flows 
as of december   we had million in cash and cash equivalents  as compared to million as of december  our primary sources of cash during included million of net cash provided by operating activities and million in net cash provided by financing activities 
these amounts were exceeded by the million in net cash that we used in investing activities 
net cash provided by operating activities was million in  compared to net cash provided by operating activities of million in the cash provided by operating activities in includes a decrease in cash flow from operations of million due to a net loss in the decrease in cash flows from operations related to net loss was offset by non cash items of million mainly attributable to the in process research and development charge of million in connection with the curacyte discovery acquisition  stock based compensation expense of million and deferred tax provision of million 

table of contents cash provided by operating activities included a decrease of million due to changes in working capital items 
included within the changes in working capital items was a million decrease in accrued expenses primarily due to payments made to nycomed under our transitional distribution agreement 
we paid nycomed million on january   million on july   as well as an additional million on july  for our obtaining european commission approval to market angiox for acs in europe in january also included within changes in working capital items was a million increase in deferred revenue primarily related to shipments of cleviprex during during  million in net cash was used in investing activities  which included million used to purchase available for sale securities  and million used to purchase fixed assets  offset by million in proceeds from the maturity and sale of available for sale securities 
net cash used in investing activities also included a net cash expenditure of million in connection with the curacyte discovery acquisition  a million investment in a specialty pharmaceutical company and million of milestone payments paid in connection with fda approval of cleviprex 
during  we received million in net cash provided by financing activities  which consisted of proceeds to us from option exercises and purchases of stock under our employee stock purchase plan 
funding requirements 
we expect to devote substantial resources to our research and development efforts and to our sales  marketing and manufacturing programs associated with the commercialization of our products 
our funding requirements will depend on numerous factors including the extent to which angiomax is commercially successful globally  the extent to which cleviprex is commercially successful in the united states  the extent to which we can successfully establish a commercial infrastructure outside the united states  the expansion of our sales force in connection with the expansion of our sales and marketing efforts in europe and the sale of cleviprex in the united states  our plan to continue to evaluate possible acquisitions of development stage products  approved products  or businesses and possible additional strategic or licensing arrangements with companies that fit within our growth strategy  such as our acquisitions of curacyte discovery and targanta  the progress  level and timing of our research and development activities related to our clinical trials with respect to angiomax  cleviprex  cangrelor  oritavancin and cu  the cost and outcomes of regulatory submissions and reviews  including our efforts to obtain approval of the expansion of the angiomax product label in the united states to include an additional dosing regimen in the treatment of acs initiated in the emergency department in the united states  approval of cleviprex internationally and approval of our product candidates globally  the continuation or termination of third party manufacturing or sales and marketing arrangements  the size  cost and effectiveness of our sales and marketing programs in the united states and internationally  the status of competitive products  the success of obtaining regulatory approval of oritavancin and the extent of the commercial success of oritavancin  if and when it is approved  which could result in the cash payment to former targanta shareholders  and our ability to defend and enforce our intellectual property rights
