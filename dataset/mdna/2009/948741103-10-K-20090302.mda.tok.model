item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto and the comparative summary of selected financial data appearing elsewhere in this report 
historical results and trends which might appear should not be taken as indicative of future operations 
our results of operations and financial condition  as reflected in the accompanying consolidated financial statements and related footnotes  are subject to management s evaluation and interpretation of business conditions  retailer performance  changing capital market conditions and other factors which could affect the ongoing viability of our tenants 
executive overview weingarten realty investors is a real estate investment trust reit organized under the texas real estate investment trust act 
we  and our predecessor entity  began the ownership and development of shopping centers and other commercial real estate in our primary business is leasing space to tenants in the shopping and industrial centers we own or lease 
we also manage centers for joint ventures in which we are partners or for other outside owners for which we charge fees 
we operate a portfolio of rental properties which includes neighborhood and community shopping centers and industrial properties of approximately million square feet 
we have a diversified tenant base with our largest tenant comprising only of total rental revenues during our long term strategy is to focus on increasing funds from operations ffo and growing dividend payments to our common shareholders 
we do this through hands on leasing  management and selected redevelopment of the existing portfolio of properties  through disciplined growth from selective acquisitions and new developments  and through the disposition of assets that no longer meet our ownership criteria 
we do this while remaining committed to maintaining a conservative balance sheet  a well staggered debt maturity schedule and strong credit agency ratings 
the depressed economic environment and capital markets have caused us to currently refocus our efforts on maintaining our operating properties at current levels and managing our capital resources to ensure adequate liquidity 

table of contents we strive to maintain a strong  conservative capital structure  which provides ready access to a variety of attractive capital sources 
we carefully balance obtaining low cost financing with minimizing exposure to interest rate movements and matching long term liabilities with the long term assets acquired or developed 
the turmoil in the current capital markets has adversely affected both the pricing and the availability of both debt and equity capital 
our strategy for the upcoming year is focused on the sourcing of new capital whether it is in the form of proceeds from asset dispositions  joint venture relationships  new financings or new equity issuances 
at december   we owned or operated under long term leases  either directly or through our interest in real estate joint ventures or partnerships  a total of developed income producing properties and properties under various stages of construction and development 
the total number of centers includes neighborhood and community shopping centers  industrial projects and three other operating properties located in states spanning the country from coast to coast 
we also owned interests in parcels of land held for development that totaled approximately million square feet 
we had approximately  leases with  different tenants at december  leases for our properties range from less than a year for smaller spaces to over years for larger tenants 
rental revenues generally include minimum lease payments  which often increase over the lease term  reimbursements of property operating expenses  including ad valorem taxes  and additional rent payments based on a percentage of the tenants sales 
the majority of our anchor tenants are supermarkets  value oriented apparel discount stores and other retailers or service providers who generally sell basic necessity type goods and services 
through this challenging economic environment  we believe stability of our anchor tenants  combined with convenient locations  attractive and well maintained properties  high quality retailers and a strong tenant mix  should ensure the long term success of our merchants and the viability of our portfolio 
in assessing the performance of our properties  management carefully tracks the occupancy of the portfolio 
the weakened economy contributed to a drop in our occupancy from at december  to at december  while we will continue to monitor the economy and the effects on our retailers  we believe the significant diversification of our portfolio both geographically and by tenant base will allow us to maintain occupancy levels of above as we move through the year  absent bankruptcies by multiple national or regional tenants 
another important indicator of performance is the increase in rental rates on a same space basis as we complete new leases and renew existing leases 
we completed  new leases or renewals during totaling million square feet  increasing rental rates an average of on a cash basis 
new development at december   we had properties in various stages of development 
we have invested million to date on these projects and  at completion  we estimate our total investment to be million 
these properties are slated to open over the next one to four years with a projected return on investment of approximately when completed 
also  five additional properties have been stabilized during with a total investment of million and a projected return on investment of 
in  we had million in properties that were held for future development pending improvement in economic conditions 
due to current economic factors  obtaining new projects in proved challenging as potential retail anchors delayed or halted their expansion plans due to the deterioration of the economy 
due to our analysis of current economic considerations  including the effects of tenant bankruptcies  lack of available funding and halt of tenant expansion plans for new development projects and declines in the real estate values  plans related to our new development properties including land held for development changed  and the use of these assets was no longer certain which brought about an impairment charge 
impairments  primarily related to our new development properties  of million were recognized for the year ended december  while we will continue to seek opportunities and monitor this market closely  we anticipate little if any investment in new projects in 
table of contents merchant development is a program where we acquire or develop a project with the objective of selling all or part of it  instead of retaining it in our portfolio on a long term basis 
also  disposition of land parcels are included in this program 
we generated gains of approximately million from this program during while our business plan calls for merchant development gains similar to those obtained in  there is no assurance this will occur due to the depressed state of the commercial real estate markets 
acquisitions and joint ventures acquisitions and joint venture arrangements are a key component of our strategy 
however  the turmoil in the capital markets has significantly reduced transactions in the marketplace and  therefore  created uncertainty with respect to pricing 
partnering with institutional investors through real estate joint ventures enables us to acquire high quality assets in our target markets while also meeting our financial return objectives 
we benefit from access to lower cost capital  as well as leveraging our expertise to provide fee based services  such as asset management and the acquisition  leasing and management of properties  to the joint ventures 
during  we acquired one shopping center and invested in a owned unconsolidated joint venture to acquire a  square foot pad building located in florida for a purchase price of approximately million 
in march  we contributed neighborhood community shopping centers located in texas with an aggregate value of approximately million  and aggregating more than million square feet  to a joint venture 
we sold an interest in this joint venture to aew capital management on behalf of one of its institutional clients 
financing totaling million was placed on the properties and guaranteed by us for tax planning purposes 
in august  we executed a real estate limited partnership with a foreign institutional investor to purchase up to million of retail properties in various states 
our ownership in this unconsolidated real estate limited partnership is 
as of december   no properties had been purchased 
in november  we contributed eight neighborhood community shopping centers with an aggregate value of approximately million  and aggregating approximately million square feet  to a joint venture 
four of these shopping centers are located in texas  two in tennessee and one each in florida and georgia 
we sold a interest in this joint venture to hines reit retail holdings  llc 
financing totaling million was placed on the properties and guaranteed by us for tax planning purposes 
subsequent to december   we contributed two additional properties to the joint venture with hines reit retail holdings  llc with an aggregate value of approximately million  and aggregating approximately 
million square feet 
these two shopping centers are located in georgia and north carolina  and we received proceeds of approximately million 
additionally  we have a commitment to contribute two additional properties to this joint venture in joint venture fee income for was approximately million or a decrease of million over the prior year 
this decrease is a result of acquisition fees recognized in that did not occur in dispositions during  we sold nine shopping centers and one industrial property for million 
although the availability of debt financing for prospective acquirers has decreased in the current capital markets  we expect to continue to dispose of non core properties during as opportunities present themselves 
dispositions are part of an ongoing portfolio management process where we prune our portfolio of properties that do not meet our geographic or growth targets and provide capital to recycle into properties that have barrier to entry locations within high growth metropolitan markets 
over time  we expect this to produce a portfolio with higher occupancy rates and stronger internal revenue growth 

table of contents summary of critical accounting policies our discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities and contingencies as of the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods 
we evaluate our assumptions and estimates on an ongoing basis 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition rental revenue is generally recognized on a straight line basis over the life of the lease  which begins the date the leasehold improvements are substantially complete  if owned by us  or the date the tenant takes control of the space  if the leasehold improvements are owned by the tenant 
revenue from tenant reimbursements of taxes  maintenance expenses and insurance is recognized in the period the related expense is recognized 
revenue based on a percentage of tenants sales is recognized only after the tenant exceeds their sales breakpoint 
in addition  in circumstances where we would provide a tenant improvement allowance for improvements that are owned by the tenant  we would recognize the allowance as a reduction of rental revenue on a straight line basis over the term of the lease 
other revenue is income from contractual agreements with third parties  tenants or partially owned real estate joint ventures or partnerships  which is recognized as the related services are performed under the respective agreements 
real estate joint ventures and partnerships to determine the method of accounting for partially owned real estate joint ventures and partnerships  we first apply the guidelines set forth in financial accounting standards board fasb interpretation no 
r fin r  consolidation of variable interest entities 
entities identified as variable interest entities are consolidated if we are determined to be the primary beneficiary of the partially owned real estate joint venture or partnership 
partially owned real estate joint ventures and partnerships over which we exercise financial and operating control are consolidated in our financial statements 
in determining if we exercise financial and operating control  we consider factors such as ownership interest  authority to make decisions  kick out rights and substantive participating rights 
if there are changes in these factors  these reconsideration events are assessed to determine if the consolidation treatment remains appropriate 
management analyzes and assesses reconsideration events as soon as they become aware of them 
partially owned real estate joint ventures and partnerships where we have the ability to exercise significant influence  but do not exercise financial and operating control  are accounted for using the equity method 
decisions regarding consolidation of partially owned entities frequently require significant judgment by our management 
errors in the assessment of consolidation could result in material changes to our consolidated financial statements 
our investments in partially owned real estate joint ventures and partnerships are reviewed for impairment  periodically  if events or circumstances change indicating that the carrying amount of our investments may not be recoverable 
the ultimate realization of our investments in partially owned real estate joint ventures and partnerships is dependent on a number of factors  including the performance of each investment and market conditions 
we will record an impairment charge if we determine that a decline in the value of an investment is other than temporary 
this evaluation involves a considerable amount of judgment by our management 
our overall future plans for the investment  our investment partner s financial outlook and our views on current market and economic conditions may have a significant impact on the resulting factors analyzed for these purposes 

table of contents property real estate assets are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation 
depreciation is computed using the straight line method  generally over estimated useful lives of years for buildings and years for parking lot surfacing and equipment 
major replacements where the betterment extends the useful life of the asset are capitalized  and the replaced asset and corresponding accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts 
all other maintenance and repair items are charged to expense as incurred 
if we do not allocate these costs appropriately or incorrectly estimate the useful lives of our real estate  depreciation expense may be misstated 
acquisitions of properties are accounted for utilizing the purchase method and  accordingly  the results of operations of an acquired property are included in our results of operations from the date of acquisition 
we have used estimates of future cash flows and other valuation techniques to allocate the purchase price of acquired property among land  buildings on an as if vacant basis  tenant improvements and other identifiable intangibles 
current economic and operational property conditions  known trends and changes expected in current market conditions are considered in the estimates of future cash flows used for purchase price allocation purposes 
other identifiable intangible assets and liabilities include the effect of out of market leases  the value of having leases in place as is versus as if vacant and absorption costs  out of market assumed mortgages and tenant relationships 
depreciation and amortization is computed using the straight line method  generally over estimated useful lives of years for buildings and over the lease term which includes bargain renewal options for other identifiable intangible assets 
the impact of these estimates could result in significant differences related to the purchased assets  liabilities and resulting depreciation or amortization 
initial valuations are subject to change until such information is finalized  no later than months from the acquisition date 
the impact of incorrect estimates in connection with acquisition asset values and related estimated useful lives could be material to our consolidated financial statements 
property also includes costs incurred in the development of new operating properties and properties in our merchant development program 
merchant development is a new program in which we develop a project with the objective of selling all or part of it  instead of retaining it in our portfolio on a long term basis 
also  disposition of land parcels and non operating properties are included in this program 
these properties are carried at cost and no depreciation is recorded on these assets until the commencement of rental revenue or no later than one year from the completion of major construction 
these costs include pre acquisition costs directly identifiable with the specific project  development and construction costs  interest and real estate taxes 
indirect development costs  including salaries and benefits  travel and other related costs that are directly attributable to the development of the property  are also capitalized 
the capitalization of such costs ceases at the earlier of one year from the completion of major construction or when the property  or any completed portion  becomes available for occupancy 
the impact of the estimates related to the allocation of indirect costs and interest could result in incorrect estimates in connection with determining the asset value which could be material to our consolidated financial statements 
property also includes costs for tenant improvements paid by us  including reimbursements to tenants for improvements that are owned by us and will remain our property after the lease expires 
our properties are reviewed for impairment if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the property  including any identifiable intangible assets including site costs and capitalized interest  may not be recoverable 
in such an event  a comparison is made of the current and projected operating cash flows of each such property into the foreseeable future on an undiscounted basis to the carrying amount of such property 
fair values are also determined by obtaining third party broker and appraisal estimates 
in accordance with fasb s statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
sfas  accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  such carrying amount is adjusted  if necessary  to the estimated fair value to reflect an impairment in the value of the asset 
due to our analysis of current economic considerations at each reporting period  including the effects of tenant bankruptcies  lack of available funding and halt of tenant expansion plans for new development projects and declines in the real estate values  plans related to our new development properties including land held for development changed  and the use of these assets was no longer certain which brought about an impairment charge in determining whether a property is impaired and  if impaired  the amount of required write down to fair value requires a significant amount of judgment by management and is based on the best information available to management at the time of evaluation 
if market conditions continue to deteriorate or managements plans for certain properties change  additional write downs could be required in the future 

table of contents interest capitalization interest is capitalized on land under development and buildings under construction based on rates applicable to borrowings outstanding during the period and the weighted average balance of qualified assets under development construction during the period 
differences in methodologies to calculate applicable interest rates and the cost of qualified assets can yield significant differences in the amounts capitalized and  as a result  the amount of depreciation recognized 
deferred charges debt financing costs are amortized primarily on a straight line basis  which approximates the effective interest method  over the terms of the debt 
lease costs represent the initial direct costs incurred in origination  negotiation and processing of a lease agreement 
such costs include outside broker commissions and other independent third party costs  as well as salaries and benefits  travel and other internal costs directly related to completing a lease and are amortized over the life of the lease on a straight line basis 
costs related to supervision  administration  unsuccessful origination efforts and other activities not directly related to completed lease agreements are charged to expense as incurred 
differences in methodologies to calculate and defer these costs can yield differences in the amounts deferred and  accordingly  the amount of amortization recognized 
sales of real estate sales of real estate include the sale of shopping center pads  property adjacent to shopping centers  shopping center properties  merchant development properties  investments in real estate joint ventures and partnerships and partial sales to real estate joint ventures and partnerships in which we participate 
we recognize profit on sales of real estate  including merchant development sales  in accordance with fasb s sfas no 
sfas  accounting for sales of real estate 
profits are not recognized until a a sale is consummated  b the buyer s initial and continuing investments are adequate to demonstrate a commitment to pay  c the seller s receivable is not subject to future subordination  and d we have transferred to the buyer the usual risks and rewards of ownership in the transaction  and we do not have a substantial continuing involvement with the property 
a considerable amount of judgment by our management is used in this evaluation 
we recognize gains on the sale of real estate to joint ventures and partnerships in which we participate to the extent we receive cash from the joint venture or partnership  if it meets the sales criteria in accordance with sfas  and we do not have a commitment to support the operations of the real estate joint venture or partnership to an extent greater than our proportionate interest in the real estate joint venture or partnership 
accrued rent and accounts receivable receivable balances outstanding include base rents  tenant reimbursements and receivables attributable to the straight lining of rental commitments 
an allowance for the uncollectible portion of accrued rents and accounts receivable is determined based upon an analysis of balances outstanding  historical bad debt levels  tenant credit worthiness and current economic trends 
additionally  estimates of the expected recovery of pre petition and post petition claims with respect to tenants in bankruptcy are considered in assessing the collectibility of the related receivables 
as these factors change  the allowance is subject to revision and may impact our results of operations 
income taxes we have elected to be treated as a reit under the internal revenue code of  as amended 
as a reit  we generally will not be subject to corporate level federal income tax on taxable income we distribute to our shareholders 
to be taxed as a reit  we must meet a number of requirements including defined percentage tests concerning the amount of our assets and revenues that come from  or are attributable to  real estate operations 
as long as we distribute at least of the taxable income of the reit without regard to capital gains or the dividends paid deduction to our shareholders as dividends  we will not be taxed on the portion of our income we distribute as dividends 

table of contents the tax relief extension act of gave reits the ability to conduct activities which a reit was previously precluded from doing as long as such activities are performed in entities which have elected to be treated as taxable reit subsidiaries under the irs code 
these activities include buying or developing properties with the express purpose of selling them 
we conduct certain of these activities in taxable reit subsidiaries that we have created 
we calculate and record income taxes in our consolidated financial statements based on the activities in those entities 
we also record deferred taxes for the temporary tax differences that have resulted from those activities as required under sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
we use estimates in preparing our deferred tax amounts and if revised  these estimates could impact our results of operations

table of contents effects of inflation we have structured our leases in such a way as to remain largely unaffected should significant inflation occur 
most of the leases contain percentage rent provisions whereby we receive increased rentals based on the tenants gross sales 
many leases provide for increasing minimum rentals during the terms of the leases through escalation provisions 
in addition  many of our leases are for terms of less than years  which allow us to adjust rental rates to changing market conditions when the leases expire 
most of our leases also require the tenants to pay their proportionate share of operating expenses and ad valorem taxes 
as a result of these lease provisions  increases due to inflation  as well as ad valorem tax rate increases  generally do not have a significant adverse effect upon our operating results as they are absorbed by our tenants 
capital resources and liquidity our primary liquidity needs are payment of our common and preferred dividends  maintaining and operating our existing properties  payment of our debt service costs and funding planned growth 
although we anticipate that cash flows from operating activities primarily in the form of rental revenues will decline due to tenant bankruptcies and store closings  we believe operating activities will continue to provide adequate capital for common and preferred dividends  debt service costs and the capital necessary to maintain and operate our existing properties 
while we project our occupancy could drop to the level by mid year  the operating cash flow generated at that occupancy should remain adequate to provide capital for these liquidity needs 
while planned acquisitions are minimal  the primary sources of capital for funding any acquisitions and the new development program are our revolving credit facilities  cash generated from sale of properties and the formation of joint ventures  cash flow generated by our operating properties and proceeds from capital issuances  both debt and equity 
amounts outstanding under the revolving credit agreement are retired as needed with proceeds from the issuance of long term debt  common and preferred equity  cash generated from disposition of properties and cash flow generated by our operating properties 
as of december   the balance outstanding under our million revolving credit facility was million  and no amount was outstanding under our million credit facility  which we use for cash management purposes 
the current credit market turmoil has significantly affected our ability to obtain additional capital  however  we have been able to complete some transactions and continue to pursue additional sources of capital 
as described under investing activities and financing activities below  we completed have completed in the fourth quarter of a million common shares of beneficial interest equity offering  a joint venture that has provided million in cash  and a new million secured loan with a major life insurance company at a consolidated real estate joint venture 
we currently have two transactions in process including a million industrial joint venture and a million to million retail joint venture 
we have term sheets for a million secured loan with a major life insurance company and an unsecured term loan ranging from million to million 
we presently have million of dispositions under contract  none of which were deemed to be held for sale at december   and another million under letters of intent 
additionally  we have more than million of individual properties currently being marketed for sale 
there can be no assurance that these transactions can be completed as planned 
with billion in unencumbered properties  we have adequate assets to leverage or sell  to raise new capital 
our business plan reflects cost reductions  cutbacks in new development expenditures and no operational growth  it also is capable of fully funding all new development and other capital needs including the million of principal debt payments due in however  if unexpected events result in the need for additional capital  we have discretionary capital expenditures that could be deferred  if necessary 
in the event additional unexpected capital needs arise  we also have the ability to pay up to of our common share dividend in our common shares of beneficial interest  which would provide up to million of cash savings per quarter 
accordingly  we currently anticipate that our available cash resources and credit will be sufficient to meet our anticipated working capital  debt maturities and new development expenditures in 
table of contents if market conditions continue to deteriorate  we have the ability to delay the funding of discretionary capital expenditures 
also  without the availability of additional funds over the long term  we may not be able to respond to competitive pressures  or take advantage of unanticipated opportunities 
we believe we are currently in compliance with our debt covenants 
our most restrictive debt covenants including debt to assets  fixed charge and unencumbered interest coverage ratios  limit the amount of additional leverage we can add  however  we believe the sources of capital described above are adequate to execute our current business plan and remain in compliance with our debt covenants 
our capital structure also includes non recourse secured debt that we assume in conjunction with our acquisitions program 
we also have non recourse debt secured by acquired or developed properties held in several of our real estate joint ventures and partnerships 
we hedge the future cash flows of certain debt transactions  as well as changes in the fair value of our debt instruments  principally through interest rate swaps with major financial institutions 
we generally have the right to sell or otherwise dispose of our assets except in certain cases where we are required to obtain our joint venture partners consent or a third party consent for assets held in special purpose entities  which are owned by us

sfas  accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  our convertible senior unsecured notes totaling million  as of december   which are due  meet the scope exception requirements  whereby the notes embedded features are not considered and treated as a derivative instrument 
we currently anticipate that the scope exception in sfas will continue to be available for these instruments 
although we have not determined the financial impact  we believe there may be a material impact on our consolidated financial statements if these instruments were recorded 
we have entered into several unconsolidated real estate joint ventures and partnerships 
under many of these agreements  we and our joint venture partners are required to fund operating capital upon shortfalls in working capital 
we have also committed to funding the capital requirements of several new development joint ventures 
as operating manager of most of these entities  we have considered these funding requirements in our business plan 

table of contents reconsideration events could cause us to consolidate these joint ventures and partnerships 
we evaluate reconsideration events as we become aware of them 
some triggers to be considered are additional contributions required by each partner and each partners ability to make those contributions 
under certain of these circumstances  we may purchase our partner s interest 
many of our material unconsolidated real estate joint ventures are with entities which appear sufficiently stable to weather the current market crisis  however  if market conditions continue to deteriorate and our partners are unable to meet their commitments  there is a possibility we may have to consolidate these entities 
if we were to consolidate all of our unconsolidated real estate joint ventures  we would still be in compliance with our debt covenants  and we believe there would not be a material change in our credit ratings 
related to our investment in a redevelopment project in sheridan  colorado that is held in an unconsolidated real estate joint venture  we  our joint venture partner and the joint venture have each provided a guaranty for the payment of any debt service shortfalls on bonds issued in connection with the project 
the sheridan redevelopment agency issued million of series a bonds used for an urban renewal project 
the bonds are to be repaid with incremental sales and property taxes and a public improvement fee pif to be assessed on current and future retail sales 
the incremental taxes and pif are to remain intact until the bond liability has been paid in full  including any amounts we may have to provide 
at inception on february   we evaluated and determined that the fair value of the guaranty is nominal to us as the guarantor 
however  a liability has been recorded by the joint venture equal to amounts funded under the bonds 
in connection with the above project  we and our joint venture partner are also signatories to a completion guaranty that requires  among other things  certain infrastructure to be substantially completed and occupants of of the retail space to be open for regular business as of december  under specified circumstances  the completion guaranty allows for extension of the completion date until june  at inception on february   we evaluated the guaranty and determined that its then fair value was nominal 
by a letter dated december   the guarantors requested extension of the completion date pursuant to the terms of the guaranty 
on december   one of the parties benefited by the guaranty filed a lawsuit against us alleging that we were not entitled to the extension and is seeking million in liquidated damages together with other relief 
on february   we filed an answer and counterclaim in which we asserted  among other things  that we were entitled to the extension 
we have recorded a contingent liability of million as of december  based on our belief that we were entitled to the requested extension in december of  but that since completion under the guaranty is not anticipated to be achieved by june   a provision of the guaranty requiring redemption of a certain portion of the outstanding bonds may be triggered 
the contingent liability of million is based on a weighted probability analysis of potential outcomes 
since the million contingent liability would be funded through the joint venture and the joint venture would purchase the bonds  it has been recorded as an increase in our investment in real estate joint ventures and partnerships 
the increased basis in our investment did not result in an impairment to our investment in accordance to the accounting principles board s apb  the equity method of accounting for investments in common stock 
also in connection with the sheridan  colorado joint venture and the issuance of the related series a bonds  we  our joint venture partner and the joint venture have also provided a performance guaranty on behalf of the sheridan redevelopment agency for the satisfaction of all obligations arising from two interest rate swap agreements for the combined notional amount of million that matures in december we evaluated and determined that the fair value of the guaranty both at inception and december  was nominal 
in july  a owned unconsolidated real estate joint venture acquired an interest in a joint venture owning a  square foot new development to be constructed in aurora  colorado 
the acquired joint venture is a variable interest entity to the unconsolidated joint venture since it provided a guaranty on debt obtained by the acquired joint venture which was approximately million at december  we have evaluated and determined that the fair value of the guaranty both at inception and december  was nominal 
in august  we executed a real estate limited partnership with a foreign institutional investor to purchase up to million of retail properties in various states 
our ownership in this unconsolidated real estate limited partnership is 
as of december   no properties had been purchased 

table of contents funds from operations the national association of real estate investment trusts nareit defines ffo as net income loss available to common shareholders computed in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  excluding gains or losses from sales of operating real estate assets and extraordinary items  plus depreciation and amortization of operating properties  including our share of unconsolidated real estate joint ventures and partnerships 
we calculate ffo in a manner consistent with the nareit definition 
management uses ffo as a supplemental measure to conduct and evaluate our business because there are certain limitations associated with using gaap net income by itself as the primary measure of our operating performance 
historical cost accounting for real estate assets in accordance with gaap implicitly assumes that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time 
since real estate values instead have historically risen or fallen with market conditions  management believes that the presentation of operating results for real estate companies that uses historical cost accounting is insufficient by itself 
there can be no assurance that ffo presented by us is comparable to similarly titled measures of other reits 
ffo should not be considered as an alternative to net income or other measurements under gaap as an indicator of our operating performance or to cash flows from operating  investing or financing activities as a measure of liquidity 
ffo does not reflect working capital changes  cash expenditures for capital improvements or principal payments on indebtedness 
ffo is calculated as follows in thousands year ended december  net income available to common shareholders depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization of unconsolidated real estate joint ventures and partnerships gain on sale of properties gain on sale of properties of unconsolidated real estate joint ventures and partnerships funds from operations funds from operations attributable to operating partnership units funds from operations assuming conversion of operating partnership units weighted average shares outstanding basic effect of dilutive securities share options and awards operating partnership units weighted average shares outstanding diluted newly issued accounting pronouncements in september  the fasb issued sfas no 
sfas  fair value measurements 
this statement defines fair value and establishes a framework for measuring fair value in generally accepted accounting principles and expands disclosures about fair value measurements 
the key changes to current practice are the definition of fair value  which focuses on an exit price rather than an entry price  the methods used to measure fair value  such as emphasis that fair value is a market based measurement  not an entity specific measurement  as well as the inclusion of an adjustment for risk  restrictions and credit standing and the expanded disclosures about fair value measurements 
this statement does not require any new fair value measurements
