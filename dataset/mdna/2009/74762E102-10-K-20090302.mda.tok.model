risk factors our business is subject to a variety of risks and uncertainties  including  but not limited to  the risks and uncertainties described below 
the risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones facing our company 
additional risks and uncertainties not known to us or not described below also may impair our business operations 
if any of the following risks actually occur  our business  financial condition and results of operations could be harmed and we may not be able to achieve our goals 
this annual report on form k also includes statements reflecting assumptions  expectations  projections  intentions or beliefs about future events that are intended as forward looking statements under the private securities litigation reform act of and should be read in conjunction with the section entitled uncertainty of forward looking statements and information included in item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
our operating results may vary significantly from quarter to quarter 
we typically experience lower gross and operating margins during winter months due to lower demand for our services and more difficult operating conditions 
additionally  our quarterly results may be materially and adversely affected by variations in the margins of projects performed during any particular quarter  unfavorable regional  national or global economic and market conditions  a reduction in the demand for our services  the budgetary spending patterns of customers  increases in construction and design costs  the timing and volume of work we perform  the termination of existing agreements  losses experienced in our operations not otherwise covered by insurance  a change in the mix of our customers  contracts and business  payment risk associated with the financial condition of our customers  changes in bonding and lien requirements applicable to existing and new agreements  implementation of various information systems  which could temporarily disrupt day to day operations  the recognition of tax benefits related to uncertain tax positions  decreases in interest rates we receive on our cash and cash equivalents  changes in accounting pronouncements which require us to account for items differently than historical pronouncements have  
table of contents costs we incur to support growth internally or through acquisitions or otherwise  the timing and integration of acquisitions  and the timing and magnitude of acquisition costs  integration costs and potential goodwill impairments 
accordingly  our operating results in any particular quarter may not be indicative of the results that you can expect for any other quarter or for the entire year 
the recent economic downturn and the financial and credit crisis may adversely impact our customers future spending as well as payment for our services and  as a result  our operations and growth 
the growth in economic activity has slowed substantially  and the us economy is in a recessionary period 
it is uncertain when these conditions will improve 
stagnant or declining economic conditions may adversely impact the demand for our services and potentially result in the delay  reduction or cancellation of projects 
many of our customers finance their projects through cash flow from operations  the incurrence of debt or the issuance of equity 
the credit markets have also declined  and the availability of credit is constrained 
additionally  many of our customers equity values have substantially declined 
a reduction in cash flow and the lack of availability of debt or equity financing may result in a reduction in our customers spending for our services and may also impact the ability of our customers to pay amounts owed to us  which could have a material adverse effect on our operations and our ability to grow at historical levels 
an economic downturn in any of the industries we serve may lead to less demand for our services 
because the vast majority of our revenue is derived from a few industries  a downturn in any of those industries would adversely affect our results of operations 
specifically  an economic downturn in any industry we serve could result in the delay  reduction or cancellation of projects by our customers as well as cause our customers to outsource less work  resulting in decreased demand for our services 
the telecommunications and utility markets experienced substantial change during and as evidenced by an increased number of bankruptcies in the telecommunications market  continued devaluation of many of our customers debt and equity securities and pricing pressures resulting from challenges faced by major industry participants 
these factors contributed to the delay and cancellation of projects and reduction of capital spending  which impacted our operations and our ability to grow at historical levels 
a number of other factors  including financing conditions and potential bankruptcies in the industries we serve or a prolonged economic downturn or recession  could adversely affect our customers and their ability or willingness to fund capital expenditures in the future or pay for past services 
recently  our telecommunications and cable operations have been negatively impacted by reductions in spending due to the economic downturn and volatility in the capital markets 
we have seen a significant slow down in fttp and fttn deployment from customers such as at t and verizon since the second quarter of  and we anticipate this slow down will likely continue if economic conditions remain stagnant or further deteriorate 
we have also seen reduced spending in electric distribution due to capital expenditure reductions 
additionally  our gas distribution installation business  which is driven in part by the housing construction market  has decreased  and continued declines in new housing construction could cause further reductions in this business 
another area of our natural gas business gas gathering and pipeline installation and maintenance has also declined  which we believe is due to lower natural gas prices and capital constraints on spending by our customers 
consolidation  competition  capital constraints or negative economic conditions in the electric power  gas  telecommunications or cable television industries may also result in reduced spending by  or the loss of  one or more of our customers 
project delays or cancellations may result in additional costs to us  reductions in revenues or the payment of liquidated damages 
in certain circumstances  we guarantee project completion by a scheduled acceptance date or achievement of certain acceptance and performance testing levels 
failure to meet any of those schedules or performance requirements could result in additional costs or penalties  including liquidated damages  and such amounts could exceed expected project profit 
many projects involve challenging engineering  procurement and construction phases that may occur over extended time periods  sometimes over several years 
we may 
table of contents encounter difficulties in engineering  delays in designs or materials provided by the customer or a third party  equipment and material delivery  schedule changes  delays from our customer s failure to timely obtain rights of way  weather related delays and other factors  some of which are beyond our control  that impact our ability to complete the project in accordance with the original delivery schedule 
for example  the recent increase in demand for transmission services has strained production resources  creating significant lead times for obtaining large transformers  transmission towers and poles 
as a result  electric transmission project revenues could be significantly reduced or delayed due to the difficulty we or our customers may experience in obtaining required materials 
in addition  we occasionally contract with third party subcontractors to assist us with the completion of contracts 
any delay by suppliers or by subcontractors in the completion of their portion of the project  or any failure by a subcontractor to satisfactorily complete its portion of the project may result in delays in the overall progress of the project or may cause us to incur additional costs  or both 
we also may encounter project delays due to local opposition  which may include injunctive actions as well as public protests  to the siting of transmission lines or other facilities 
delays and additional costs may be substantial and  in some cases  we may be required to compensate the customer for such delays 
we may not be able to recover all of such costs 
in extreme cases  the above mentioned factors could cause project cancellations  and we may not be able to replace such projects with similar projects or at all 
such delays or cancellations may impact our reputation or relationships with customers  adversely affecting our ability to secure new contracts 
project contracts may require customers or other parties to provide the design  engineering information  equipment or materials to be used on a project 
in some cases  the project schedule or the design  engineering information  equipment or materials may be deficient or delivered later than required by the project schedule 
our customers may change or delay various elements of the project after its commencement  resulting in additional direct or indirect costs 
under these circumstances  we generally negotiate with the customer with respect to the amount of additional time required and the compensation to be paid to us 
we are subject to the risk that we may be unable to obtain  through negotiation  arbitration  litigation or otherwise  adequate amounts to compensate us for the additional work or expenses incurred by us due to customer requested change orders or failure by the customer to timely deliver items  such as engineering drawings or materials  required to be provided by the customer 
litigation or arbitration of claims for compensation may be lengthy and costly  and it is often difficult to predict when and for how much the claims will be resolved 
a failure to obtain adequate compensation for these matters could require us to record a reduction to amounts of revenue and gross profit recognized in prior periods under the percentage of completion accounting method 
any such adjustments could be substantial 
we may also be required to invest significant working capital to fund cost overruns while the resolution of claims is pending  which could adversely affect liquidity and financial results in any given period 
we may be unsuccessful at generating internal growth 
our ability to generate internal growth will be affected by  among other factors  our ability to expand the range of services we offer to customers to address their evolving network needs  attract new customers  increase the number of projects performed for existing customers  hire and retain qualified employees  expand geographically  including internationally  and address the challenges presented by difficult economic or market conditions that may affect us or our customers 
in addition  our customers may delay  reduce or cancel the number or size of projects available to us due to their inability to obtain capital or pay for services provided  the risk of which has become heightened in light of the recent economic downturn 
many of the factors affecting our ability to generate internal growth may be beyond our control  and we cannot be certain that our strategies will be successful or that we will be 
table of contents able to generate cash flow sufficient to fund our operations and to support internal growth 
if we are unsuccessful  we may not be able to achieve internal growth of our business or expand our operations 
our use of fixed price contracts could adversely affect our business 
we currently generate  and expect to continue to generate  a portion of our revenues under fixed price contracts 
we must estimate the costs of completing a particular project to bid for fixed price contracts 
the actual cost of labor and materials  however  may vary from the costs we originally estimated 
these variations  along with other risks inherent in performing fixed price contracts  may cause actual revenue and gross profits for a project to differ from those we originally estimated and could result in reduced profitability or losses on projects 
depending upon the size of a particular project  variations from the estimated contract costs could have a significant impact on our operating results for any fiscal quarter or year 
our use of percentage of completion accounting could result in a reduction or elimination of previously reported profits 
as discussed in item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations critical accounting policies and in the notes to our consolidated financial statements included in item hereof  a significant portion of our revenues are recognized using the percentage of completion method of accounting  utilizing the cost to cost method 
this method is used because management considers expended costs to be the best available measure of progress on these contracts 
this accounting method is generally accepted for fixed price contracts 
the percentage of completion accounting practice we use results in our recognizing contract revenues and earnings ratably over the contract term in proportion to our incurrence of contract costs 
the earnings or losses recognized on individual contracts are based on estimates of contract revenues  costs and profitability 
contract losses are recognized in full when determined to be probable and reasonably estimatable  and contract profit estimates are adjusted based on ongoing reviews of contract profitability 
further  a substantial portion of our contracts contain various cost and performance incentives 
penalties are recorded when known or finalized  which generally occurs during the latter stages of the contract 
in addition  we record cost recovery claims when we believe recovery is probable and the amounts can be reasonably estimated 
actual collection of claims could differ from estimated amounts and could result in a reduction or elimination of previously recognized earnings 
in certain circumstances  it is possible that such adjustments could be significant 
our industry is highly competitive 
our industry is served by numerous small  owner operated private companies  some public companies and several large regional companies 
in addition  relatively few barriers prevent entry into some of our industries 
as a result  any organization that has adequate financial resources and access to technical expertise may become one of our competitors 
competition in the industry depends on a number of factors  including price 
certain of our competitors may have lower overhead cost structures and  therefore  may be able to provide their services at lower rates than we are able to provide 
in addition  some of our competitors have significant resources including financial  technical and marketing resources 
we cannot be certain that our competitors will not develop the expertise  experience and resources to provide services that are superior in both price and quality to our services 
similarly  we cannot be certain that we will be able to maintain or enhance our competitive position within our industry or maintain our customer base at current levels 
we also may face competition from the in house service organizations of our existing or prospective customers 
electric power  gas  telecommunications and cable television service providers usually employ personnel who perform some of the same types of services we do 
we cannot be certain that our existing or prospective customers will continue to outsource services in the future 
legislative actions and incentives relating to electric power and renewable energy may fail to result in increased demand for our services 
implementation of the energy act is still subject to considerable fiscal and regulatory uncertainty 
regulations implementing the components of the energy act that may affect demand for our services remain 
table of contents in some cases subject to review in various federal courts 
in one such case  decided in february  a federal court of appeals vacated ferc s interpretation of the scope of its backstop siting authority 
accordingly  the effect of these regulations  once finally implemented  is uncertain 
as a result  the legislation may not result in increased spending on the electric power transmission infrastructure 
continued uncertainty regarding the implementation of the energy act may result in slower growth in demand for our services 
in addition  changes to energy regulatory policy may be forthcoming due to the new administration 
demand for our services also may not result from renewable energy initiatives or the arra 
while states currently have mandates in place that require certain percentages of power to be generated from renewable sources  states could reduce those mandates or make them optional  which would reduce  delay or eliminate renewable energy development in the affected states 
additionally  renewable energy is generally more expensive to produce and may require additional power generation sources as backup 
the locations of renewable energy projects are often remote and are not viable unless connectivity to the grid to transport the power to demand centers is economically feasible 
furthermore  funding for renewable energy initiatives may not be available  which may be further constrained as a result of turbulent credit markets 
these factors could result in fewer renewable energy projects than anticipated or a delay in the timing of construction of these projects and the related infrastructure  which would negatively affect the demand for our services 
in addition  we cannot predict when programs under the arra will be implemented or the timing and scope of any investments to be made under these programs 
investments for renewable energy  electric power infrastructure and telecommunications fiber deployment under arra programs may not occur  may be less than anticipated or may be delayed  which would negatively impact demand for our services 
many of our contracts may be canceled on short notice or may not be renewed upon completion or expiration  and we may be unsuccessful in replacing our contracts in such events 
we could experience a decrease in our revenue  net income and liquidity if any of the following occur our customers cancel a significant number of contracts or contracts having significant value  we fail to win a significant number of our existing contracts upon re bid  we complete a significant number of non recurring projects and cannot replace them with similar projects  or we fail to reduce operating and overhead expenses consistent with any decrease in our revenue 
many of our customers may cancel our contracts on short notice  typically days  even if we are not in default under the contract 
certain of our customers assign work to us on a project by project basis under master service agreements 
under these agreements  our customers often have no obligation to assign a specific amount of work to us 
our operations could decline significantly if the anticipated volume of work is not assigned to us  which may be more likely if customer spending decreases  for example  due to the economic downturn 
many of our contracts  including our master service agreements  are opened to public bid at the expiration of their terms 
there can be no assurance that we will be the successful bidder on our existing contracts that come up for re bid 
our business is labor intensive  and we may be unable to attract and retain qualified employees 
our ability to maintain our productivity and profitability will be limited by our ability to employ  train and retain skilled personnel necessary to meet our requirements 
we cannot be certain that we will be able to maintain an adequate skilled labor force necessary to operate efficiently and to support our growth strategy 
for instance  we may experience shortages of qualified journeyman linemen 
in addition  we cannot be certain that our labor expenses will not increase as a result of a shortage in the supply of these skilled personnel 
labor shortages or increased labor costs could impair our ability to maintain our business or grow our revenues 

table of contents backlog may not be realized or may not result in profits 
backlog is difficult to determine with certainty 
customers often have no obligation under our contracts to assign or release work to us  and many contracts may be terminated on short notice 
reductions in backlog due to cancellation of one or more contracts by a customer or for other reasons could significantly reduce the revenue and profit we actually receive from contracts included in backlog 
in the event of a project cancellation  we may be reimbursed for certain costs but typically have no contractual right to the total revenues reflected in our backlog 
the backlog we obtain in connection with any companies we acquire may not be as large as we believed or may not result in the revenue or profits we expected 
in addition  projects may remain in backlog for extended periods of time 
all of these uncertainties are heightened as a result of negative economic conditions and their impact on our customers spending 
consequently  we cannot assure you that our estimates of backlog are accurate or that we will be able to realize our estimated backlog 
our financial results are based upon estimates and assumptions that may differ from actual results 
in preparing our consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  several estimates and assumptions are used by management in determining the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  revenues and expenses recognized during the periods presented and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities known to exist as of the date of the financial statements 
these estimates and assumptions must be made because certain information that is used in the preparation of our financial statements is dependent on future events  cannot be calculated with a high degree of precision from data available or is not capable of being readily calculated based on generally accepted methodologies 
in some cases  these estimates are particularly difficult to determine and we must exercise significant judgment 
estimates are primarily used in our assessment of the allowance for doubtful accounts  valuation of inventory  useful lives of property and equipment  fair value assumptions in analyzing goodwill and long lived asset impairments  self insured claims liabilities  forfeiture estimates relating to stock based compensation  revenue recognition under percentage of completion accounting and provision for income taxes 
actual results for all estimates could differ materially from the estimates and assumptions that we use  which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
factors beyond our control may affect our ability to successfully execute our acquisition strategy  which may have an adverse impact on our growth strategy 
our business strategy includes expanding our presence in the industries we serve through strategic acquisitions of companies that complement or enhance our business 
we expect to face competition for acquisition opportunities  and some of our competitors may have access to financing on more favorable terms than us or have greater financial resources 
this competition may limit our acquisition opportunities and our ability to grow through acquisitions or could raise the prices of acquisitions and make them less accretive or possibly non accretive to us 
acquisitions that we may pursue may also involve significant cash expenditures  debt incurrence or the issuance of securities 
any acquisition may ultimately have a negative impact on our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
we may be unsuccessful at integrating companies that either we have acquired or that we may acquire in the future 
as a part of our business strategy  we have acquired  and seek to acquire in the future  companies that complement or enhance our business 
however  we cannot be sure that we will be able to successfully integrate each of these companies with our existing operations without substantial costs  delays or other operational or financial problems 
if we do not implement proper overall business controls  our decentralized operating strategy could result in inconsistent operating and financial practices at the companies we acquire and our overall profitability could be adversely affected 
integrating our acquired companies involves a number of special risks which could have a negative impact on our business  financial condition and results of operations  including failure of acquired companies to achieve the results we expect  
table of contents diversion of our management s attention from operational and other matters  difficulties integrating the operations and personnel of acquired companies  inability to retain key personnel of acquired companies  risks associated with unanticipated events or liabilities  loss of business due to customer overlap  risks arising from the prior operations of acquired companies  such as performance  safety or workforce issues  and potential disruptions of our business 
if one of our acquired companies suffers or has suffered customer dissatisfaction  performance problems or operational issues  the reputation of our entire company could suffer 
our results of operations could be adversely affected as a result of goodwill impairments 
when we acquire a business  we record an asset called goodwill equal to the excess amount we pay for the business  including liabilities assumed  over the fair value of the tangible and intangible assets of the business we acquire 
for example  in connection with the merger  we recorded approximately million in goodwill and million of intangible assets based on the application of purchase accounting 
statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
provides that goodwill and other intangible assets that have indefinite useful lives not be amortized  but instead be tested at least annually for impairment  and intangible assets that have finite useful lives continue to be amortized over their useful lives 
sfas no 
provides specific guidance for testing goodwill and other non amortized intangible assets for impairment 
sfas no 
requires management to make certain estimates and assumptions when allocating goodwill to reporting units and determining the fair value of a reporting unit s net assets and liabilities  including  among other things  an assessment of market conditions  projected cash flows  investment rates  cost of capital and growth rates  which could significantly impact the reported value of goodwill and other intangible assets 
fair value is determined using a combination of the discounted cash flow  market multiple and market capitalization valuation approaches 
absent any impairment indicators  we perform our impairment tests annually during the fourth quarter 
if there is a decrease in market capitalization below book value in the future  this may be considered an impairment indicator 
as part of our annual test for goodwill impairment  goodwill in the amount of million was written off as a non cash operating expense associated with a decrease in the expected future demand for the services of one of our businesses  which has historically served the cable television industry 
any future impairments  including impairments of the goodwill or intangible assets recorded in connection with the merger  would negatively impact our results of operations for the period in which the impairment is recognized 
our profitability and financial operations may be negatively affected by changes in  or interpretations of  existing state or federal telecommunications regulations or new regulations that could adversely affect our dark fiber segment 
in connection with the merger  we acquired infrasource s dark fiber licensing business 
many of the dark fiber customers benefit from the universal service e rate program  which was established by congress in the telecommunications act and is administered by the universal service administrative company usac under the oversight of the federal communications commission fcc 
under the e rate program  schools  libraries and certain health care facilities may receive subsidies for certain approved telecommunications services  internet access and internal connections 
from time to time  bills have been introduced in congress that would eliminate or curtail the e rate program 
passage of such actions by the fcc or usac to further limit e rate subsidies could decrease the demand for telecommunications infrastructure services by certain customers 
the telecommunications services we provide through our dark fiber licensing business are subject to regulation by the fcc  to the extent that they are interstate telecommunications services  and by state 
table of contents regulatory agencies  when wholly within a particular state 
to remain eligible to provide services under the e rate program  we must maintain telecommunications authorizations in every state where we operate  and we must obtain such authorizations in any new state where we plan to operate 
changes in federal or state regulations could reduce the profitability of our dark fiber licensing business  and delays in obtaining new authorizations could inhibit our ability to grow our dark fiber business in new geographic areas 
we could be subject to fines if the fcc or a state regulatory agency were to determine that any of our activities or positions are not in compliance with certain regulations 
if the profitability of our dark fiber licensing business were to decline  or if this business were to become subject to fines  our results of operations could also be adversely affected 
our dark fiber licensing business is capital intensive and requires a substantial investment before returns can be realized 
our dark fiber licensing business requires substantial amounts of capital investment to build out new fiber networks 
in  our proposed capital expenditures for our dark fiber licensing business is approximately million  million of which is related to committed licensing arrangements as of december  although we do not commit capital to new networks until we have a committed license arrangement in place with at least one customer  we may not be able to recoup our initial investment in the network if that customer defaults on its commitment 
even if the customer does not default or we add additional customers to the network  we still may not realize a return on the capital investment for an extended period of time 
additionally  new or developing technologies could negatively impact our dark fiber licensing business 
if any of the above events occur  it could result in an impairment of our dark fiber network 
we extend credit to customers for purchases of our services  and in the past we have had  and in the future we may have  difficulty collecting receivables from major customers that have filed for bankruptcy or are otherwise experiencing financial difficulties 
we grant credit  generally without collateral  to our customers  which include electric power and gas companies  telecommunications and cable television system operators  governmental entities  general contractors  and builders  owners and managers of commercial and industrial properties located primarily in the united states 
consequently  we are subject to potential credit risk related to changes in business and economic factors throughout the united states 
in the past  our customers in the telecommunications business have experienced significant financial difficulties and in several instances have filed for bankruptcy 
a number of our utility customers have also experienced financial and business challenges in the past 
in addition  some of our customers are currently experiencing financial difficulties as a result of the recent economic downturn 
if additional major customers file for bankruptcy or continue to experience financial difficulties  or if anticipated recoveries relating to receivables in existing bankruptcies or other workout situations fail to materialize  we could experience reduced cash flows and losses in excess of current allowances provided 
in addition  material changes in any of our customer s revenues or cash flows could affect our ability to collect amounts due from them 
we are self insured against potential liabilities 
although we maintain insurance policies with respect to employer s liability  general liability  automobile and workers compensation claims  those policies are subject to deductibles ranging from million to million per occurrence depending on the insurance policy 
we are primarily self insured for all claims that do not exceed the amount of the applicable deductible 
additionally  we are subject to an annual cumulative aggregate liability of up to million on workers compensation claims in excess of million per occurrence 
we also have employee health care benefit plans for most employees not subject to collective bargaining agreements  of which the primary plan is subject to a deductible of  per claimant per year 
losses under all of these insurance programs are accrued based upon our estimates of the ultimate liability for claims reported and an estimate of claims incurred but not reported  with assistance from third party actuaries 
these insurance liabilities are difficult to assess and estimate due to unknown factors  including the severity of an injury  the determination of our liability in proportion to other parties  the number 
table of contents of incidents not reported and the effectiveness of our safety program 
the accruals are based upon known facts and historical trends and management believes such accruals to be adequate 
if we were to experience insurance claims or costs significantly above our estimates  our results of operations could be materially and adversely affected in a given period 
our casualty insurance carrier for the policy periods from august  to february  has experienced financial distress 
effective september   quanta consummated a novation transaction that released this distressed casualty insurance carrier for the policy periods august  to february  from all further obligations in connection with the policies in effect during that period in exchange for the payment to us of an agreed amount 
our current casualty insurance carrier assumed all obligations under the policies in effect during that period  however  we are obligated to indemnify the carrier in full for any liabilities under the policies assumed 
at december   we estimated that the total future claim amounts associated with the novated policies was million  based on an estimate of the potential range of these future claim amounts at december  of between million and million 
the actual amounts ultimately paid by us in connection with these claims  if any  could vary materially from the above range and could be impacted by further claims development 
our unionized workforce and related obligations could adversely affect our operations 
as of december   approximately of our hourly employees were covered by collective bargaining agreements 
although the majority of these agreements prohibit strikes and work stoppages  we cannot be certain that strikes or work stoppages will not occur in the future 
strikes or work stoppages would adversely impact our relationships with our customers and could cause us to lose business and decrease our revenue 
additionally  many of these agreements require us to participate with other companies in multi employer pension plans 
to the extent those plans are underfunded  the employee retirement income security act of  as amended by the multi employer pension plan amendments act of  may subject us to substantial liabilities under those plans if we withdraw from them or they are terminated 
furthermore  the pension protection act of added new funding rules generally applicable to plan years beginning after for multi employer plans that are classified as endangered  seriously endangered  or critical status 
for a plan in critical status  additional required contributions or benefit reductions may apply if a plan is determined to be underfunded 
our ability to complete future acquisitions could be adversely affected because of our union status for a variety of reasons 
for instance  our union agreements may be incompatible with the union agreements of a business we want to acquire and some businesses may not want to become affiliated with a union based company 
additionally  we may increase our exposure to withdrawal liabilities for underfunded multi employer pension plans to which an acquired company contributes 
approximately of our hourly employees are not unionized 
the new presidential administration has expressed strong support for proposed legislation that would create more flexibility and opportunity for labor unions to organize non union workers 
if passed  this legislation could result in a greater percentage of our workforce being subject to collective bargaining agreements  heightening the risks described above 
in addition  certain of our customers require or prefer a non union workforce  and they may reduce the amount of work assigned to us if our labor crews were to become unionized 
we may incur liabilities or suffer negative financial or reputational impacts relating to occupational health and safety matters 
our operations are subject to extensive laws and regulations relating to the maintenance of safe conditions in the workplace 
while we have invested  and will continue to invest  substantial resources in our occupational health and safety programs  our industry involves a high degree of operational risk and there can be no assurance that we will avoid significant liability exposure 
although we have taken what we believe are appropriate precautions  we have suffered fatalities in the past and may suffer additional fatalities in the future 

table of contents serious accidents  including fatalities  may subject us to substantial penalties  civil litigation or criminal prosecution 
claims for damages to persons  including claims for bodily injury or loss of life  could result in substantial costs and liabilities  which could materially and adversely affect our financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
in addition  if our safety record were to substantially deteriorate over time or we were to suffer substantial penalties or criminal prosecution for violation of health and safety regulations  our customers could cancel our contracts and not award us future business 
our dependence on suppliers  subcontractors and equipment manufacturers could expose us to the risk of loss in our operations 
on certain projects  we rely on suppliers to obtain the necessary materials and subcontractors to perform portions of our services 
we also rely on equipment manufacturers to provide us with the equipment required to conduct our operations 
although we are not dependent on any single supplier  subcontractor or equipment manufacturer  any substantial limitation on the availability of required suppliers  subcontractors or equipment manufacturers could negatively impact our operations 
the risk of a lack of available suppliers  subcontractors or equipment manufacturers is heightened under the current turbulent market conditions and economic downturn 
to the extent we cannot engage subcontractors or acquire equipment or materials  we could experience losses in the performance of our operations 
our business growth could outpace the capability of our corporate management infrastructure 
we cannot be certain that our infrastructure will be adequate to support our operations as they expand 
future growth also could impose significant additional responsibilities on members of our senior management  including the need to recruit and integrate new senior level managers and executives 
we cannot be certain that we will be able to recruit and retain such additional managers and executives 
to the extent that we are unable to manage our growth effectively  or are unable to attract and retain additional qualified management  we may not be able to expand our operations or execute our business plan 
during the ordinary course of our business  we may become subject to lawsuits or indemnity claims  which could materially and adversely affect our business and results of operations 
we have in the past been  and may in the future be  named as a defendant in lawsuits  claims and other legal proceedings during the ordinary course of our business 
these actions may seek  among other things  compensation for alleged personal injury  workers compensation  employment discrimination  breach of contract  property damage  punitive damages  civil penalties or other losses or injunctive or declaratory relief 
in addition  we generally indemnify our customers for claims related to the services we provide and actions we take under our contracts with them  and  in some instances  we may be allocated risk through our contract terms for actions by our customers or other third parties 
because our services in certain instances may be integral to the operation and performance of our customers infrastructure  we may become subject to lawsuits or claims for any failure of the systems that we work on  even if our services are not the cause of such failures  and we could be subject to civil and criminal liabilities to the extent that our services contributed to any property damage  personal injury or system failure 
the outcome of any of these lawsuits  claims or legal proceedings could result in significant costs and diversion of management s attention to the business 
payments of significant amounts  even if reserved  could adversely affect our reputation  liquidity and results of operations 
we may not realize all of the anticipated synergies and other benefits from acquiring infrasource 
the success of the merger will depend  in part  on our ability to realize the synergies and other benefits from acquiring infrasource 
to realize these synergies and benefits  however  we must continue to successfully integrate the operations and personnel of infrasource into our business 
we have substantially completed the integration of the two companies  but further integration may be required to fully realize the benefits of the merger 
if this continuing integration is unsuccessful  certain anticipated benefits of the merger may not be realized fully or at all  may take longer or cost more to realize than expected 
because we and infrasource have previously operated as independent companies  it is possible the integration may result in the future loss 
table of contents of valuable employees  the disruption of our business or inconsistencies in standards  controls  procedures  practices  policies and compensation arrangements 
the size of the merger may also make integration difficult  expensive and disruptive  adversely affecting our revenues and earnings 
a portion of our business depends on our ability to provide surety bonds 
we may be unable to compete for or work on certain projects if we are not able to obtain the necessary surety bonds 
current or future market conditions  including losses incurred in the construction industry or as a result of large corporate bankruptcies  as well as changes in our sureties assessment of our operating and financial risk  could cause our surety providers to decline to issue or renew  or substantially reduce the amount of  bonds for our work and could increase our bonding costs 
these actions could be taken on short notice 
if our surety providers were to limit or eliminate our access to bonding  our alternatives would include seeking bonding capacity from other sureties  finding more business that does not require bonds and posting other forms of collateral for project performance  such as letters of credit or cash 
we may be unable to secure these alternatives in a timely manner  on acceptable terms  or at all  which could affect our ability to bid for or work on future projects requiring financial assurances 
we have also granted security interests in various of our assets to collateralize our obligations to our sureties 
furthermore  under standard terms in the surety market  sureties issue or continue bonds on a project by project basis and can decline to issue bonds at any time or require the posting of additional collateral as a condition to issuing or renewing any bonds 
if we were to experience an interruption or reduction in the availability of bonding capacity as a result of these or any other reasons  we may be unable to compete for or work on certain projects that would require bonding 
the departure of key personnel could disrupt our business 
we depend on the continued efforts of our executive officers and on senior management of our operating units  including the businesses we acquire 
although we have entered into employment agreements with terms of one to three years with most of our executive officers and certain other key employees  we cannot be certain that any individual will continue in such capacity for any particular period of time 
the loss of key personnel  or the inability to hire and retain qualified employees  could negatively impact our ability to manage our business 
we do not carry key person life insurance on any of our employees 
we are in the process of implementing an information technology it solution  which could temporarily disrupt day to day operations at certain operating units 
we have begun to design a comprehensive it solution that we believe will allow for a seamless interface between functions such as accounting and finance  human resources  operations  fleet management and customer relationships 
development and implementation of the it solution will require substantial financial and personnel resources 
implementation will occur on an operating unit by operating unit basis 
while the it solution is intended to improve and enhance our information systems  implementation of new information systems at each operating unit exposes us to the risks of start up of the new system and integration of that system with our existing systems and processes  including possible disruption of our financial reporting 
failure to properly implement the it solution could result in substantial disruptions to our business  including coordinating and processing our normal business activities  testing and recording of certain data necessary to provide oversight over our disclosure controls and procedures and effective internal controls over our financial reporting  and other unforeseen problems 
we may not be successful in continuing to meet the requirements of the sarbanes oxley act of the sarbanes oxley act of has many requirements applicable to us regarding corporate governance and financial reporting  including the requirements for management to report on our internal controls over financial reporting and for our independent registered public accounting firm to express an opinion over the operating effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting 
during  we continued actions to ensure our ability to comply with these requirements 
as of december   our internal control over 
table of contents financial reporting was effective  however  there can be no assurance that our internal control over financial reporting will be effective in future years 
failure to maintain effective internal controls or the identification of significant internal control deficiencies in acquisitions already made or made in the future could result in a decrease in the market value of our common stock and our other publicly traded securities  the reduced ability to obtain financing  the loss of customers  penalties and additional expenditures to meet the requirements 
our failure to comply with environmental laws could result in significant liabilities 
our operations are subject to various environmental laws and regulations  including those dealing with the handling and disposal of waste products  pcbs  fuel storage and air quality 
we perform work in many different types of underground environments 
if the field location maps supplied to us are not accurate  or if objects are present in the soil that are not indicated on the field location maps  our underground work could strike objects in the soil  some of which may contain pollutants 
these objects may also rupture  resulting in the discharge of pollutants 
in such circumstances  we may be liable for fines and damages  and we may be unable to obtain reimbursement from the parties providing the incorrect information 
in addition  we perform directional drilling operations below certain environmentally sensitive terrains and water bodies 
due to the inconsistent nature of the terrain and water bodies  it is possible that such directional drilling may cause a surface fracture  resulting in the release of subsurface materials 
these subsurface materials may contain contaminants in excess of amounts permitted by law  potentially exposing us to remediation costs and fines 
we also own and lease several facilities at which we store our equipment 
some of these facilities contain fuel storage tanks which are above or below ground 
if these tanks were to leak  we could be responsible for the cost of remediation as well as potential fines 
in addition  new laws and regulations  stricter enforcement of existing laws and regulations  the discovery of previously unknown contamination or leaks  or the imposition of new clean up requirements could require us to incur significant costs or become the basis for new or increased liabilities that could negatively impact our financial condition and results of operations 
in certain instances  we have obtained indemnification or covenants from third parties including predecessors or lessors for such cleanup and other obligations and liabilities that we believe are adequate to cover such obligations and liabilities 
however  such third party indemnities or covenants may not cover all of our costs  and such unanticipated obligations or liabilities  or future obligations and liabilities  may have a material adverse effect on our business operations  financial condition or cash flows 
further  we cannot be certain that we will be able to identify or be indemnified for all potential environmental liabilities relating to any acquired business 
risks associated with operating in international markets could restrict our ability to expand globally and harm our business and prospects 
while only a small percentage of our revenue is currently derived from international markets  we hope to continue to expand the volume of services that we provide internationally 
we presently conduct our international sales efforts in canada  mexico and select countries overseas  but expect that the number of countries that we operate in could expand significantly over the next few years 
economic conditions  including those resulting from wars  civil unrest  acts of terrorism and other conflicts or volatility in the global markets  may adversely affect our customers  their demand for our services and their ability to pay for our services 
in addition  there are numerous risks inherent in conducting our business internationally  including  but not limited to  potential instability in international markets  changes in regulatory requirements applicable to international operations  currency fluctuations in foreign countries  political  economic and social conditions in foreign countries and complex us and foreign laws and treaties  including tax laws and the us foreign corrupt practices act 
these risks could restrict our ability to provide services to international customers and could adversely affect our ability to operate our business profitably 
opportunities within the government arena could subject us to increased governmental regulation and costs 
most government contracts are awarded through a regulated competitive bidding process 
as we pursue increased opportunities in the government arena  management s focus associated with the start up and bidding process may be diverted away from other opportunities 
involvement with government contracts could require 
table of contents a significant amount of costs to be incurred before any revenues are realized from these contracts 
in addition  as a government contractor  we are subject to a number of procurement rules and other public sector liabilities  any deemed violation of which could lead to fines or penalties or a loss of business 
government agencies routinely audit and investigate government contractors 
government agencies may review a contractor s performance under its contracts  cost structure  and compliance with applicable laws  regulations and standards 
if government agencies determine through these audits or reviews that costs were improperly allocated to specific contracts  they will not reimburse the contractor for those costs or may require the contractor to refund previously reimbursed costs 
if government agencies determine that we engaged in improper activity  we may be subject to civil and criminal penalties 
in addition  if the government were to even allege improper activity  we also could experience serious harm to our reputation 
many government contracts must be appropriated each year 
if appropriations are not made in subsequent years we would not realize all of the potential revenues from any awarded contracts 
the industries we serve are subject to rapid technological and structural changes that could reduce the demand for the services we provide 
the electric power  gas  telecommunications and cable television industries are undergoing rapid change as a result of technological advances that could  in certain cases  reduce the demand for our services  impair the value of our dark fiber network or otherwise negatively impact our business 
new or developing technologies could displace the wireline systems used for voice  video and data transmissions  and improvements in existing technology may allow telecommunications and cable television companies to significantly improve their networks without physically upgrading them 
we may not have access in the future to sufficient funding to finance desired growth and operations 
if we cannot secure additional financing in the future on acceptable terms  we may be unable to support our growth strategy or future operations 
we cannot readily predict the ability of certain customers to pay for past services  and the recent economic downturn may negatively impact the ability of our customers to pay amounts owed to us 
we also cannot readily predict the timing  size and success of our acquisition efforts 
using cash for acquisitions limits our financial flexibility and makes us more likely to seek additional capital through future debt or equity financings 
our existing credit facility contains significant restrictions on our operational and financial flexibility  including our ability to incur additional debt or conduct equity financings  and if we seek more debt we may have to agree to additional covenants that limit our operational and financial flexibility 
when we seek additional debt or equity financings  we cannot be certain that additional debt or equity will be available to us on terms acceptable to us or at all  in particular under the current volatile market conditions 
furthermore  our credit facility is based upon existing commitments from several banks 
with the current turbulent credit markets  banks have become more restrictive in their lending practices  and some may be unable or unwilling to fund their commitments  which may limit our access to the capital needed to fund our growth and operations 
we also rely on financing companies to fund the leasing of certain of our trucks and trailers  support vehicles and specialty construction equipment 
the deteriorating credit market may cause certain of these financing companies to restrict or withhold access to capital to fund the leasing of additional equipment 
although we are not dependent on any single equipment lessor  a widespread lack of available capital to fund the leasing of equipment could negatively impact our future operations 
additionally  the market price of our common stock may change significantly in response to various factors and events beyond our control  which will impact our ability to use equity to obtain funds 
a variety of events may cause the market price of our common stock to fluctuate significantly  including overall market conditions or volatility  a shortfall in our operating results from those anticipated  negative results or other unfavorable information relating to our market peers on the risk factors described in this annual report on form k 

table of contents our convertible subordinated notes may be convertible in the future  which  if converted  may result in dilution to existing stockholders  lower prevailing market prices for our common stock or cause a significant cash outlay 
as a result of our common stock satisfying the market price condition of our convertible subordinated notes  our convertible subordinated notes due notes were convertible at the option of the holders during various quarters in and the notes are not presently convertible  but may resume convertibility in future periods upon satisfaction of the market price condition or other conditions 
we have the right to deliver shares of our common stock  cash or a combination of cash and shares of our common stock upon a conversion of the notes 
the number of shares issuable upon conversion will be determined based on a conversion rate of approximately for the notes 
in the event that all notes were converted for common stock  we would issue an aggregate of million shares of our common stock 
the conversion of some or all of our notes into our common stock would dilute existing stockholders 
any sales in the public market of the common stock issued upon such conversion could adversely affect prevailing market prices of our common stock 
in addition  the possibility that the notes may be converted may encourage short selling by market participants because the conversion of the notes could depress the price of our common stock 
if we elect to satisfy the conversion obligation in cash  the amount of cash payable upon conversion of the notes will be determined by the product of i the number of shares issuable for the principal amount of the converted notes at a conversion rate of approximately per share for the notes and ii the average closing price of our common stock during a day trading period following the holders unretracted election to convert the notes 
to the extent we decide to pay cash to settle any conversions and the average closing price of our common stock during this period exceeds for the notes  we would have to pay cash in excess of the principal amount of the notes being converted  which would result in the recording of a loss on extinguishment of debt 
certain provisions of our corporate governing documents could make an acquisition of our company more difficult 
the following provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws  as currently in effect  as well as our stockholder rights plan and delaware law  could discourage potential proposals to acquire us  delay or prevent a change in control of us or limit the price that investors may be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock our certificate of incorporation permits our board of directors to issue blank check preferred stock and to adopt amendments to our bylaws  our bylaws contain restrictions regarding the right of stockholders to nominate directors and to submit proposals to be considered at stockholder meetings  our certificate of incorporation and bylaws restrict the right of stockholders to call a special meeting of stockholders and to act by written consent  we are subject to provisions of delaware law which prohibit us from engaging in any of a broad range of business transactions with an interested stockholder for a period of three years following the date such stockholder became classified as an interested stockholder  and we have adopted a stockholder rights plan that could cause substantial dilution to a person or group that attempts to acquire us on terms not approved by our board of directors or permitted by the stockholder rights plan

with respect to all such lawsuits  claims and proceedings  we record reserves when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated 
we do not believe that any of these proceedings  separately or in the aggregate  would be expected to have a material adverse effect on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows

accordingly  we currently do not intend to declare or pay any cash dividends on our common stock in the immediate future 
the declaration  payment and amount of future cash dividends  if any  will be at the discretion of our board of directors after taking into account various factors 
these factors include our financial condition  results of operations  cash flows from operations  current and anticipated capital requirements and expansion plans  the income tax laws then in effect and the requirements of delaware law

the new peer group is composed of dycom industries  inc  mastec  inc  chicago bridge iron company nv  shaw group  inc  pike electric corporation and myr group inc the companies in the new peer group were selected because they comprise a broad group of publicly held corporations  each of which has some operations similar to ours
