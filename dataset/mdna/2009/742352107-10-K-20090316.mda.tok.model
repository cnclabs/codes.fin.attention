this discussion and analysis contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of many factors  including  but not limited to  those described under risk factors and elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
overview the princeton review provides integrated classroom based  print and online products and services that address the needs of students  parents  educators and educational institutions 
we offer one of the leading sat preparation courses and are among the leading providers of test preparation courses for most major post secondary and graduate admissions tests 
the company and its international franchisees provide test preparation courses and tutoring services for the sat  gmat  mcat  lsat  gre and other standardized admissions tests to students throughout the united states and abroad 
we currently operate through our test preparation services and supplemental educational services ses divisions 
test preparation services division the test preparation services division derives the majority of its revenue from classroom based and princeton review online test preparation courses and tutoring services 
this division also receives royalties from its independent franchisees  which provide classroom based courses under the princeton review brand 
as a result of the acquisition of test services  inc tsi in march  the princeton review franchises in several southern california locations  utah and new mexico socal in july and the princeton review pittsburgh  inc in october  we do not have any remaining domestic franchisees as of december  additionally  this division receives royalties and advances from random house for books authored by the princeton review 
the test preparation services division accounted for of our overall revenue in the year ended december   and historically has accounted for the majority of our overall revenue 
as a result of the 
table of contents acquisitions described above and despite the elimination of the related franchise fees  we expect test preparation services revenue and income from operations to continue to increase in supplemental educational services division the supplemental educational services ses division provides state aligned research based academic tutoring instruction to students in schools in need of improvement in school districts throughout the country which receive funding under the no child left behind act of nclb 
we expect ses revenue and income from operations to continue to increase in as a result of the full year benefit of new markets entered over the course of  increased demand in existing markets and expansion into new markets 
discontinued businesses the company s former k services division provided a number of services to k schools and school districts  including assessment  professional development and intervention materials workbooks and related products 
additionally  this division received college counseling fees paid by high schools 
in september  the company committed to a plan to dispose of the k services division 
accordingly  the k services division is presented as a discontinued operation in this form k 
during the third quarter of  management determined that the assets of the k services division were impaired 
in december  we signed a definitive agreement to sell the k business to a subsidiary of core projects and technologies limited core  an education technology company 
the purchase price is composed of a million payment at the close of the transaction and a working capital payment to be received six months thereafter based on net working capital balances as defined as of the closing date 
the sale was completed on march  as a result of these events  the loss from discontinued operations in includes an impairment charge of million to reduce the carrying value of the assets of the k business to its estimated fair value  less costs to dispose 
the impairment charge was the net result of a million impairment expense recorded during the third quarter of and a subsequent gain of million recorded in the fourth quarter of based on the estimated increase in fair value of the k assets resulting from the core agreement 
excluding the effects of the impairment  the results of the k services division were negatively impacted for the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  due to a restructuring charge in the second quarter of and the loss of a significant customer in july until february  the company s former admissions services division derived most of its revenue from the sale of web based admissions and related application management products to educational institutions higher education technology services 
in february  we sold our web based admissions and application management business for million in cash and a potential earn out of up to million 
in connection with the sale of the higher education technology services business  financial results associated with this business have been reclassified as discontinued operations 
in connection with this transaction  two other businesses operated by this division college counseling and admissions publications were transferred to the k services now classified as discontinued operations and test preparation services divisions  respectively 
the only remaining business operated by the former admissions services division was providing higher education marketing services to post secondary schools 
in april  we outsourced the business of selling these marketing services to post secondary schools to higher edge marketing  inc higher edge 
under this new arrangement  the sales and customer support functions related to this business are to be performed by higher edge and we are responsible solely for the fulfillment function 
accordingly  all of the remaining employees in this division were transferred to other divisions  or terminated and re hired by higher edge 
higher edge contracts with post secondary schools directly and is required to pay us a royalty on the fees it receives from post secondary schools for marketing services 
financial results associated with admissions publications and marketing services  including any royalties from higher edge previously reported in the admissions services division have been reclassified for all periods presented into test preparation services 
college counseling services previously reported in the admissions services division have been reclassified for all periods and are presented within k services now classified as discontinued operations 

table of contents results of operations comparison of years ended december  and revenue for the year ended december   total revenue increased by million  or  from million in to million in test preparation services revenue increased by million  or  to million in from million in primarily due to million of incremental revenue from domestic franchises acquired during  as described above  and the full year impact of the providence  rhode island and amherst  massachusetts franchise acquisitions of october this increase was offset by a million reduction in franchise fees as a direct result of the franchise acquisitions noted 
the remaining increase in test prep services revenue is the net impact of organic revenue growth from tutoring and institutional contracts  partially offset by lower enrollments for classroom based services 
ses revenues increased by million  or  to million in from million in this increase is due to million of revenue from program expansions in existing markets and million from entry into nine new markets in as noted in the overview section above  we expect revenue for both of test preparation services and ses to increase in however  we cannot predict the impact the current economic recession and financial market crisis will have on revenues of either of our divisions  which could negatively impact our ability to increase revenue 
cost of revenue for the year ended december   total cost of revenue increased by million  or  to million in from million in test preparation services cost of revenue increased by million  or  to million in from million in due primarily to incremental costs of million related to the acquisitions and the full year impact of the october acquisitions 
excluding the impact of franchises acquired  cost of revenue decreased by million due to improved classroom operating efficiencies which lowered relative teacher  course material and facility costs required to deliver our services 
gross margin increased to in from in primarily as a result of the operating efficiencies described above 
ses cost of revenue increased by million  or  to million in from million in as a direct result of the increase in revenue 
gross margin did not change materially  decreasing from to we do not expect test preparation services or ses gross margin as a percentage of revenue to change materially in selling  general and administrative expenses for the year ended december   selling  general and administrative expenses increased by million  or  to million from million in test preparation services selling  general and administrative expenses increased by million  or  to million in from million in the increase is primarily related to the acquisitions and the full year impact of the october acquisitions  which collectively resulted in an increase of million 

table of contents expenses related to operations we owned for all of and decreased by million primarily as a result of increased focus on cost containment and operating efficiencies 
ses selling  general and administrative expenses increased by million  or  to million in from million in the increase is primarily attributable to additional personnel  facility and other costs necessary to support entry into nine new markets in  and organic growth in existing markets 
corporate expenses decreased million or  to million in from million in primarily due to temporary duplicative costs in resulting from moving the financial staff and duplicative hosting costs as we transitioned to a new facility as part of the restructuring initiated in professional fees and duplicative hosting costs related to this transition were approximately million 
we did not incur similar expenses in  thus reducing corporate expenses as compared to the remainder of the decrease is primarily due to reductions in corporate headcount associated with our efforts to reduce corporate expenses 
restructuring in  we initiated a restructuring effort which resulted in restructuring expenses of million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the costs incurred related to the relocation of our finance and certain legal operations from new york city to offices located near boston  massachusetts  and the consolidation of the remaining new york offices 
the relocation was undertaken in order to improve the financial reporting process and to continue remediation efforts related to material weaknesses we previously reported in our annual report on form k for the fiscal year ended december  we announced and commenced a restructuring initiative in the first quarter of related to our decision to outsource our information technology operations  transfer the majority of remaining corporate functions located in new york city to our offices located near boston  massachusetts  and simplify our management structure following the sale of the k services division 
the company expects to incur approximately million of charges related to these actions consisting of severance benefits for terminated employees and consulting fees related to transition of information technology operations to a third party 
the company expects to record the majority of these expenses and make related cash payments over the first and second quarters of impairment of investments in we recorded an impairment charge related to our investment in oasis children s services of million

income taxes during and we continued to record a valuation allowance against the deferred tax assets net of deferred tax liabilities that are scheduled to reverse in the foreseeable future 
as required by sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  we will continue to record such allowances until we have established a 
table of contents reasonable history of generating pre tax income coupled with an expectation of generating future pre tax profits which substantiate an ability to recover net deferred tax assets  which are primarily composed of net operating loss carryforwards 
accordingly  any tax benefit or provision we have recorded in or relates primarily to deferred taxes due to the temporary difference related to tax deductible amortization of goodwill which cannot be expected to reverse in the foreseeable future  taxes on income related to our canadian operations  withholding tax on income from foreign franchisees  and state taxes 
we recorded a provision for income taxes of million for the year ended december  as compared to an income tax benefit of  for the year ended december  we recorded tax provisions of  and  in and  respectively  due to the temporary difference related to tax deductible amortization of goodwill which cannot be expected to reverse in the foreseeable future 
the remainder of the tax provision recorded for the year ended december  related primarily to taxes on income related to our canadian operations and withholding taxes on income from foreign franchisees 
the income tax benefit of  recorded for the year ended december  was the result of the utilization of losses generated by continuing operations to offset income from discontinued operations in accordance with sfas no 
 partially offset by the  tax provision related to tax deductible amortization noted above 
comparison of years ended december  and revenue for the year ended december   total revenue increased by million  or  from million in to million in test preparation services revenue increased by million  or  from million in to million in retail revenue increased by million  primarily due to a shift to small group and individual tutoring revenue 
tutoring revenue for the sat and act increased by million 
retail graduate course revenues increased by million due to higher tutoring revenue  partially offset by lower graduate classroom based instruction 
this increase was partially offset by lower revenue related to the higher education institutional marketing business 
a revenue sharing arrangement related to this business offset the growth in course generated revenue 
the effect of the revenue sharing arrangement was to decrease revenues by million or of test preparation services revenue 
ses revenues increased by million  or  from million in to million in the increase was the result of higher revenues in new york and chicago and new contracts in florida in cost of revenue for the year ended december   total cost of revenue increased by million  or  from million in to million in test preparation services cost of revenue increased by million  or  from million in to million in this increase is due to an increase in teacher pay of million because of higher teacher pay rates together with increased tutoring pay to support higher levels of tutoring revenue 
higher costs for course materials and the costs of content expenditures for books and courses of million also contributed to the higher cost of revenues in gross margin declined from to due to the higher teacher and course material costs 
additionally  lower average retail classroom enrollments per course offering have reduced classroom utilization which resulted in lower profit margins 
ses cost of revenue increased by million  or  from million in to million in gross margin increased from to  primarily due to increased volume providing greater margin expansion 

table of contents selling  general and administrative expenses for the year ended december   selling  general and administrative expenses increased by million  or  from million in to million in test preparation services expenses decreased by  from million in to million in salaries and related costs increased by approximately  as a result of the timing of the hiring of new employees  pay increases and bonus and commissions 
marketing and advertising costs increased million in compared to as a result of higher media spend and increased direct mail campaigns 
offsetting these increases was lower bad debt expense  professional fees and technology related expenses 
ses selling  general and administrative expenses increased by million  or  from million in to million in this increase is attributable to a increase in revenue 
the greatest increases in costs were incurred in the sales and marketing area to obtain new students and in the salaries and wages to support the new students and expansion into new markets in florida 
corporate expenses increased million or  from million in to million in  primarily due to temporary duplicative costs resulting from moving the financial staff and duplicative hosting costs as we transitioned to a new facility as part of the restructuring initiated in professional fees and duplicative hosting costs related to this transition were approximately million 
we did not incur similar expenses in  thus increasing corporate expenses as compared to restructuring we recorded restructuring charges of million for the year ended december  related to severance and benefit costs for finance staff and management changes associated with the relocation of our finance and certain legal operations from new york city to offices outside boston  massachusetts 
there were no restructuring charges recorded in impairment of investments in and the company recorded an impairment charge for its investment in oasis children s services of million and  respectively 
interest income interest income increased by  or  from  in to  in as a result of an increase in average cash balances associated with the issuance of series c preferred stock in july other income expense during  other expense consisted primarily of a million charge for fair value of the embedded derivative and warrant related to the series b preferred stock retired in july income taxes during we continued to record a valuation allowance against our deferred tax asset net of deferred tax liabilities that are scheduled to reverse in the foreseeable future 
when we achieve profitability  any tax provision recorded as a result of using net operating losses or deductible temporary differences will be offset by a reversal of the tax valuation allowance previously recorded  which reversal would be for the same amount as the provision 
the temporary difference related to amortization of goodwill taken for tax purposes cannot be expected to reverse in the foreseeable future 
accordingly  a provision of  and  was recorded in and  respectively 

table of contents liquidity and capital resources our primary sources of liquidity during the year ended december  were cash and cash equivalents on hand and cash flow generated from operations prior to payments required to fund restructuring activities and borrowings under our credit facility 
our primary uses of cash during were capital expenditures  debt service related to the term loan under our credit facility  acquisitions of franchises and payments required to fund restructuring activities 
at december   we had million of cash and cash equivalents including  of restricted cash and million of unused borrowing capacity available under the revolving line of credit of our wells fargo credit facility as compared to million of cash and cash equivalents including  of restricted cash at december  we expect to generate positive cash flow from operations in  including payments to fund restructuring activities  as a result of expected revenue growth and the continued benefit of operational improvements and cost reductions described above 
cash flow from operations and currently available cash  including proceeds from the sale of the k business  are expected to fund capital expenditures and debt obligations over at least the next twelve months 
however  our ability to generate positive cash flows from operations is dependent on our future financial performance  which is subject to many factors beyond our control  as outlined above in item a 
in addition to generating positive income from operations  the timing of cash payments received under our customer arrangements is a primary factor impacting our sources of liquidity 
our test preparation services division generates the largest portion of our cash flow from operations from its retail classroom and tutoring courses 
these customers usually pay us in advance or contemporaneously with the services we provide  thereby supporting our short term liquidity needs 
increasingly  however  across test prep and ses  we are generating a greater percentage of our cash from contracts with institutions such as schools and school districts and post secondary institutions  all of which pay us in arrears 
typical payment performance for these institutional customers  once invoiced  ranges from to days 
additionally  the long contract approval cycles and or delays in purchase order generation with some of our contracts with large institutions or school districts can contribute to the level of variability in the timing of our cash receipts 
cash flows used for operating activities for the year ended december  was million as compared to million for the year ended december  the reduction in cash flows used for operating activities in was primarily the result of positive income from operations in of million as compared to a million loss from operations in the cash flow benefits from revenue growth and cost reductions in were offset by million of restructuring payments and  to a lesser extent  growth in ses revenue which did not convert to cash in cash used for continuing operations for the year ended december  was million  primarily as a result of the operating losses noted 
cash provided by operating activities for the year ended december  was million 
cash flows used for investing activities during the year ended december  was million as compared to million for each of the years ended december  and cash flows used for investing activities during and included million and million of cash used net of cash acquired to purchase existing domestic franchises  respectively 
the balance of cash used for investing activities during  and consisted primarily of capital expenditures including development of internal use software 
we expect capital expenditures in to be approximately million 
cash flows provided by financing activities were million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
during  the primary source of cash from financing activities was the million of proceeds from our credit facility as compared to the net proceeds of million from the july issuance of the series c preferred stock which was the primary source of cash in the net proceeds from the series c preferred stock were used in part to repay million outstanding under the credit facility established in and million was used to terminate the series b preferred stock 
during  we borrowed million under a credit facility 

table of contents contractual obligations and commercial commitments as of december   our principal contractual obligations and commercial commitments consisted of long term debt obligations  long term office and classroom leases  severance agreements and capital leases of computer equipment 
as of december   we operated from leased premises in states as well as washington dc  canada and puerto rico 
the following table summarizes our contractual obligations and other commercial commitments set forth therein as of december  payments due by period in millions contractual obligations total less than year years years more than years long term debt obligations capital lease obligations operating lease obligations severance and benefits cost total long term debt obligations consist primarily of a term loan under our credit facility  of which million is outstanding as of december  interest due on the term loan and other long term debt obligations is not included in the contractual obligations table presented above 
interest on the term loan is determined based upon our option of either a base rate margin or libor rate margin and applicable spreads as defined under the credit agreement 
as of december   the interest rate on the term loan was

 which defers the effective date to january  for all non financial assets and liabilities  except those that are recognized or disclosed in the financial statements on a recurring basis that is  at least annually 
sfas no

the adoption of sfas no 
did not impact our financial statements or disclosures as we did not carry any financial assets or liabilities subject to fair value accounting during we are in the process of evaluating the deferred portions of sfas no 
will have on our consolidated results of operations and financial position  the only impact of which would be enhanced disclosures on certain non financial assets and liabilities that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a non recurring basis that is  at least annually 
critical accounting policies and estimates management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  as well as related disclosures 
we evaluate our policies and estimates on an ongoing basis  including those related to the collectability of our accounts receivable balances  which impacts bad debt write offs  recoverability of goodwill  which impacts goodwill impairment expense  assessment of recoverability of long lived assets  which primarily impacts operating margins when we record the impairment of assets or accelerate their depreciation  recognition and measurement of current and deferred income tax assets and liabilities  which impacts our tax provision  revenue recognition requirements  which impacts how and when we recognize revenue from our goods and services and the estimates we use to record stock based compensation expense 
management bases its estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we have identified the following policies as critical to an understanding of our results of operations and financial condition 
this is not a comprehensive list of our accounting policies 
we also have other policies that we consider to be key accounting policies 
however  these policies do not meet the definition of critical accounting estimates because they do not generally require us to make estimates or judgments that are difficult or subjective 
for a discussion of our other accounting policies  see note to our consolidated financial statements included in this form k 
accounts receivable we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances for uncollectible accounts may be required 
we review our receivables on a regular basis to determine if past due balances are likely to be collected 
this 
table of contents review includes discussions with our customers and their account representatives  the customers payment history and other factors 
based on these reviews we may increase or decrease our allowance for uncollectible accounts if we determine there is a change in the collectability of our accounts receivable 
goodwill impairment we perform our annual goodwill impairment review during the fourth quarter of each year  or more frequently when events or circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired 
we completed our annual impairment testing related to goodwill and determined that these assets were not impaired during  and we use valuation techniques to estimate fair value which rely primarily on our historical and projected operating results and market information related to public companies we deem to have operations comparable to us 
projected operating results are consistent with estimates used in our budgeting and planning processes 
changes in our projected operating results or market information used in this analysis would affect our fair value estimates 
impairment of long lived assets subject to depreciation and amortization we assess the impairment of long lived assets when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the assets or the asset grouping may not be recoverable 
factors we consider in deciding when to perform an impairment review include significant under performance of a business or product line in relation to expectations  significant negative industry or economic trends and significant changes or planned changes in our use of the assets 
we assess recoverability of assets that will continue to be used in our operations by comparing the carrying amount of the asset grouping to the related total projected undiscounted net cash flows 
if an asset grouping s carrying value is not recoverable through those cash flows  the asset grouping is considered to be impaired 
the impairment is measured by the difference between the assets carrying amount and their fair value  based on the best information available  including market prices or discounted cash flow analysis 
we also review the carrying value of assets held for sale for impairment based upon management s best estimate of the anticipated net proceeds expected to be received upon final disposition 
we record any impairment charges or estimated losses on disposal in the period in which we identify such impairment or loss 
income taxes sfas no 
accounting for income taxes  requires that companies record a valuation allowance when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
we must assess the likelihood that we will be able to recover our deferred tax assets 
if recovery is not likely  we must increase our provision for taxes by recording a reserve  in the form of a valuation allowance  for the deferred tax assets that we estimate will not ultimately be recoverable 
we record a valuation allowance against our deferred tax asset net of deferred tax liabilities that are scheduled to reverse in the foreseeable future as we believe it is more likely than not that the future tax benefits from accumulated net operating losses and deferred taxes will not be realized 
if  in the future  an appropriate level and consistency of profitability is attained  we would reduce the valuation allowance  which could have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition we are required to make estimates or judgments that are difficult or subjective primarily for institutional contracts that require us to provide more than one product or service and accordingly record revenue in accordance with emerging issues task force no 
 revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables 
in accounting for multiple element arrangements  we must estimate the accounting value attributable to the different contractual elements and determine the timing for recognition of each element 
revenue is allocated to each element based on our assessment of the relative fair value of that element to the aggregate fair value of all elements 
the fair values must be reliable  verifiable and objectively determinable 
when available  such determination is based principally on the pricing of similar arrangements with unrelated parties that are not part of a multiple element arrangement 

table of contents restructuring in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities  our facilities related expenses and liabilities under all of our restructuring plans included estimates of the remaining rental obligations  net of estimated sublease income  for facilities we no longer occupy 
we review our estimates and assumptions on a regular basis until the outcome is finalized and make whatever modifications we believe necessary  based on our best judgment  to reflect any changed circumstances 
it is possible that such estimates could change in the future resulting in additional adjustments  and the effect of any such adjustments could be material 
stock based compensation the company records stock based compensation in accordance with sfas no 
r  share based payment  which requires the measurement and recognition of compensation expense for all shared based payments awards made to employees and directors  including stock options and restricted stock 
sfas no 
r requires companies to recognize stock based compensation awards granted to employees as compensation expense on a fair value method 
under the fair value recognition provisions of sfas no 
r  stock based compensation cost is measured at the accounting measurement date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized as expense over the service period  which generally represents the vesting period 
the expense recognized over the service period is required to include an estimate of the awards that will be forfeited 
under sfas no 
r  the fair value of a stock option is determined using a black scholes option pricing model that takes into account the stock price at the accounting measurement date  the exercise price  the expected life of the option  the volatility of the underlying stock and its expected dividends  and the risk free interest rate over the expected life of the option 
these assumptions are highly subjective and changes in them could significantly impact the value of the option and hence compensation expense 
impact of inflation inflation has not had a significant impact on our historical operations 
seasonality in results of operations we experience  and we expect to continue to experience  seasonal fluctuations in our revenue  results of operations and cash flows because the markets in which we operate are subject to seasonal fluctuations based on the scheduled dates for standardized admissions tests and the typical school year 
these fluctuations could result in volatility or adversely affect our stock price 
we typically generate the largest portion of our test preparation revenue in the third quarter 
ses revenue is concentrated in the first and fourth quarters to more closely reflect the after school programs greatest activity during the school year 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the term loan under our credit facility carries a variable interest rate that fluctuates based primarily on changes in libor rates 
we had million of outstanding principal under the term loan as of december  a increase in the interest rate on the term loan would increase interest expense by million 
we do not carry any other variable interest rate debt 
revenue from our international operations and royalty payments from our international franchisees constitute an insignificant percentage of our revenue 
accordingly  our exposure to exchange rate fluctuations is minimal
