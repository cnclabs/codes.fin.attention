item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview the company is a commercial printer  business forms manufacturer and office products and office furniture supplier in regional markets of the united states of america  east of the mississippi river 
the company also publishes the herald dispatch daily newspaper in huntington  west virginia with a total daily and sunday circulation of approximately  and  respectively 
the company has grown through strategic acquisitions and internal growth 
through such growth  the company has realized regional economies of scale  operational efficiencies  and exposure of its core products to new markets 
the company has acquired fifteen printing companies  eight office products and office furniture companies  one company with a combined emphasis on both printing and office products and office furniture  a paper distribution division which was subsequently sold in and a daily newspaper since its initial public offering on january  the company s net revenues consist primarily of sales of commercial printing  business forms  tags  other printed products  document output solutions including rendering  inserting and mailing  office supplies  office furniture  data products and office design services as well as newspaper revenues primarily from advertising and circulation 
the company recognizes revenues when products are shipped or ownership is transferred and when services are rendered to the customer 
newspaper advertising revenues are recognized  net of agency commissions  in the period when advertising is printed or placed on web sites 
circulation revenues are recognized when purchased newspapers are distributed 
the company s revenues are subject to seasonal fluctuations caused by variations in demand for its products 
the company s cost of sales primarily consists of raw materials  including paper  ink  pre press supplies and purchased office supplies  furniture and data products  and manufacturing costs including direct labor  indirect labor and overhead 
significant factors affecting the company s cost of sales include the costs of paper in printing  office supplies and the newspaper operations  costs of labor and other raw materials 
the company s operating costs consist of selling  general and administrative expenses 
these costs include salaries  commissions and wages for sales  customer service  accounting  administrative and executive personnel  rent  utilities  legal  audit  information systems equipment costs  software maintenance and depreciation 
critical accounting policies involving significant estimates the company s significant accounting policies are described in note to the consolidated financial statements included in item of this form k 
the discussion and analysis of the financial statements and results of operations are based upon the company s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
the following critical accounting policies affect the company s more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
there can be no assurance that actual results will not differ from those estimates 
asset impairment the company is required to test for asset impairment relating to property and equipment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset might not be recoverable 
the company applies statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets sfas in order to determine whether or not an asset is impaired 
this standard requires an impairment analysis when indicators of impairment are present 
if such indicators are present  the standard indicates that if the sum of the future expected cash flows from the company s asset  undiscounted and without interest charges  is less than the carrying value  an asset impairment must be recognized in the financial statements 
the amount of the impairment is the difference between the fair value of the asset and the carrying value of the asset 
the company believes that the accounting estimate related to an asset impairment is a critical accounting estimate because it is highly susceptible to change from period to period because it requires management to make assumptions about future cash flows over future years and that the impact of recognizing an impairment could have a significant effect on operations 
management s assumptions about future cash flows requires significant judgment because actual operating levels have fluctuated in the past and are expected to continue to do so in the future 
management has discussed the development and selection of this critical accounting estimate with the audit committee of our board of directors and the audit committee has reviewed the company s disclosure relating to it in the md a 
beginning in fiscal year  goodwill and other intangibles are required to be evaluated annually for impairment  according to sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
sfas 
the standard requires a two step process be performed to analyze whether or not goodwill has been impaired 
step one is to test for potential impairment and requires that the fair value of the reporting unit be compared to its book value including goodwill and other intangibles 
if the fair value is higher than the book value  no impairment is recognized 
if the fair value is lower than the book value  a second step must be performed 
the second step is to measure the amount of impairment loss  if any  and requires that a hypothetical purchase price allocation be done to determine the implied fair value of goodwill and other intangibles 
this fair value is then compared to the carrying value of goodwill and other intangibles 
if the implied fair value is lower than the carrying value  an impairment must be recorded 
as discussed in the notes to the financial statements  goodwill and other intangibles are recorded at the adjusted book value and were analyzed for impairment with the implementation of sfas the fair value of the company s goodwill and other intangibles was estimated using discounted cash flow methodologies 
based on the analysis  the company determined that the fair value relating to goodwill and other intangibles resulted in an implied fair value greater than the book value recorded for the corresponding goodwill and other intangibles  and therefore  no impairment was recognized in any period subsequent to the adoption of this statement 
the company believes that the accounting estimate related to the goodwill and other intangibles impairment is a critical accounting estimate because the underlying assumptions used for the discounted cash flow can change from period to period and could potentially cause a material impact to the income statement 
management s assumptions about discount rates  inflation rates and other internal and external economic conditions  such as earnings growth rate  require significant judgment based on fluctuating rates and expected revenues 
additionally  sfas requires that the goodwill and other intangibles be analyzed for impairment on an annual basis using the assumptions that apply at the time the analysis is updated 
management has discussed the development of these estimates with the audit committee of the board of directors 
additionally  the board of directors has reviewed this disclosure and its relation to md a 
allowance for doubtful accounts the company encounters risks associated with sales and the collection of the associated accounts receivable 
as such  the company records a monthly provision for accounts receivable that are considered to be uncollectible 
in order to calculate the appropriate monthly provision  the company primarily utilizes a historical rate of accounts receivables written off as a percentage of total revenue 
this historical rate is applied to the current revenues on a monthly basis 
the historical rate is updated periodically based on events that may change the rate such as a significant increase or decrease in collection performance and timing of payments as well as the calculated total exposure in relation to the allowance 
periodically  the company compares the identified credit risks with the allowance that has been established using historical experience and adjusts the allowance accordingly 
the company believes that the accounting estimate related to the allowance for doubtful accounts is a critical accounting estimate because the underlying assumptions used for the allowance can change from period to period and could potentially cause a material impact to the income statement and working capital 
management has discussed the development and selection of this estimate with the audit committee of the board of directors  and the board has  in turn  reviewed the disclosure and its relation to md a 
during  and    and  of bad debt expense was incurred and the allowance for doubtful accounts was   and  of october   and the actual write offs for the periods were   and  during  and general economic conditions and specific geographic and customer concerns are major factors that may affect the adequacy of the allowance and may result in a change in the annual bad debt expense 
the following discussion and analysis presents the significant changes in the financial position and results of operations of the company and should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere herein

working capital as of october  was million  a decrease from million at october  the company had historically used cash generated from operating activities and debt to finance capital expenditures and the cash portion of the purchase price of acquisitions 
management plans to continue making significant investments in equipment and to seek appropriate acquisition candidates 
however  to fund the company s continued expansion of operations  additional financing may be necessary 
the company has two available lines of credit totaling up to million  of which million is subject to borrowing base limitations see note of the consolidated financial statements 
for the foreseeable future including through fiscal  management believes it can fund operations  meet debt service requirements and make the planned capital expenditures based on the available cash and cash equivalents  cash flow from operations and lines of credit 
additionally  the company has minimal amounts of future contracted obligations see note and note of the consolidated financial statements 
the company is not a guarantor of indebtedness of others 
the company s off balance sheet arrangements at october  relate to the syscan acquisition and are associated with a put option from williams land corporation to sell a building to the company for million 
this option may be exercised no later than days prior to the end of the lease and closing of said purchase cannot exceed days from the end of the lease 
the company had borrowed under its million line of credit approximately million at october  which encompassed refinancing of existing indebtedness prior to the herald dispatch acquisition and to partially fund the purchase of the herald dispatch 
pursuant to the borrowing base calculation the company had million in additional availability under its million revolving credit line 
in january  the company renewed its million unsecured line of credit with a bank 
as of october   the company had contractual obligations in the form of leases and debt as follows payments due by fiscal year contractual obligations residual total non cancelable operating leases revolving line of credit  term debt the company is required to make certain mandatory payments on its credit facilities related to net proceeds received from a loss subject to applicable thresholds  equity proceeds and effective january   the company is required to prepay its credit facilities by of excess cash flow for its most recently completed fiscal year 
the excess cash flow for purposes of this calculation is defined as the difference if any between a ebitda for such period and b federal  state and local income taxes paid in cash during such period plus capital expenditures during such period not financed with indebtedness plus interest expense paid in cash during such period plus the aggregate amount of scheduled payments made by the borrower and its subsidiaries during such period in respect of all principal on all indebtedness whether at maturity  as a result of mandatory sinking fund redemption  or otherwise  plus restricted payments paid in cash by the borrower during such period in compliance with the credit agreement 
the company s prepayment obligation due january  is approximately million 
the company converted an operating lease to an equipment purchase in december as a result of this conversion no lease commitments pertaining to this equipment are reflected in the contractual obligations schedule above 
the company paid  of an approximate aggregate commitment of  for this equipment in december cash flows from operating activities cash flows from operating activities for the years ended october   and were million  million  and million 
the increase in cash flows from operating activities for fiscal compared to was primarily associated with higher depreciation and amortization  deferred financing costs  deferred income taxes and bad debt expense 
the decrease in cash flows from operating activities for the fiscal year compared to was primarily reflective of cash paid for taxes of which a refund has been recorded in and a liability was recorded in  primarily due to the timing of tax payments and a cash payment under a deferred compensation plan 
these items were partially offset by additional cash generated by changes in the remaining assets and liabilities and an increase in net income 
cash flows from investing activities cash used in investing activities was million  million  and million for the years ended october   and cash flows used in investing activities were down approximately  in from the cash used in investing activities in was primarily related to capital expenditures and a working capital adjustment payment associated with the acquisition of the herald dispatch 
cash flows used in investing activities increased in compared to primarily due to the contingent earn out paid for the acquisition of syscan  higher capital expenditures  partially offset by cash net of certain acquisition related expenditures for the herald dispatch 
cash flows from financing activities net cash flows used in financing activities for the years ended october   and were million  million  and million 
the increase in cash used in financing activities was primarily associated with payments made on the company s outstanding indebtedness associated with its revolving credit facility 
the million utilized for financing activities in was primarily reflective of net payments on debt  dividends and financing costs paid  partially offset by stock option proceeds 
during  the company reduced net borrowings by approximately million and  after adjusting for non cash investing and financing activities  reduced net borrowings by million 
this  coupled with dividend payments of million  partially offset by stock option proceeds  was reflective of net cash used in financing activities during dividends paid in   and were million  million  and million 
inflation and economic conditions management believes that the effect of inflation on the company s operations has not been material and will continue to be immaterial for the foreseeable future 
the company does not have long term contracts  therefore  to the extent permitted by competition  it has the ability to pass through to its customers most cost increases resulting from inflation  if any 
in addition  the company is not particularly energy dependent  therefore  an increase in energy costs should not have a significant impact on the company 
seasonality historically  the company has experienced a greater portion of its profitability in the second and fourth quarters than in the first and third quarters 
the second quarter generally reflects increased orders for printing of corporate annual reports and proxy statements 
a post labor day increase in demand for printing services and office products coincides with the company s fourth quarter 
our business is subject to seasonal fluctuations that we expect to continue to be reflected in our operating results in future periods 
on a historical basis the herald dispatch s first and third calendar quarters of the year tended to be the weakest because advertising volume is at its lowest levels following the holiday season and a seasonal slowdown in the summer months 
correspondingly  on a historical basis the fourth calendar quarter followed by the second calendar quarter tended to be the strongest quarters 
the fourth calendar quarter includes heavy holiday season advertising 
other factors that affect our quarterly revenues and operating results may be beyond our control  including changes in the pricing policies of our competitors  the hiring and retention of key personnel  wage and cost pressures  distribution costs  changes in newsprint prices and general economic factors 
the united states economy has been in a recession since december  according to the national bureau of economic research  and it is widely believed that certain elements of the economy  such as housing  were in decline before that time 
the duration and depth of an economic recession in markets in which the company operates may further reduce its future advertising and circulation revenue  operating results and cash flows
