we undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise any forward looking statements made herein because of new information  future events or otherwise 
overview we are a biotechnology company with a primary focus on the development of therapeutics 
our late stage compounds include i vilazodone a potential first in class drug candidate for the treatment of depression  which recently completed its second phase iii trial successfully  and ii apadenoson  which is trademarked under the name stedivaze  a potential best in category vasodilator for use in myocardial perfusion imaging  which is entering its phase iii clinical trial program 
our sources of liquidity as of march  include our cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities balance of approximately million 
this amount does not include approximately million in proceeds from the sale of our cogenics segment in april our projected uses of cash include cash used to fund operations  capital expenditures  existing debt service costs and continued research and product development 
we believe that our cash and cash availability will be sufficient to fund our operations at least through december we will need additional funds to continue development of vilazodone and stedivaze beyond december the sale of any equity or debt securities may result in additional dilution to our stockholders  and we cannot be certain that additional financing will be available in amounts or on terms acceptable to us  if at all 
if 
table of contents we are unable to obtain financing  we may be required to reduce the scope and timing of the planned clinical and pre clinical programs  which could harm our financial condition and operating results 
therapeutics vilazodone vilazodone  a novel dual acting serotonergic antidepressant  is a potent and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor  or ssri  a first line therapy for major depressive disorder  and a partial agonist of the hydroxytryptamine a  or ht 
a  receptor  a first line therapy for anxiety disorders 
vilazodone has greater in vitro potency and selectivity for serotonin reuptake than compounds such as fluoxetine 
in vitro binding studies also indicate that vilazodone has a greater potency for the ht 
a 
receptor than specific ht 
a 
ligands such as buspirone 
journal of medicinal chemistry  
there is evidence that a partial ht 
a 
agonist  taken in combination with an ssri for the treatment for major depressive disorder  may reverse the adverse sexual side effects induced by the ssri 
journal of clinical psychopharmacology  
thus  we expect vilazodone not to induce adverse sexual side effects associated with ssris in the market today 
our second phase iii vilazodone clinical trial has been completed 
in the study  vilazodone achieved statistically significant results on the primary endpoint and secondary efficacy endpoints related to major depressive disorder 
top line study results suggest that vilazodone was generally well tolerated and the efficacy and safety data were consistent with the findings from the previous phase iii trial 
in addition  study findings corroborate that there was no impairment of sexual function as measured by a validated scale 
this is an important finding since many antidepressants have been associated with causing or exacerbating sexual dysfunction 
a statistically significant improvement in the symptoms of anxiety associated with major depressive disorder was also observed 
separately  the phase iii study also sought to replicate a proprietary biomarker associated with response to vilazodone from the first phase iii trial 
although this preselected biomarker did not replicate  analyses remain ongoing 
based on the results of these and additional activities  including the manufacture of registration batches of the active pharmaceutical ingredient and the commercial product  we intend to file an nda for vilazodone with the fda by the end of calendar year stedivaze stedivaze is a selective adenosine receptor a  or a 
a  agonist in development as a vasodilator used for myocardial perfusion imaging 
we plan to launch our phase iii clinical development program for stedivaze in the next several months 
phase ii data showed potential best in category attributes with an improved adverse event profile over the current standard of care and favorable pharmacokinetic and target binding affinity profiles 
we conducted an end of phase ii meeting with the fda in january based on this meeting  we believe that we have reached agreement with the fda on the overall design elements for our phase iii trial program 
our phase iii trial protocol has been submitted to the fda and we are awaiting comment 
stedivaze could be marketed by us directly to providers or partnered as a complementary and valuable to the pipelines of other well established biotechnology and specialty healthcare companies 
if we are successful in phase iii clinical development  there is no assurance that we will be successful marketing stedivaze 
we believe that stedivaze has the potential to be well differentiated and become the best in category 
in addition  while some new modalities offer growth potential to work adjunctively with stedivaze  other diagnostic imaging techniques may be developed in the coming years that will limit the market for myocardial perfusion imaging 
other therapeutic products we are developing atl as an oral therapeutic for the treatment of asthma and or diabetes  both of which are multi billion dollar growing markets 
working through antagonism of the adenosine a 
b 
receptor sub type  the compound has shown significant responses in animal models of both asthma and diabetes 
we are proceeding with a toxicology and chemistry program  and with success  we will proceed to an investigation new drug  or ind  filing 
atl is the subject of an option agreement to an exclusive license purchased by novartis 

table of contents atl is a highly selective agonist of the adenosine a 
a 
receptor subtype that is in development for the treatment of acute inflammatory conditions 
the compound has shown significant responses in animal models of a number of inflammatory mediated diseases  and has demonstrated a lack of toxicity in both rodent and primate toxicology models at doses expected to be therapeutically relevant 
atl is currently in later stage toxicology development  and with success  we will proceed to an ind filing 
atl is a selective agonist of the adenosine a 
a 
receptor subtype that is targeted as a treatment for ophthalmic disease 
the compound has shown significant effect in both small and large animal models of disease 
atl is the subject of a confidential collaboration with a larger pharmaceutical partner  who has an option to the ophthalmic program 
this compound may be well positioned to be used in other major indications and some work is being conducted currently to identify and advance these opportunities 
in june  avalon announced that it had identified a compound for clinical development  named avn this compound has good pharmacological properties and potently inhibits the beta catenin pathway in a variety of model systems 
avalon is currently conducting lead optimization efforts around avn and has synthesized compounds in this family that kill human cancer cells in vitro  cause a cell cycle arrest that is characteristic of inhibition of the beta catenin pathway  and cause a dose dependent decrease in beta catenin protein levels 
studies with these compounds in animal models have shown good pharmacological properties  bioavailability  modulation of pharmacodynamic markers  and growth inhibition in tumor xenograft studies 
to date  avalon is not aware of any specific inhibitors of the beta catenin pathway that are on the market or in clinical development 
genetic tests we are pursuing additional tests for complex and difficult to diagnose diseases and syndromes that will complement our familion family of tests 
these activities are required to reduce the cost of delivery and to increase laboratory capacity relating to delivery of our tests  enhance scalability of lab operations as demand grows for our tests  drive adoption of existing tests  commercialize new tests and enhance reimbursement for the tests  among other key metrics 
we have also made significant progress in our efforts to contract with private and government health insurers for test coverage and reimbursement 
our work with private insurers resulted in the familion lqts  brs  and familion family tests receiving s codes effective october followed by the familion hcm and familion family tests receiving s codes effective april we expect that s codes should speed the adoption of these tests by private insurers 
in october  we became an in network provider with aetna for healthcare coverage of our familion lqts and family tests 
we are utilizing our national contract with the bcbs association signed in december to work with individual bcbs companies to provide their customers with access to our familion family of tests 
in addition  we are an approved medicare provider for our genetic testing services  and a medicaid provider in states and the district of columbia 
these providers and other private payers with positive coverage policies offer access to genetic testing for nearly million patients 
the positive changes to the reimbursement landscape for our genetic tests demonstrate our commitment to working with private and government payers to improve patient access to these vital tests 
financial operations overview revenue 
the majority of our revenue is from services related to genetic tests 
we maintain relationships with certain healthcare providers as well as healthcare insurance companies  revenue from these arrangements is recognized net of contractual allowances 
cost of revenue 
cost of revenue consists primarily of salaries and related expenses for personnel  including stock based compensation expense  laboratory expenses  depreciation  and facility costs 
sales and marketing expense 
sales and marketing expense consists primarily of salaries  commissions and other related personnel costs  including stock based compensation expense 
other costs primarily include advertising and promotion expenses  direct mailings  trade shows  and travel and related expenses 

table of contents research and development expense 
research and development expense consists primarily of fees paid to professional service providers in conjunction with independent monitoring of our clinical trials and acquiring and evaluating data in conjunction with our clinical trials  fees paid to independent researchers  costs of contract manufacturing  services expenses incurred in developing and testing products and product candidates  salaries and related expenses for personnel  including stock based compensation expense  costs of materials  depreciation  rent  utilities and other facilities costs 
in addition  research and development expenses include the cost to in license technologies to support current development efforts 
we expense research and development costs as incurred 
general and administrative expense 
general and administrative expense consists primarily of salaries and other related costs for personnel  including stock based compensation expense  in our executive  finance  accounting  information technology and human resource functions 
other costs primarily include facility costs and professional fees for accounting  consulting and legal services  including patent related expenses 
purchased research and development expense 
purchased research and development expense represents the value of the in process research and development projects of adenosine therapeutics and avalon that had not yet reached technological feasibility  defined as being equivalent to fda approval  and had no alternative use at their date of its acquisition 
such costs were expensed in accordance with sfas no 
 business combinations  see note to the consolidated financial statements for the method and assumptions used to value the in process research and development 
interest and other income expense  net 
interest expense consists of interest incurred under notes payable and other debt financings and capital lease obligations 
interest income consists of interest earned on our cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities 
other income expense  net consists primarily of foreign currency gains losses 
critical accounting policies and significant judgments and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements and notes  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue and expenses 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates and judgments  including those related to revenue  allowances for doubtful accounts  intangibles  goodwill  accrued expenses and income taxes 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
a summary of our significant accounting policies is contained in note to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition the majority of our current revenue is from services related to genetic tests 
we maintain relationships with certain healthcare providers as well as healthcare insurance companies  revenue from these arrangements is recognized net of contractual allowances 
revenue is also derived from fees for licenses of intellectual property 
allowance for doubtful accounts and contractual allowances allowances for doubtful accounts are maintained for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
these estimated allowances of million   and  at march   and  respectively  are periodically reviewed  analyzing the customers payment history and information known to us regarding customers credit worthiness as well as the contract terms and history of collections with third party payors 
the increase in reflects the increase in revenue 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate additional allowances may be required 
actual losses incurred and contractual write offs have not been significantly different than management s estimates in recent history 
valuation of intangibles and goodwill as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements  we completed one business combination during fiscal  one in fiscal and one in fiscal in accordance 
table of contents with sfas no 
 business combinations  the transactions have been accounted for based on fair value 
as a result of the purchase price allocations  we recorded purchased intangibles totaling million and goodwill totaling million 
the fair value of the purchased intangibles was determined based on either discounted probable cash flows or replacement costs 
the interest rates used to discount the net cash flows to their present value were based on our weighted average cost of capital ranging between and 
in accordance with the requirements of sfas no 
 goodwill and intangible assets  we perform an annual impairment test of the carrying value of goodwill using december as our selected annual evaluation date 
the fair value of our recorded intangibles can be impacted by economic conditions  market risks  and the volatility in the markets in which we and our customers operate 
changes in fair value could result in future impairment charges if the fair value of the reporting units or asset groups to which these long lived assets are associated are determined to be less than the carrying value of such assets 
as of december   the most recent evaluation date  there was no impairment of goodwill 
following the disposal of our cogenics segment  we operate as a single operating segment and expect to have a single reporting unit 
our fair value will be measured using our market capitalization  however  given our significant accumulated deficit  our carrying value is significantly lower than our market capitalization as of march  in accordance with the requirements of sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  when facts and circumstances suggest that there may be impairment  we will assess the carrying value of amortizing intangibles  including purchased intangibles 
when a potential impairment has been identified  forecasted undiscounted net cash flows of the operations to which the asset relates are compared to the current carrying value of the assets present in that operations 
if such cash flows are less than such carrying amounts  such intangibles are written down to their respective fair values 
the results of these periodic impairment tests can be impacted by our future expected operating results and cash flows  economic conditions  market risks  and the volatility in the markets in which we and our customers operate 
accrued expenses as part of the process of preparing consolidated financial statements  we are required to estimate accrued expenses 
this process involves identifying services which have been performed on our behalf and estimating the level of services performed and the associated cost incurred for such services as of each balance sheet date in our consolidated financial statements 
examples of estimated expenses for which we accrue include contract service fees  such as amounts paid to clinical monitors  data management organizations  clinical sites and investigators in conjunction with clinical trials  and fees paid to contract manufacturers for the production of materials for clinical and non clinical trials  and professional service fees 
in connection with these service fees  our estimates are most affected by our understanding of the status and timing of services provided relative to the actual levels of services incurred by such service providers 
in the event that we do not identify costs which have begun to be incurred or we under or over estimate the level of services performed or the costs of such services  our reported expenses for such period would be too low or too high 
the date on which specified services commence  the level of services performed on or before a given date and the cost of such services is often judgmental 
we attempt to mitigate the risk of inaccurate estimates  in part  by communicating with our service providers when other evidence of costs incurred is unavailable 
income taxes as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements  we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process involves estimating our actual current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatments of items for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities 
as of march   we had federal tax net operating loss carryforwards  after limitation for changes in ownership of acquired entities  of million  which expire starting in  federal tax credit carryforwards of million and net deferred tax assets of million 
we have recorded a valuation allowance of million as an offset against these otherwise recognizable net deferred tax assets due to the uncertainty surrounding the timing of the realization of the tax benefit 
in the event that we determine in the future that we will be able to realize all or a portion of our net deferred tax asset  an adjustment to the deferred tax valuation allowance would increase net income in the period in which such a determination is made 

table of contents recent accounting pronouncements in september  the financial accounting standards board  or fasb  issued statement no 
 fair value measurements  or sfas sfas establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosures about fair value measurements 
the changes to current practice resulting from the application of this statement relate to the definition of fair value  the methods used to measure fair value  and the expanded disclosures about fair value measurements 
sfas was effective for us beginning on april  and did not have a significant impact on our financial statements 
in february  the fasb deferred the implementation of sfas for certain non financial assets and liabilities  that portion of sfas will become effective for us beginning on april  we are evaluating the impact of sfas no 
 if any  related to certain non financial assets and liabilities on our consolidated financial statements 
in july  the emerging issues task force  or eitf  issued eitf issue no 
 accounting for nonrefundable advance payments for goods or services to be used in future research and development activities  or eitf eitf clarifies the accounting for nonrefundable advance payments for goods or services that will be used or rendered for research and development activities 
eitf states that such payments should be capitalized and recognized as an expense as the goods are delivered or the related services are performed 
if an entity does not expect the goods to be delivered or the services rendered  the capitalized advance payment should be charged to expense 
eitf was effective for us on april  and did not have a significant impact on our financial statements as we typically don t have any advance payments for research and development activities 
in november  the eitf issued eitf issue no 
 accounting for collaborative arrangements  or eitf eitf requires participants in a collaborative arrangement to report costs incurred and revenue generated from transactions with third parties in the income statement 
eitf is effective for us beginning on april  we are currently evaluating the effect of eitf on our consolidated financial statements 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
revised  business combinations  or sfas r 
sfas r retains the fundamental requirements in sfas that the acquisition method of accounting which sfas called the purchase method be used for all business combinations and for an acquirer to be identified for each business combination 
sfas r requires an acquirer to recognize the assets acquired  the liabilities assumed  and any non controlling interest in the acquiree at the acquisition date  measured at their fair values as of that date  with limited exceptions specified in the statement 
that replaces sfas s cost allocation process  which required the cost of an acquisition to be allocated to the individual assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values 
the statement retains the guidance in sfas for identifying and recognizing intangible assets separately from goodwill 
sfas r requires the acquiring entity to recognize in process research and development at fair value at the date of acquisition and subsequently account for it as an indefinite lived intangible asset until completion or abandonment of the associated research and development efforts 
sfas r will now require acquisition costs to be expensed as incurred  restructuring costs associated with a business combination must generally be expensed prior to the acquisition date and changes in deferred tax asset valuation allowances and income tax uncertainties after the acquisition date generally will affect income tax expense 
sfas r applies prospectively to our business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after april  see note business combinations for further discussion related to the impact of adopting sfas r 
in june  the fasb ratified eitf  determining whether an instrument or an embedded feature is indexed to an entity s own stock eitf 
eitf provides that an entity should use a two step approach to evaluate whether an equity linked financial instrument or embedded feature is indexed to its own stock  including evaluating the instrument s contingent exercise and settlement provisions 
eitf also clarifies the impact of exercise prices that are denominated in a foreign currency and valuation consideration of market based employee stock options 
eitf is effective for the company beginning april  we are currently evaluating the effect of eitf on our consolidated financial statements 
in april  the fasb issued three fasb staff positions  or fsps  related to fair value measurement and disclosure 
fsp fas  determining fair value when the volume and level of activity for the asset or liability have significantly decreased and identifying transactions that are not orderly  provides additional guidance on the factors that should be considered in estimating fair value when there has been a significant decrease in market 
table of contents activity for an asset or liability 
the fasb also issued fsp fas and fas  recognition and presentation of other than temporary impairments  amending the accounting guidance for other than temporary impairments of debt securities and the disclosure requirements of equity securities and debt securities 
the fasb also issued fsp fas and apb  interim disclosures about fair value of financial instruments 
fsp and apb require the disclosure of fair value for assets and liabilities within the scope of sfas  disclosures about fair value of financial instruments  for interim periods 
these pronouncements are not expected to have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations but will require additional disclosures once adopted 
we will adopt these fsps during the quarter ended june  results of operations fiscal year ended march  compared to fiscal year ended march  revenue 
revenue increased million  or  from million in fiscal to million in fiscal this increase was solely driven by the increase in sales of our genetic tests of million  or  from the same period a year ago 
the introduction of our new commercial sales and marketing team in september and increased coverage from third party payors  such as medicare  medicaid and aetna  has had a significant impact on revenue 
as of march   we are an approved medicare provider for our genetic testing services  and a medicaid provider in states and the district of columbia  up from just seven states in january in an effort to continue the acceleration of revenue growth  we continued to expand and invest in the development of our sales force and have expanded our service offerings by adding two new genetic tests in fiscal hypertrophic cardiomyopathy  or hcm  was launched in may and arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy  or arvc  was launched in november we expect to continue to expand our sales force  third party payor base and our product offerings in fiscal gross profit 
gross profit margins decreased from in fiscal to in fiscal gross margins for fiscal were compared with for fiscal however  in fiscal  our gross margins increased from in the first fiscal quarter to in the fourth fiscal quarter 
the decline from fiscal to was primarily due to the exclusion of shared infrastructure costs which were born by the cogenics segment in early fiscal  and planned investment in our infrastructure  equipment and a new laboratory information system  which were designed to increase productivity and lab efficiencies 
gross margins are expected to improve as infrastructure improvements drive efficiencies 
our cost structure  which includes personnel  equipment and facilities  is largely fixed in nature  thus  as revenue increases our gross margin should increase 
research and development expense 
research and development expenses increased million to million for fiscal  or  from million for the year ended march  the increase is primarily related to the recently completed vilazodone safety and phase iii confirmatory trials  which began in december and march  respectively  and to a lesser extent  costs incurred with advancing the adenosine therapeutics pipeline since the acquisition date for its clinical and pre clinical programs 
we expect our ongoing research and development costs to continue to increase as we prepare for the nda filing for vilazodone and begin our stedivaze phase iii clinical trials and in addition  stock based compensation expense charged to research and development expense increased  for the year ended march  to million from  for the same period in fiscal sales and marketing expense 
sales and marketing expenses increased million to million for fiscal  or  from million for the year ended march  the increase was principally due to a full year of expense relating to our sales force and marketing team 
in fiscal and  we implemented plans to aggressively expand our sales force 
although we expect to continue to expand our sales force  increasing expense in this area should take place at a lower rate as we build upon an already established organization 
stock based compensation expense charged to sales and marketing increased  for the year ended march  to million from  for the same period in fiscal general and administrative expense 
general and administrative expenses increased million to million for fiscal  or  from million for the year ended march  the increase was  in part  the result of an increase in stock based compensation charged to general and administrative expense of million for the year ended march  to million from million for the same period in fiscal 
table of contents purchased in process research and development expense 
purchased in process research and development expense of million for the year ended march  includes million related to the may acquisition of avalon and million related to the acquisition of adenosine therapeutics 
because the nature and economics of the term loan were to fund the losses of avalon  we have recognized in our financial statements a portion of the losses incurred by avalon during the period from october  to march  as purchased in process research and development expense 
the amount recognized was determined based upon a ratable allocation of the net loss of avalon during the period from october  to march  and the consideration of the proceeds of the term loan relative to the total cash available to avalon prior to receipt of the proceeds of the term loan 
the million related to the acquisition of adenosine therapeutics represents the fair value of the in process research and development projects at adenosine therapeutics at the date of its acquisition  in particular stedivaze 
stedivaze was valued based on discounted future cash flows 
we prepared revenue and expense projections as well as technology assumptions through for stedivaze 
the revenue for stedivaze was based on estimates of the relevant market sizes and growth factors  expected trends in technology and the nature and expected timing of the introduction of the new products 
the estimated expenses were based upon the expected remaining costs to complete stedivaze 
we discounted the projected cash flows using a risk adjusted discount rate and considered the probability of success  where appropriate 
the rate utilized to discount the net cash flows to their present values was the internal rate of return  or irr  based on the purchase price paid 
management believed that the irr reflected the difficulties and uncertainties in completing the project and thereby achieving technological feasibility  the stage of completion of the project  anticipated market acceptance and penetration  market growth rates and risks related to the impact of potential changes in future target markets 
based on these considerations  the irr of was deemed an appropriate discount for valuing the iprd 
since the cost relates to a project that had not yet reached technological feasibility  defined as being equivalent to fda approval  and which had no alternative use at the date of acquisition  the costs were expensed during fiscal there were no such costs in fiscal interest and other income expense  net 
interest expense increased million from  in fiscal to million in fiscal this increase was primarily due to the interest on the notes issued in connection with the adenosine therapeutics acquisition and to a lesser extent the interest on the convertible notes issued in february interest income decreased million from million in fiscal to  in fiscal we expect interest income to continue to decline as our invested cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities balances decrease 
other income  net decreased  to  in fiscal from  in fiscal fiscal year ended march  compared to fiscal year ended march  revenue 
revenue increased million  or  to million in fiscal from million in fiscal this increase was primarily driven by the increase in sales of our genetic tests of million  or  from the same period a year ago 
the introduction of our new commercial sales and marketing team in september had a notable impact on revenue for the last half of fiscal gross profit 
gross profit margins increased from in fiscal to in fiscal the increase was largely due to the increase in revenue 
our cost structure  which includes personnel  equipment and facilities  is largely fixed in nature  thus  as revenue increases our gross margin should increase due to leveraging of an economy of scale 
research and development expense 
research and development expenses increased million to million in fiscal  or  from million in fiscal the increase is primarily related to a million equity payment made to merck associated with the successful completion of the first vilazodone phase iii clinical trials as well as the initiation of the vilazodone phase iii confirmatory and safety trials 
during fiscal  we recorded a million equity milestone charge for manufacturing rights acquired from merck 
sales and marketing expense 
sales and marketing expenses increased million to million in fiscal  or  from million in fiscal the increase was due primarily to the development of a new sales and marketing function within pgxhealth  including the hiring of a new sales force and senior level sales and marketing management 
in addition  stock based compensation expense charged to sales and marketing expense was  in fiscal compared to in fiscal 
table of contents general and administrative expense 
general and administrative expenses increased million to million in fiscal  or  from million in fiscal the increase was primarily the result of the increase in stock based compensation expense charged to general and administrative expense of million in fiscal to million from million in fiscal interest and other income expense  net 
interest expense decreased  from  in fiscal to  in fiscal interest income increased million from  in fiscal to million in fiscal as a result of the financing transaction completed in july for net proceeds of million  we invested our cash not required to fund current operations in interest bearing assets 
other income  net increased  to  in fiscal from  in fiscal liquidity and capital resources we had cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities of approximately million at march  our cash flows from operating  investing and financing activities  as reflected in the consolidated statements of cash flows  are summarized in the following table year end march  in thousands cash used in provided by operating activities investing activities financing activities effect of exchange rate increase in cash and cash equivalents significant sources and uses of cash flows during the fiscal year ended march  were as follows in february  we completed a million convertible debt financing 
in october concurrent with the avalon merger agreement  we entered into the following transactions with avalon purchased million shares of avalon s common stock for entered into a royalty free  fully paid  worldwide  perpetual  irrevocable  sub licensable  exclusive license agreement to use the avalonrx platform for a one time access fee of million  and funded a million term loan payable may   as amended 
in september  we sold approximately million shares of our common stock for net proceeds of million 
in august  we acquired adenosine therapeutic for approximately million in cash  net of  purchase price adjustment 
our total debt obligations were million at march  
table of contents the following table summarizes our contractual obligations at march   excluding the cogenics segment  and the effects such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flows in future periods payments due by period fiscal fiscal through through after total fiscal fiscal fiscal fiscal in thousands contractual obligations short and long term debt capital lease obligations operating lease obligations total contractual cash obligations excludes the obligations of our cogenics segment  which was sold on april  includes interest expense currently  we do not enter into financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
during fiscal  we made capital expenditures of approximately million primarily to introduce new products  improve production processing of existing and planned product offerings and to upgrade our laboratory information systems 
our sources of liquidity as of march  include our cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities balance of approximately million 
this amount does not include approximately million from the sale of our cogenics segment  which closed on april  our projected uses of cash include cash used to fund operations  capital expenditures  existing debt service costs and continued research and product development 
we believe that our cash and cash availability will be sufficient to fund our operations at least through december we will need additional funds to continue development of vilazodone and stedivaze beyond december the sale of any equity or debt securities may result in additional dilution to our stockholders  and we cannot be certain that additional financing will be available in amounts or on terms acceptable to us  if at all 
if we are unable to obtain financing  we may be required to reduce the scope and timing of the planned clinical and pre clinical programs  which could harm our financial condition and operating results 
off balance sheet arrangements we do not have any special purpose entities or other off balance sheet arrangements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risks  which include changes in interest rates  changes in credit worthiness and liquidity of our marketable securities 
interest rate risk we use a combination of fixed rate term loans and fixed rate leases to partially finance our activities 
our long term debt and capital leases are all at fixed rates over their lives and carry no interest rate risk 
auction rate preferred securities at march   we held auction rate preferred securities  or arps  with a par value of million  which approximates fair value 
the investments at march  consisted of preferred stock issued by closed end mutual funds  none of the auction rate securities in our portfolio are mortgage backed 
the most recent auctions for the arps in our investment portfolio failed 
our goal is to liquidate these securities as soon as possible  however  as 
table of contents a result of the failed auctions we continue to hold these securities and the issuers continue to pay interest at the maximum contractual rate 
based on current market conditions  it is likely that auctions related to these securities will be unsuccessful in the near term 
unsuccessful auctions will result in our holding these securities beyond their next scheduled auction reset dates  thus limiting the short term liquidity of these investments 
while these failures in the auction process have affected our ability to access these funds in the near term  we do not believe that the underlying securities or collateral have been adversely impacted 
we believe that the higher reset rates on failed auctions provide sufficient incentive for the security issuers to address this lack of liquidity 
if the credit rating of the security issuers deteriorates or the liquidity issues persist  we may be required to adjust the carrying value of these investments through an impairment charge 
based on our ability to access our cash  our expected operating cash flows  and our available credit lines  we do not anticipate the current lack of liquidity in these investments to have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operation
