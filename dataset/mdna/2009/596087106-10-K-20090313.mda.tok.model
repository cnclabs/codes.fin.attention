item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations for a detailed discussion of our research and development expenses 
pulsys product candidates we intend to develop the pulsys technology based drugs listed above and any that we may develop in the future  with the intention of incorporating one or more of the following therapeutic advantages once a day formulation  shorter duration of therapy  lower dose  reduced side effect profile  improved pediatric dosage form  and combination product with superior efficacy over either drug alone 
products that incorporate one or more of these attributes have the potential to provide increased convenience and possibly increased patient compliance 
our drug product candidates primarily represent improved versions of approved and marketed drugs  either delivered alone or in combination with other drugs 
because these existing drugs have already been approved for marketing by the fda  we anticipate being able to rely  in part  on the fda s prior findings regarding the safety and or efficacy of these existing drugs when seeking fda approval of our pulsys product candidates 
for example  based on meetings with the fda regarding the study program for moxatag  we filed our nda via the b regulatory pathway  which relied in part on the fda s prior findings regarding the safety and efficacy of amoxicillin

keflex cephalexin pulsys 
we are developing a once daily pulsys version of keflex  our first generation oral cephalosporin antibiotic product 
we are in the early stages of preparing for a phase iii clinical trial for our keflex pulsys product candidate  and we continue to evaluate the extent of work to be performed on this product based upon our financial resources and the successful commercialization of moxatag 
our intent is to develop a once daily keflex pulsys product for skin and skin structure infections to increase patient convenience and compliance for cephalexin therapy 
cephalexin is the antibiotic most frequently prescribed by physicians for the treatment of skin and skin structure infections  and the most common dosing regimen is mg three times per day for a period of ten days  according to ims health  national disease and therapeutic index tm there is currently no fda approved once daily cephalexin product and we believe a once daily version of keflex pulsys may represent a substantial market opportunity 
in  cephalexin  the active ingredient in keflex  was the fourth most prescribed antibiotic in the united states  with approximately million prescriptions according to ims health  national prescription audit tm we have completed a total of six keflex pulsys phase i clinical studies  evaluating various formulations and components of a proposed pulsys formulation dosed in more than healthy volunteer subjects 
based on the results from our phase i studies  we finalized the formulation development phase i program for our keflex pulsys product candidate 
we are in the early stages of preparing for a phase iii clinical trial for our keflex pulsys product candidate for the treatment of skin and skin structure infections in adults and adolescents due to susceptible staphylococcus aureus and or streptococcus pyogenes 
we expect to begin enrolling patients in our phase iii clinical trial in early the design of the clinical trial is on going and we plan to gain agreement with the fda  on the trial s design  prior to enrollment 
our work on this phase iii clinical trial is dependent on the availability of funds and the successful launch of moxatag 
while we cannot predict the exact start or completion dates of this phase iii clinical trial  we would anticipate that the clinical trial and regulatory approval process  assuming a positive outcome and fda approval of the clinical trial  should take approximately three years from the start of patient enrollment in the clinical trial 
we refer to this product candidate as keflex pulsys  but there is no guarantee the fda will accept or approve this name for use with the marketed product  if approved 
amoxicillin pediatric pulsys sprinkle program 
in addition to our amoxicillin pulsys formulation to treat pharyngitis in adults and pediatric patients age and older our fda approved moxatag  we have a product development candidate a sprinkle formulation  intended for pediatric patients age two and older 
our pediatric pulsys sprinkle product s formulation is similar to moxatag  however  it is dosed in multiparticulate granules which can be sprinkled over food 
survey results from patients and caregivers utilizing our pediatric sprinkle product suggest that its convenience and transportability may be beneficial features of our sprinkle formulation 
we believe the market opportunity for a pediatric strep throat product is substantial  as almost one third of the strep throat market is believed to be represented by pediatric patients  according to ims health  national prescription audit tm and national disease and therapeutic index tm in  approximately million prescriptions were written for pediatric amoxicillin  according to ims health  national prescription audit tm the further development of this pediatric pulsys sprinkle product candidate is dependent upon commercialization of moxatag and our having adequate financial resources available 
in  we concluded a phase iii clinical trial evaluating our once daily amoxicillin pediatric pulsys sprinkle product for seven days in pediatric patients with pharyngitis tonsillitis  or strep throat which did not achieve its desired clinical endpoints 
however  we believe there is potential for us to pursue a pulsys version of amoxicillin for the treatment of pediatric patients with strep throat through a redesigned clinical trial program 
based on the results from our phase i studies and previously conducted phase iii clinical trials in pediatrics and adults  we intend to evaluate the safety and efficacy of various daily doses and durations of treatment for our pediatric pulsys sprinkle product candidate in a phase ii study  should we have sufficient capital and other resources to do so 
as part of our fda approval of moxatag on january   in adults and pediatric patients years and older and in accordance with the requirements of the pediatric research equity act  we received from the fda a deferral to further evaluate our product candidate for pediatric patients with pharyngitis and or tonsillitis as part of a post marketing commitment 
should the results of the phase ii study support proceeding into phase iii  we plan to conduct a phase iii trial in this population 
we agreed to submit a completed study report and data set for our pediatric amoxicillin product candidate in pediatric patients between the ages of two and by march if the results of the phase ii study do not support proceeding into phase iii  we may file a request for a waiver for the further assessment of the safety and effectiveness of the product in this population 
other possible pulsatile product candidates 
our current focus is on antibiotic product candidates that include amoxicillin and cephalexin 
we have also identified additional product candidates that we believe could be developed with our pulsatile delivery technology 
furthermore  when we reinitiate our research and development efforts  additional or alternative compounds may be selected to replace or supplement the compounds described above 
the timing of further development work on these candidates depends on the successful launch of moxatag  our financial and other resources  as well as our evaluation of these products commercial potential 
we have previously conducted preclinical studies evaluating the bacterial killing efficiency of several antibiotics and antibiotic combinations dosed in a pulsatile manner 
based on these studies  along with the consultation of our scientific advisors  we believe we may be able to utilize our pulsys technology to target some of the most common uses of antibiotics 
these include sinusitis  chronic bronchitis  acute otitis media  urinary tract infections  and community acquired methicillin resistant staphylococcus aureus mrsa 
we may also explore the use of our pulsatile dosing approach beyond antibiotics to other therapeutic categories  such as antivirals and antifungals  in the event that we have sufficient financial and other resources to do so 
although we have not tested the effectiveness of pulsatile dosing for these applications  we believe that our approach may yield benefits similar to those we have found for the treatment of bacterial infections 
we have currently placed all of these development programs on hold  and any plans for additional studies regarding these  or any other possible product candidates  will be dependent on the successful commercialization of moxatag and our having adequate financial resources 
patent and intellectual property protection our success depends in part on our ability to obtain patents  to protect trade secrets  to operate without infringing upon the proprietary rights of others and to prevent others from infringing on our proprietary rights 
we seek to protect our proprietary position by  among other methods  filing us and foreign patent applications related to our proprietary technology  inventions and improvements that are important to the development of our business 
furthermore  all of our employees have executed agreements assigning to us all rights to any inventions and processes they develop while they are employed by us 
in addition  we may use license agreements to access external products and technologies  as well as to convey our own intellectual property to others 
we will be able to protect our proprietary rights from unauthorized use by third parties only to the extent that our proprietary rights are covered by valid and enforceable patents or are effectively maintained as trade secrets 
protection of our intellectual property rights is subject to a number of risks 
number of patents 
we currently own issued us patents  pending us patent applications and four foreign issued patents 
our issued patents cover certain compositions and methods using pulsatile dosing 
we also own foreign filed patent applications  which correspond to our us patents and applications 
we also own one international pct patent application  which we anticipate converting into several individually foreign filed patent applications to further correspond to our us patents and applications 
multi level patent strategy for pulsys 
we have implemented a multi level patent strategy in order to protect our approved and potential future pulsatile drug products 
the first level is composed of umbrella patents and patent applications directed to application of the pulsys technology to general classes of anti infective drugs  such as antibiotics  antivirals  antifungals and anti cancer agents 
the second level is composed of sub umbrella patents and patent applications  directed to the application of the pulsys technology to subclasses of drugs  such as beta lactam antibiotics with enzyme inhibitors 
the third level includes patents and applications directed to the application of the pulsys technology to specific antibiotics 
expiration dates for key patents 
our general pulsys antibiotic patents were issued in and  and will continue to run for a number of years 
the earliest patent expiration is in october no royalties on pulsys patents 
we have developed our pulsys technology in house  and we have retained full ownership of our patents 
thus  we owe no royalties to any third party for utilizing the pulsys technology in our products 
however  we do owe certain royalties to eli lilly for use of the keflex trademarks we acquired from them in june for more information on the keflex trademark royalties  see item business our approved and marketed products keflex cephalexin  usp capsules 
we may rely  in some circumstances  on trade secrets to protect our technology 
however  trade secrets can be difficult to protect 
we seek to protect our proprietary technology and processes  in part  by confidentiality agreements with our employees  consultants  scientific advisors and contractors 
we also seek to preserve the integrity and confidentiality of our data and trade secrets by maintaining physical security of our premises and by maintaining the physical and electronic security of our information technology systems 
while we have confidence in these individuals  organizations and systems  agreements or security measures may be breached  and we may not have adequate remedies for any breach 
in addition  our trade secrets may otherwise become known or be independently discovered by competitors 
to the extent that our consultants  contractors or collaborators use intellectual property owned by others in their work for us  disputes may arise as to the rights in related or resulting know how and inventions 
keflex  middlebrook  middlebrook pharmaceuticals stylized  middlebrook pharmaceuticals  inc  m stylized  mox  moxakit  moxatag stylized  moxatag  moxaten  mox pak and pulsys are our trademarks and have been registered in the us patent and trademark office or are the subject of pending us trademarks applications 
sales and marketing following the receipt of fda approval for moxatag in january  and the investment by egi mbrk  llc in our equity in september  we are focusing our organization s efforts on the commercialization of moxatag 
to that end  we have expanded our marketing and sales departments in preparation for the launch of moxatag in march our new sales and marketing campaign is designed to educate physicians  pharmacists and other healthcare professional on the benefits of our products and to encourage them to recommend our products to their patients 
our physician marketing efforts for moxatag and keflex will focus on primary care physicians and pharmacists 
historically  we used an innovex contract sales force for the promotion of keflex mg capsules 
in november  we terminated our agreement with innovex  and we began to hire an internal  dedicated field sales force to prepare for the launch of moxatag 
our approximately person field sales force and district sales managers will detail moxatag and keflex mg to approximately  primary care physicians and  pharmacies 
we believe these healthcare professionals have traditionally written most of the prescriptions for products similar to ours 
if we successfully market moxatag  and develop and receive regulatory approval to market additional product candidates  we believe we will have to substantially expand our sales and marketing capabilities and or enter into partnerships with other pharmaceutical companies to successfully commercialize our product candidates 
our future profitability will depend in part on our ability to successfully recruit additional sales and marketing personnel and expand our sales and marketing infrastructure to successfully commercialize any additional products or product candidates that we develop  acquire or license 
trade sales and distribution 
keflex is primarily sold directly to wholesalers 
however  we believe that moxatag will be sold directly to food and drug chains in addition to drug wholesalers 
a limited number of major wholesalers account for a majority of our sales 
product sales of keflex to cardinal health inc  mckesson corporation  and amerisourcebergen corporation represented approximately and of our net revenue from keflex in fiscal years and  respectively 
consistent with industry practice  we maintain a return policy that allows our customers to return product within a specified period prior and subsequent to the expiration date of the product label 
occasionally  we also provide extended payment terms and greater discounts to our customers to ensure adequate distribution of our products 
our trade sales department calls on national and regional drug  food and mass merchandiser retail accounts 
the primary focus of our trade sales effort is to ensure availability of our products on pharmacy shelves to support the efforts of our professional field sales representatives 
in  we entered into a distribution and logistics agreement with integrated commercialization solutions  a division of amerisourcebergen corporation  or ics 
under this agreement  ics is responsible for warehouse inventory operations  logistics  shipping  billing and customer collections on a fee for services basis 
ics also serves as the exclusive distribution agent for commercial sales of keflex and moxatag 
seasonality 
aminopenicillin antibiotics experience seasonality with prescriptions peaking between october and march  according to ims health  national prescription audit tm 
we do not believe that the cephalexin antibiotic market experiences any seasonality 
competition the pharmaceutical industry is highly competitive and characterized by a number of established  large pharmaceutical companies  as well as smaller emerging companies 
our main competitors are large pharmaceutical companies  such as pfizer  glaxosmithkline  wyeth  bristol myers squibb  merck  johnson johnson  roche  schering plough  novartis  sanofi aventis  abbott laboratories  astrazeneca  and bayer  which may develop new drug compounds that render our drugs obsolete or noncompetitive 
smaller pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies and specialty pharmaceutical companies engaged in focused research and development of anti infective drugs  such as trimeris  vertex  gilead sciences  cubist  basilea  intermune  oscient  king  advanced life sciences  and others 
drug delivery companies  such as johnson johnson s alza division  biovail  depomed  flamel technologies  and skyepharma  which may develop a dosing regimen that is more effective than pulsatile dosing 
generic drug companies  such as teva  ranbaxy  sandoz and stada  which produce low cost versions of antibiotics that may contain the same active pharmaceutical ingredients as our pulsys product candidates 
there are many approved antibiotics available to treat bacterial conditions in the united states 
our marketed keflex and moxatag products  and our developmental products  will compete with other available products based primarily on efficacy  safety  tolerability  acceptance by doctors  patient compliance and acceptance  patent protection  convenience  price  insurance and other reimbursement coverage  distribution  marketing  and adaptability to various modes of dosing 
our keflex brand of cephalexin faces significant competition from generic distributors of cephalexin capsules and suspensions 
currently  a significant portion of the prescriptions written for our keflex mg and mg capsules are substituted at the pharmacy with generic versions of keflex  supplied through leading generic drug manufacturers including teva  stada  ranbaxy  and others 
in addition  our keflex mg capsules are not patent protected and thus would be subject to similar competition from generic versions of keflex mg capsules if and when generic drug manufacturers decide to pursue the manufacture and marketing approvals required for a generic mg strength cephalexin product 
in some instances  moxatag and our development products that utilize our pulsys technology may compete against non pulsys drug products that share the same active ingredient  but are less convenient or require more cumbersome administration schedules 
a number of these non pulsys drug products are available in generic form  which are usually substantially less expensive than the branded version 
for example  a number of retailers offer generic amoxicillin  the active pharmaceutical ingredient in moxatag  for free or at significantly lower prices than moxatag 
companies such as teva  ranbaxy  sandoz  stada  and others are major manufacturers and distributors of generic versions of antibiotics that may compete with our existing and future products 
new developments  including the development of methods for preventing the incidence of disease  such as vaccines  occur rapidly in the pharmaceutical industry 
these developments may render our product candidates or technologies obsolete or noncompetitive 
many of our competitors possess greater financial  managerial and technical resources and have established reputations for successfully developing and marketing drugs  all of which put us at a competitive disadvantage 
our competitors may be able to apply their resources and capabilities to develop and commercialize products that have distinct  enhanced  or perceived advantages versus our products 
the competitors may be in a position to devote greater resources in the sales  marketing  and distribution of these products and therefore considerably impact our ability to successfully commercialize our own products 
manufacturing manufacture and packaging 
we currently rely on third party contract manufacturers to produce sufficient quantities of our product candidates for use in our preclinical studies and clinical trials  and to produce sufficient quantities of commercial supplies of our marketed products and product samples 
we believe that our initial focus on the production of improved formulations of approved and marketed drugs will reduce the risk and time involved in the development of manufacturing capabilities because production of these drugs involves well established and well accepted manufacturing techniques and processes 
we intend to continue to rely upon third party contract manufacturers for the production of our clinical and commercial supplies for products and product candidates 
the use of third parties for these activities allows us to minimize our initial capital investment and reduce the risks associated with the establishment of our own commercial manufacturing and distribution operations 
we maintain internal quality control  regulatory affairs and product planning resources to oversee the activities of these third party manufacturers 
in december  we entered into a commercial supply agreement with patheon to manufacture our keflex brand of products 
patheon informed us that it would be closing its puerto rico site which manufactured our keflex immediate release products and that it would manufacture enough keflex to meet our commercial needs for approximately months 
we received our final order of keflex from patheon in february we are actively pursuing a third party manufacturer for our keflex products  but we cannot guarantee we will have a manufacturer site qualified by the fda prior to selling all of our currently available keflex inventory 
in april  we entered into agreements under which stada production ireland limited  or spi  previously known as the manufacturing division of clonmel healthcare limited  a subsidiary of stada arzneimittel ag  provides us with commercial supply of our moxatag product 
spi has capacity in place to cover current projected needs  with additional capacity for growth 
in addition  we have entered into various ancillary agreements whereby spi provided technology transfer  clinical stability batch manufacturing  commercial scale up and validation services 
as part of our agreement with spi  we funded the facility build out and equipment additions to support our commercial manufacturing program at spi s facilities 
in december  we entered into a three year packaging agreement with almac pharma services limited to handle the packaging of our moxatag samples 
to date  we have received all trade and physician sample materials of moxatag ordered to support the commercial launch of moxatag 
in connection with our third party manufacturing and clinical activities  we generate hazardous waste 
we are subject to various regulations regarding the disposal of hazardous and potentially hazardous waste 
we may incur costs to comply with such regulations now or in the future 
raw material sourcing agreements 
we depend upon dsm anti infectives bv  or dsm  for all amoxicillin used in moxatag and for all cephalexin used in our keflex products 
we believe that dsm will provide us with sufficient quantities of amoxicillin and cephalexin to meet our current manufacturing needs for the next twelve months 
we are actively pursuing additional suppliers of both amoxicillin and cephalexin for use in our products and product candidates 
product candidates 
we obtain active pharmaceutical ingredients and finished products from certain specialized manufacturers for use in clinical studies 
although the antibiotics and finished products we use in our clinical studies may generally be obtained from several suppliers  the loss of a supplier could result in delays in conducting or completing our clinical trials and could delay our ability to commercialize products 
collaboration agreements we currently have no active collaboration agreements 
we have previously been a party to collaborations with glaxosmithkline  or gsk  and par pharmaceuticals  or par 
termination of our collaboration with par pharmaceutical for amoxicillin pulsys 
in may  we entered into an agreement with par to collaborate on the further development and commercialization of a pulsys based amoxicillin product 
under the terms of the agreement  we conducted the development program  including manufacturing clinical supplies and conducting clinical trials  and were responsible for obtaining regulatory approval for the product 
we were to own the product trademark and to manufacture or arrange for supply of the product for commercial sales 
par was to be the sole distributor of the product 
both parties were to share commercialization expenses  including pre marketing costs and promotion costs  on an equal basis 
operating profits from sales of the product were also to be shared on an equal basis 
under the agreement  we received an upfront fee of million and a commitment from par to fund all further development expenses 
development expenses incurred by us were to be partially funded by quarterly payments from par aggregating million over the period of july through october  of which up to million was contingently refundable 
on august   we were notified by par of its decision to terminate the amoxicillin pulsys collaboration agreement 
under certain circumstances  the termination clauses of the agreement may entitle par to receive a share of net profits up to one half of their million funding of the development of certain amoxicillin pulsys products  should the products covered by the agreement be successfully commercialized 
termination of the collaboration with gsk 
in july  we entered into a license agreement with gsk pursuant to which we licensed patents and pulsys technology to gsk for use with its augmentin amoxicillin clavulanate combination products and with limited other amoxicillin products 
under the agreement  gsk was responsible  at its cost and expense  to use commercially reasonable efforts for the clinical development  manufacture and sale of the licensed products 
we received an initial non refundable payment of million from gsk upon signing of the agreement  and a million payment upon achievement of the first milestone 
our receipt of further milestone payments  royalty payments and sales milestone payments under the agreement depended on the ability of gsk to develop and commercialize the products covered by the agreement and was subject to certain conditions and limitations 
the agreement could be terminated at any time by gsk  which it elected to do with an effective date of december  as a result of the termination  we accelerated the recognition of the remaining deferred revenue of approximately million related to the collaboration during the fourth quarter of the termination had no other effects on our financial position 
collaboration with par pharmaceutical for generic clarithromycin 
in september  we entered into an agreement pursuant to which we licensed to par the distribution and marketing rights to our generic formulation of abbott s biaxin xl extended release clarithromycin 
during the third quarter of  we conducted bioequivalence studies on two revised formulations of the generic product  with both formulations failing to achieve bioequivalence 
we concluded that due to the non core nature of the product  the expense involved in the development of additional formulations  and the reduced market potential given the emergence of competing products  we would discontinue further development work on the product 
keflex agreements deerfield transaction on november   we entered into a series of agreements with deerfield management  and certain of its affiliates  which provided for a potential capital raise of up to million in cash 
the agreement included provisions for two potential closings  with the first closing occurring upon the execution of the agreements for million in gross proceeds  less million in transaction expenses and the second closing for an additional million in gross proceeds occurring at our option  contingent upon fda approval of moxatag 
first closing 
at the transaction s first closing  we sold certain assets  including keflex product inventories  and assigned certain intellectual property rights  relating only to our existing  immediate release cephalexin business  to two deerfield affiliates  kef pharmaceuticals  inc  or kef  and lex pharmaceuticals  inc  or lex 
under the terms of the agreement  we received million on november   and reimbursed deerfield million for transaction related expenses 
approximately million of those proceeds were used to fully repay the outstanding merrill lynch capital loan balance  with the remainder available for general corporate purposes 
pursuant to a consignment of those assets and the license of those intellectual property rights back to us  we continued to operate our existing cephalexin business  subject to consignment and royalty payments to deerfield of of net sales  subject to a minimum quarterly payment of million 
in addition  we granted to deerfield a six year warrant to purchase million shares of our common stock at per share  the closing market price on november  second closing 
the agreements provided for a second closing  at our option until june  we did not exercise the option for a second closing  and permitted the option to expire on june  repurchase right 
deerfield also granted us the right to repurchase all of the assets and rights sold and licensed by us to deerfield by purchasing all of the outstanding capital stock of both kef and lex on or before june  in accordance with the terms of the agreement  upon payment of a million extension fee  the right to repurchase the assets was extended to december  on september   pursuant to an agreement with deerfield dated july   we exercised this repurchase right and purchased all of the outstanding capital stock of kef and lex for million the million extension fee was applied against this purchase price  plus the value of the assets of the entities including cash and inventory  and we redeemed deerfield s warrant to purchase million shares of our common stock 
these repurchases were funded with a portion of the proceeds received from the egi transactions 
for a description of the egi transaction  see management overview of the key developments in in part ii  item government regulation we are subject to extensive pre and post market regulation by the fda  including regulations that govern the testing  manufacturing  safety  efficacy  labeling  storage  record keeping  advertising  and promotion of drugs promulgated under the federal food  drug  and cosmetic act and the public health service act and by comparable agencies in foreign countries 
fda approval is required before any new drug can be legally marketed in the united states 
new drug application process 
the process required by the fda before a new drug may be marketed in the united states generally involves completion of preclinical laboratory and animal testing  submission of an investigational new drug application  which must become effective before the commencement of clinical trials  performance of adequate and well controlled human clinical trials to establish the safety and efficacy of the proposed drug product s intended use  and submission to and approval by the fda of an nda which includes inspection of manufacturing facilities 
preclinical preclinical studies generally include laboratory evaluation of product chemistry  formulation and stability  as well as animal studies  to assess the safety and efficacy of the product 
preclinical trials also provide a basis for design of human clinical studies 
human clinical trials are typically conducted in three sequential phases which may overlap phase i during typical phase i studies  the drug is initially introduced into healthy human subjects and tested for safety  dosage tolerance  absorption  metabolism  distribution and excretion 
phase ii during phase ii studies  the drug is introduced to patients that have the medical condition that the drug is intended to treat 
phase ii studies generally are intended to identify possible adverse effects and safety risks  to determine the efficacy of the product for specific targeted diseases and to determine dosage tolerance and optimal dosage 
phase ii studies are sometimes combined with phase i studies referred to as phase i ii studies in certain instances when safety issues and questions of absorption  metabolism  distribution and excretion are well established 
phase iii when phase ii evaluations suggest that a dosage range of the product is effective and has an acceptable safety profile  phase iii trials are undertaken to further evaluate dosage  clinical efficacy and to further test for safety in an expanded patient population  often at geographically dispersed clinical study sites 
the drug sponsor  the fda or the institutional review board at each institution at which a clinical trial is being performed may suspend a clinical trial at any time for various reasons  including a concern that the subjects are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk 
the results of product development  preclinical studies and human studies are submitted to the fda as part of the nda 
the nda also must contain extensive manufacturing information 
the fda may approve the nda or issue a complete response letter if applicable fda regulatory criteria are not satisfied or if additional data  including clinical data  are required to demonstrate the safety or effectiveness of the drug 
abbreviated new drug applications  or anda 
an anda is an application for approval of a generic drug 
the application is based on a showing of bioequivalence to an already approved drug product 
andas do not contain full reports of safety and effectiveness as required in ndas but rather demonstrate that their proposed products are the same as reference products with regard to their conditions of use  active ingredients  route of administration  dosage form  strength  and labeling 
anda applicants must demonstrate the bioequivalence of their products to the reference product 
bioequivalence generally means that no significant difference exists in the rate and extent to which the active ingredients enter the blood stream and become available at the site of drug action 
bioequivalence  however  does not mean that the products must be identical in all respects 
furthermore  the fda has broad discretion to determine whether a product meets the anda approval standards 
drugs approved in this way are commonly referred to as generic equivalents to the listed drug  and can often be substituted by pharmacists filling prescriptions written for the original listed drug 
b applications 
as an alternate path to fda approval for new or improved formulations of previously approved products  a company may submit a section b nda 
section b of the federal food  drug  cosmetic act permits the submission of an nda where at least some of the information required for approval comes from studies not conducted by or for the applicant and for which the applicant has not obtained a right of reference 
in other words  the applicant can rely upon fda s previous findings of safety and efficacy for an approved product and or published literature for related products  whether or not approved  and only perform those additional studies or measurements that are needed to support the change from the referenced product 
in our nda submissions  we intend to rely  in part  on prior fda approvals of the antibiotic ingredients used in our products and on data generated by other parties which help to demonstrate the safety and effectiveness of those ingredients 
in the case of products that we may develop in conjunction with sponsors of previously approved products  we expect that we will have a specific right of reference to the data contained in the prior applications and submit a traditional nda 
in any case in which we do not have a specific right of reference from the sponsor of the previously approved product  we anticipate that we will submit section b ndas 
all data necessary to demonstrate the safety and effectiveness of our own versions of these products will have to be generated by or for us and submitted to the fda in support of our applications 
these data are expected to include data establishing the safety and efficacy of the pulsatile dosage form and any other differences between the dosage form and the conditions for use of our products and the dosage form and conditions for use of the previously approved products 
paragraph iv certifications 
to the extent that an anda applicant or section b applicant is relying on previous fda findings for an already approved product  the applicant is required to certify to the fda concerning any patents listed for the approved product in the fda s orange book  as defined below 
specifically  the applicant must certify that i the required patent information has not been filed  ii the listed patent has expired  iii the listed patent has not expired  but will expire on a particular date and approval is sought after patent expiration  or iv the listed patent is invalid or will not be infringed by the new product 
a certification that the new product will not infringe the already approved product s listed patents or that such patents are invalid is called a paragraph iv certification 
absent a paragraph iv certification  the anda or section b nda will not be approved until all the listed patents claiming the referenced product have expired  including any applicable period of non patent market exclusivity 
if the anda applicant or section b applicant has provided a paragraph iv certification to the fda  the applicant must also send notice of the paragraph iv certification to the nda and patent holders once the anda or section b application has been accepted for filing by the fda 
the nda and patent holders may then initiate a patent infringement lawsuit in response to the notice of the paragraph iv certification 
the filing of a patent infringement lawsuit within days of the receipt of notice of a paragraph iv certification automatically prevents the fda from approving the anda or section b application until the earlier of months after notice of a paragraph iv certification is received by the nda or patent holders  expiration of the patent and any applicable period of patent exclusivity  settlement of the lawsuit or a decision in the infringement case that is favorable to the anda applicant or b applicant 
the anda or section b application also will not be approved until any applicable non patent market exclusivity  such as exclusivity for obtaining approval of a new chemical entity  listed in the orange book for the referenced product has expired or is otherwise waived by the reference product holder 
the orange book is the means by which the fda identifies products it has approved on the basis of safety and efficacy under section of the federal food  drug and cosmetic act  and attached in an addendum to the orange book are any applicable periods of patent and non patent market exclusivity for those fda approved drugs 
a new law  enacted late in  extended certain of these patent and exclusivity benefits to older antibiotics that were historically excluded from these provisions of the federal food  drug  and cosmetic act 
amoxicillin and cephalexin are older antibiotics covered by this new law 
as such  we may be eligible for three year exclusivity for these drugs if applicable legal and regulatory requirements are met 
in addition  transition provisions included in the new law permitted us to list certain patents associated with moxatag in the orange book  thereby requiring that any applicant seeking approval of an anda  or section b version of moxatag would have to certify to these patents 
in late  after the enactment of the new law  we submitted and the fda listed in the orange book three patents covering moxatag 
moreover  if we submit future b ndas that rely on previous approvals of old antibiotics for which there are orange book listed patents  then we would have to certify to any patents listed in the orange book for those products 
to date  we have not received notice from a generic applicant that an anda or a b application containing a paragraph iv certification with respect to an orange book listed patent for moxatag has been submitted to fda 
if an anda or a b applicant later submits an application to fda containing a paragraph iv certification to such an orange book listed patent  and if we timely sue for patent infringement within the statutory day period  then we believe we will be entitled to a month stay 
our keflex mg product currently does not have any period of patent or non patent protection listed in the fda s orange book 
because there are no orange book listed patents  we do not know whether an anda or a b application has been submitted to the fda for a generic or modified version of our keflex mg product 
if we subsequently submit an nda for a new use for keflex  moxatag  or our pediatric pulsys sprinkle product candidate those could qualify for three year exclusivity  or if there is an applicable patent covering the drug product  then we will take the necessary steps to ensure that the fda s orange book reflects this 
should we obtain the fda s approval for our line extension of keflex  currently termed keflex pulsys  then we will take the necessary steps to ensure that the fda s orange book reflects any applicable period of patent or non patent market exclusivity 
in the case of antibiotic ingredients not previously approved in the combinations that we propose  it will also be necessary for us to satisfy the fda s fixed dose combination drug regulations with data establishing that each active component contributes to the effectiveness of the combination and that the dosage of each component is such that the combination is safe and effective for a significant patient population requiring such concurrent therapy 
this policy typically requires very large clinical trials that test each antibiotic alone and in combination 
no assurance can be given that ndas submitted for our products will receive fda approval on a timely basis  or at all 
under the prescription drug user fee act  or pdufa  generally  the submission of an nda is subject to substantial application user fees  currently  for an application requiring clinical data  and one half of an application fee  for an application not requiring clinical data and a supplement requiring clinical data  and the manufacturer and or sponsor under an approved nda are also subject to annual product and establishment user fees  currently  per product and  per establishment 
these fees are typically increased annually 
in addition  the pdufa statute has been subject to significant amendments in connection with its regular reauthorization 
we are not in a position to predict whether and how the user fee requirements will be interpreted and applied to us and our products in the future 
other regulatory constraints 
in addition to the results of product development  preclinical animal studies and clinical human studies  an nda also must contain extensive information on the chemistry  manufacturing and controls that relate to the planned routine production and testing of the drug 
an nda must also contain proposed prescribing information for the product  supported by available clinical and other testing data  describing how the product may properly be used 
the fda may approve  deny approval or grant conditional approval depending on whether it finds that information provided sufficiently addresses all issues regarding the manufacture and proposed use of the product candidate 
both prior to and subsequent to approval of a product  the federal food  drug  and cosmetic act and fda regulations require that the manufacture and testing of any drug for investigational use or for commercial use in humans be manufactured in accordance with current good manufacturing practice  or cgmp 
regulatory authorities  including the fda  periodically inspect manufacturing facilities to assess compliance with cgmp 
our failure or that of our contract manufacturer  to follow cgmp requirements  as well as other regulatory requirements  can subject a sponsor and its products to various sanctions  including  but not limited to delay in approving or refusal to approve a product  product recall or seizure  suspension or withdrawal of an approved product from the market  interruption of production  operating restrictions  warning letters  injunctions  fines and other monetary penalties  criminal prosecutions  and unanticipated expenditures 
we have used  and intend to continue to use  third party firms that we believe are knowledgeable and qualified in compliance with cgmp requirements to manufacture and test our product candidates and  to the extent that we engage in these activities on our own behalf  intend to utilize cgmp compliant procedures and controls 
there can be no assurance  however  that we or our contractors will be and remain at all times in full compliance with all cgmp requirements 
furthermore  the testing  manufacturing  labeling  safety  advertising  promotion  storage  sales  distribution  export and marketing  among other things  of our products  after approval  is subject to extensive regulation by governmental authorities 
the marketing practices of all us pharmaceutical manufacturers are subject to federal and state healthcare laws that are used to protect the integrity of government funded healthcare programs 
a number of laws and related regulations  loosely referred to as fraud and abuse laws  are used to prosecute healthcare providers  suppliers  physicians and others that fraudulently or wrongfully obtain reimbursement for healthcare products or services 
these laws apply broadly and may constrain our business and the financial arrangements through which we market  sell and distribute our products 
the anti kickback provisions of the federal social security act prohibit the exchange of anything of value with the intent to induce referrals of patients or purchases  leases  orders  arrangements  or recommendations of any items or services reimbursable by a federal healthcare program such as medicare or medicaid 
the statute imputes liability to both sides of an impermissible transaction and will cover any arrangement where one purpose of the arrangement is to obtain money for the referral of covered services or items 
there are safe harbors provisions under the anti kickback statute that shield from prosecution certain common business arrangements that might otherwise technically violate the statute 
safe harbor protection is afforded  however  only to those arrangements that precisely meet all of the conditions set forth in the safe harbor 
many legitimate arrangements may not fully meet the requirements of the safe harbor provisions 
additionally  the federal false claims act prohibits the submission of false or fraudulent claims or any other documents in support of a false or fraudulent claim for payment by government programs  commercial insurers  and other healthcare plans 
under the false claims act  it is illegal to make or induce someone else to make a false claim for reimbursement from the federal government for pharmaceutical products 
various states have enacted laws and regulations comparable to the federal fraud and abuse laws and regulations 
if our operations are found to be in violation of any of the laws and regulations described above or any other law or regulation to which we or our customers are or will be subject  we may be subject to civil and criminal penalties  damages  fines  exclusion from the medicare and medicaid programs and the curtailment or restructuring of our operations 
any penalties  damages  fines  curtailment or restructuring of our operations would adversely affect our ability to operate our business and our financial results 
any action against us for violation of these laws  even if we successfully defend against it  could cause us to incur significant legal expenses  divert our management s attention from the operation of our business and damage our reputation 
in addition  the distribution of prescription pharmaceutical products is subject to the prescription drug marketing act  or pdma  which regulates the distribution of drugs and drug samples at the federal level  and sets minimum standards for the registration and regulation of drug distributors by the states 
both the pdma and state laws limit the distribution of prescription pharmaceutical product samples and impose requirements to ensure accountability in distribution 
under the pdma and its implementing regulations  states are permitted to require registration of manufacturers and distributors and adopt regulations limiting the distribution of product samples to licensed practitioners 
the pdma also imposes extensive licensing  personnel recordkeeping  packaging  quantity  labeling  product handling  and facility storage and security requirements to ensure accountability in distribution 
foreign regulatory approval 
although we do not currently market any of our products outside the united states and have no current plans to engage in product commercialization outside the united states  we may decide to do so in the future 
in order to market any product outside of the united states  we would need to comply with numerous and varying regulatory requirements of other countries regarding safety and efficacy and governing  among other things  clinical trials  marketing authorization  commercial sales and distribution of our products 
whether or not we obtain fda approval for a product  we would need to obtain the necessary approvals by the comparable regulatory authorities of foreign countries before we can commence clinical trials or marketing of the product in those countries 
the approval process varies from country to country and can involve additional product testing and additional administrative review periods 
the time required to obtain approval in other countries might differ from and be longer than that required to obtain fda approval 
regulatory approval in one country does not ensure regulatory approval in another  but a failure or delay in obtaining regulatory approval in one country may negatively impact the regulatory process in others 
to date  we have not initiated any discussions with the european medicines agency  or any other foreign regulatory authorities with respect to seeking regulatory approval for any of our products in europe or in any other country outside the united states 
obtaining foreign regulatory approvals would require additional financial resources and in the event we choose to seek those approvals  we would need to raise additional capital 
we cannot assure you that any of our product candidates will prove to be safe or effective  will receive regulatory approvals  or will be successfully commercialized 
pharmaceutical pricing and reimbursement 
our ability to commercialize our products successfully depends in significant part on the availability of adequate financial coverage and reimbursement from third party payors  including  governmental payors such as the medicare and medicaid programs  managed care organizations  or mcos  pharmacy benefits managers  or pbms  and private health insurers 
third party payors are increasingly challenging the prices charged for medicines and examining their cost effectiveness  in addition to their safety  efficacy and ease of use 
due to the share of the patient population covered by mcos  marketing prescription drugs to them and the pbms that serve them is important to our business 
a significant objective of mcos is to contain and  where possible  reduce health care expenditures 
to achieve these objectives  mcos and pbms typically rely upon formularies  volume purchases and long term contracts to negotiate discounts from pharmaceutical companies 
formularies can be based on the prices and therapeutic benefits of the available products 
due to their generally lower cost  mcos and pbms often favor generic drugs 
to successfully compete for business with mcos  pbms and other third party payors  we may need to conduct expensive pharmacoeconomic studies in order to demonstrate that our products offer not only medical benefits but also cost advantages as compared to other forms of care  in addition to the costs required to obtain fda approvals 
even with these studies  our products may be considered less safe  less effective or less cost effective than existing products  and third party payors may decide not to provide coverage and reimbursement for our product candidates  in whole or in part 
if third party payors approve coverage and reimbursement  the resulting payment rates may not be sufficient for us to sell our products at a profit 
political  economic and regulatory influences are subjecting the healthcare industry in the united states to fundamental changes 
there have been  and we expect there will continue to be  legislative and regulatory proposals to change the healthcare system in ways that could significantly affect our business 
we anticipate that the us congress  state legislatures and the private sector will continue to consider and may adopt healthcare policies intended to curb rising healthcare costs 
these cost containment measures could include  for example controls on government funded reimbursement for drugs  controls on payments to healthcare providers that affect demand for drug products  challenges to the pricing of drugs or limits or prohibitions on reimbursement for specific products through other means  weakening of restrictions on imports of drugs  and expansion of use of managed care systems in which healthcare providers contract to provide comprehensive healthcare for a fixed cost per person 
under the medicare part d prescription drug benefit  which took effect in january  medicare beneficiaries can obtain prescription drug coverage from private plans that are permitted to limit the number of prescription drugs that are covered on their formularies in each therapeutic category and class 
under this program  our products may be excluded from formularies and may be subject to significant price competition that depresses the prices we are able to charge 
we believe that it is likely that non medicare plans will follow medicare coverage and reimbursement policies 
outpatient pharmaceuticals sold to state administered medicaid programs are subject to a mandatory national drug rebate program 
in order for a prescription drug to qualify for reimbursement  the medicaid drug rebate program requires the drug manufacturer to enter into a national rebate agreement with the secretary of the department of health and human services 
under the medicaid drug rebate program  a drug provider must pay as a rebate to state medicaid agencies for medicaid recipients purchases of the company s covered drugs the greater of a specific percentage of the average manufacturer price for the drug  or the difference between the average manufacturer price and the best price for the drug 
pharmaceutical companies must also enter into pricing agreements with the us department of veterans affairs as a condition for participating in the medicaid program  and some states may impose supplemental rebate agreements 
we are a party to these types of pricing agreements with respect to our currently marketed products 
pharmaceutical manufacturers participating in the medicaid program must also enter into a second agreement  called a pharmaceutical pricing agreement  as a condition of reimbursement 
under the section b pricing program  manufacturers must make covered outpatient drugs available to certain public health service entities at discounted prices that are approximately equal to the price for such drugs under state medicaid programs after taking into consideration the medicaid rebate 
we may also face competition for our products from lower priced products from foreign countries that have placed price controls on pharmaceutical products 
proposed federal legislative changes may expand consumers ability to purchase imported  lower priced versions of our and competing products from canada and other countries 
further  several states and local governments have implemented importation schemes for their citizens  and  in the absence of federal action to curtail such activities  we expect other states and local governments to launch importation efforts 
the importation of foreign products that compete with our own products could negatively impact our business and prospects 
we are unable to predict what additional legislation  regulations or policies  if any  relating to the healthcare industry or third party coverage and reimbursement may be enacted in the future or what effect legislations  regulations or policies would have on our business 
any cost containment measures  including those listed above  or other healthcare system reforms that are adopted could impair our ability to set prices that cover our costs  constrain our ability to generate revenue from government funded or private third party payors  limit the revenue and profitability of our potential customers  suppliers and collaborators  and impede our access to capital needed to operate and grow our company 
any of these circumstances could significantly limit our ability to operate profitably 
employees as of march   we had employees  who work in our westlake  texas facility  and who work in our germantown  maryland facility 
our sales and marketing department consisted of employees of these employees are field based and work outside of the office as of march  we currently have no part time employees 
none of our employees are subject to collective bargaining agreements 
we consider our relationships with our employees to be good

item a 
risk factors there are a number of important factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those that are indicated by forward looking statements 
those factors include  without limitation  those listed below and elsewhere herein 
risks related to our business our performance depends substantially on the ability of our new management team to fully implement a new business strategy and on the performance of our executive officers and other key personnel 
in september  we issued and sold  shares of our common stock and a warrant to purchase an aggregate of  shares of our common stock to egi mbrk  llc  or egi  in a private placement offering  for proceeds of approximately million 
in connection with the offering  and as contemplated by the securities purchase agreement dated july  between us and egi  our board of directors appointed john thievon to replace edward m 
rudnic  phd  as our president and chief executive officer 
dr 
rudnic also resigned from our board  and our board appointed mr 
thievon to fill this vacancy 
in addition  david becker was appointed our executive vice president and chief financial officer  replacing robert c 
low as our principal financial officer 
we also expanded the size of our board of directors from seven to members  adding new directors lord james blyth  william c 
pate and mark sotir 
we have hired or promoted a number of other members of our senior management team 
the new management team is in the process of setting new business objectives and implementing a new business strategy for our company and products 
our management team is untested  has not worked together as a group for an extended period of time  and may lack familiarity with our company and products 
they may not work together effectively to successfully implement a new business strategy  manage our operations  or accomplish business objectives 
in addition  the new initiatives being implemented may not be successful and could adversely affect our business 
poor execution in the transition of our management team and in implementing new initiatives could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operation 
we are highly dependent on the principal members of our scientific and management teams 
in order to pursue our product development  marketing and commercialization plans  we may need to hire additional personnel with experience in clinical testing  government regulation  manufacturing  marketing and business development 
we may not be able to attract and retain personnel on acceptable terms given the intense competition for such personnel among biotechnology  pharmaceutical and healthcare companies  universities and non profit research institutions 
we are not aware of any present intention of any of our key personnel to leave our company or to retire 
although we have employment agreements with certain of our executive officers  these employees may terminate their services at any time by delivery of appropriate notice 
the loss of any of our key personnel  or the inability to attract and retain qualified personnel  may significantly delay or prevent the achievement of our research  development or business objectives and could materially adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we have a history of losses  we expect to incur losses for the foreseeable future  and we may never become profitable 
from the date we began operations in january through december   we have incurred losses of approximately million  including a loss of approximately million and million for the fiscal years ended december  and december   respectively 
our losses to date have resulted principally from research and development costs related to the development of our product candidates  the purchase of equipment and establishment of our facilities and selling  general and administrative costs related to our operations 
we expect to incur substantial losses in and depending on the successful commercialization of moxatag  we may incur substantial losses for the foreseeable future thereafter 
among other things  in we expect to incur significant expenses in anticipation of commercialization of our moxatag product which was approved for marketing by the fda in january we have limited the further development of our keflex pulsys product candidate and postponed development of our pediatric pulsys sprinkle product candidate in order to reduce our expenses 
we may also incur losses in connection with the continued sales and marketing of our keflex mg product which was approved for marketing by the fda in may in addition  we expect to incur additional expenses as a result of other research and development costs  and regulatory compliance activities 
our chances for achieving profitability depend on numerous factors  including success in commercializing our moxatag amoxicillin extended release tablets  mg product  which was approved for marketing by the fda in january  maintaining sales of our keflex mg product  successfully developing  gaining fda approval for  and commercializing other product candidates  and obtaining additional financing  should it prove to be necessary 
we may never become profitable 
although our moxatag product has been approved for commercial sale  we will not be successful if the product is not accepted by the market 
even though we have obtained regulatory approval to market moxatag  it  or any of our other potential pulsys products  may not gain market acceptance among physicians  patients  pharmacists  healthcare payors and the medical community 
the degree of market acceptance of any pharmaceutical product that we develop will depend on a number of factors  including demonstration of clinical efficacy and safety  cost effectiveness  potential advantages over alternative therapies  reimbursement policies of government and third party payors  and effectiveness of our marketing and distribution capabilities and the effectiveness of such capabilities of our collaborative partners 
our products will compete with a number of products manufactured and marketed by major pharmaceutical companies  biotechnology companies and manufacturers of generic drugs 
our products may also compete with new products currently under development by others 
physicians  patients  third party payors and the medical community may not accept and use any product candidates that we or our collaborative partners develop 
to the extent current antibiotics already successfully treat certain infections  physicians may not be inclined to prescribe our pulsatile drugs for the same indications 
if our products do not achieve significant market acceptance  we will not be able to generate significant revenues or become profitable 
current unfavorable market conditions may adversely affect our product sales and business 
current economic and market conditions are unfavorable 
adverse economic conditions impacting our customers  including among others  high unemployment  low customer confidence in the economy  high customer debt levels  low availability of customer credit and hardships relating to declines in the stock markets  could impact the ability or willingness of consumers to purchase our products  which could adversely affect our revenues and operating results 
we expect that our products will be more expensive for consumers than competing products  and in the current economy consumers may be reluctant to accept higher costs 
if market conditions remain unfavorable or deteriorate further  we may experience material impacts on our business  operating results and financial condition 
our pulsys technology is based on a finding that could ultimately prove to be incorrect  or could have limited applicability 
our pulsys product candidates are based on our in vitro finding that bacteria exposed to antibiotics in front loaded  rapid sequential bursts are eliminated more efficiently and effectively than those exposed to presently available treatment regimens 
ultimately  our finding may be incorrect  in which case our pulsatile dosage form would not differ substantially from competing dosage forms and may be inferior to them 
if these products are substantially identical or inferior to products already available  the market for our pulsatile drugs will be reduced or eliminated 
even if pulsatile dosing is more efficient than traditional dosing  we may be unable to apply this finding in vivo successfully to a substantial number of products in the anti infective market 
our preliminary studies indicate that pulsatile dosing may not provide superior performance for all types of antibiotics 
additionally  we have not conducted any studies with anti viral or anti fungal medications 
if we cannot apply our technology to a wide variety of antibiotics or other anti infectives  our potential market will be substantially reduced 
our pulsys delivery technology may not be effective for our product candidates  which would prevent us from commercializing products that are more effective than those of our competitors 
even if we are correct that pulsatile dosing is more effective than traditional dosing of antibiotics  our pulsys delivery technology must be effective in humans such that the pulsatile administration of drugs are at levels that prove effective in curing infections 
we may not be successful in developing other antibiotics using our pulsys technology 
furthermore  we may not be successful when applying for indications other than our current indications for moxatag 
should this occur  our pulsatile product candidates may not be more effective than the products of our competitors  which may decrease or eliminate market acceptance of our products 
if our pulsys delivery technology is not effective in delivering rapid bursts of antibiotics  or is unable to do so at appropriate concentrations  and we are not able to create an alternative delivery method for pulsatile dosing that proves to be effective  we will be unable to capitalize on any advantage of our discovery  which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 
if a competitor produces and commercializes an antibiotic that is superior to our pulsys antibiotics  the market for our potential products would be reduced or eliminated 
we have devoted a substantial amount of our research efforts and capital to the development of pulsatile antibiotics 
competitors are developing or have developed new drugs that may compete with our pulsatile antibiotics 
a number of pharmaceutical companies are also developing new classes of compounds  such as oxazolidinones  that may also compete against our pulsatile antibiotics 
in addition  other companies are developing technologies to enhance the efficacy of antibiotics by adding new chemical entities that inhibit bacterial metabolic function 
if a competitor produces and commercializes an antibiotic or method of delivery of antibiotics that provides superior safety  effectiveness or other significant advantages over our pulsatile antibiotics  the value of our pulsatile drugs would be substantially reduced 
as a result  we would need to conduct substantial new research and development activities to establish new product targets  which would be costly and time consuming 
in the event we are unable to establish new product targets  we will be unable to generate additional sources of revenue 
we have not conducted an extensive third party patent infringement  invalidity and enforceability investigation on pulsatile dosing and our pulsys technology  and we are aware of at least one issued patent covering pulsatile delivery 
our patents  prior art and infringement investigations were primarily conducted by our senior management and other employees 
although our patent counsel has consulted with management in connection with management s intellectual property investigations  our patent counsel has not undertaken an extensive independent analysis to determine whether our pulsys technology infringes upon any issued patents or whether our issued patents or patent applications covering pulsatile dosing could be invalidated or rendered unenforceable for any reason 
we are aware of one issued patent owned by a third party that covers certain aspects of delivering drugs by the use of two delayed release pulses 
however  we believe that we will be able to manufacture and market formulations of our pulsatile products without infringing any valid claims under this patent 
any reformulation of our products  if required  could be costly and time consuming and may not be possible 
we cannot assure you that a claim will not be asserted by such patent holder or any other holder of an issued patent  that any of our products infringe their patent  or that our patents are invalid or unenforceable 
we may be exposed to future litigation by third parties based on claims that our products or activities infringe the intellectual property rights of others 
we cannot assure you that  in the event of litigation  any claims would be resolved in our favor 
any litigation or claims against us  whether or not valid  may result in substantial costs  could place a significant strain on our financial resources  divert the attention of management and harm our reputation 
in addition  intellectual property litigation or claims could result in substantial damages and force us to do one or more of the following cease selling  incorporating or using any of our products that incorporate the challenged intellectual property  obtain a license from the holder of the infringed intellectual property right  which may be costly or may not be available on reasonable terms  if at all  or redesign our products  which would be costly and time consuming and may not be possible 
we have not sought patent protection for certain aspects of the technology used in our pulsys product candidates 
we have not filed for patent protection with respect to all of our specific formulations  materials including inactive ingredients or manufacturing process approaches that are incorporated in our pulsys product candidates  and we may not seek such patent coverage in the future 
in producing our pulsys products  we expect to use general formulation techniques used in the industry that would be modified by us and which would  therefore  include know how and trade secrets that we have developed 
we cannot be certain that a patent would issue to cover such intellectual property  and currently  we would prefer to keep such techniques and know how as our trade secrets 
in the event a competitor is able to develop and patent technology substantially similar to ours  we may be blocked from using certain of our formulations or manufacturing process approaches  which could limit our ability to develop and commercialize products 
if we are unable to develop and successfully commercialize our pulsys product candidates  we may never achieve profitability 
we have just begun the commercialization of our first pulsys product  moxatag  however  as of december   we have not recognized any revenue from pulsys product sales 
with the exception of our keflex pulsys product candidate  which is in the early stages of preparing for a phase iii clinical trial  all of our pulsatile drugs candidates are in early stages of development 
we must obtain regulatory approval for our products before we are able to commercialize these products and generate revenue from their sales 
we expect that we must conduct significant additional research and development activities on our other pulsys product candidates and successfully complete preclinical  phase i  phase i ii or phase ii  and phase iii clinical trials before we will be able to receive final regulatory approval to commercialize these pulsatile products 
even if we succeed in developing and commercializing one or more of our pulsys products  we may never generate sufficient or sustainable revenue to enable us to be profitable 
if clinical trials for our products are unsuccessful or delayed  we will be unable to meet our anticipated development and commercialization timelines 
we must demonstrate through preclinical testing and clinical trials that our product candidates are safe and effective for use in humans before we can obtain regulatory approvals for their commercial sale 
in addition  we will also need to demonstrate through clinical trials any claims we may wish to make that our product candidates are comparable or superior to existing products 
for drug products which are expected to contain active ingredients in fixed combinations that have not been previously approved by the fda  we may also need to conduct clinical studies in order to establish the contribution of each active component to the effectiveness of the combination in an appropriately identified patient population 
conducting clinical trials is a lengthy  time consuming and expensive process 
with the exception of both our keflex pulsys product candidate and pediatric pulsys sprinkle product candidate  which have completed phase i clinical trials  we have not completed preclinical studies and initial clinical trials phase i  phase i ii or phase ii to extrapolate proper dosage for our other potential product candidates for phase iii clinical efficacy trials in humans 
in the event we incorrectly identify a dosage as appropriate for human clinical trials  any results we receive from such trials may not properly reflect the optimal efficacy or safety of our products and may not support approval in the absence of additional clinical trials using a different dosage 
the commencement and rate of completion of clinical trials for our products may be delayed by many factors  including lack of efficacy during the clinical trials  unforeseen safety issues  slower than expected rate of patient recruitment  or government or regulatory delays 
the results from preclinical testing and early clinical trials are often not predictive of results obtained in later clinical trials 
although a new product may show promising results in preclinical and initial clinical trials  it may subsequently prove unfeasible or impossible to generate sufficient safety and efficacy data to obtain necessary regulatory approval 
data obtained from preclinical and clinical studies are susceptible to varying interpretations  which may delay  limit or prevent regulatory approval 
in addition  we may encounter regulatory delays or rejections as a result of many factors  including results that do not support our claims  perceived defects in the design of clinical trials and changes in regulatory policy during the period of product development 
our business  financial condition and results of operations may be materially adversely affected by any delays in  or termination of  our clinical trials or a determination by the fda that the results of our trials are inadequate to justify regulatory approval 
we have a post marketing commitment to proceed with a phase ii clinical trial for our pediatric pulsys sprinkle product candidate  which we may never be able to conduct 
as part of the moxatag approval  we are committed to submitting a final clinical trial report for a phase iii clinical study by march for our pediatric pulsys sprinkle product candidate 
prior to the initiation of such a phase iii clinical trial  we plan to conduct a phase ii clinical trial in order to evaluate various dosing regimens 
if we lack adequate financial resources to proceed with a phase ii clinical trial for our pediatric pulsys sprinkle product candidate we will be unable to meet our commitment and will have to request that the fda extend our current deferral until such resources are available 
if the results of the phase ii clinical study do not support proceeding into a phase iii clinical trial  we will have to request a waiver for the further assessment of the safety and effectiveness of our pediatric pulsys sprinkle product candidate 
there can be no assurance that the fda will grant our deferral or waiver requests 
if we fail to obtain a deferral or waiver from the fda regarding this post marketing commitment it could have a material adverse affect on our business 
our ability to commercialize our products is dependent upon successfully developing our own sales and marketing capabilities and infrastructure 
our new sales and marketing personnel have limited experience working together 
in order to commercialize our moxatag product  we expanded our commercial capabilities  with the addition of several sales and marketing personnel  using a significant portion of the proceeds raised in our september private placement offering 
the expansion of our sales infrastructure will also require substantial resources  which may divert the attention of our management and key personnel and defer our product development efforts 
we filled all district sales manager positions and territory manager positions  and we have been actively creating a distribution channel for our drugs both in the commercial market and managed care market 
our sales force has had no experience selling our products and they may not be successful 
in the event any of our other products or product candidates are approved by the fda  we may have to expand our sales and marketing personnel  which could divert the attention of management and have a material adverse affect on other areas of our business  these efforts may not be successful and cause a delay in product sales and increased costs 
our keflex mg product may not be successful 
we launched our keflex mg product in july while we have invested considerable resources in the launch of this product  to date  sales have not met our expectations 
we had previously anticipated that this product would generate revenues in excess of related expenses and would contribute additional cash flow to help fund our other operations 
during and  we reduced the number of contract sales representatives and marketing costs associated with keflex mg in order to more closely match the monthly sales level 
the extent to which this product is accepted by physicians is dependent upon a number of factors  including the recognition of the potential advantages over alternative generic dosage strengths of cephalexin  despite higher cost  and the effectiveness of our marketing and distribution capabilities 
in addition  this product faces significant competition from other dosage strengths of cephalexin manufactured by generic pharmaceutical companies  as well as from other dosage strengths of immediate release keflex marketed by us 
although there is no current mg dosage strength of generic cephalexin  the product is not protected by patents and we expect to have a limited window of opportunity to market this product  should generic pharmaceutical manufacturers choose to compete with us 
even if sales of this product increase in the short term  we expect that the amount of revenues from this product could decline significantly within a few years due to competition from generic formulations of the product 
we rely upon a limited number of pharmaceutical wholesalers and distributors  which could impact our ability to sell our products 
we rely largely upon specialty pharmaceutical distributors and wholesalers to deliver our products to end users  including physicians  hospitals  and pharmacies 
product sales to three major pharmaceutical wholesalers  cardinal health inc  mckesson corporation and amerisourcebergen corporation  accounted for approximately and of our net revenue from keflex in fiscal years ended december  and december   respectively 
there can be no assurance that our distributors and wholesalers will adequately meet the market demand for our products 
given the high concentration of sales to certain pharmaceutical distributors and wholesalers  we could experience a significant loss if one of our top customers were to cease buying our product s  declare bankruptcy or otherwise become unable to pay its obligations to us 
the potential success of our products and product candidates  will be dependent upon successfully pricing the products in the marketplace 
while we believe that physicians make antibiotic prescribing decisions based primarily on efficacy  safety  and compliance  we also believe that  when deciding whether to prescribe a modified release drug or its immediate release generic analog  physicians also weigh patient co pay and patient preferences 
as a result  we believe that price will be an important driver of the adoption of our products and product candidates 
in addition  we believe it will be important to carefully manage resistance from payor organizations by pricing our products in such a way as to minimize the incremental payor cost burden relative to generic analogs 
if our product pricing does not achieve significant market acceptance  the sales of our products will be significantly impacted and it could materially adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
generic pricing plans  such as that implemented by wal mart and other retailers  may affect the market for our products 
in september  wal mart began offering certain generic drugs at per prescription and various other retailers currently offer generic drugs at similar prices or for free 
amoxicillin and cephalexin are on the list of drugs that retailers provide at per prescription or less 
wal mart and many of these other retailers have significant market presence 
as a result  there can be no assurance that wal mart s generic pricing plan  and or similar plans adopted by others  will not have a material adverse effect on the market for our products 
our immediate release keflex products are subject to therapeutic equivalent substitution  and our products are subject to medicaid reimbursement and price reporting 
the cost of pharmaceutical products continues to be a subject of investigation and action by governmental agencies  legislative bodies and private organizations in the united states and other countries 
in the united states  most states have enacted legislation requiring or permitting a dispensing pharmacist to substitute a generic equivalent to the prescribed drug 
federal legislation requires pharmaceutical manufacturers to pay to state medicaid agencies prescribed rebates on drugs to enable them to be eligible for reimbursement under medicaid programs 
federal and state governments continue to pursue efforts to reduce spending in medicaid programs  including imposing restrictions on amounts agencies will reimburse for certain products 
we also must give discounts or rebates on purchases or reimbursements of our products by certain other federal and state agencies and programs 
our ability to earn sufficient returns on our products will depend  in part  on the availability of reimbursements from third party payors  such as health insurers  governmental health administration authorities and other organizations and the amount of rebates payable under medicaid programs 
we are dependent on our contract manufacturers and suppliers to provide us with active pharmaceutical ingredients and finished products 
we do not maintain commercial scale manufacturing facilities 
our keflex products were manufactured for us by patheon 
we were informed that patheon would be closing its puerto rico site that manufactures our keflex product and that they would be willing to manufacture enough keflex to meet our commercial needs for approximately months 
we received our final order of keflex from patheon in february and cannot guarantee that the amount of product received will meet our near term demand for keflex 
we are actively pursuing a third party manufacturer to produce our current immediate release keflex products and to perform development work on our keflex pulsatile development product 
however  we cannot guarantee that we will be able to select a site and obtain approval from the fda for a third party manufacturing and development site 
if we are unable to obtain approval  or if such approval is delayed  for a third party manufacturing and development site for our current keflex products and our keflex pulsys development product this could result in a significant disruption to our business  have a material adverse affect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
moxatag is manufactured for us by stada production ireland limited  or spi  previously known as the manufacturing division of clonmel healthcare limited  a subsidiary of stada arzneimittel ag  pursuant to a contract manufacturing arrangement 
samples of our moxatag product are packaged by almac pharma services limited  or almac  pursuant to a three year packaging agreement 
although we believe that our finished moxatag product and samples could be potentially obtained from several suppliers  our applications for regulatory approval currently only identify spi and almac as our authorized sources for moxatag product and samples  respectively 
in the event that spi or almac are unable to supply moxatag product and samples to us in sufficient quantities on a timely basis or at a commercially reasonable price  or in the event either of them breaches their agreement with us  or if spi or almac loses its regulatory status as an acceptable source  we would need to locate another source 
a change to a supplier not previously approved or an alteration in the procedures or product provided to us by an approved supplier may require formal approval by the fda before the product could be sold and could result in significant disruption to our business 
these factors could limit our ability to sell moxatag and could materially adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
if the demand for our products increases and we are unable to increase manufacturing capacity or unable to obtain additional capacity on reasonable economic terms to meet that demand  our revenues and operating results may be negatively impacted 
the addition of capacity on unfavorable terms could also affect our revenue and profitability 
in addition  any damage to  or disruption at  our manufacturers facilities could halt production of our products and materially harm our business 
reliance on third party manufacturers entails risks  including but not limited to the possibility that third parties may not comply with the fda s cgmp regulations  other regulatory requirements and quality assurance  the possible breach of manufacturing agreements by third parties due to factors beyond our control  and the possibility of termination or nonrenewal of an agreement by a third party manufacturer  based on its own business priorities  at a time that is costly or inconvenient for us 
in the event of a supply disruption or a deterioration in our product quality from a third party manufacturer  we would have to rely on alternative manufacturing sources or identify and qualify new manufacturers 
we may not be able to identify or qualify new manufacturers in a timely manner or obtain a sufficient allocation of their capacity to meet our requirements 
in addition  alternative vendors must comply with product validation and stability testing  which may involve additional manufacturing expense  delay in production or required regulatory approvals 
any resulting delays in meeting demand could negatively impact our inventory levels  sales  profitability  and reputation 
a limited number of manufacturers operating under cgmp regulations are capable of manufacturing amoxicillin and cephalexin to our specifications 
we may be unable to utilize alternative manufacturing sources for these active pharmaceutical ingredients  or apis  or to obtain such manufacturing on commercially reasonable terms or on a timely basis 
any transfer of our sources of supply to other manufacturers will require the satisfaction of various regulatory requirements  which could cause us to experience significant delays in receiving adequate supplies of api for use in our products 
any delays in the manufacturing process may adversely impact our ability to meet commercial demand on a timely basis  which would negatively impact our revenues  reputation and business strategy 
in addition  we obtain apis and finished products from certain specialized manufacturers for use in clinical studies 
although the antibiotics and finished products we use in our clinical studies may generally be obtained from several suppliers  the loss of a supplier could result in delays in conducting or completing our clinical trials and could delay our ability to commercialize products 
all of our manufacturing operations are located outside of the us  which exposes us to additional business risks that may cause our profitability to decline 
spi and almac will manufacture and package moxatag product and samples in their respective facilities in ireland 
our costs associated with spi are denominated in euros  or eur  and those of almac are in british pound sterling  or gbp 
we are therefore exposed to fluctuations in the exchange rates between the us dollar  or usd  and the eur and gbp  which could have an adverse effect on our financial results 
in addition  we may be subject to the laws and regulations of local authorities 
these laws and regulations may be modified in the future  and we may not be able to operate in compliance with those modifications 
we are currently in the process of selecting a third party manufacturer for our keflex products 
we believe this manufacturer will be located overseas  and the costs for the manufacturer will be denominated in a foreign currency  which exposes us to currency risk 
in addition  we may be subject to separate laws and regulations of local authorities 
these laws and regulations may be modified in the future  and we may not be able to operate in compliance with those modifications 
fluctuations in exchange rates and changes in applicable foreign laws and regulations could have an adverse effect on our business  financial condition  or results of operations 
our ability to conduct clinical trials will be impaired if we fail to qualify our clinical supply manufacturing facility and we are unable to maintain relationships with current clinical supply manufacturers or enter into relationships with new manufacturers 
we currently rely on several contractors to manufacture product for our clinical studies 
we believe that there are a variety of manufacturers that we may retain to produce these products 
however  once we retain a manufacturing source  if we are unable to maintain our relationship with such manufacturer  qualifying a new manufacturing source will be time consuming and expensive and may cause delays in the development of our products 
clinical trials for our product candidates may be delayed due to our dependence on third parties for the conduct of such trials 
we have limited experience in conducting and managing clinical trials 
we rely  and will continue to rely  on third parties  including contract research organizations and outside consultants  to assist us in managing and monitoring clinical trials 
our reliance on these third parties may result in delays in the completion of  or the failure to complete  these trials if they fail to perform their obligations under our agreements with them 
our success may depend on our ability to successfully attract and retain collaborative partners 
for certain product candidates  we may enter into collaborative arrangements with third parties 
collaborations may be necessary in order for us to fund our research and development activities  fund manufacturing by third parties  seek and obtain regulatory approvals  and successfully commercialize our product candidates 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to enter into collaborative agreements with partners on terms favorable to us  or at all  and any future agreement may expose us to risks that our partner might fail to fulfill its obligations and delay commercialization of our products 
we also could become involved in disputes with partners  which could lead to delays in or terminations of our development and commercialization programs and time consuming and expensive litigation or arbitration 
our inability to enter into additional collaborative arrangements with other partners  or our failure to maintain such arrangements  may limit the number of product candidates we can develop and ultimately  decrease our sources of any future revenues 
if we cannot enter into new licensing arrangements or otherwise gain access to products  our ability to develop a diverse product portfolio could be limited 
a component of our business strategy may involve in licensing or acquiring drug compounds developed by other pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies or academic research laboratories that may be marketed and developed or improved upon using our novel technologies 
competition for promising compounds can be intense  and currently we have not entered into any arrangement to license or acquire any drugs from other companies  other than eli lilly 
if we are not able to identify licensing or acquisition opportunities or enter into arrangements on acceptable terms  we may be unable to develop a diverse portfolio of products 
any product candidate that we acquire may require significant additional research and development efforts prior to seeking regulatory approval and commercial sale  including extensive preclinical and or clinical testing 
all product candidates are prone to the risks of failure inherent in pharmaceutical product development  including the possibility that the product candidate will not be safe  non toxic and effective or approved by regulatory authorities 
in addition  we cannot assure you that any approved products that we develop or acquire will be manufactured or produced economically  successfully commercialized  widely accepted in the marketplace or that we will be able to recover our significant expenditures in connection with the development or acquisition of such products 
in addition  proposing  negotiating and implementing an economically viable acquisition is a lengthy and complex process 
other companies  including those with substantially greater financial  sales and marketing resources  may compete with us for the acquisition of product candidates and approved products 
we may not be able to acquire the rights to additional product candidates and approved products on terms that we find acceptable  or at all 
in addition  if we acquire product candidates from third parties  we may be dependent on third parties to supply such products to us for sale 
we could be materially adversely affected by the failure or inability of such suppliers to meet performance  reliability and quality standards 
we could be forced to pay substantial damage awards if product liability claims that may be brought against us are successful 
the use of any of our product candidates in clinical trials  and the sale of any approved products  may expose us to liability claims and financial losses resulting from the use or sale of our products 
we have obtained limited product liability insurance coverage for our clinical trials  which we believe is adequate to cover our present activities 
however  such insurance may not be adequate to cover any claims made against us 
in addition  we may not be able to obtain or maintain insurance coverage at a reasonable cost or in sufficient amounts or scope to protect us against losses 
risks related to our industry any inability to protect our intellectual property could harm our competitive position 
our success will depend in part on our ability to obtain patents and maintain adequate protection of other intellectual property for our technologies and products in the united states and other countries 
if we do not adequately protect our intellectual property  competitors may be able to use our technologies and erode or negate our competitive advantage 
further  the laws of some foreign countries do not protect our proprietary rights to the same extent as the laws of the us  and we may encounter significant problems in protecting our proprietary rights in these foreign countries 
the patent positions of pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies  including our patent positions  involve complex legal and factual questions and  therefore  validity and enforceability cannot be predicted with certainty 
patents may be challenged  deemed unenforceable  invalidated or circumvented 
we will be able to protect our proprietary rights from unauthorized use by third parties only to the extent that we cover our proprietary technologies with valid and enforceable patents or we effectively maintain such proprietary technologies as trade secrets 
we will apply for patents covering both our technologies and product candidates as we deem appropriate 
we may fail to apply for patents on important technologies or products in a timely fashion  or at all  and in any event  the applications we do file may be challenged and may not result in issued patents 
any future patents we obtain may not be sufficiently broad to prevent others from practicing our technologies or from developing competing products 
furthermore  others may independently develop similar or alternative technologies or design around our patented technologies 
in addition  if challenged  our patents may be declared invalid 
even if valid  our patents may fail to provide us with any competitive advantages 
we rely upon trade secrets protection for our confidential and proprietary information 
we have taken measures to protect our proprietary information  however  these measures may not provide adequate protection 
we seek to protect our proprietary information by entering into confidentiality agreements with employees  collaborators and consultants 
nevertheless  employees  collaborators or consultants may still disclose our proprietary information  and we may not be able to meaningfully protect our trade secrets 
in addition  others may independently develop substantially equivalent proprietary information or techniques or otherwise gain access to our trade secrets 
if we are unable to protect the intellectual property rights related to our brands  our ability to compete effectively in the markets for our products and our business could be negatively impacted 
a significant part of our business strategy is to position moxatag and our keflex line of products as preferred brands for relief of tonsillitis and or pharyngitis secondary to streptococcus pyogenes  and skin and skin structure infections  respectively 
we believe that familiarity with our brands is an important competitive advantage and that the growth and sustainability of our market share for our product lines will depend to a significant extent upon the goodwill associated with our related trademarks  trade names and copyrights 
we intend to use the trademarks and trade names on our products to convey that the products we sell are brand name products  and we believe consumers and physicians will ascribe value to our brands 
we own the material trademark and trade name rights used in connection with the packaging  marketing and sale of our products 
this ownership prevents our competitors or new entrants to the market from using our brand names 
therefore  we view trademark and trade name protection as critical to our business 
although most of our trademarks are registered in the united states  we may not be successful in asserting trademark or trade name protection 
if we were to lose the exclusive right to use the moxatag or keflex brand name or other brand names we establish or acquire in the future  our sales and operating results could be materially and adversely affected 
we could also incur substantial costs to prosecute legal actions relating to the use of our trademarks and trade names  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations or financial condition 
additionally  other parties may infringe on our property rights in our trademarks and trade names  which may dilute the value of our brands in the marketplace 
our competitors may also introduce brands that cause confusion with our brands in the marketplace  which could adversely affect the value that our customers associate with our brands and thereby negatively impact our sales 
any such infringement of our intellectual property rights would also likely result in a commitment of our time and resources to protect those rights through litigation or otherwise 
in addition  third parties may assert claims against our trademark and trade name rights  and we may not be able to successfully resolve these claims 
in such event  we may lose our ability to use the brand names that are the subject of these claims  which could have a material adverse impact on our sales and operating results 
we could also incur substantial costs to defend even those claims that are not ultimately successful  which could materially adversely affect our business  results of operations or financial condition 
legal proceedings or third party claims of intellectual property infringement may require us to spend time and money and could prevent us from developing or commercializing products 
our technologies  products or potential products in development may infringe rights under patents or patent applications of third parties 
third parties may own or control these patents and patent applications in the united states and abroad 
these third parties could bring claims against us that would cause us to incur substantial expenses and  if successful  could cause us to pay substantial damages 
further  if a patent infringement suit were brought against us  we could be forced to stop or delay research  development  manufacturing  or sales of the product or product candidate that is the subject of the suit 
as a result of patent infringement claims  or to avoid potential claims  we may choose to seek  or be required to seek  a license from the third party and would most likely be required to pay license fees or royalties or both 
these licenses may not be available on acceptable terms  or at all 
even if we were able to obtain a license  the rights may be nonexclusive  which would give our competitors access to the same intellectual property 
ultimately  we could be prevented from commercializing a product or be forced to cease some aspect of our business operations if  as a result of actual or threatened patent infringement claims  we are unable to enter into licenses on acceptable terms 
this inability to enter into licenses could harm our business significantly 
the pharmaceutical industry has experienced substantial litigation and other proceedings regarding patent and other intellectual property rights 
in addition to infringement claims against us  we may become a party to other patent litigation and other proceedings  including interference proceedings declared by the us patent and trademark office and opposition proceedings in the european patent office  regarding intellectual property rights with respect to our products and technology 
the cost to us of any patent litigation or other proceeding  even if resolved in our favor  could be substantial 
some of our competitors may be able to sustain the costs of such litigation or proceedings more effectively because of their substantially greater financial resources 
uncertainties resulting from the initiation and continuation of patent litigation or other proceedings could have a material adverse effect on our ability to compete in the marketplace 
patent litigation and other proceedings may also absorb significant management time 
if we do not compete successfully in the development and commercialization of products and keep pace with rapid technological change  we will be unable to capture and sustain a meaningful market position 
the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries are highly competitive and subject to significant and rapid technological change 
while we are not aware of any company using rapid bursts of antibiotics as a treatment method  there are numerous companies actively engaged in the research and development of anti infectives 
our main competitors are large pharmaceutical companies  such as pfizer  glaxosmithkline  wyeth  bristol myers squibb  merck  johnson johnson  roche  schering plough  novartis  sanofi aventis  abbott laboratories  astrazeneca  and bayer  which may develop new drug compounds that render our drugs obsolete or noncompetitive 
smaller pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies and specialty pharmaceutical companies engaged in focused research and development of anti infective drugs  such as trimeris  vertex  gilead sciences  cubist  basilea  intermune  oscient  king  advanced life sciences  and others 
drug delivery companies  such as johnson johnson s alza division  biovail  depomed  flamel technologies  and skyepharma  which may develop a dosing regimen that is more effective than pulsatile dosing 
generic drug companies  such as teva  ranbaxy  sandoz and stada  which produce low cost versions of antibiotics that may contain the same apis as our pulsys product candidates 
many of these competitors  either alone or together with their collaborative partners  have substantially greater financial resources and larger research and development staffs than we do 
in addition  many of these competitors  either alone or together with their collaborative partners  have significantly greater experience than we do in developing products  undertaking preclinical testing and human clinical trials  obtaining approvals of products from the fda and other regulatory agencies  and manufacturing and marketing products 
developments by others may render our product candidates or technologies obsolete or noncompetitive 
we face and will continue to face intense competition from other companies for collaborative arrangements with pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies  for establishing relationships with academic and research institutions  and for licenses of products or technology 
these competitors  either alone or with their collaborative partners  may succeed in developing technologies or products that are more effective than ours 
if we experience delays in obtaining regulatory approvals  or are unable to obtain or maintain regulatory approvals  we may be unable to commercialize any products 
our product candidates are subject to extensive and rigorous domestic government regulation as described more fully under item business government regulation in this annual report on form k 
the fda regulates  among other things  the development  testing  manufacture  safety  efficacy  record keeping  labeling  storage  approval  advertising  promotion  sale and distribution of pharmaceutical products 
if we or our manufacturers fail to comply with those regulations  we could become subject to significant penalties or claims  which could materially and adversely affect our operating results or our ability to conduct our business 
in addition  the adoption of new regulations or changes in the interpretations of existing regulations may result in significant compliance costs or discontinuation of product sales and may adversely affect our revenue and the marketing of our products 
if our products are marketed abroad  they will also be subject to extensive regulation by foreign governments 
none of our pulsys product candidates have been approved for sale in any foreign market 
the regulatory review and approval process takes many years  requires the expenditure of substantial resources  involves post marketing surveillance and may involve ongoing requirements for post marketing studies 
the actual time required for satisfaction of fda pre market approval requirements may vary substantially based upon the type  complexity and novelty of the product or the medical condition it is intended to treat 
government regulation may delay or prevent marketing of potential products for a considerable period of time and impose costly procedures upon a manufacturer s activities 
delays in obtaining regulatory approvals may adversely affect the commercialization of any drugs that we or our collaborative partners develop  impose costly procedures on us or our collaborative partners  diminish any competitive advantages that we or our collaborative partners may attain  and adversely affect our receipt of revenues or royalties 
success in early stage clinical trials does not assure success in later stage clinical trials 
data obtained from clinical activities is not always conclusive and may be susceptible to varying interpretations that could delay  limit or prevent regulatory approval 
of the large number of drugs in development  only a small percentage result in the submission of a nda to the fda  and the fda approves even fewer for commercialization 
any required approvals  once obtained  may be withdrawn 
further  if we fail to comply with applicable fda and other regulatory requirements at any stage during the regulatory process  we may encounter difficulties including delays in clinical trials or commercialization  product recalls or seizures  suspension of production and or distribution  withdrawals of previously approved marketing applications  and fines  civil penalties and criminal prosecutions 
we may need to successfully address a number of challenges in order to complete the development of our future products 
for example  to obtain marketing approval for a new product candidate  we and our third party manufacturers will be required to demonstrate that we can consistently produce the product in commercial quantities and of specified quality on a repeated basis 
this requirement is referred to as process validation 
if we are unable to satisfy this process validation requirement for a future product candidate  through our third party manufacturers or otherwise  we will not receive approval to market such product 
in addition  the fda and other regulatory agencies may apply new standards for safety  manufacturing  packaging  and distribution of future product candidates 
complying with such standards may be time consuming or expensive and could result in delays in our obtaining marketing approval for future product candidates  or possibly preclude us from obtaining such approval 
such a delay could also increase our commercialization costs  possibly materially 
furthermore  our future products may not be effective or may prove to have undesirable or unintended side effects  toxicities or other characteristics that may preclude us from obtaining regulatory approval or prevent or limit commercial use 
even if we do obtain regulatory approval  such regulatory approvals may be subject to limitations on the indicated uses for which we may market a product  which may limit the size of the market for such product 
we may rely on future collaborative partners to file investigational new drug applications and generally direct the regulatory approval process for some of our products 
these collaborative partners may not diligently conduct clinical testing or obtain necessary approvals from the fda or other regulatory authorities for any product candidates 
if we fail to obtain required governmental approvals  we or our collaborative partners will experience delays in  or be precluded from  marketing products developed through our research 
we and our contract manufacturers are also required to comply with applicable fda cgmp regulations 
cgmp regulations include requirements relating to quality control and quality assurance as well as the corresponding maintenance of records and documentation 
manufacturing facilities are subject to inspection by the fda 
these facilities must be approved before we can use them in commercial manufacturing of our products 
we or our contract manufacturers may not be able to comply with the applicable cgmp requirements and other fda regulatory requirements 
if we or our contract manufacturers fail to comply  we could be subject to fines or other sanctions  or be precluded from marketing our products 
furthermore  if the fda implements additional regulations with which we and our third party manufacturers have to comply  our expenses would increase 
furthermore  our failure to comply with the fda  us federal trade commission or state regulations relating to our product claims and advertising may result in enforcement actions and imposition of penalties or otherwise materially and adversely affect our marketing strategy and product sales 
the manufacture and storage of pharmaceutical and chemical products is subject to environmental regulation and risk 
because of the chemical ingredients of pharmaceutical products and the nature of their manufacturing process  the pharmaceutical industry is subject to extensive environmental regulation and the risk of incurring liability for damages or the costs of remedying environmental problems 
we use a number of chemicals and drug substances that can be toxic 
these chemicals include acids  solvents and other reagents used in the normal course of our chemical and pharmaceutical analysis  and other materials  such as polymers  inactive ingredients and drug substances  used in the research  development and manufacture of drug products 
if we fail to comply with environmental regulations to use  discharge or dispose of hazardous materials appropriately or otherwise to comply with the conditions attached to our operating licenses  the licenses could be revoked and we could be subject to criminal sanctions and or substantial liability or could be required to suspend or modify our operations 
environmental laws and regulations can require us to undertake or pay for investigation  clean up and monitoring of environmental contamination identified at properties that we currently own or operate or that we formerly owned or operated 
further  these laws and regulations can require us to undertake or pay for such actions at offsite locations where we may have sent hazardous substances for disposal 
these obligations are often imposed without regard to fault 
in the event we are found to have violated environmental laws or regulations  our reputation will be harmed and we may incur substantial monetary liabilities 
we currently have insurance coverage that we believe is adequate to cover our present activities 
however  this insurance may not be available or adequate to cover any losses arising from contamination or injury resulting from our use of hazardous substances 
our current and future products may be associated with certain transient side effects 
if we or others identify additional  more severe side effects associated with our current or future products  we may be required to withdraw our products from the market  perform lengthy additional clinical trials or change the labeling of our products  any of which would hinder or preclude our ability to generate revenues 
our current cephalexin based products may be associated with mild and transient side effects including diarrhea  dyspepsia  gastritis  and abdominal pain 
our amoxicillin based product may be associated with vulvovaginal myotic infection  diarrhea  nausea  vomiting  abdominal pain and headaches 
if we or others identify side effects after any of our products are on the market regulatory authorities may withdraw their approvals  we may be required to reformulate our products  conduct additional clinical trials  change the labeling of our products  or implement changes to obtain new approvals of manufacturers facilities  we may recall the affected products from the market  we may experience a significant drop in sales of the affected products  our reputation in the marketplace may suffer  we may become the target of lawsuits  including class action suits  and we may be required to withdraw our products from the market and not be able to re introduce them into the market 
any of these events could harm or prevent sales of the affected products or could substantially increase the costs and expenses of commercializing or marketing these products  which would adversely affect our results of operations and financial position 
market acceptance of our products will be limited if users of our products are unable to obtain adequate reimbursement from third party payors 
the commercial success of our products and product candidates will depend in part on the availability of reimbursement from third party payors  including government health administrators  managed care providers and private health insurers 
we cannot assure you that third party payors will consider our products cost effective or provide reimbursement in whole or in part for their use 
significant uncertainty exists as to the reimbursement status of newly approved healthcare products 
third party payors may conclude that our products are less safe  effective or cost effective than existing products 
therefore  third party payors may not approve our products for reimbursement 
if third party payors do not approve our products for reimbursement or fail to reimburse them adequately  sales will suffer as some physicians or their patients will opt for a competing product that is approved for reimbursement or is adequately reimbursed 
even if third party payors make reimbursement available  reimbursement levels may not be sufficient for us to realize an appropriate return on our investment in product development 
moreover  the trend toward managed healthcare in the us  the growth of organizations such as health maintenance organizations  and legislative proposals to reform healthcare and government insurance programs could significantly influence the purchase of healthcare services and products  resulting in lower prices and reduced demand for our products 
in addition  legislation and regulations affecting the pricing of pharmaceuticals may change in ways adverse to us 
while we cannot predict the likelihood of any of these legislative or regulatory proposals  if any government or regulatory agencies adopt these proposals  they could materially adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
potential regulatory changes  and the billing and reimbursement process applicable to underlying conditions may cause price erosion and reduce sales revenue for our products  and our products may not be accepted by healthcare providers 
government and private healthcare programs currently are under financial stress due to overall medical cost increases 
federal and state governments are taking steps to ease the burden on healthcare programs in ways that could affect the pricing of pharmaceuticals 
any such federal and state laws and regulations can have a negative impact on the pricing of prescription drugs  including medicare  medicaid  pharmaceutical importation laws and other laws and regulations that directly or indirectly impose controls on pricing 
market acceptance of our products may depend on the availability of reimbursement by government and private third party payors 
in recent years  there have been numerous proposals to change the healthcare system in the united states 
the growth of managed care organizations  or mcos eg  medical insurance companies  medical plan administrators  hospital alliances and pharmaceutical benefit managers has placed increased pressure on drug prices and on overall healthcare expenditures 
mcos and government and other private third party payors increasingly are attempting to contain health care costs by limiting both the coverage and the level of reimbursement for drug products 
consequently  the reimbursement status of our products is highly uncertain  and we cannot assure that third party coverage will be available or that available third party coverage or payment will be adequate 
other risks future sales of our common stock  or the perception that these sales may occur  could depress our stock price 
sales of substantial amounts of our common stock in the public market  or the perception in the public markets that these sales may occur  could cause the market price of our common stock to decline 
this could also impair our ability to raise additional capital through the sale of our equity securities 
selling of a large number of shares by any of our existing shareholders or management shareholders could cause the price of our common stock to decline 
in september  we issued and sold  shares of common stock and a warrant to acquire up to  additional shares of common stock at an exercise price of per share to egi mbrk  llc in january  we completed a private placement of  shares of common stock and warrants to acquire up to  shares of common stock at a price of per unit 
in april  we completed a private placement of  shares of common stock and warrants to purchase  shares of common stock  at a price of per unit 
in december  we completed a private placement of  shares of common stock 
in april  we completed a private placement of  shares of our common stock and warrants to purchase a total of  shares of common stock at an exercise price of per share 
we have registered approximately  and  shares of common stock that are authorized for issuance under our stock incentive plan and new hire stock incentive plan  respectively 
as of march   options to purchase  shares were outstanding   of which are vested and exercisable 
because they are registered  the shares authorized for issuance under our stock plans can be freely sold in the public market upon issuance  subject to the restrictions imposed on our affiliates under rule we could be forced to pay liquidated damages if we do not maintain the effectiveness of our s registration statements 
pursuant to the terms of the registration rights agreements for each of the private placement transactions described directly above  we filed with the sec shelf registration statements on form s covering resales of common stock 
the registration rights agreement in each transaction provides that if we do not maintain the effectiveness of the registration statement  then in addition to any other rights the investor may have  we will be required to pay the investor liquidated damages in cash 
a small number of stockholders have significant influence over our business  and the interests of those stockholders may not be consistent with the interests of our other stockholders 
egi currently beneficially owns an aggregate of of our outstanding common stock assuming the exercise of its outstanding warrant to acquire  shares of our common stock

accordingly  these stockholders are able to exert significant influence over all matters requiring stockholder approval  including the election and removal of directors and any merger  consolidation or sale of all or substantially all of our assets  as well as over the day to day management of our business 
these stockholders may direct our affairs in a manner that is not consistent with the interests of our other stockholders 
in addition  this concentration of ownership could have the effect of delaying  deferring or preventing a change in control  or impeding a merger or consolidation  takeover or other business combination or a sale of all or substantially all of our assets 
our certificate of incorporation and provisions of delaware law could discourage a takeover you may consider favorable or could cause current management to become entrenched and difficult to replace 
provisions in our certificate of incorporation and delaware law may have the effect of delaying or preventing a merger or acquisition  or making a merger or acquisition less desirable to a potential acquirer  even when the stockholders may consider the acquisition or merger favorable 
under the terms of our certificate of incorporation  we are authorized to issue million shares of blank check preferred stock  and to determine the price  privileges  and other terms of these shares 
the issuance of any preferred stock with superior rights to our common stock could reduce the value of our common stock 
in particular  specific rights we may grant to future holders of preferred stock could be used to restrict an ability to merge with or sell our assets to a third party  preserving control by present owners and management and preventing you from realizing a premium on your shares 
in addition  we are subject to provisions of the delaware corporation law that  in general  prohibit any business combination with a beneficial owner of or more of our common stock for five years unless the holder s acquisition of our stock was approved in advance by our board of directors 
these provisions could affect our stock price adversely 
the price of our common stock has been and will likely continue to be volatile 
prior to our october initial public offering  there was no public market for our common stock 
the initial public offering price of our common stock was per share 
since our initial public offering  the price of our common stock has been as high as and as low as per share 
some companies that have had volatile market prices for their securities have been subject to securities class action suits filed against them 
if a suit were to be filed against us  regardless of the outcome  it could result in substantial costs and a diversion of our management s attention and resources 
this could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
we may undertake strategic acquisitions of technologies and products 
integration of such technologies and products will involve a variety of costs  and we may never realize the anticipated benefits of such acquisitions 
we intend to pursue opportunities to acquire technologies  brands and products that would allow us to leverage our professional field sales force or our marketing and development expertise or enhance our product portfolio or brand recognition in the prescription market 
we have limited experience in identifying and completing such acquisitions 
further  acquisitions typically entail many risks  including risks related to the integration of the technologies and products 
in attempting to integrate such technologies and products  we may experience unexpected integration costs and delays  which may divert management and employee attention and disrupt our ability to develop and introduce new products 
if we are not able to successfully integrate our acquisitions  we may not be able to realize the intended benefits of the acquisition 
as a result of acquiring products or entering into other significant transactions  we will likely experience  significant charges to earnings for acquisitions and related expenses  including transaction costs  closure costs or acquired in process product development charges 
these costs may include substantial fees for investment bankers  attorneys  accountants  and financial printing costs 
charges that we may incur in connection with acquisitions could adversely affect our results of operations for particular quarterly or annual periods 
in addition  we may lack the required funds or resources to carry out such acquisitions 
we may need additional financing  which may be difficult to obtain 
our failure to obtain necessary financing or doing so on unattractive terms could adversely affect our marketing and development programs and other operations 
we will require substantial funds to commercialize our products  launch new products  promote our brands  and conduct development  including preclinical testing and clinical trials  of our potential products 
we believe that our existing cash  coupled with cash flow from product sales  will be sufficient to fund our anticipated levels of operations through at least the next months 
however  our future capital requirements will depend on many factors  including the success of our commercialization of our products and the costs associated with related marketing  promotional and sales efforts  the timing of new product launches  product development and advancement of other product candidates into development  potential acquisitions or in licensing of other products or technologies  the timing of  and the costs involved in  obtaining regulatory approvals  the cost of manufacturing activities  including raw material sourcing and regulatory compliance  and the costs involved in establishing and protecting our patent  trademark and other intellectual property rights 
additional financing may not be available to us when we need it or on favorable terms  especially during the unfavorable economic conditions that currently exist and that may exist in the future 
if we are unable to obtain adequate financing on a timely basis  we may be required to significantly curtail one or more of our marketing  development  licensing  or acquisition programs 
we could be required to seek funds through arrangements with others that may require us to relinquish rights to some of our technologies  product candidates or products that we would otherwise pursue on our own 
if we raise additional funds by issuing equity securities  our then existing stockholders will experience dilution and the terms of any new equity securities may have preferences over our common stock

item legal proceedings we are not a party to any material pending legal proceedings  other than ordinary routine litigation incidental to our business  except as discussed below 
in august  eli lilly and company provided notice of a legal matter relating to keflex to us 
a product liability claim was filed by jamie kaye moore against eli lilly  teva pharmaceuticals  inc and teva pharmaceuticals industries ltd 
on march  the claim alleges injury from ingestion of some form of keflex 
lilly has determined through discovery that ms 
moore did not take branded keflex but rather took generic cephalexin manufactured by codefendant teva 
lilly filed a motion for summary judgment on the grounds that plaintiff did not take a lilly product 
that motion was denied without prejudice to its refiling 
lilly refiled its motion for summary judgment after the close of discovery 
as the matter remains unresolved  lilly is not currently requesting indemnification from middlebrook

cooper against eli lilly  mylan inc  f k a mylan laboratories  inc  mylan bertek pharmaceuticals  inc 
and mylan pharmaceuticals  inc on august  the claim alleges injury from ingestion of some form of phenytoin and or keflex 
lilly has filed preliminary objections to the complaint  and has also requested prescription and other records  in order to determine whether the plaintiff ingested brand or generic cephalexin and which manufacturer might be involved 
since the identity of the manufacturer is not known  lilly is not currently requesting indemnification from us

as a result of many factors  such as those set forth under the forward looking statements and risks related to our business sections in part  item and elsewhere in this annual report on form k  our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements 
our business middlebrook pharmaceuticals  inc was incorporated in delaware in december and commenced operations on january  we are a pharmaceutical company focused on developing and commercializing anti infective drug products that fulfill unmet medical needs 
we have developed a proprietary delivery technology called pulsys  which enables the pulsatile delivery  or delivery in rapid bursts  of certain drugs 
our pulsys technology can potentially offer the prolonged release and absorption of a drug 
we believe that the pulsatile delivery of certain medicines can provide therapeutic advantages over current dosing regimens and therapies 
we currently have issued us patents and four issued foreign patents covering our pulsys technology which extend through our near term corporate strategy is to improve dosing regimens and frequency of dosing which we believe will result in improved patient dosing convenience and compliance for antibiotics that have been used and trusted for decades 
initially we are focused on developing pulsys product candidates utilizing approved and marketed drugs such as amoxicillin and cephalexin 
our lead pulsys product  based on the antibiotic amoxicillin  received us food and drug administration  or fda  approval for marketing on january   under the trade name moxatag amoxicillin extended release tablets  mg 
moxatag is the first and only fda approved once daily amoxicillin 
it is approved for the treatment of pharyngitis tonsillitis secondary to streptococcus pyogenes  commonly known as strep throat  for adults and pediatric patients age and older 
on march   our member field sales force and district sales managers will begin detailing moxatag to approximately  primary care physicians and  pharmacies to help educate them on the benefits of moxatag 
we believe these primary care physicians have traditionally written most of the prescriptions for antibiotic treatment of strep throats 
we have two additional pulsys product candidates in clinical development 
we are currently in the early stages of preparing for a phase iii clinical trial for our keflex cephalexin pulsys product candidate for the treatment of skin and skin structure infections 
we believe the added convenience of improving cephalexin from its typical two to four times per day dosing regimen to a once daily product represents an attractive commercial opportunity 
assuming the availability of funds  we also plan to conduct a phase ii trial to evaluate various dosing regimens of our amoxicillin pediatric pulsys sprinkle product candidate  which is a sprinkle formulation utilizing the antibiotic amoxicillin for use in pediatric patients greater than two years old with pharyngitis tonsillitis secondary to streptococcus pyogenes 
we currently market certain drug products which do not utilize our pulsys technology and which are not protected by any other patents 
we acquired the us rights to keflex cephalexin  usp  the immediate release brand of cephalexin  from eli lilly in we currently sell our line of immediate release keflex products to wholesalers in capsule formulations  and received fda marketing approval in may for two additional immediate release keflex capsule strengths  mg and mg  however  we only market the mg capsules 
previously  the innovex division of quintiles transnational corporation  or innovex  provided us with a contract sales force for the promotion of keflex mg capsules 
however  in november  we terminated our agreement with innovex  and began to hire an internal dedicated person sales force to prepare for the nationwide launch of moxatag in march general our future operating results will depend largely on our ability to successfully commercialize our lead pulsys product  moxatag  our keflex mg product  and our ability to develop our product candidates in clinical development  which is subject to our having adequate financial resources available 
the results of our operations will vary significantly from year to year and quarter to quarter and depend on a number of factors  including risks related to our business  risks related to our industry  and other risks which are detailed in this annual report on form k 
management overview of the key developments in the following is a summary of key events that occurred during review of strategic alternatives concluded in million equity investment subsequent to receiving fda approval for our moxatag product in january  we announced that we had retained morgan stanley as our strategic advisor to assist us in exploring various strategic alternatives to further enhance stockholder value 
strategic alternatives that were evaluated included  but were not limited to  continued execution of our operating plan  licensing or development arrangements  the sale of some or all of our assets  partnership or other collaboration agreements  or a merger or other strategic transaction 
on july   we announced that we reached an agreement for a million equity investment in us by egi mbrk  llc  or egi 
on september   following stockholder approval  and in accordance with the stock purchase agreement dated july  with egi  we sold  shares of our common stock at per share and a five year warrant to purchase a total of  shares of our common stock at an exercise price of per share to egi in exchange for its million equity investment  or the egi transaction 
in connection with the egi transaction  we repurchased certain keflex assets previously sold to two entities affiliated with deerfield management  or deerfield  kef pharmaceuticals  inc  or kef  and lex pharmaceuticals  inc  or lex  in november by purchasing all of the outstanding capital stock of both kef and lex for approximately million  which canceled our ongoing royalty obligations to deerfield 
additionally  we redeemed the warrant to purchase million shares of our common stock issued to deerfield for a total of million 
as part of the agreement with egi  a new  commercially focused senior management team was appointed 
the net proceeds from the egi transaction  after repurchasing the keflex assets  have allowed us to move forward with the commercial launch of moxatag  including hiring a dedicated sales force  and to continue work on the development of our proprietary delivery technology  or pulsys  product candidate  keflex pulsys 
moxatag approval we received fda approval of our new drug application  or nda  on january   for our once daily amoxicillin pulsys product under the trade name moxatag amoxicillin extended release tablets  mg  which is indicated for the treatment of adults and pediatric patients years and older with pharyngitis and or tonsillitis secondary to streptococcus pyogenes commonly referred to as strep throat 
the fda approval of moxatag combined with our distribution  marketing and professional detail efforts will provide physicians with the first fda approved once daily aminopenicillin antibiotic product for the treatment of pharyngitis 
following approval of moxatag  we were actively engaged in the commercial manufacture  testing and validation of our moxatag tablet production process in cooperation with our contract manufacturer  stada production ireland limited in clonmel  ireland  or stada 
additionally  we retained almac pharma services limited  or almac  to handle the packaging of our moxatag product samples 
orange book listing the orange book is the means by which the fda identifies products it has approved on the basis of safety and efficacy under section of the federal food  drug and cosmetic act  and attached in an addendum to the orange book are any applicable periods of patent and non patent market exclusivity for those fda approved drugs 
in october  section of public law no 
 extended certain hatch waxman act patent and exclusivity benefits to older antibiotics that were historically excluded from these provisions of the federal food  drug  and cosmetic act 
amoxicillin and cephalexin are older antibiotics covered by this new law 
as such  we may be eligible for year exclusivity for these drugs if applicable legal and regulatory requirements are met 
in addition  transition provisions included in the new law permit us to list certain patents in the orange book  thereby requiring that any applicant seeking approval of an abbreviated new drug application  or anda  or section b version of moxatag would have to certify to these patents 
in late  after the enactment of the new law  we submitted  and the fda listed in the orange book  three patents covering moxatag 
moreover  if we submit future b ndas that rely on previous approvals of older antibiotics for which there are orange book listed patents  then we would have to certify to any patents listed in the orange book for those products 
if we subsequently submit an nda for a new use for moxatag  keflex  or our amoxicillin pediatric pulsys sprinkle product candidate those could qualify for three year exclusivity  or if there is an applicable patent covering the drug product  then we will take the necessary steps to ensure that the fda s orange book reflects this 
should we obtain the fda s approval for our line extension of keflex  currently termed keflex pulsys  then we will take the necessary steps to ensure that the fda s orange book reflects any applicable period of patent or non patent market exclusivity 
marketed products keflex cephalexin  usp mg  mg and mg capsules in  net sales of our branded keflex cephalexin  usp immediate release product line were approximately million 
during  we continued our commercialization efforts for our mg strength of keflex capsules through our person contract sales force with innovex 
however  in november  we terminated our agreement with innovex and we began hiring our dedicated sales force of sales representatives and district sales managers 
focus for our primary focus for will be the commercial launch of our moxatag product for adults and pediatric patients years and older  beginning march   along with the continued commercialization of our keflex mg capsules 
we also need to continue to preserve cash prior to achieving commercial profitability and sustainable operating cash 
we also intend to work toward validating additional active pharmaceutical ingredient providers for our products and a new third party manufacturer for our keflex products 
critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  or gaap  in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities and expenses 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates and judgments  including those related to accrued expenses  fair valuation of stock related to stock based compensation and income taxes 
we have based our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue for the sale of pharmaceutical products and for payments received  if any  under collaboration agreements for licensing  milestones  and reimbursement of development costs as follows product sales 
revenue from product sales  net of estimated provisions  is recognized when there is persuasive evidence that an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the selling price is fixed or determinable  and collectability is reasonably probable 
our customers consist primarily of large pharmaceutical wholesalers who sell directly into the retail channel 
provisions for sales discounts  and estimates for chargebacks  service fees  rebates  and product returns are established as a reduction of product sales revenue at the time revenues are recognized  based on historical experience adjusted to reflect known changes in the factors that impact these reserves 
product returns 
in the pharmaceutical industry  customers are normally granted the right to return product for a refund if the product has not been used prior to its expiration date  which for our keflex product is typically three years from the date of manufacture 
our return policy typically allows product returns for products within an eighteen month window from six months prior to the expiration date and up to twelve months after the expiration date 
as of december  and  the liability for product returns was million and million  respectively  and was recorded within accrued expenses and other current liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet 
the decreased liability balance is the result of fewer sales during compared to  which we believe is due to the fewer sales representative detailing physicians about the benefits of keflex mg  due to the reduction of contract sales representatives from in to for most of we estimate the level of sales which will ultimately be returned pursuant to our return policy  and record a related reserve at the time of sale 
these amounts are deducted from our gross sales to determine our net revenues 
our estimates take into consideration historical returns of our products  estimated product in the trade channel  remaining time until expiration and our future expectations 
we periodically review the reserves established for returns and adjust the reserves and estimates based on actual experience 
the amount of actual product returns could be either higher or lower than the amounts accrued by us 
changes in our estimates would be recorded in the income statement in the period of the change 
if we over or under estimate the quantity of product which will ultimately be returned  there may be a material impact to our financial statements 
based on historical experience  we have estimated and accrued approximately of gross product sales for keflex mg and for all other keflex strengths to cover future product returns 
changing that accrual rate by one percentage point would result in an approximately  impact to our financial results by increasing or decreasing net sales 
we have not had reason to make any material changes to the assumptions utilized in our returns estimate 
distribution service fees 
consistent with industry practice  we enter into distribution and inventory management agreements with our key wholesalers to provide incentives to effectively manage channel inventory and provide timely and accurate data with respect to inventory levels and data regarding sales activity 
the distribution service fees paid to each wholesaler are based on agreements and are unique to each wholesaler 
therefore  the reserve fluctuates based on the product mix and sales levels to each wholesaler 
as of december  and  the reserves for distribution service fees related to agreements with wholesalers were approximately  and  respectively  and were recorded as a reduction of gross accounts receivable 
the decreased reserve balance compared to the prior year is the result of decreased sales combined with the timing of the deductions taken by wholesalers 
the reserve is calculated and recorded as a reduction of gross sales at the time the product is sold but the deduction is taken by the wholesaler against a future payment 
based on the unique formula to record these fees for each wholesaler  there have been minimal adjustments to these balances 
chargebacks and rebates 
chargebacks and rebates represent the difference between the prices at which we sell our products to wholesalers and the sales price ultimately paid under fixed price contracts by third party payers  including governmental agencies 
we record an estimate at the time of sale of the amount to be charged back to us or rebated to the end user 
as of december  and  reserves for chargebacks were approximately  and  respectively  and recorded as a reduction of gross accounts receivable 
the reserves for medicaid rebates were approximately  and  respectively  for the same periods and were recorded within accrued expenses and other current liabilities 
the decreases in the reserve balance compared to prior year is driven by decreased sales in compared to combined with the timing of payment and deductions taken against the reserves and a review of historical experience 
we have recorded reserves for chargebacks and rebates based upon various factors  including current contract prices  historical trends  estimated inventory levels and our future expectations 
the amount of actual chargebacks and rebates claimed could be either higher or lower than the amounts we have accrued 
changes in our estimates would be recorded in the income statement in the period of the change 
the accrual rates for chargebacks and rebates are more predictable than for product returns due to the amount of the chargeback or rebate generally being based on contracted dollar amounts or percentages 
additionally  chargebacks and medicaid rebates are typically accrued and paid out or deducted by customers within one to three fiscal quarters compared to product returns which could take up to three years subsequent to the date of sale 
as a result of the more predictable nature of chargebacks and medicaid rebates  we do not believe that the actual amounts claimed will be materially different than the amounts previously accrued and reflected in our financial statements 
other sales allowances and reserves 
we also record other sales allowances and reserves that reduce the total of our gross product revenue 
these allowances and reserves include cash discounts  coupon redemption estimates and pricing discounts 
cash discounts are for prompt payments from customers and are estimated based on customer payment terms and historical experience 
cash discount reserves are recorded as an allowance against accounts receivable 
coupon redemptions are based on the specific terms of the coupon and timing and quantity of distribution combined with historical redemption rates 
the reserve for coupon redemption is recorded as a liability within accrued expenses and other current liabilities 
pricing discounts are based on the specific terms of each discount and are recorded at the time of the sale of such discounted product 
the following table shows the balances of liabilities and accounts receivable valuation accounts resulting from sales reserves and allowances at each balance sheet date december  product returns rebates and other accrued returns  rebates and other distribution service fees chargebacks cash discounts accrued returns  rebates and other are reported within accrued expenses and other current liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet 
distribution fees  chargebacks and cash discounts are reported as valuation allowances against accounts receivable on the consolidated balance sheet 
for the years ended december  and  and  respectively  of net sales were attributable to three customers cardinal health  mckesson and amerisourcebergen 
as a result of this concentration of our sales among a few customers and the similarity of our keflex products  we have been able to closely monitor our reserves against sales and have made minimal adjustments to our assumptions to date 
therefore  most of our provisions made during  and have been associated with products sold during the respective year 
the following table summarizes the activity of accrued returns  distribution fees  chargebacks and other sales allowances rebates total accrued product distribution cash other sales sales reserves returns service fees chargebacks discounts allowances allowances balance at december  provision made for sales during period payments credits balance at december  provision made for sales during period payments credits balance at december  provision made for sales during period provision benefit for sales in prior periods payments credits balance at december  inventories inventory is stated at the lower of cost or market with cost determined under the first in  first out method 
inventory consists of keflex finished capsules 
we purchase our keflex products from third party manufacturers only at the completion of the manufacturing process  and accordingly have no raw material or work in process inventories 
at least on a quarterly basis  we review our inventory levels and write down inventory that has become obsolete or has a cost basis in excess of its expected net realizable value or is in excess of expected requirements 
inventory levels are evaluated by management relative to product demand  remaining shelf life  future marketing plans and other factors  and reserves for obsolete and slow moving inventories are recorded for amounts which may not be realizable 
foreign exchange forward exchange contracts we have entered into three foreign currency forward exchange contracts to hedge forecasted inventory and sample purchase transactions that are subject to foreign exchange exposure to either the euro or british pound sterling 
these instruments are designated as cash flow hedges in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  as amended by sfas no 
 no 
and no 
 sfas  and are recorded in our consolidated balance sheet at fair value in either other current assets for unrealized gains or other current liabilities for unrealized losses 
we formally document our hedge relationships  including identifying the hedging instruments and the hedged items  as well as our risk management objectives and strategies for undertaking the hedge transaction 
this process includes identifying the designated derivative to forecasted transactions 
we also formally assess  both at inception and at least quarterly thereafter  whether the derivatives that are used in hedging transactions are highly effective in offsetting changes in the fair value of the hedged item 
the maturities of the forward exchange contracts generally coincide with the settlement dates of the underlying exposure 
we do not use derivatives for trading purposes and restrict all derivative transactions to those intended for hedging purposes 
intangible assets acquired intangible assets 
we originally acquired the us rights to the keflex brand of cephalexin in during november we sold these rights to deerfield and then reacquired them in september we may acquire additional pharmaceutical products in the future that include license agreements  product rights and other identifiable intangible assets 
when intangible assets are acquired  we review and identify the individual intangible assets acquired and record them based on relative fair values 
each identifiable intangible asset is then reviewed to determine if it has a definite life or indefinite life  and definite lived intangible assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives 
impairment 
we assess the impairment of identifiable intangible assets when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
some factors we consider important which could trigger an impairment review include significant underperformance compared to historical or projected future operating results  significant changes in our use of the acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business  or significant negative industry or economic trends 
if we determine that the carrying value of intangible assets may not be recoverable based upon the existence of one or more of these factors  we first perform an assessment of the asset s recoverability based on expected undiscounted future net cash flow  and if the amount is less than the asset s value  we measure any impairment based on a projected discounted cash flow method using a discount rate determined by our management to be commensurate with the risk inherent in our current business model 
accrued expenses as part of the process of preparing financial statements  we are required to estimate accrued expenses for services performed and liabilities incurred 
this process involves identifying services that have been performed on our behalf and estimating the level of service performed and the associated cost incurred for such service as of each balance sheet date in our financial statements 
examples of estimated accrued expenses for services include professional service fees  such as lawyers and accountants  contract service fees  such as amounts paid to clinical monitors  data management organizations and investigators in conjunction with clinical trials  fees paid to our contract sales organization  and fees paid to contract manufacturers in conjunction with the production of clinical materials 
in connection with such service fees  our estimates are most affected by our understanding of the status and timing of services provided relative to the actual levels of services incurred by such service providers 
the majority of our service providers invoice us monthly in arrears for services performed 
in the event that we do not identify certain costs that have begun to be incurred or we under or over estimate the level of services performed or the costs of such services  our reported expenses for such period would be too low or too high 
the date on which certain services commence  the level of services performed on or before a given date and the cost of such services are often judgmental 
we make these judgments based upon the facts and circumstances known to us in accordance with gaap 
we also make estimates for other liabilities incurred  including health insurance costs for our employees 
we used to be self insured for claims made under our health insurance program and recorded an estimate at the end of a period for claims not yet reported 
our risk exposure is limited  as claims over a maximum amount are covered by an aggregate stop loss insurance policy 
stock based compensation effective january   we adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 
r  share based payment  or sfas r 
we adopted sfas r using the modified prospective transition method  which requires the recognition of compensation expense under the sfas r on a prospective basis only 
accordingly  prior period financial statements were not restated 
under this transition method  stock based compensation cost for the years ended december   and includes a compensation cost for all share based awards granted prior to  but not yet vested as of  january   based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the original provisions of sfas  and b compensation cost for all share based awards granted subsequent to january  based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the fair value provisions of sfas r 
sfas r also requires us to estimate forfeitures in calculating the expense related to share based compensation rather than recognizing forfeitures as a reduction in expense as they occur 
to the extent actual forfeitures differ from our estimates  such amounts will be recorded as a cumulative adjustment in the period that the estimates are revised 
we plan to refine our estimated forfeiture rate as we obtain more historical data 
we determine the value of stock option grants using the black scholes option pricing model 
our determination of fair value of share based payment awards on the date of grant is affected by our stock price as well as assumptions regarding a number of highly complex and subjective variables 
these variables include  but are not limited to  our expected stock price volatility over the term of the awards and projected employee stock option exercise behaviors 
this model requires that we estimate our future expected stock price volatility as well as the period of time that we expect the share based awards to be outstanding 
we estimate the expected term of share based awards granted subsequent to january  utilizing many factors including historical experience  vesting period of awards  expected volatility and employee demographics 
accordingly  as of december   we have estimated the expected term to be years  equal to the length of the vesting periods for most option grants 
previously  we elected to determine the expected term of share based award granted subsequent to january  using the transition approach proved by staff accounting bulletin no 
 under which an expected term of years may be used for four year grants with a ten year contractual term 
a shorter expected term would result in lower compensation expense 
to estimate expected future volatility  we use our historical volatility over a period equal to our estimated expected term of options adjusted for certain unusual  one day fluctuations 
we have no implied volatility data since we have no publicly traded options or other financial instruments from which implied volatility can be derived 
as of december   we changed our volatility from to based on the updated expected term and our adjusted historical volatility 
historically  we based our estimate of expected future volatility upon a combination of our historical volatility together with the average volatility rates of comparable public companies 
using a higher volatility input to the black scholes model would result in a higher compensation expense 
the risk free rate is based on us treasury yields in effect at the time of grant corresponding with the expected term of the options 
estimates of fair value are not intended to predict actual future events or the value ultimately realized by the employees who receive equity awards 
income taxes as part of the process of preparing our financial statements we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
we account for income taxes by the liability method 
under this method  deferred income taxes are recognized for tax consequences in future years of differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their financial reporting amounts at each year end  based on enacted laws and statutory tax rates applicable to the periods in which the differences are expected to affect taxable income 
valuation allowances are provided if  based upon the weight of available evidence  it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
as required by fas  income tax expense or benefit for the year is allocated among continuing operations  discontinued operations  extraordinary items  other comprehensive income  and items charged or credited directly to shareholders equity 
pursuant to this intraperiod allocation requirement   of tax benefit has been allocated to the loss from continuing operations  and  of tax expense has been allocated to the unrealized gains that were recorded in other comprehensive income due to fas and fas we have not recorded any tax provision or benefit for the years ended december  and we have provided a valuation allowance for the full amount of our net deferred tax assets since realization of any future benefit from deductible temporary differences and net operating loss carry forwards cannot presently be sufficiently assured 
at december  and  we had federal and state net operating loss carryforwards of approximately million and million  respectively  available to reduce future taxable income  which will begin to expire in under the provisions of sections and of the internal revenue code  certain substantial changes in our ownership may result in a limitation on the amount of net operating loss and research and experimentation tax credit carry forwards which can be used in future years 
during  and  we may have experienced such ownership changes 
in june  the financial accounting standards board  or fasb  issued fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
 or fin fin clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprise s financial statements in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  or sfas fin prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken on a tax return 
fin also provides guidance on derecognition  classification  interest and penalties  accounting in interim periods  disclosure and transition 
we applied the provisions of fin effective january  the implementation of fin had no impact on our financial condition  results of operations  or cash flows  as we had no unrecognized tax benefits 
warrants freestanding financial instruments  such as detachable warrants  must be evaluated under the authoritative accounting literature to determine whether they should be classified as assets or liabilities derivative accounting  temporary equity  or permanent equity 
management initially evaluates whether the instruments are covered by sfas  accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity  or sfas if the instrument is not governed by sfas  then management determines whether it meets the definition of a derivative under sfas  accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
to determine whether a specific warrant agreement would follow derivative accounting under sfas  management must first evaluate whether the warrant would meet the definition of equity under the provisions of eitf  accounting for derivative financial instruments indexed to  and potentially settled in  a company s own stock  or eitg financial instruments such as warrants that are classified as permanent or temporary equity are excluded from the definition of a derivative for purposes of sfas financial instruments  including warrants  that are classified as assets or liabilities are considered derivatives under sfas  and are marked to market at each reporting date  with the change in fair value recorded in the income statement 
under eitf  contracts that require physical settlement or net share settlement and contracts that give the issuer the choice of settlement in cash or shares are classified as equity 
contracts that require net cash settlement or that give the counterparty a choice which includes net cash settlement are classified as assets or liabilities  not equity 
if a transaction is outside the control of the issuer and there is the possibility that the issuer could net cash settle  then for purposes eitf it is assumed that the issuer will have to net cash settle  which may preclude accounting for a contract as equity of the company except in certain circumstances where the existing common stockholders would also receive cash 
management s judgment is required in evaluating the terms of freestanding instruments  such as warrants  and the application of authoritative accounting literature 
in november  we issued million warrants to affiliates of deerfield in connection with the sale and license of certain non pulsys keflex tangible and intangible assets 
the warrant agreement contains provisions for cash settlement under certain conditions  including a major asset sale or acquisition in certain circumstances  which is available to the warrant holders at their option 
as a result  management concluded that the warrants should be classified as a liability at their contractual fair value in our consolidated balance sheet 
these warrants were redeemed for cash on september   in accordance with the deerfield agreement dated july  all other warrants  including those issued to egi in september  are classified as equity based on the provisions of each warrant agreement 
registration payment arrangements we view a registration rights agreement containing a liquidated damages provision as a separate freestanding contract which has nominal value  and we have followed that accounting approach  consistent with fasb staff position no 
eitf  accounting for registration payment arrangements  or fsp no 
eitf under this approach  the registration rights agreement is accounted for separately from the financial instrument 
under fsp no 
eitf  registration payment arrangements are measured in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies 
should we conclude that it is more likely than not that a liability for liquidated damages will occur  we would record the estimated cash value of the liquidated damages liability at that time 
consolidation of variable interest entities fasb interpretation no 
revised  consolidation of variable interest entities  or fin r  clarifies the application of accounting research bulletin no 
 consolidated financial statements  to certain entities in which equity investors do not have the characteristics of a controlling financial interest or do not have sufficient equity at risk for the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support from other parties 
the usual condition for a controlling financial interest is ownership of a majority of voting interest  however  there may be situations where the controlling financial interest may be achieved through arrangements that do not involve voting interests 
variable interest entities are entities that are subject to consolidation because they meet the provisions of fin r 
management s judgment is required in identifying potential variable interest entities and in evaluating the application of the provisions of fin r to those potential variable interest entities 
paragraph of fin r specifies that an entity shall be subject to consolidation under fin r if a the total equity investment at risk is not sufficient to permit the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support from other parties  or b the equity investment holders lack the direct or indirect ability to make decisions about an entity s activities  the obligation to absorb the expected losses of the entity  or the right to receive the expected residual returns of the entity 
if management concludes that an entity is a variable interest entity under fin r  an analysis must then be made to determine if there is a primary beneficiary  using either a qualitative or quantitative approach 
in accordance with fin r  our management evaluated whether the deerfield affiliates kef and lex are variable interest entities and  if so  whether there is a primary beneficiary with a controlling financial interest 
because middlebrook made the important decisions with respect to the ongoing activities involving the assets owned by kef and lex  the kef and lex entities were determined to be variable interest entities for this characteristic 
because we had a fixed price repurchase option  the equity holders in kef and lex did not have rights to all of the residual returns of the entities  accordingly kef and lex were determined to be variable interest entities for this characteristic 
management used a qualitative analysis to determine whether deerfield or middlebrook was the primary beneficiary of the entities 
middlebrook was determined to be the primary beneficiary  because it was the party exposed to the majority of the risks 
thus  we consolidated the financial condition and results of operations of kef and lex in accordance with fin r 
in connection with the egi transaction  we repurchased those certain keflex assets previously sold to kef and lex in november by purchasing all of the outstanding capital stock of both kef and lex 
accordingly  subsequent to september   we no longer eliminate the noncontrolling interest of kef and lex from our consolidated financial condition and results of operations 
recent accounting pronouncements in june  the emerging issues task force  or eitf  reached a consensus on eitf issue no 
 accounting for nonrefundable advance payments for goods or services to be used in future research and development activities  or eitf eitf concludes that nonrefundable advance payments for future research and development activities should be deferred and capitalized until the goods have been delivered or the related services have been performed 
if an entity does not expect the goods to be delivered or services to be rendered  the capitalized advance payment should be charged to expense 
this consensus is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  adoption of eitf did not have a material effect on our results of operations and financial condition 
in december  the eitf reached a consensus on eitf issue no 
 accounting for collaborative arrangements  or eitf eitf requires collaborators to present the result of activities for which they act as the principal on a gross basis and report any payments received from or made to other collaborators based on other applicable gaap or  in the absence of other applicable gaap  based on analogy to authoritative accounting literature or a reasonable  rational  and consistently applied accounting policy election 
in addition  a participant in a collaborative arrangement should provide the following disclosures separately for each collaborative arrangement a the nature and purpose of the arrangement  b its rights and obligations under the collaborative arrangement  c the accounting policy for the arrangement in accordance with apb opinion  disclosure of accounting policies  and d the income statement classification and amounts arising from the collaborative arrangement between participants for each period an income statement is presented 
eitf will be effective for annual periods beginning after december  adoption of eitf is not expected to have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
revised  business combinations  or sfas r  which is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning on or after december  sfas r establishes principles and requirements for how an acquirer recognizes and measures in its financial statements the identifiable assets acquired  the liabilities assumed  any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree  and the goodwill acquired in the business combination 
sfas r also establishes disclosure requirements to enable the evaluation of the nature and financial effects of the business combination 
sfas r will be applied prospectively 
we will adopt sfas r prospectively on january  in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
 noncontrolling interests in consolidated financial statements  an amendment of arb no 
 or sfas sfas changes the accounting and reporting for minority interests  which will be recharacterized as noncontrolling interests and classified as a component of equity 
sfas also requires that entities provide sufficient disclosures that clearly identify and distinguish between the interests of the parent and the interests of the noncontrolling owners 
sfas is effective for fiscal years beginning on or after december  earlier adoption is prohibited 
sfas will be applied prospectively as of the beginning of the fiscal year in which it is initially applied  except for the presentation and disclosure requirements  which shall be applied retrospectively for all periods presented 
the adoption of sfas is not expected to have a material effect on our results of operations and financial condition 
in february  the fasb issued a fasb staff position  or fsp  to defer the effective date of sfas no 
 fair value measurements  or sfas  for nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities  except for items that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis 
this fsp defers the effective date of sfas to fiscal years beginning after november  the delay is intended to provide the fasb additional time to consider the effect of certain implementation issues that have arisen from the application of sfas to these assets and liabilities 
sfas defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value in accordance with gaap  and expands disclosures about fair value measurements 
we are currently evaluating the effect that the adoption of sfas will have on our results of operations and financial condition 
in march  the fasb issued sfas no 
 disclosures about derivative instruments and hedging activities an amendment of fasb statement no 
 or sfas sfas amends sfas by requiring expanded disclosures about an entity s derivative instruments and hedging activities 
sfas requires qualitative disclosures about objectives and strategies for using derivatives  quantitative disclosures about fair value amounts of and gains and losses on derivative instruments  and disclosures about credit risk related contingent features in derivative instruments 
sfas is effective as of january  we are currently assessing the impact of sfas on our consolidated financial statements 
research and development expenses we expect our research and development expenses to be significant as we continue to develop our product candidates 
these expenses consist primarily of salaries and related expenses for personnel  fees paid to professional service providers in conjunction with independently monitoring our clinical trials and acquiring and evaluating data in conjunction with our clinical trials  development costs for contract manufacturing prior to fda approval of products  costs of materials required to validate the manufacturing process and prepare for commercial launch  depreciation of capital resources used to develop our products  and other costs of facilities 
we expense research and development costs as incurred 
we believe that significant investment in product development is a competitive necessity and plan to continue these investments  assuming sufficient financial resources are available  in order to be in a position to realize the potential of our product candidates and proprietary technologies 
summary of product development initiatives 
the following table summarizes our product development initiatives for the fiscal years ended december   and included in this table is the research and development expense recognized in connection with each product candidate currently in clinical development and all preclinical product candidates as a group 
see item business section our product pipeline above for our current priority product candidates 
incurred from inception january  clinical year ended december  to december  development phase direct project costs moxatag nda approved keflex product development     early stages of preparing for phase iii other product candidates     phase ii on hold total direct project costs indirect project costs facility depreciation other indirect overhead total indirect expense total research development expense many of our research and development costs are not attributable to any individual project because we share resources across several development projects 
we record direct costs  including personnel costs and related benefits and stock based compensation  on a project by project basis 
we record indirect costs that support a number of our research and development activities in the aggregate 
on january   we received approval for marketing from the fda of our amoxicillin pulsys adult and pediatric patients age and older product  with the trade name moxatag 
see item business our approved and marketed products moxatag amoxicillin extended release tablets  mg 
we previously had an agreement under which par pharmaceutical was to be responsible for funding the anticipated future development costs of this product and our amoxicillin pediatric pulsys sprinkle product candidate 
see item business collaboration agreements termination of our collaboration with par pharmaceutical for amoxicillin pulsys above 
assuming availability of funds  we plan to conduct a phase ii clinical trial for our amoxicillin pediatric pulsys sprinkle product candidate 
see item business our product pipeline pulsys product candidates amoxicillin pediatric pulsys sprinkle program above 
direct project costs for keflex product development include development costs for the non pulsatile keflex mg line extension product  which commercially launched in july  as well as research and development costs for a once a day keflex pulsys product candidate 
we are currently in the early stages of preparing for a phase iii clinical trial for our keflex pulsys product candidate 
net losses we have a limited history of operations 
we anticipate that our results of operations will fluctuate for the foreseeable future due to several factors  including the progress of our research and development efforts  the approval and commercial launch of new products  and the timing and outcome of regulatory approvals 
our limited operating history makes predictions of future operations difficult or impossible 
since our inception  we have incurred significant losses 
as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of approximately million 
we anticipate incurring additional annual operating losses in and into results of operations fiscal year ended december  compared to fiscal year ended december  revenues 
we recorded revenues of million during the fiscal year ended december  compared to million during the fiscal year ended december   composed of keflex product sales as follows product sale revenues keflex mg capsules keflex mg and mg capsules total net sales of keflex decreased during compared to while units sold decreased 
a price increase during october helped partially offset the impact of declining units sold on our net revenue 
we believe the primary driver of the decreased sales is fewer prescriptions being written as a result of fewer physicians being detailed about the benefits of keflex mg by our contract sales representatives 
in order to reduce expenses  we decreased our contract sales force from in to during the contract for the sale force was terminated in november cost of product sales 
cost of product sales represents the purchase cost of the keflex products sold during the year  provisions for obsolescence  as well as royalties  if applicable 
the following table discloses the major components of cost of product sales cost of product sales product manufacturing costs obsolescence provisions royalty to eli lilly the decrease in product manufacturing costs during the year reflects the decrease in units sold during compared to  partially offset by an increase in cost per unit across all products 
the royalty to eli lilly also reflects the decrease in sales during as the royalty is calculated based on sales of keflex mg 
the decrease in the obsolescence provision is due to a large provision recorded in to cover excess inventory of keflex mg after initial sales forecasts were lowered resulting in slow moving inventory 
most of this excess inventory was destroyed in obsolescence provisions result from projections of future sales compared to inventory levels  and a determination that a portion of inventory may not be sold prior to expiration date 
consignment and royalty payments we owed to kef and lex based on sales of all keflex non pulsys products are eliminated in the consolidated statement of operations in accordance with fin r 
these payments approximated million from january  through september   and million for the period from november  through december   the periods during which we consolidated kef and lex under the provisions of fin r 
research and development expenses 
research and development expenses decreased million  or  to million for the fiscal year ended december  from million for the fiscal year ended december  research and development expenses consist of direct costs which include salaries and related costs of research and development personnel  and the costs of consultants  materials and supplies associated with research and development projects  as well as clinical studies and manufacturing validation in advance of commercial launch of moxatag 
indirect research and development costs include facilities  depreciation  and other indirect overhead costs 
the following table discloses the components of research and development expenses reflecting our project expenses 
year ended december  research and development expenses direct project costs personnel  benefits and related costs stock based compensation consultants  supplies  materials and other direct costs clinical studies total direct costs indirect project costs total personnel  benefits and related costs decreased million  or  during the year ended december  compared to as a result of lower headcount due to expense reductions 
the lower headcount also drove lower stock based compensation expense for the period 
consultants  supplies  materials and other direct costs also dropped significantly from million to million  or  due to reduced research and development activity as we prepared for the commercial launch of moxatag 
the activity primarily related to our contract manufacturer s facility modifications in clonmel  ireland that were completed by the end of the activity relates to the manufacturing and validation activities to prepare for commercial supply 
indirect project costs increased by million  primarily due to costs related to our ceasing to use parts of our germantown  maryland research facilities  including loss on sales of assets  impairment of leasehold improvements and accelerated expense associated with the lease 
these additional expenses more than offset reductions in other indirect costs 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses decreased million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  year ended december  salaries  benefits and related costs severance costs stock based compensation legal and consulting expenses other expenses marketing costs contract sales expenses total selling  general and administrative expenses consist of salaries and related costs for executive  marketing  selling and other administrative personnel  selling and product distribution costs  professional fees and facility costs 
overall expenses decreased by million  or  compared to prior year 
the driver of the decrease is due to a reduction in the contract sales force from representatives in to representatives during most of the agreement with the contract sales force provider was terminated during the fourth quarter of marketing expenses associated with the keflex mg product also decreased year over year 
these reductions were partially offset by a severance charge recorded during the third quarter of associated with the departure of executives and other employees in connection with the egi transaction in september  along with hiring additional employees as the commercially focused management team began to prepare for the launch of moxatag in the first quarter of other expenses increased over prior year  primarily reflecting increased activity in preparation of hiring our field sales force and other general expenses including insurance  accounting  facility and equipment expenses 
net interest income expense 
net interest income was million for the year ended december  compared to net interest expense of  for the year ended december  the income increase of million represents interest income on increased cash and short term investment balances invested during the year combined with no interest expense during the current year as our merrill lynch capital term debt facility was paid off in november year ended december  interest income interest expense total  net early extinguishment of debt 
in connection with the payoff of the merrill lynch capital debt facility in november  we incurred expenses of million 
we did not have any similar expenses in warrant expense 
warrant expense in of million resulted from recording the full warrant liability of million paid to deerfield in connection with the re acquisition of the keflex intangibles assets during the third quarter of in connection with the egi transaction 
as of december   million of warrant liability had already been expensed

during we received notice from montgomery county that we had met the conditions required for our development loan to be forgiven  and accordingly the full amount was recognized as other income in the quarter 
we had no other income amounts during noncontrolling interest 
pursuant to the agreements that we entered into with deerfield in november  we consolidated the financial condition and results of operations of kef and lex in accordance with fin r until we acquired these entities in september accordingly  during  we have deducted the losses of million attributable to the noncontrolling interest the losses of kef and lex from our net loss in the consolidated statement of operations  and we also reduced the noncontrolling interest holders ownership interest in kef and lex in the consolidated balance sheet by the losses of kef and lex 
this loss represents the loss from january  through the acquisition date of september  during  we deducted losses associated with the noncontrolling interest of million which represents the loss from when we entered into the agreements in november through december subsequent to our acquisition of the entities  we fully consolidated them in our financial condition and result of operations without eliminating any associated losses 
fiscal year ended december  compared to fiscal year ended december  revenues 
we recorded revenues of million during the fiscal year ended december  compared to million during the fiscal year ended december   composed of keflex product sales as follows product sale revenues keflex mg capsules keflex mg and mg capsules total prior to the third quarter of  net product sales consist primarily of shipments of the keflex mg and mg strengths to wholesalers

other income of million in represents the recognition in income of an advance payment received in from a potential buyer of our keflex brand 
we did not enter into a definitive agreement for the asset sale  and in january we decided to retain the keflex assets 
the agreement in principle expired on february  under the circumstances  the advance payment of million was not refundable and was therefore recognized as income in noncontrolling interest 
pursuant to the agreements that we entered into with deerfield in november  we consolidated the financial condition and results of operations of kef and lex in accordance with fin r 
accordingly  we have deducted the losses of million attributable to the noncontrolling interest the losses of kef and lex from our net loss in the consolidated statement of operations  and we have also reduced the noncontrolling interest holders ownership interest in kef and lex in the consolidated balance sheet by the losses of kef and lex

contractual obligations the following table summarizes our contractual obligations at december  and the effects such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flows in future periods 
payments due by period after contractual obligations  total in thousands minimum purchase commitments operating lease obligations total contractual cash obligations other commercial commitments this table does not include potential royalty payments  at a rate of of sales value  to eli lilly and company  which may be due on product line extensions of keflex  including keflex mg 
any such royalties cannot be estimated at this time 
this table does not include a contingent liability to par pharmaceutical under our amoxicillin development and commercialization agreement that was terminated by par in august under certain circumstances  the termination clauses of the agreement may entitle par to receive a share of future net profits  if any  up to one half of par s total million investment in the development of certain amoxicillin pulsys products  should products covered by the agreement be successfully commercialized 
accordingly  we retained million of deferred revenue in recognition of this contingent liability to par 
includes minimum contract termination costs associated with innovex and purchase commitments through purchase orders with our suppliers and contracts with vendors 
in addition to the minimum purchase commitments required under our contracts  we expect to incur additional amounts under contractual arrangements 
these amounts represent software license agreements for our field based sales force and annual license fees for the fda 
in addition to the minimum purchase commitments and contractual obligations in the above table  we may incur funding liabilities for additional obligations which we enter into on a discretionary basis 
these discretionary obligations could include additional facilities or equipment  investments in new technologies or products  acquisitions  funding of clinical trials  or similar events 
as part of our fda approval of moxatag on january   in adults and pediatric patients years and older and in accordance with the requirements of the pediatric research equity act  we received from the fda a deferral to further evaluate our product candidate for pediatric patients with pharyngitis and or tonsillitis as part of a post marketing commitment 
should the results of the phase ii study support proceeding into phase iii  we plan to conduct a phase iii trial in this population 
we agreed to submit a completed study report and data set for our pediatric amoxicillin product candidate in pediatric patients between two and years old by march as part of this commitment 
if the results of the phase ii study do not support proceeding into phase iii  we may file a request for a waiver for the further assessment of the safety and effectiveness of the product in this population 
the funding for these studies is not included in the above table as we cannot estimate the potential exposure at this time 
in connection with some of our private placements  we have registration rights agreements that generally require that we undertake to file a registration statement within a specified number of days  to have the sec declare the registration statement effective within a specified number of days  and that we maintain the effectiveness of the registration statement for a period of time 
these agreements also specify liquidated damages for each day we fail to comply with these obligations 
we have met the required deadlines for filing and for achieving effectiveness of these private placements and have never had a period in which any of our registration statements was not continuously effective 
if the registration statements are declared ineffective  the maximum potential liquidated damages for the private placements would be private placement maximum liquidated damages september million january million april million december million april million off balance sheet arrangements we have not entered into any transactions  agreements or other contractual arrangements that meet the definition of off balance sheet arrangements  with the exception of our private placements of common stock and warrants in september  january  april and april warrants are instruments that meet the definition of a derivative under sfas  although they may qualify for the scope exception under paragraph of sfas in the september private placement  a warrant was issued to purchase  shares of common stock at an exercise price of per share 
in the january private placement  warrants were issued to purchase  shares of common stock at an exercise price of per shares 
in the april private placement  warrants were issued to purchase a total of  shares of common stock at an exercise price of per share 
in the april private placement  warrants were issued to purchase a total of  shares of common stock at an exercise price of per share 
in november  warrants were issued to affiliates of deerfield to purchase a total of  shares of common stock at an exercise price of  these warrants had been determined to be a derivative and were therefore recorded as a liability in our december  balance sheet 
the deerfield warrants were redeemed in connection with the egi transaction in september  and as such are no longer outstanding as of december  in august  we leased additional space adjacent to our germantown  maryland  facility 
we ceased the use of this facility during the third quarter of effective april  another company leased approximately percent of the facility directly from the landlord  with the landlord amending our lease to reflect a rent reduction for the amount of rent the landlord will receive each month from the other company 
we remain contingently liable for the other company s rental payments under a financial guarantee to the landlord 
due to the financial guarantee  we have included percent of the full building rent in our contractual obligations table above for operating lease obligations 
prospective information risks and uncertainties related to our future capital requirements we expect to incur a loss from operations in and into we believe our existing cash resources will be sufficient to fund our operations at least into the first quarter of at our planned levels of research  development  sales and marketing activities  including the launch of moxatag  barring unforeseen developments 
subsequent to the fda s approval for marketing of moxatag in january  we explored various strategic alternatives  including licensing or development arrangements  the sale of some or all of our assets  partnering or other collaboration agreements  or a merger or other strategic transaction 
on july   we announced that we had concluded our review of strategic alternatives with an agreement for a million equity investment by egi 
we entered into a definitive securities purchase agreement with egi for the sale of  shares of our common stock at per share and a five year warrant to purchase a total of  shares of common stock at an exercise price of per share 
the egi transaction closed  following stockholder approval  on september  if the commercialization of moxatag is not successful  we may  if possible  enter into arrangements with other parties to raise additional capital which would dilute the ownership of our equity investors 
there can be no guarantee other financing will be available to us on acceptable terms or at all 
if adequate funds are not available  we would be required to reduce the scope of or eliminate our research and development programs  reduce our commercialization efforts  effect changes to our facilities or personnel and may be forced to seek bankruptcy protection 
to minimize our cash requirements  we have continued our program of cost reductions including postponement of product development programs and elimination of other discretionary spending 
our net cash requirements for will depend  among other things  on the cash received from sales of moxatag and our existing non pulsys products primarily sales of keflex capsules in mg  mg and mg strengths and the cash expended for cost of products sold  including royalties due to eli lilly on keflex mg net revenues  research and development spending  sales and marketing expenses for keflex mg and moxatag  and general and administrative expenses 
our cash receipts and cash expenditures assumptions for include the following continuation of keflex mg monthly prescriptions at the current  to  prescriptions per month rate end user demand  assuming no generic competitive product enters the market in  market acceptance of moxatag and associated end user demand  our internal sales force of approximately representatives and district sales managers  marketing costs associated with the commercial launch of moxatag  and research and development programs for pulsys product candidates under evaluation and dependent on the successful commercialization of moxatag 
we expect to incur a significant loss in  as we expect that revenues from product sales will not be sufficient to fully fund our operating costs 
these estimates are forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties  and actual results could vary 
we have experienced significant losses since our inception in  and as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of million 
the process of developing and commercializing our products requires significant research and development work  preclinical testing and clinical trials  as well as regulatory approvals  significant marketing and sales efforts  and manufacturing capabilities 
these activities  together with our general and administrative expenses  are expected to continue to result in significant operating losses for and into to date  the revenues we have recognized from our non pulsys products have been limited and have not been sufficient for us to achieve or sustain profitability 
our product revenues are unpredictable in the near term and may fluctuate due to many factors  many of which we cannot control  including the market acceptance of our products 
if our products fail to achieve market acceptance  we would have lower product revenues which may increase our capital requirements 
our estimates of future capital requirements are uncertain and will depend on a number of factors  including the success of our commercialization of moxatag  the progress of our research and development of product candidates  the timing and outcome of regulatory approvals  cash received from sales of our immediate release keflex products and our moxatag product  payments received or made under any future collaborative agreements  the costs involved in preparing  filing  prosecuting  maintaining  defending and enforcing patent claims and other intellectual property rights  the acquisition of licenses for new products or compounds  the status of competitive products  the availability of financing and our or our partners success in developing markets for our product candidates 
changes in our commercialization plans  partnering activities  regulatory activities and other developments may increase our rate of spending and decrease the period of time our available resources will fund our operations 
insufficient funds may require us to delay  scale back or eliminate some or all of our research  development or commercialization programs  or may adversely affect our ability to operate as a going concern 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk our exposure to market risk is currently confined to our cash and cash equivalents  marketable securities  and restricted cash which generally have maturities of less than one year 
we currently do not hedge interest rate exposure 
we have not used derivative financial instruments for speculation or trading purposes 
because of the short term maturities of our cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities  we do not believe that an increase in market rates would have any significant impact on the realized value of our investments 
foreign currency risk most of our trade payable transactions are conducted in us dollars usd  although purchases of our moxatag product are paid in euros eur for finished goods and british pound sterling gbp for product samples 
in order to manage the fluctuations in exchange rates between the usd and eur and usd and gbp  middlebrook has entered into several forward exchange contracts that lock in the exchange rate for which we will utilize usd to buy the foreign currency and therefore our inventory 
these contracts are designated as cash flow hedges of the variability of the cash flows due to changes in foreign exchange rates and are marked to market with the resulting gains or losses reflected in other comprehensive income loss 
gains or losses will be included in cost of products sold at the time the products are sold  generally within the next twelve months 
fair value of warrants derivative liabilities in conjunction with the egi transaction  the warrant liability that was recorded in connection with the deerfield management transaction was redeemed for million 
as such  there is no longer a derivative liability on our balance sheet as of december  inflation our most liquid assets are cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities 
because of their liquidity  these assets are not directly affected by inflation 
we also believe that we have intangible assets in the value of our intellectual property 
in accordance with gaap  we have not capitalized the value of this intellectual property on our balance sheet 
due to the nature of this intellectual property  we believe that these intangible assets are not affected by inflation 
because we intend to retain and continue to use our equipment  furniture and fixtures and leasehold improvements  we believe that the incremental inflation related to replacement costs of such items will not materially affect our operations 
however  the rate of inflation affects our expenses  such as those for employee compensation and contract services  which could increase our level of expenses and the rate at which we use our resources
