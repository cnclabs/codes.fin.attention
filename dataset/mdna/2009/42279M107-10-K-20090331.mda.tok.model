overview we are a designer  marketer and distributor of innovative  action sports inspired products under the heelys brand targeted to the youth market 
our primary product  heelys wheeled footwear  is patented  dual purpose footwear that incorporates a stealth  removable wheel in the heel 
heelys wheeled footwear allows the user to seamlessly transition from walking or running to rolling by shifting weight to the heel 
users can transform heelys wheeled footwear into street footwear by removing the wheel 
in  approximately of our net sales was derived from the sale of our heelys wheeled footwear 
the remainder of our net sales was derived from branded accessories  such as replacement wheels  helmets and other protective gear 
we introduced heelys wheeled footwear in  and for several years our domestic sales were concentrated with one large  national specialty retailer 
although we initially focused on driving our domestic sales growth  we also established relationships with independent distributors in japan  south korea and southeast asia 
as a result  the sources of our net sales were largely concentrated and we were susceptible to customer specific and region specific factors 
this concentration caused variability in our results of operations 
since that time  we have diversified our retail customer base in the united states by widening our distribution to include full line sporting goods retailers  specialty apparel and footwear retailers  family footwear stores  and select online retailers 
we have also expanded our international distribution channels to mitigate this concentration 
historically  our products have been sold to independent distributors with exclusive rights to specified international territories 
during the first quarter of  our belgian subsidiary opened an office in belgium to focus on expanding our international opportunities by 
table of contents working more closely with our distributors  establishing relationships with distributors in new international markets and  in select markets  selling our products direct to retail customers 
effective as of march  and april   respectively  we entered into agreements with our distributor in germany and austria and our distributor in france  monaco and andorra whereby we terminated their rights to distribute our products in their specified territories 
our belgium subsidiary took over the distribution of our products in germany and austria effective april  and in france  monaco and andorra effective may  continued growth of our net sales will depend on consumer demand for heelys wheeled footwear and our ability to satisfy this demand 
a number of factors may impact consumer demand for our products  including general economic conditions  particularly changes in consumer discretionary spending patterns  the effectiveness of our marketing strategies  our ability to effectively distribute our products  our ability to design products that appeal to our target consumers  our ability to protect our intellectual property rights  and changes in the popularity of and participation in wheeled sports activities 
we intend to continue to diversify our product offering with new heelys wheeled footwear models in order to benefit from the recognition of our heelys brand 
designing  marketing and distributing new products will require us to devote additional resources to product development  marketing and operations 
these additional resources may include hiring new employees to support expansion in these areas and increasing amounts allocated to product advertising and promotion 
each of these additional resource commitments will increase our selling  general and administrative expenses 
because the selling price and unit cost of new products may differ from those of our existing products  sales of these new products may also impact our gross margin 
in addition  we may seek to selectively acquire products and companies that offer products that are complementary to ours 
recent developments during the second half of  we experienced challenges related primarily to higher than expected inventory positions of product at many of our domestic accounts as weekly unit sales were lower than internal projections of many of our domestic retail customers  which had a significant adverse effect on our results for the second half of certain of our major retailers were reluctant to place significant fourth quarter orders until their current inventory was reduced to their targeted levels 
we also saw decreased prices on our products at certain of our retailers in the fourth quarter of and continuing into these factors led us to work closely with each of our key retail customers to assist them in managing their inventory and sell through 
this included providing marketing discretionary funds  rescheduling orders to later dates  accepting cancellations  increasing marketing promotion and advertising support and accepting returns 
during we have continued to work with our retailers in order to lower their inventory levels and stabilize retail prices 
the retailers have continued to be cautious in placing future orders and have continued to look to us to carry on hand inventory 
we have maintained a tight focus on our inventory levels and have reduced inventory levels from december  although a significant decline from levels  we experienced sequential improvement in net sales and gross margin in the first  second and third quarters 
in the fourth quarter  the slowdown in consumer spending and the highly promotional environment resulted in reduced sales and gross margins 
we also recorded inventory reserves to reduce certain styles of our inventory to the lower of cost or market 
we plan on selling the 
table of contents discounted inventory throughout in the periods in which we sell this inventory  our gross margin will be negatively impacted 
with the passage of the consumer product safety improvement act of  or cpsia  there are new requirements mandated for the textiles and apparel industries 
these mandates relate to all products marketed to children years of age and under 
among other requirements  the consumer product safety commission  or cpsc  will require certification and testing of lead paint levels as applied to certain products  along with testing the lead content of the product as a whole 
we are working with accredited third party testing services to ensure compliance with all cpsia requirements and to further product safety goals 
we will continue to monitor the situation and intend to abide by all rules and changes made by the cpsc 
this could have a negative impact on the cost of our goods and poses a potential risk if we do not adhere to these requirements 
general net sales net sales represent primarily sales of heelys wheeled footwear  less an estimated reserve for sales returns  allowances including certain allowances for marketing  promotion and advertising support and discounts 
a small portion of our net sales are derived from the sale of accessories such as replacement wheels  helmets and other protective gear 
amounts billed to domestic customers for shipping and handling are included in net sales 
we sell our products through distribution channels that generally merchandise our products in a manner that we believe enhances and protects our heelys brand image 
domestically  our products can be found in full line sporting goods retailers  specialty apparel and footwear retailers  select department stores  family footwear stores and select online retailers 
for  of our net sales were derived from domestic retail customers 
internationally  our products are sold primarily to independent distributors with exclusive rights to specified territories 
during the first quarter of  our belgian subsidiary opened an office in belgium to focus on expanding our international opportunities by working more closely with our distributors  establishing relationships with distributors in new international markets and  in select markets  selling our products direct to retail customers 
effective as of march  and april   respectively  we entered into agreements with our distributor in germany and austria and our distributor in france  monaco and andorra whereby we terminated their rights to distribute our products in their specified territories 
our belgian subsidiary took over the distribution of our products in germany and austria effective april  and in france  monaco and andorra effective may  additionally  effective april   our subsidiary in belgium became responsible for sales to our independent distributors in emea europe  middle east and africa 
sales to our customers in germany  austria  france  monaco and andorra are denominated in euro 
sales to our independent distributors in the other emea countries are denominated in us dollars 
sales to our independent distributors in non emea territories will continue to be processed at our office in carrollton  texas and denominated in us dollars 
payments are required to be made in the same currency as invoiced 
no country  other than the united states accounted for or more of our net sales for cost of sales and gross profit cost of sales consists primarily of the cost to purchase finished products from our independent manufacturers 
cost of sales also includes inbound and outbound freight  warehousing expenses  tooling depreciation  royalty expenses related to licensed intellectual property  an inventory reserve for shrinkage and write downs  costs associated with operating our representative office in china and  until  commissions paid to our independent sourcing agent 

table of contents we source all of our products from manufacturers located in china 
our product costs are largely driven by the prices we negotiate with our independent manufacturers 
each season  we negotiate a unit price for each model of heelys wheeled footwear 
factors that influence these prices include raw materials and labor costs and foreign exchange rates 
we believe that our sourcing model allows us to minimize our capital investment  retain the production flexibility  cost effectiveness and scalability inherent in the use of independent manufacturers and focus our resources on developing new products and enhancing our heelys brand image 
through december   we paid an independent sourcing agent a commission equal to a specified percentage of our per unit cost  with the percentage decreasing when our annual purchases exceeded a predetermined unit volume threshold 
in january  we terminated our consulting agreement with the independent sourcing agent and opened a representative office in qingdao  china 
this office serves multiple sourcing functions including quality control  price negotiation  logistics and product development 
we believe our qingdao office will help us improve our research and development efforts  enhance communication between us and our distribution and manufacturing partners and give us more direct control over the manufacturing and sourcing process 
when demand for our products slows  we may elect to discount our products to reduce our inventory  which causes our gross profit as a percentage of net sales  or gross margin  to decline 
our gross margin is affected by our sourcing and distribution costs  our product mix and our ability to avoid excess inventory by accurately forecasting demand for our products 
the unit prices that we charge our domestic and international retail customers are generally higher than what we charge our independent distributors for similar products  because our independent distributors are responsible for distribution and marketing costs relating to our products 
our inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market 
inventory quantities are regularly reviewed and provisions for excess or obsolete inventory are recorded primarily based on the forecast of future demand and market conditions 
if we estimate that the net realizable value of our inventory is less than the cost of the inventory recorded on our books  we charge cost of sales for the difference between the cost of the inventory and the estimated net realizable value 
if changes in market conditions result in reductions in the estimated net realizable value of our inventory below our previous estimate  we would write down the inventory in the period in which we made such a determination and charge cost of sales 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses consist of wages and related payroll and employee benefit costs  sales and marketing expenses  advertising costs  travel and insurance expenses  product development costs  costs to enforce our intellectual property rights  depreciation  amortization  professional fees  facility expenses and costs associated with operating as a public company 
sfas no 
r requires the measurement of compensation cost of stock based compensation awards based on the estimated fair value of that award on the date of grant 
we recognize this compensation cost using the straight line method over the period during which the employee is required to provide service in exchange for the award 
no compensation cost is recognized for awards for which the employee does not render the required service 
if the requisite service is not provided  all previously recognized compensation cost is reversed 
for all awards granted to date  the requisite service period is the same as the vesting period of the award 
our selling  general and administrative expenses may increase in future periods as we hire additional personnel  develop our infrastructure  increase our brand recognition through marketing  increase our product development efforts  secure and enforce our intellectual property rights and incur expenses associated with operating as a public company

in addition  the company is subject to income taxes in certain other states as a result of business activities being performed in those states 
in february  the company formed a subsidiary in belgium  with branch offices in germany and france  to function as the headquarters for european sales operations 
as a result  we are subject to tax in belgium  germany and france for and future periods so long as we have operations in these jurisdictions 
increased activities in foreign jurisdictions or the formation of additional foreign subsidiaries could cause us to be liable for income taxes in additional jurisdictions

payments under these agreements are to be made in euro 
the primary assets acquired as a result of these agreements were the customer lists and goodwill 
in addition  both of these former distributors agreed to not compete with the company for a limited period of time 
the fair value of the acquired assets was based upon the amount at which the assets could be bought or sold in a current transaction between willing parties 
as a result  the company recorded goodwill and intangibles including acquired customer relationships and non compete agreements in the amount of million million euro 
as of december   the company paid million million euro for these acquired assets with the balance of million million euro to be paid out over time in accordance with the terms of the agreements  million is recorded as other long term liability and  is recorded as a current liability 
additionally  as of december   we owed these distributors amounts related to unshipped orders and consulting services

table of contents shipped

future payments  included in the table above  have been estimated using the currency exchange rate as of december  liability uncertain tax positions liabilities including penalties and interest for uncertain tax positions in certain jurisdictions as of december  was million 
we are generally unable to reasonably estimate the timing of the payments or the amount by which a liability will increase or decrease over time  therefore we have only reflected in the payments due by period section of the table above those amounts we were reasonably able to estimate 
seasonality similar to other vendors of footwear products  sales of our products are subject to seasonality 
there are three major buying seasons in footwear spring summer  back to school and holiday 
we offer two primary lines spring summer and a combined back to school holiday line 
a few new styles will typically be added for holiday 
shipments for spring summer take place during the first quarter and early weeks of the second quarter  shipments for back to school generally begin in may and finish in late august and shipments for the holiday season begin in october and finish in early december 
historically  we have experienced greater revenues in the second half of the year than those in the first half due to a concentration of shopping around the back to school and holiday seasons 
in  due to the growth of our business and the delays we experienced from our independent manufacturers  we experienced a higher percentage of net sales in the third quarter in comparison to the total year than we experienced in the past  as many orders were delayed from the second quarter to the third quarter  thereby causing the second quarter to be lower than normal and the third quarter to be higher than normal 
in  we estimate that approximately million of net sales shifted from the second quarter to the third quarter due to late shipments 
during the second half of  we experienced challenges related primarily to higher than expected inventory positions of product at many of our domestic accounts as weekly unit sales were lower than internal projections of many of our domestic retail customers  which had a significant adverse effect on our results for the second half of we believe that this was attributed to aggressive sell through expectations of some of our domestic retailers going into the summer months and retail softness in footwear and apparel 
certain of our major retailers were reluctant to place significant fourth quarter orders until their current inventory was reduced to their targeted levels 
we also saw decreased prices on our products at certain of our retailers in the fourth quarter of and continuing into these factors led us to work closely with each of our key retail customers to assist them in managing their inventory and sell through 
this included providing marketing discretionary funds  rescheduling orders to later dates  accepting cancellations  increasing marketing  promotion and advertising support  and accepting returns 
while inventory levels at many of our domestic retailers decreased during  we continued to see decreased retail prices on many of our products during a difficult footwear and apparel environment 
many retailers were reluctant to place orders which resulted in decreased sales 
we expect our retail customers to continue to be more cautious when placing future orders and to shift 
table of contents toward shorter lead times and at once inventory purchases 
additionally  we expect to continue to provide marketing  promotional and advertising support to our retail customers to promote the sell through of our products and monitor inventory levels at our retail customers in an effort to manage the balance between supply and demand in the retail channel 
results for any one quarter are not necessarily indicative of results to be expected for any other quarter or for any year 
backlog historically  we received most of our orders three to four months prior to the date the products were shipped to customers 
at december   our backlog was approximately million  compared to approximately million at december  although generally  these orders are not subject to cancellation prior to the date of shipment  cancellations have and may continue to occur 
during the second half of and continuing through  many of our retail customers were cautious when placing future orders with us and shifting toward shorter lead times 
we believe this was attributed to retail softness in footwear and apparel 
this trend required us to take more aggressive inventory position to be able to meet at once orders 
while we will continue to experience some rescheduled orders  cancellations and returns in the normal course of business  we do not anticipate  at this time  for those to be as significant as those we encountered during the second half of and continuing into the first half of we expect our retail customers to continue to be more cautious when placing future orders and shifting toward shorter lead times and at once inventory purchases 
we will continue to provide marketing  promotional and advertising support to our retail customers to promote the sell through of our products 
we will actively monitor inventory levels at our retail customers in an effort to manage the balance between supply and demand in the retail channel 
for a variety of reasons  including the timing of release dates for our product offerings  shipments  order deadlines and receipt of orders  backlog may not be a reliable measure of future sales and may not be comparable from one period to another 
vulnerability due to customer concentration in  journeys represented of our net sales 
for  finish line accounted for of our net sales 
in  journeys represented of our net sales 
no other retail customer or independent distributor accounted for or more of our net sales in any of these periods 
we anticipate that our net sales may remain concentrated for the foreseeable future 
if any of our significant retail customers or independent distributors decreases its purchases of our products or stops purchasing our products our net sales and results of operations could be adversely affected 
critical accounting policies our management s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  net sales and expenses and related disclosure at the date of our financial statements 
we continually evaluate our estimates and judgments  including those related to net sales  collectability of accounts receivable  inventory reserve allowances  long lived assets  income taxes and stock based compensation 
we base our estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis of our judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results or changes in the estimates or other judgments of matters inherently uncertain that are included within these accounting policies could result in a significant change to the information presented in the consolidated financial statements 
we believe that the 
table of contents following discussion addresses the critical accounting policies that are necessary to understand and evaluate our reported consolidated financial results 
revenue recognition 
revenues are recognized when merchandise is shipped and the customer takes title and assumes risk of loss  collection of relevant receivables are probable  persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists and the sales price is fixed or determinable 
title passes upon shipment or upon receipt by the customer depending on the agreement with the customer 
revenues are stated net of estimated returns and other allowances  including permitted returns of damaged or defective merchandise and marketing discretionary funds 
other allowances include funds for promotional and marketing activities and a volume based incentive program 
we base our estimates and judgments on historical experience and other various factors including customer communications  and analysis of relevant market information 
reserve for uncollectible accounts receivable 
we continually make estimates relating to the collectability of our accounts receivable and maintain a reserve for estimated losses resulting from the failure of our customers to make required payments 
in determining the amount of the reserve  we consider our historical level of credit losses and make judgments about the creditworthiness of significant customers 
because we cannot predict future changes in the financial stability of our customers  actual future losses from uncollectible accounts may differ from our estimates 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in their inability to make payments  a larger reserve might be required 
if we determined that a smaller or larger reserve was appropriate  we would record a benefit or charge to general and administrative expense in the period in which we made such a determination 
inventory write downs 
our inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market 
inventory quantities are regularly reviewed and provisions for excess or obsolete inventory are recorded primarily based on the forecast of future demand and market conditions 
if we estimate that the net realizable value of our inventory is less than the cost of the inventory recorded on our books  we record a write down equal to the difference between the cost of the inventory and the estimated net realizable value 
this write down is recorded to cost of sales 
if changes in market conditions result in reductions in the estimated net realizable value of our inventory below our previous estimate  we would increase our write down in the period in which we made such a determination and record it to cost of sales 
property and equipment 
property and equipment  including furniture and fixtures  office equipment  plant equipment  leasehold improvements  computer hardware and software are recorded at cost and this cost is depreciated over the asset s estimated useful life 
we continually evaluate whether events and circumstances have occurred that indicate the remaining estimated useful life of long lived assets may warrant revision or that the remaining balance may not be recoverable 
these factors may include a significant deterioration of operating results  changes in business plans or changes in anticipated cash flow 
when factors indicate that a long lived asset should be evaluated for possible impairment  we review the asset or property to assess recoverability from future operations using the undiscounted pre tax future net cash flows expected to be generated by that asset or property 
impairments are recognized in earnings to the extent that the carrying value exceeds fair value 
goodwill and other intangible assets 
in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas  goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives are not amortized but are instead measured for impairment at least annually  or when events indicate that an impairment might exist 
as required by sfas  in impairment tests for goodwill  we compared the estimated fair value of goodwill to the carrying value over our estimate of fair value 
our estimates of fair value utilized in goodwill tests may be based upon a number of factors  including assumptions about the expected future operating performance of our reporting units 
estimates may change in future periods due to  among other things  the expected future operating performance of our reporting units 
estimates may also change in future periods as a result of  among other things  technological change  
table of contents economic conditions  change to our business operations or inability to meet business plans 
such changes may result in impairment charges recorded in future periods 
any impairment charge related to goodwill would be classified as a separate line item on the consolidated statement of operations for amounts necessary to reduce the carrying value of the asset to fair value 
in the fourth quarter of  we performed the required annual impairment test and determined that no goodwill impairment existed 
income tax 
tax laws require items to be included in our tax returns at different times than when these items are reflected in the consolidated financial statements 
some of these differences are permanent  such as expenses that are not deductible in our tax return  and some differences reverse over time  such as depreciation expense 
these timing differences create deferred tax assets and liabilities 
we assess the realizability of our deferred tax assets to determine whether a valuation allowance is required 
based on all available evidence  both positive and negative  and the weight of that evidence to the extent such evidence can be objectively verified  if we determine if it is more likely than not the deferred tax asset will not be realized a valuation allowance is established 
uncertain tax positions 
in july  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes fin 
fin clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprise s financial statements in accordance with fasb statement no 
 accounting for income taxes 
fin prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
significant judgment is required in determining whether the recognition threshold has been met for recording an uncertain tax benefit and in determining the appropriate measurement of the uncertain benefit under fin stock based compensation 
we account for stock based compensation in accordance with sfas no 
r  which requires the measurement of compensation cost based on the estimated fair value of the award on the date of grant 
we recognize that cost using the straight line method over the period during which an employee is required to provide service in exchange for the award the requisite service period 
no compensation cost is recognized for equity instruments for which employees do not render the requisite service 
we determine the grant date fair value of employee stock options using the black scholes option pricing model 
the amount of compensation expense recognized will depend upon numerous factors and estimates  including the number and vesting period of option grants  the publicly traded price of our common stock  the estimated volatility of our common stock price  estimates of the timing and volume of exercises and forfeitures of the options and fluctuations in future interest and income tax rates

table of contents points  for every million outstanding under our revolving credit facility  our income before income taxes would be reduced by approximately  per year 
we are not party to any derivative financial instruments 
our independent distributors pay us in us dollars 
because our independent manufacturers buy materials and pay for manufacturing expenses in their local currencies  to the extent the us dollar weakens compared to such local currencies  our operating results may be adversely affected 
conversely  to the extent the us dollar strengthens compared to local currencies in foreign markets where our products are sold  our products may appear more expensive relative to local products
