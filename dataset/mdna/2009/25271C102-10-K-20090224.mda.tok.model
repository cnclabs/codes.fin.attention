item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the following discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements including the notes thereto in item of this report 
we provide contract drilling services to the energy industry around the globe and are a leader in offshore drilling with a fleet of offshore drilling rigs 
our fleet currently consists of semisubmersibles  jack ups and one drillship 
overview industry conditions the global economic recession significantly reduced energy demand in the fourth quarter of and into the first quarter of as a result  crude oil prices have fallen from a mid summer high of per barrel to as low as per barrel in mid february  and remain volatile 
with the falling energy prices  project economics for our customers have deteriorated  exploration budgets have been trimmed  and demand and pricing for available drilling rigs is declining 
our contract backlog should help mitigate the impact of the current market on us  however  a prolonged decline in commodity prices and the global economy could have a negative impact on us 
possible negative impacts  among others  could include customer credit problems  customers seeking bankruptcy protection  customers attempting to renegotiate or terminate contracts  a further slowing in the pace of new contracting activity  additional declines in dayrates for new contracts  declines in utilization and the stacking of idle equipment 
floaters the majority of our intermediate and high specification floater rigs are largely contracted for the remainder of additionally  contracts for of our floating rigs extend at least through  with of our floating units having contracts extending into the timeframe 
however  during the first quarter of a customer employing our semisubmersible ocean guardian in the united kingdom  or uk  sector of the north sea entered into administration under uk law a uk insolvency proceeding similar to uk chapter bankruptcy reorganization but with an external manager  typically an accountant  running the company 
the rig  which was operating under a contract that extends until september  is currently on standby and is not earning revenue 
in the us gulf of mexico  or gom  during the fourth quarter of  a customer breached its contract with us and canceled the second well of a two well project for the semisubmersible ocean victory 
we were able to re contract the rig  albeit at a lower dayrate  to fill the resulting short gap until a previously committed job is scheduled to begin 
we are continuing to pursue appropriate contractual remedies with both customers 
international jack ups the industry s jack up market is divided between an international sector and a us sector  with the international sector generally characterized by contracts of longer duration and higher prices  compared to the generally shorter term and lower priced domestic sector 
however  in to the date of this report  demand and dayrates have continued to soften internationally 
based on analyst reports to the effect that less than of the industry s new build jack up order book is under contract  it is possible that an oversupply of jack up rigs will have an increasingly negative impact on the international sector during and beyond 
us gulf of mexico jack ups in the domestic jack up sector  rapidly declining product prices have negatively impacted both demand and dayrates 
in response  where possible we are continuing to seek to move units out of the gom and into markets with generally longer contract duration and higher prices 
in that regard  we were low bidder for a day job for the ft 
ocean summit and for an day extension for the ft 
ocean nugget 
both bids are for work offshore mexico and remain subject to final approvals 
absent improving product prices  weakness in the gom is likely to continue in  with an increasing number of rigs being cold stacked by the industry in an effort to help bring equipment supply and demand into equilibrium 

table of contents contract drilling backlog the following table reflects our contract drilling backlog as of february   october  the date reported in our quarterly report on form q for the quarter ended september  and february  the date reported in our annual report on form k for the year ended december  and for the periods includes both firm commitments typically represented by signed contracts  as well as previously disclosed letters of intent  or lois  where indicated 
an loi is subject to customary conditions  including the execution of a definitive agreement  and as such may not result in a binding contract 
contract drilling backlog is calculated by multiplying the contracted operating dayrate by the firm contract period and adding one half of any potential rig performance bonuses 
our calculation also assumes full utilization of our drilling equipment for the contract period excluding scheduled shipyard and survey days  however  the amount of actual revenue earned and the actual periods during which revenues are earned will be different than the amounts and periods shown in the tables below due to various factors 
utilization rates  which generally approach during contracted periods  can be adversely impacted by downtime due to various operating factors including  but not limited to  weather conditions and unscheduled repairs and maintenance 
contract drilling backlog excludes revenues for mobilization  demobilization  contract preparation and customer reimbursables 
no revenue is generally earned during periods of downtime for regulatory surveys 
changes in our contract drilling backlog between periods are a function of the performance of work on term contracts  as well as the extension or modification of existing term contracts and the execution of additional contracts

casualty loss in september  the jack up rig ocean tower sustained significant damage during hurricane ike  which impacted the gulf of mexico and the upper texas and louisiana gulf coasts 
the ocean tower lost its derrick  drill floor and drill floor equipment during the hurricane 
during the third quarter of  we wrote off the net book value of the derrick  drill floor and drill floor equipment for the ocean tower of approximately million and accrued million in estimated salvage costs for the recovery of equipment from the ocean floor 
the aggregate of these items is reflected in casualty loss in our consolidated statements of operations for the year ended december  included in item of this report 
in december  we entered into an agreement to sell the ocean tower at a price in excess of its million carrying value and transferred the million net book value of the rig to assets held for sale in our consolidated balance sheets included in item of this report 
the agreement prohibits competitive use of the rig  which is expected to be deployed by the purchaser as an accommodation unit 
we do not expect the sale of the ocean tower to have a material impact on our financial position  results of operations  or our ability to compete in the jack up market 
in connection with the execution of the sales agreement  we received a million deposit from the purchaser which we have recorded in accrued liabilities in our consolidated balance sheet at december  included in item of this report 
we expect to complete the sale in the first quarter of general the two most significant variables affecting revenues are dayrates for rigs and rig utilization rates  each of which is a function of rig supply and demand in the marketplace 
demand for drilling services is dependent upon the level of expenditures set by oil and gas companies for offshore exploration and development  as well as a variety of political and economic factors 
the availability of rigs in a particular geographical region also affects both dayrates and utilization rates 
these factors are not within our control and are difficult to predict 
demand affects the number of days our fleet is utilized and the dayrates earned 
as utilization rates increase  dayrates tend to increase as well  reflecting the lower supply of available rigs 
conversely  as utilization rates decrease  dayrates tend to decrease as well  reflecting the excess supply of rigs 
when a rig is idle  no dayrate is earned and revenues will decrease as a result 
revenues can also be affected as a result of the acquisition or disposal of rigs  required surveys and shipyard upgrades 
in order to improve utilization or realize higher dayrates  we may mobilize our rigs from one market to another 
however  during periods of mobilization  revenues may be adversely affected 
as a response to changes in demand  we may withdraw a rig from the market by stacking it or may reactivate a rig stacked previously  which may decrease or increase revenues  respectively 
we recognize revenue from dayrate drilling contracts as services are performed 
in connection with such drilling contracts  we may receive fees either lump sum or dayrate for the mobilization of equipment 
we earn these fees as services are performed over the initial term of the related drilling contracts 
we defer mobilization fees received  as well as direct and incremental mobilization costs incurred  and amortize each  on a straight line basis  over the term of the related drilling contracts which is the period estimated to be benefited from the mobilization activity 
straight line amortization of mobilization revenues and related costs over the term of the related drilling contracts which generally range from two to months is consistent with the timing of net cash flows generated from the actual drilling services performed 
absent a contract  mobilization costs are recognized currently 
from time to time  we may receive fees from our customers for capital improvements to our rigs either lump sum or dayrate 
we defer such fees and recognize them into income on a straight line basis over the period of the related drilling contract as a component of contract drilling revenue 
we capitalize the costs of such capital improvements and depreciate them over the estimated useful life of the improvement 
we receive reimbursements for the purchase of supplies  equipment  personnel services and other services provided at the request of our customers in accordance with a contract or agreement 
we record these reimbursements at the gross amount billed to the customer  as revenues related to reimbursable expenses in our consolidated statements of operations included in item of this report 

table of contents operating income 
our operating income is primarily affected by revenue factors  but is also a function of varying levels of operating expenses 
our operating expenses represent all direct and indirect costs associated with the operation and maintenance of our drilling equipment 
the principal components of our operating costs are  among other things  direct and indirect costs of labor and benefits  repairs and maintenance  freight  regulatory inspections  boat and helicopter rentals and insurance 
labor and repair and maintenance costs represent the most significant components of our operating expenses 
in general  our labor costs increase primarily due to higher salary levels  rig staffing requirements and costs associated with labor regulations in the geographic regions in which our rigs operate 
in recent years  we have experienced upward pressure on salaries and wages as a result of the strong offshore drilling market during this period and increased competition for skilled workers 
in response to these market conditions we have implemented retention programs  including increases in compensation 
costs to repair and maintain our equipment fluctuate depending upon the type of activity the drilling unit is performing  as well as the age and condition of the equipment and the regions in which our rigs are working 
operating expenses generally are not affected by changes in dayrates  and short term reductions in utilization do not necessarily result in lower operating expenses 
for instance  if a rig is to be idle for a short period of time  few decreases in operating expenses may actually occur since the rig is typically maintained in a prepared or ready stacked state with a full crew 
in addition  when a rig is idle  we are responsible for certain operating expenses such as rig fuel and supply boat costs  which are typically costs of the operator when a rig is under contract 
however  if the rig is to be idle for an extended period of time  we may reduce the size of a rig s crew and take steps to cold stack the rig  which lowers expenses and partially offsets the impact on operating income 
we recognize  as incurred  operating expenses related to activities such as inspections  painting projects and routine overhauls that meet certain criteria and which maintain rather than upgrade our rigs 
these expenses vary from period to period 
costs of rig enhancements are capitalized and depreciated over the expected useful lives of the enhancements 
higher depreciation expense decreases operating income in periods subsequent to capital upgrades 
periods of high  sustained utilization may result in cost increases for maintenance and repairs in order to maintain our equipment in proper  working order 
in addition  during periods of high activity and dayrates  higher prices generally pervade the entire offshore drilling industry and its support businesses  which cause our costs for goods and services to increase 
our operating income is negatively impacted when we perform certain regulatory inspections  which we refer to as a year survey  or special survey  that are due every five years for each of our rigs 
operating revenue decreases because these surveys are performed during scheduled downtime in a shipyard 
operating expenses increase as a result of these surveys due to the cost to mobilize the rigs to a shipyard  inspection costs incurred and repair and maintenance costs 
repair and maintenance costs may be required resulting from the survey or may have been previously planned to take place during this mandatory downtime 
the number of rigs undergoing a year survey will vary from year to year  as well as from quarter to quarter 
in addition  operating income may be negatively impacted by intermediate surveys  which are performed at interim periods between year surveys 
intermediate surveys are generally less extensive in duration and scope than a year survey 
although an intermediate survey may require some downtime for the drilling rig  it normally does not require dry docking or shipyard time  except for rigs located in the uk and norwegian sectors of the north sea 
during  five of our rigs will require year surveys  and we expect that they will be out of service for approximately days in the aggregate 
we also expect to spend an additional approximately days during for intermediate surveys  the mobilization of rigs  contract modifications for international contracts and extended maintenance projects 
in addition  we expect the ocean bounty to be taken out of service at some time after the first quarter of for a repowering project and minor water depth upgrade 
we expect these projects to take approximately one year to complete and to extend to we can provide no assurance as to the exact timing and or duration of downtime associated with regulatory inspections  planned rig mobilizations and other shipyard projects 
see overview contract drilling backlog 
under our current insurance policy that expires on may   our deductible for physical damage is million per occurrence or lower for some rigs if they are declared a constructive total loss in the us gulf of mexico due to named windstorms with an annual aggregate limit of million 
accordingly  our insurance coverage for all physical damage to our rigs and equipment caused by named windstorms in the us gulf of mexico for the policy period ending may  is limited to million 
if named windstorms in the us gulf of 
table of contents mexico cause significant damage to our rigs  it could have a material adverse effect on our financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
insurance premiums are amortized as expense over the applicable policy periods which generally expire at the end of april construction and capital upgrade projects 
we capitalize interest cost for the construction and upgrade of qualifying assets in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards  or sfas  no 
 capitalization of interest cost  or sfas pursuant to sfas  the period of interest capitalization covers the duration of the activities required to make the asset ready for its intended use  and the capitalization period ends when the asset is substantially complete and ready for its intended use 
for the three years ended december   we capitalized interest on qualifying expenditures related to the upgrades of the ocean endeavor and ocean monarch for ultra deepwater service and the construction of two jack up rigs  the ocean shield and ocean scepter through the date of each project s completion 
the upgrades of the ocean endeavor and ocean monarch were completed in march and december  respectively 
construction of the ocean shield and ocean scepter was completed in may and august  respectively 
as a result of the delivery of these rigs in  we anticipate that depreciation and interest expense in will increase by approximately million and million  respectively  compared to critical accounting estimates our significant accounting policies are included in note general information to our consolidated financial statements in item of this report 
judgments  assumptions and estimates by our management are inherent in the preparation of our financial statements and the application of our significant accounting policies 
we believe that our most critical accounting estimates are as follows property  plant and equipment 
we carry our drilling and other property and equipment at cost 
maintenance and routine repairs are charged to income currently while replacements and betterments  which meet certain criteria  are capitalized 
depreciation is amortized up to applicable salvage values by applying the straight line method over the remaining estimated useful lives 
our management makes judgments  assumptions and estimates regarding capitalization  useful lives and salvage values 
changes in these judgments  assumptions and estimates could produce results that differ from those reported 
we evaluate our property and equipment for impairment whenever changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
we utilize a probability weighted cash flow analysis in testing an asset for potential impairment 
our assumptions and estimates underlying this analysis include the following dayrate by rig  utilization rate by rig expressed as the actual percentage of time per year that the rig would be used  the per day operating cost for each rig if active  ready stacked or cold stacked  and salvage value for each rig 
based on these assumptions and estimates  we develop a matrix by assigning probabilities to various combinations of assumed utilization rates and dayrates 
we also consider the impact of a reduction in assumed dayrates for the cold stacked rigs holding all other assumptions and estimates in the model constant  or alternatively the impact of a reduction in utilization again holding all other assumptions and estimates in the model constant as part of our analysis 
as of december   all  except for two  of our drilling rigs were either under contract  in shipyards for surveys or contract modifications or  in the case of the recently upgraded ocean monarch  mobilizing to the us one of these idle units  the ocean tower  which was damaged during hurricane ike in september  has been transferred to assets held for sale in our consolidated balance sheets at december  included in item of this report 
we have entered into an agreement to sell the rig for a price in excess of its carrying value 
at december   the second of our idle rigs was ready stacked while waiting to begin drilling operations in early january we did not have any cold stacked rigs at december  we do not believe that current circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of our property and equipment may not be recoverable 

table of contents management s assumptions are an inherent part of our asset impairment evaluation and the use of different assumptions could produce results that differ from those reported 
personal injury claims 
our deductible for liability coverage for personal injury claims  which primarily result from jones act liability in the gulf of mexico  is million per occurrence  with no aggregate deductible 
the jones act is a federal law that permits seamen to seek compensation for certain injuries during the course of their employment on a vessel and governs the liability of vessel operators and marine employers for the work related injury or death of an employee 
we estimate our aggregate reserve for personal injury claims based on our historical losses and utilizing various actuarial models 
the eventual settlement or adjudication of these claims could differ materially from our estimated amounts due to uncertainties such as the severity of personal injuries claimed  significant changes in the volume of personal injury claims  the unpredictability of legal jurisdictions where the claims will ultimately be litigated  inconsistent court decisions  and the risks and lack of predictability inherent in personal injury litigation 
income taxes 
we account for income taxes in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  or sfas  which requires the recognition of the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year and an asset and liability approach in recognizing the amount of deferred tax liabilities and assets for the future tax consequences of events that have been currently recognized in our financial statements or tax returns 
in each of our tax jurisdictions we recognize a current tax liability or asset for the estimated taxes payable or refundable  respectively  on tax returns for the current year and a deferred tax asset or liability for the estimated future tax effects attributable to temporary differences and carryforwards 
deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance  if necessary  which is determined by the amount of any tax benefits that  based on available evidence  are not expected to be realized under a more likely than not approach 
for interim periods  we estimate our annual effective tax rate by forecasting our annual income before income tax  taxable income and tax expense in each of our tax jurisdictions 
we make judgments regarding future events and related estimates especially as they pertain to forecasting of our effective tax rate  the potential realization of deferred tax assets such as utilization of foreign tax credits  and exposure to the disallowance of items deducted on tax returns upon audit 
we adopted the provisions of financial accounting standards board  or fasb  interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes  or fin  on january  as a result of the implementation of fin  we recognized a long term tax receivable of million and a long term tax liability of million for uncertain tax positions excluding interest and penalties  the net of which was accounted for as a reduction to the january  balance of retained earnings 

table of contents results of operations although we perform contract drilling services with different types of drilling rigs and in many geographic locations  there is a similarity of economic characteristics among all our divisions and locations  including the nature of services provided and the type of customers for our services 
we believe that the combination of our drilling rigs into one reportable segment is the appropriate aggregation in accordance with sfas no 
 disclosures about segments of an enterprise and related information 
however  for purposes of this discussion and analysis of our results of operations  we provide greater detail with respect to the types of rigs in our fleet and the geographic regions in which they operate to enhance the reader s understanding of our financial condition  changes in financial condition and results of operations

table of contents demand remained strong for our high specification floaters and intermediate semisubmersible rigs in all markets and geographic regions during the first nine months of during the fourth quarter of  the growing global economic recession became apparent in our industry  resulting in reduced demand for energy and a significant decline in crude oil prices 
however  because of our contracted revenue backlog  our results were not greatly impacted by these market conditions during the fourth quarter of the high overall utilization and historically high dayrates for our floater fleet contributed to an overall increase in our revenues of million  or  to billion in compared to billion in total contract drilling revenues in increased million  or compared to  to billion 
average realized dayrates in many of our floater markets increased as our rigs began operating under contracts at higher dayrates than those earned during  resulting in the generation of additional contract drilling revenues 
however  overall revenue increases for our floater fleet were negatively impacted by the effect of downtime associated with scheduled shipyard projects and mandatory inspections or surveys 
in addition  the gom jack up market  which was improving in early  began experiencing reduced demand and dayrates by the end of the international jack up market  which had been strong throughout the majority of  also began to reflect softening demand and reduced dayrates by the end of our gom and international jack up fleets earned lower dayrates during compared to despite a fleet wide increase in utilization during total contract drilling expenses increased million  or  in compared to overall cost increases for maintenance and repairs between the and periods reflect the impact of high  sustained utilization of our drilling units across our fleet  additional survey and related maintenance costs  contract preparation and mobilization costs  as well as the inclusion of normal operating costs for the ocean endeavor  ocean shield and ocean scepter 
the increase in overall operating and overhead costs also reflects the impact of higher prices throughout the offshore drilling industry and its support businesses  including higher costs associated with hiring and retaining skilled personnel for our worldwide offshore fleet 
depreciation expense increased million to million during  or compared to  due to a higher depreciable asset base

cash flows from operations 
our cash flows from operations are impacted by the ability of our customers to weather the current global financial and credit crisis 
in general  before working for a customer with whom we have not had a prior business relationship and or whose financial stability may be uncertain to us  we perform a credit review on that company 
based on that analysis  we may require that the customer present a letter of credit  prepay or provide other credit enhancements 
tightening of the credit markets may preclude us from doing business with potential customers and could have an impact on our existing customers  causing them to fail to meet their obligations to us

we believe that our operating cash flows and cash reserves will be sufficient to meet both our working capital requirements and our capital commitments over the next twelve months  however  we will continue to make periodic assessments based on industry conditions and will adjust capital spending programs if required 
in addition  we may  from time to time  issue debt or equity securities  or a combination thereof  to finance capital expenditures  the acquisition of assets and businesses or for general corporate purposes

our measure of market risk exposure represents an estimate of the change in fair value of our financial instruments 
market risk exposure is presented for each class of financial instrument held by us at december  and december   assuming immediate adverse market movements of the magnitude described below 
we believe that the various rates of adverse market movements represent a measure of exposure to loss under hypothetically assumed adverse conditions 
the estimated market risk exposure represents the hypothetical loss to future earnings and does not represent the maximum possible loss or any expected actual loss  even under adverse conditions  because actual adverse fluctuations would likely differ 
in addition  since our investment portfolio is subject to change based on our portfolio management strategy as well as in response to changes in the market  these estimates are not necessarily indicative of the actual results that may occur 
exposure to market risk is managed and monitored by our senior management 
senior management approves the overall investment strategy that we employ and has responsibility to ensure that the investment positions are consistent with that strategy and the level of risk acceptable to us 
we may manage risk by buying or selling instruments or entering into offsetting positions 
interest rate risk we have exposure to interest rate risk arising from changes in the level or volatility of interest rates 
our investments in marketable securities are primarily in fixed maturity securities 
we monitor our sensitivity to interest rate risk by evaluating the change in the value of our financial assets and liabilities due to fluctuations in interest rates 
the evaluation is performed by applying an instantaneous change in interest rates by varying magnitudes on a static balance sheet to determine the effect such a change in rates would have on the recorded market value of our investments and the resulting effect on stockholders equity 
the analysis presents the sensitivity of the market value of our financial instruments to selected changes in market rates and prices which we believe are reasonably possible over a one year period 
the sensitivity analysis estimates the change in the market value of our interest sensitive assets and liabilities that were held on december  and december   due to instantaneous parallel shifts in the yield curve of basis points  with all other variables held constant 
the interest rates on certain types of assets and liabilities may fluctuate in advance of changes in market interest rates  while interest rates on other types may lag behind changes in market rates 
accordingly  the analysis may not be indicative of  is not intended to provide  and does not provide a precise forecast of the effect of changes in market interest rates on our earnings or stockholders equity 
further  the computations do not contemplate any actions we could undertake in response to changes in interest rates 
loans under our million syndicated  senior unsecured revolving credit facility bear interest at our option at a rate per annum equal to i the higher of the prime rate or the federal funds rate plus or ii the london interbank offered rate  or libor  plus an applicable margin  varying from to  based on our current credit ratings 
as of december  and  there were no loans outstanding under the credit facility however  as of december   million in letters of credit were issued and outstanding under the credit facility 

table of contents our long term debt  as of december  and december   is denominated in us dollars 
our debt has been primarily issued at fixed rates  and as such  interest expense would not be impacted by interest rate shifts 
the impact of a basis point increase in interest rates on fixed rate debt would result in a decrease in market value of million and million as of december  and  respectively 
a basis point decrease would result in an increase in market value of million and million as of december  and  respectively 
foreign exchange risk foreign exchange rate risk arises from the possibility that changes in foreign currency exchange rates will impact the value of financial instruments 
it is customary for us to enter into foreign currency forward exchange contracts in the normal course of business 
these contracts may require us to exchange predetermined amounts of foreign currencies on specified dates or to net settle the spread between the contracted foreign currency exchange rate and the spot rate on the contract settlement date  which for certain of our outstanding contracts is the average spot rate for the contract period 
as of december   we had foreign currency exchange contracts outstanding  in the aggregate notional amount of million  consisting of million in australian dollars  million in brazilian reais  million in british pounds sterling  million in mexican pesos and million in norwegian kroner 
these contracts settle at various times through june at december   we have presented the fair value of our outstanding foreign currency forward exchange contracts as a current liability of million in accrued liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets included in item of this report in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for derivatives and hedging activities 
we have presented the fair value of our outstanding foreign currency forward exchange contracts at december  as a current asset of  in prepaid expenses and other current assets and a current liability of  in accrued liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets included in item of this report
