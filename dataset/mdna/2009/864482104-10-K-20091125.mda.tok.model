item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following is a discussion of our financial condition and results of operations  which should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere in this annual report 
executive overview the following are factors that regularly affect our operating results and financial condition 
in addition  our business is subject to the risks and uncertainties described in item a of this annual report 
product costs and supply the level of profitability in the retail propane  fuel oil  natural gas and electricity businesses is largely dependent on the difference between retail sales price and product cost 
the unit cost of our products  particularly propane  fuel oil and natural gas  is subject to volatility as a result of product supply or other market conditions  including  but not limited to  economic and political factors impacting crude oil and natural gas supply or pricing 
we enter into product supply contracts that are generally one year agreements subject to annual renewal  and we also purchase product on the open market 
we attempt to reduce our exposure to volatile product costs by short term pricing arrangements  rather than long term fixed price supply arrangements 
our propane supply contracts typically provide for pricing based upon index formulas using the posted prices established at major supply points such as mont belvieu  texas  or conway  kansas plus transportation costs at the time of delivery 
to supplement our annual purchase requirements  we may utilize forward fixed price purchase contracts to acquire a portion of the propane that we resell to our customers  which allows us to manage our exposure to unfavorable changes in commodity prices and to assure adequate physical supply 
the percentage of contract purchases  and the amount of supply contracted for under forward contracts at fixed prices  will vary from year to year based on market conditions 
product cost changes can occur rapidly over a short period of time and can impact profitability 
there is no assurance that we will be able to pass on product cost increases fully or immediately  particularly when product costs increase rapidly 
therefore  average retail sales prices can vary significantly from year to year as product costs fluctuate with propane  fuel oil  crude oil and natural gas commodity market conditions 
in addition  in periods of sustained higher commodity prices  as has been experienced over the past several fiscal years  retail sales volumes have been negatively impacted by customer conservation efforts 
seasonality the retail propane and fuel oil distribution businesses  as well as the natural gas marketing business  are seasonal because of the primary use for heating in residential and commercial buildings 
historically  approximately two thirds of our retail propane volume is sold during the six month peak heating season from october through march 
the fuel oil business tends to experience greater seasonality given its more limited use for space heating and approximately three fourths of our fuel oil volumes are sold between october and march 
consequently  sales and operating profits are concentrated in our first and second fiscal quarters 
cash flows from operations  therefore  are greatest during the second and third fiscal quarters when customers pay for product purchased during the winter heating season 
we expect lower operating profits and either net losses or lower net income during the period from april through september our third and fourth fiscal quarters 
to the extent necessary  we will reserve cash from the second and third quarters for distribution to holders of our common units in the first and fourth fiscal quarters 

table of contents weather weather conditions have a significant impact on the demand for our products  in particular propane  fuel oil and natural gas  for both heating and agricultural purposes 
many of our customers rely heavily on propane  fuel oil or natural gas as a heating source 
accordingly  the volume sold is directly affected by the severity of the winter weather in our service areas  which can vary substantially from year to year 
in any given area  sustained warmer than normal temperatures will tend to result in reduced propane  fuel oil and natural gas consumption  while sustained colder than normal temperatures will tend to result in greater consumption 
hedging and risk management activities we engage in hedging and risk management activities to reduce the effect of price volatility on our product costs and to ensure the availability of product during periods of short supply 
we enter into propane forward and option agreements with third parties  and use fuel oil and crude oil futures and option contracts traded on the new york mercantile exchange nymex  to purchase and sell fuel oil and crude oil at fixed prices in the future 
the majority of the futures  forward and option agreements are used to hedge price risk associated with propane and fuel oil physical inventory  as well as  in certain instances  forecasted purchases of propane or fuel oil 
forward contracts are generally settled physically at the expiration of the contract and futures are generally settled in cash at the expiration of the contract 
although we use derivative instruments to reduce the effect of price volatility associated with priced physical inventory and forecasted transactions  we do not use derivative instruments for speculative trading purposes 
risk management activities are monitored by an internal commodity risk management committee  made up of five members of management and reporting to our audit committee  through enforcement of our hedging and risk management policy 
under our hedging and risk management strategy  realized gains or losses on futures or option contracts will typically offset losses or gains on the physical inventory once the product is sold to customers at market prices 
however  as a result of lower than expected volumes primarily attributable to customer conservation  we realized losses under certain futures positions in fiscal that were not fully offset by sales of the physical product 
accordingly  our risk management activities had a negative effect on earnings of approximately million during fiscal as a result of realized losses on futures contracts that were not fully offset by sales of physical product 
see item a of this annual report for a further discussion of risk management activities 
critical accounting policies and estimates our significant accounting policies are summarized in note  summary of significant accounting policies  included within the notes to consolidated financial statements section elsewhere in this annual report 
certain amounts included in or affecting our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures must be estimated  requiring management to make certain assumptions with respect to values or conditions that cannot be known with certainty at the time the financial statements are prepared 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
we are also subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ from estimated results 
estimates are used when accounting for depreciation and amortization of long lived assets  employee benefit plans  self insurance and litigation reserves  environmental reserves  allowances for doubtful accounts  asset valuation assessments and valuation of derivative instruments 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
any effects on our business  financial position or results of operations resulting from revisions to these estimates are recorded in the period in which the facts that give rise to the revision become known to us 
management has reviewed these critical accounting estimates and related disclosures with the audit committee of our board of supervisors 
we believe that the following are our critical accounting estimates 
table of contents allowances for doubtful accounts 
we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
we estimate our allowances for doubtful accounts using a specific reserve for known or anticipated uncollectible accounts  as well as an estimated reserve for potential future uncollectible accounts taking into consideration our historical write offs 
if the financial condition of one or more of our customers were to deteriorate resulting in an impairment in their ability to make payments  additional allowances could be required 
as a result of our large customer base  which is comprised of approximately  customers  no individual customer account is material 
therefore  while some variation to actual results occurs  historically such variability has not been material 
schedule ii  valuation and qualifying accounts  provides a summary of the changes in our allowances for doubtful accounts during the period 
pension and other postretirement benefits 
we estimate the rate of return on plan assets  the discount rate used to estimate the present value of future benefit obligations and the expected cost of future health care benefits in determining our annual pension and other postretirement benefit costs 
while we believe that our assumptions are appropriate  significant differences in our actual experience or significant changes in market conditions may materially affect our pension and other postretirement benefit obligations and our future expense 
see liquidity and capital resources pension plan assets and obligations below for additional disclosure regarding pension benefits 
with other assumptions held constant  an increase of basis points in the discount rate would have an estimated favorable impact of million on net pension and postretirement benefit costs and an increase of basis points in the expected rate of return assumption would have an estimated favorable impact of million on net pension benefit costs 
with other assumptions held constant  a decrease of basis points in the discount rate would have an estimated unfavorable impact of million on net pension and postretirement benefit costs and a decrease of basis points in the expected rate of return assumption would have an estimated unfavorable impact of million on net pension benefit costs 
self insurance reserves 
our accrued self insurance reserves represent the estimated costs of known and anticipated or unasserted claims under our general and product  workers compensation and automobile insurance policies 
accrued insurance provisions for unasserted claims arising from unreported incidents are based on an analysis of historical claims data 
for each unasserted claim  we record a self insurance provision up to the estimated amount of the probable claim utilizing actuarially determined loss development factors applied to actual claims data 
our self insurance provisions are susceptible to change to the extent that actual claims development differs from historical claims development 
we maintain insurance coverage wherein our net exposure for insured claims is limited to the insurance deductible  claims above which are paid by our insurance carriers 
for the portion of our estimated self insurance liability that exceeds our deductibles  we record an asset related to the amount of the liability expected to be paid by the insurance companies 
historically  we have not experienced significant variability in our actuarial estimates for claims incurred but not reported 
accrued insurance provisions for reported claims are reviewed at least quarterly  and our assessment of whether a loss is probable and or reasonably estimable is updated as necessary 
due to the inherently uncertain nature of  in particular  product liability claims  the ultimate loss may differ materially from our estimates 
however  because of the nature of our insurance arrangements  those material variations historically have not  nor are they expected in the future to have  a material impact on our results of operations or financial position 

table of contents results of operations and financial condition net income for fiscal amounted to million  or per common unit  an increase of million  or  compared to net income of million  or per common unit  in fiscal earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization ebitda increased million  or  to million in fiscal compared to million for fiscal net income and ebitda for fiscal included a loss on debt extinguishment of million associated with the debt tender offer completed during the fourth quarter of fiscal net income and ebitda for fiscal included a gain reported within discontinued operations of million from the sale of our tirzah  south carolina underground propane storage cavern and associated mile pipeline 
therefore  excluding the effects of these significant items on our earnings for both periods  ebitda increased million  or  in fiscal compared to the prior year 
in addition to the increased earnings  fiscal included several notable achievements  including i a million reduction in total debt  ii the refinancing of our revolving credit facility to a new four year facility on favorable terms relative to an otherwise challenging credit market  iii an upgrade to our credit ratings by both moody s investors service and standard poor s  iv the successful issuance of  common units  the proceeds of which were used to fund a portion of the debt reduction  and  v an increase of per common unit  or  in the annualized distribution rate compared to the end of fiscal we ended fiscal with million of cash on hand  an increase of million compared to the end of fiscal  despite the use of cash for a portion of the debt reduction 
revenues of  million decreased million  or  compared to  million in the prior year  primarily as a result of a decline in average selling prices associated with lower commodity prices and  to a lesser extent  lower sales volumes 
retail propane gallons sold for fiscal decreased million gallons  or  to million gallons from million gallons in fiscal sales of fuel oil and other refined fuels decreased million gallons  or  to million gallons compared to million gallons in the prior year 
overall average temperatures in our service territories for fiscal were colder than the prior year 
the favorable volume impact from the colder average temperatures was more than offset by declines in commercial and industrial volumes resulting from the recession and  to a lesser extent  continued customer conservation 
in the commodities markets  average posted prices for propane and fuel oil during fiscal were and lower  respectively  compared to fiscal cost of products sold declined million  or  to million in fiscal compared to  million in the prior year 
the sharp decline in commodity prices  particularly during the first half of fiscal  compared to the historically high commodity prices reached during fiscal  resulted in a reduction in product costs that outpaced the decline in average selling prices 
in addition  during fiscal we reported realized losses from risk management activities that were not fully offset by sales of the physical product  resulting in a million reduction to cost of products sold in fiscal compared to the prior year 
cost of products sold for fiscal and fiscal included a million and million unrealized non cash gain  respectively  attributable to the mark to market adjustment for derivative instruments used in risk management activities 
combined operating and general and administrative expenses of million increased million  or  compared to million in the prior year  primarily due to higher variable compensation associated with higher earnings  partially offset by continued savings in payroll and vehicle expenses attributable to further operating efficiencies and lower diesel costs  as well as lower bad debt expense 
net interest expense increased million  or  to million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal as a result of lower interest income earned on invested cash 
with the million debt tender offer which was completed on september   we have reduced our interest expense requirement by approximately million on an annualized basis beginning in fiscal as has been the case since april  during fiscal there were no borrowings under our revolving credit facility to support working capital needs  as such needs continue to be funded from cash on hand 
as we look ahead to fiscal  our anticipated cash requirements include i maintenance and growth capital expenditures of approximately million  ii approximately million of interest and income tax payments  and iii assuming distributions remain at the current level  approximately million of distributions to common unitholders 
based on our current cash position  availability under the revolving credit agreement unused borrowing capacity of million at september  and expected cash flow from operating activities  we expect to have sufficient funds to meet our current and future obligations 
based on our current forecast of working capital requirements for fiscal  we currently do not expect to borrow under our credit facility to fund those requirements 

table of contents fiscal year compared to fiscal year revenues fiscal fiscal percent dollars in thousands decrease decrease revenues propane fuel oil and refined fuels natural gas and electricity all other total revenues total revenues decreased million  or  to  million for the year ended september  compared to  million for the year ended september   due to a combination of lower volumes and lower average selling prices associated with lower product costs 
volumes for the fiscal were lower than the prior year due to the negative impact of adverse economic conditions  particularly on our commercial and industrial accounts  as well as ongoing customer conservation  partially offset by the favorable impact of colder temperatures 
from a weather perspective  average heating degree days  as reported by the national oceanic and atmospheric administration in our service territories were of normal for fiscal and colder compared to the prior year 
revenues from the distribution of propane and related activities of million for the year ended september  decreased million  or  compared to  million for the year ended september   primarily due to lower average selling prices  as well as lower volumes in our commercial and industrial accounts and  to a lesser extent  our residential accounts 
retail propane gallons sold in fiscal decreased million gallons  or  to million gallons from million gallons in the prior year 
the average propane selling prices during fiscal decreased approximately compared to the prior year due to lower product costs  thereby having a negative impact on revenues 
additionally  revenues from wholesale and other propane activities of million for the year ended september  decreased million compared to the prior year 
revenues from the distribution of fuel oil and refined fuels of million for the year ended september  decreased million  or  from million in the prior year  primarily due to lower volumes and lower average selling prices 
fuel oil and refined fuels gallons sold in fiscal decreased million gallons  or  to million gallons from million gallons in the prior year 
lower volumes in our fuel oil and refined fuels segment were primarily attributable to the impact of ongoing customer conservation driven by adverse economic conditions and continued high energy prices relative to historical averages 
the average fuel oil and refined fuels selling prices during fiscal decreased approximately compared to the prior year due to lower product costs  thereby having a negative impact on revenues 

table of contents revenues in our natural gas and electricity segment decreased million  or  to million for the year ended september  compared to million in the prior year as a result of lower average selling prices and lower volumes 
revenues in our all other segment decreased to million in fiscal from million in the prior year  primarily due to reduced installation service activities as a result of the market decline in residential and commercial construction and other adverse economic conditions 
cost of products sold fiscal fiscal percent dollars in thousands decrease decrease cost of products sold propane fuel oil and refined fuels natural gas and electricity all other total cost of products sold as a percent of total revenues the cost of products sold reported in the consolidated statements of operations represents the weighted average unit cost of propane and fuel oil sold  as well as the cost of natural gas and electricity  including transportation costs to deliver product from our supply points to storage or to our customer service centers 
cost of products sold also includes the cost of appliances and related parts sold or installed by our customer service centers computed on a basis that approximates the average cost of the products 
unrealized non cash gains or losses from changes in the fair value of derivative instruments that are not designated as cash flow hedges are recorded within cost of products sold 
cost of products sold excludes depreciation and amortization  these amounts are reported separately within the consolidated statements of operations 
cost of products sold decreased million  or  to million for the year ended september  compared to  million in the prior year due to the impact of the decline in product costs  lower volumes sold and the favorable impact from our risk management activities during fiscal we reported realized losses from risk management activities that were not fully offset by sales of the physical product  resulting in a million reduction to cost of products sold in fiscal compared to the prior year 
cost of products sold in fiscal and fiscal included a million and million unrealized non cash gain  respectively  representing the net change in the fair value of derivative instruments during the period million increase in cost of products sold reported within the propane segment  offset by a million decrease in cost of products sold within the fuel oil and refined fuels segment 
cost of products sold associated with the distribution of propane and related activities of million for the year ended september  decreased million  or  compared to the prior year 
lower average propane costs and lower propane volumes resulted in a decrease of million and million  respectively  in cost of products sold during fiscal compared to the prior year 
cost of products sold from wholesale and other propane activities decreased million compared to the prior year due to lower product costs and lower sales volumes 
cost of products sold associated with the distribution of fuel oil and refined fuels of million for the year ended september  decreased million  or  compared to the prior year 
lower average fuel oil and refined fuels costs and lower volumes resulted in decreases of million and million  respectively  in cost of products sold during fiscal compared to the prior year 
in addition  during fiscal we reported realized losses from risk management activities that were not fully offset by sales of the physical product  resulting in a million reduction to cost of products sold associated with our fuel oil and refined fuels segment in fiscal compared to the prior year 

table of contents cost of products sold in our natural gas and electricity segment of million for the year ended september  decreased million  or  compared to the prior year due to lower product costs and lower sales volumes 
cost of products sold in our all other segment of million for the year ended september  decreased million  or  compared to the prior year primarily due to lower sales volumes 
for the fiscal year ended september   total cost of products sold represented of revenues compared to in the prior year 
the decrease in costs as a percentage of revenues was primarily attributable to the decline in product costs which outpaced the decline in average selling prices  and  to a much lesser extent  the favorable variance attributable to risk management activities discussed above 
operating expenses fiscal fiscal percent dollars in thousands decrease decrease operating expenses as a percent of total revenues all costs of operating our retail distribution and appliance sales and service operations are reported within operating expenses in the consolidated statements of operations 
these operating expenses include the compensation and benefits of field and direct operating support personnel  costs of operating and maintaining our vehicle fleet  overhead and other costs of our purchasing  training and safety departments and other direct and indirect costs of operating our customer service centers 
operating expenses of million for year ended september  decreased million  or  compared to million in the prior year as higher variable compensation expense associated with higher earnings was more than offset by our continued efforts to drive operational efficiencies and reduce costs across all operating segments 
savings were primarily attributable to payroll and benefit related expenses as a result of lower headcount  lower fuel costs to operate our fleet and lower bad debt expense 
general and administrative expenses fiscal fiscal percent dollars in thousands increase increase general and administrative expenses as a percent of total revenues all costs of our back office support functions  including compensation and benefits for executives and other support functions  as well as other costs and expenses to maintain finance and accounting  treasury  legal  human resources  corporate development and the information systems functions are reported within general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statements of operations 
general and administrative expenses of million for the year ended september  increased million  or  compared to million during the prior year 
the increase was primarily attributable to higher variable compensation expense resulting from higher earnings in fiscal compared to the prior year  and higher compensation costs recognized under certain long term incentive plans 

table of contents depreciation and amortization fiscal fiscal percent dollars in thousands increase increase depreciation and amortization as a percent of total revenues depreciation and amortization expense of million for the year ended september  increased million  or  compared to million in the prior year primarily as a result of accelerating depreciation expense for certain assets retired in the second half of fiscal interest expense  net fiscal fiscal percent dollars in thousands increase increase interest expense  net as a percent of total revenues net interest expense increased million  or  to million for the year ended september   compared to million in the prior year as a result of lower market interest rates for short term investments  which contributed to less interest income earned  and a non cash charge of million to write off the unamortized debt issuance costs associated with the previous credit agreement which was terminated in the third quarter of fiscal loss on debt extinguishment on september   we purchased  aggregate principal amount of the senior notes through a cash tender offer 
in connection with the tender offer  we recognized a loss on the extinguishment of debt of  in the fourth quarter of fiscal  consisting of  for the tender premium and related fees  as well as the write off of  in unamortized debt origination costs and unamortized discount 
discontinued operations on october   the operating partnership completed the sale of its tirzah  south carolina underground granite propane storage cavern  and associated mile pipeline  for approximately million in cash  after taking into account certain adjustments 
as part of the agreement  we entered into a long term storage arrangement  not to exceed million propane gallons  with the purchaser of the cavern that will enable us to continue to meet the needs of our retail operations  consistent with past practices 
as a result of this sale  we reported a million gain on disposal of discontinued operations during the first quarter of fiscal net income and ebitda we reported net income of million  or per common unit  for the year ended september  compared to net income of million  or per common unit  in the prior year 
ebitda for fiscal of million increased million  or  compared to ebitda of million in the prior year 
net income and ebitda for fiscal included a million charge for the loss on extinguishment of million of our senior notes 
by comparison  net income and ebitda for fiscal included a gain reported within discontinued operations of million from our sale of its tirzah  south carolina underground storage cavern and associated mile pipeline 

table of contents ebitda represents net income before deducting interest expense  income taxes  depreciation and amortization 
our management uses ebitda as a measure of liquidity and we disclose it because we believe that it provides our investors and industry analysts with additional information to evaluate our ability to meet our debt service obligations and to pay our quarterly distributions to holders of our common units 
in addition  certain of our incentive compensation plans covering executives and other employees utilize ebitda as the performance target 
we use this non gaap financial measure in order to assist industry analysts and investors in assessing our liquidity on a year over year basis 
moreover  our revolving credit agreement requires us to use ebitda as a component in calculating our leverage and interest coverage ratios 
ebitda is not a recognized term under gaap and should not be considered as an alternative to net income or net cash provided by operating activities determined in accordance with gaap 
because ebitda as determined by us excludes some  but not all  items that affect net income  it may not be comparable to ebitda or similarly titled measures used by other companies

fuel oil and refined fuels gallons sold in fiscal decreased million gallons  or  to million gallons from million gallons in the prior year 
lower volumes in our fuel oil and refined fuels segment were attributable to the impact of ongoing customer conservation from continued high energy prices combined with our decision to exit certain lower margin diesel and gasoline businesses 
our decision to exit the majority of our low sulfur diesel and gasoline businesses resulted in a reduction in volumes in the fuel oil and refined fuels segment of approximately million gallons  or of the total volume decline in fiscal compared to the prior year 
the average posted price of fuel oil during fiscal increased approximately compared to the average posted prices in the prior year  while our average selling prices in our fuel oil and refined fuels segment increased approximately compared to the prior year period 
revenues in our natural gas and electricity segment increased million  or  to million for the year ended september  compared to million in the prior year as a result of higher average selling prices for both electricity and natural gas  partially offset by lower electricity and natural gas volumes 
revenues in our all other segment decreased to million in fiscal from million in the prior year as a result of the decision to reduce the level of certain installation service activities

cost of products sold associated with our fuel oil and refined fuels segment of million increased million  or  compared to the prior year 
higher average fuel oil costs resulted in an increase of million in cost of products sold during fiscal compared to the prior year period 
this increase was partially offset by lower fuel oil sales volumes  which resulted in a million decrease in cost of products sold during fiscal compared to the prior year 
in addition  as described above  risk management activities during fiscal resulted in a million increase in cost of products sold compared to the prior year as a result of realized losses on futures contracts that were not fully offset by sales of physical product

interest expense  net fiscal fiscal percent dollars in thousands increase increase interest expense  net as a percent of total revenues net interest expense increased million  or  to million for the year ended september   compared to million in the prior year as a result of lower market interest rates for short term investments  which contributed to less interest income earned 
as has been the case since april  there were no borrowings under our working capital facility as seasonal working capital needs have been funded through cash on hand and cash flow from operations 
we ended fiscal in a strong cash position with million in cash on the consolidated balance sheet 
discontinued operations on october   the operating partnership completed the sale of its tirzah  south carolina underground granite propane storage cavern  and associated mile pipeline  for approximately million in cash  after taking into account certain adjustments 
as part of the agreement  we entered into a long term storage arrangement  not to exceed million propane gallons  with the purchaser of the cavern that will enable us to continue to meet the needs of our retail operations  consistent with past practices

we reported a million gain within discontinued operations during the first quarter of fiscal for the amount by which the fair value of assets relinquished exceeded the carrying value of the assets relinquished 
during fiscal we also sold three customer service centers for net cash proceeds of million and reported a gain on sale within discontinued operations of million 
net income and ebitda we reported net income of million  or per common unit  for the year ended september  compared to net income of million  or per common unit  in the prior year

net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended september  amounted to million  an increase of million compared to million in the prior year 
the increase was attributable to a million increase in earnings  after adjusting for non cash items in both periods deprecation  amortization  compensation costs recognized under our restricted unit plan  gains on disposal of assets and deferred tax provision  coupled with a million reduction in our investment in working capital as a result of the decline in propane and fuel oil commodity prices 
net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended september  amounted to million  a decrease of million compared to million in fiscal the decrease was attributable to a million decrease in earnings  after adjusting for non cash items in both periods deprecation  amortization  compensation costs recognized under our restricted unit plan  gains on disposal of assets  pension settlement charges and deferred tax provision and a million increased investment in working capital  partially offset by a million voluntary contribution to our defined benefit pension plan made in fiscal no pension contributions were made during fiscal or fiscal investing activities 
net cash used in investing activities of million for the year ended september  consisted of capital expenditures of million including million for maintenance expenditures and million to support the growth of operations  partially offset by the net proceeds from the sale of property  plant and equipment of million 
capital spending in fiscal was flat compared to fiscal net cash provided by investing activities of million for the year ended september  consisted of the net proceeds from the sale of discontinued operations of million and the net proceeds from the sale of property  plant and equipment of million  partially offset by capital expenditures of million including million for maintenance expenditures and million to support the growth of operations 
capital spending in fiscal decreased million  or  compared to fiscal primarily as a result of lower spending on tanks and information technology as much of the incremental spending on our field realignment efforts has been incurred 
financing activities 
net cash used in financing activities for the year ended september  of million reflects million in quarterly distributions to common unitholders at a rate of per common unit in respect of the fourth quarter of fiscal  at a rate of per common unit in respect of the first quarter of fiscal  at a rate of per common unit in respect of the second quarter of fiscal and at a rate of per common unit in respect of the third quarter of fiscal in addition  financing activities for fiscal reflects million of repayments on our term loan  which was partially funded by borrowings of million under the revolving credit facility executed on june   the million payment of debt issuance costs associated with the execution of the new revolving credit facility  and the repurchase of million aggregate principal amount of our senior notes for million  which was partially funded by the proceeds of million from the issuance of  of our common units 
net cash used in financing activities for the year ended september  of million reflects million in quarterly distributions to common unitholders at a rate of per common unit in respect of the fourth quarter of fiscal  at a rate of per common unit in respect of the first quarter of fiscal  at a rate of per common unit in respect of the second quarter of fiscal and at a rate of per common unit in respect of the third quarter of fiscal  as well as a prepayment of million to reduce amounts outstanding under our previous term loan 
equity offering on august   we sold  common units in a public offering the equity offering at a price of per common unit  realizing proceeds of million  net of underwriting commissions and other offering expenses 
on august   we announced that the underwriters had given notice of their exercise of their over allotment option  in part  to acquire  common units at the equity offering price of per common unit 
net proceeds from the over allotment exercise amounted to million 
the aggregate net proceeds from the equity offering of million were used  along with cash on hand  to fund the purchase of million aggregate principal amount of our senior notes 
these transactions increased the total number of common units outstanding by  to  
table of contents summary of long term debt obligations and revolving credit lines as of september   our long term borrowings and revolving credit lines consist of million in senior notes due december the senior notes and a million senior secured revolving credit facility at the operating partnership level the revolving credit facility 
the revolving credit facility was executed on june  and replaces the operating partnership s previous credit facility which  as amended  provided for a million term loan the term loan and a separate million working capital facility both of which were scheduled to mature in march borrowings under the revolving credit facility may be used for general corporate purposes  including working capital  capital expenditures and acquisitions until maturity on june  our operating partnership has the right to prepay loans under the revolving credit facility  in whole or in part  without penalty at any time prior to maturity 
at closing  the operating partnership borrowed million under the revolving credit facility and  with cash on hand  repaid the million then outstanding under the term loan and terminated the previous credit agreement 
we have standby letters of credit issued under the revolving credit facility in the aggregate amount of million primarily in support of retention levels under our self insurance programs  which expire periodically through april  therefore  as of september  we had available borrowing capacity of million under the revolving credit facility 
on september   with proceeds of million from our equity offering along with cash on hand  we purchased million of our senior notes through a cash tender offer 
holders who validly tendered their senior notes on or prior to the early tender date of august  received a cash payment of  for each  principal amount of senior notes accepted for payment  and holders who validly tendered their senior notes thereafter  but on or prior to the expiration date of september   received a cash payment of for each  principal amount of senior notes accepted for payment 
the remaining million of senior notes mature on december  and require semi annual interest payments 
we are permitted to redeem some or all of the senior notes any time on or after december  at redemption prices specified in the indenture governing the senior notes 
in addition  the senior notes have a change of control provision that would require us to offer to repurchase the notes at of the principal amount repurchased  if the holders of the notes elected to exercise the right of repurchase 
borrowings under the revolving credit facility bear interest at prevailing interest rates based upon  at our operating partnership s option  libor plus the applicable margin or the base rate  defined as the higher of the federal funds rate plus of  the agent bank s prime rate  or libor plus  plus in each case the applicable margin 
the applicable margin is dependent upon our ratio of total debt to ebitda on a consolidated basis  as defined in the revolving credit facility 
as of september   the interest rate for the revolving credit facility was approximately 
the interest rate and the applicable margin will be reset at the end of each calendar quarter 
in connection with the revolving credit facility  our operating partnership amended its existing interest rate swap agreement  which has a termination date of march   to reduce the notional amount to million from million 
our operating partnership will pay a fixed interest rate of to the issuing lender on the notional principal amount outstanding  effectively fixing the libor portion of the interest rate at 
in return  the issuing lender will pay to our operating partnership a floating rate  namely libor  on the same notional principal amount 
on july   our operating partnership entered into a forward starting interest rate swap agreement with a march  effective date  which is commensurate with the maturity of the existing interest rate swap agreement  and termination date of june  under the forward starting interest rate swap agreement  our operating partnership will pay a fixed interest rate of to the issuing lender on the notional principal amount outstanding  effectively fixing the libor portion of the interest rate at 
in return  the issuing lender will pay to our operating partnership a floating rate  namely libor  on the same notional principal amount 

table of contents the revolving credit facility and the senior notes both contain various restrictive and affirmative covenants applicable to the operating partnership and the partnership  respectively  including i restrictions on the incurrence of additional indebtedness  and ii restrictions on certain liens  investments  guarantees  loans  advances  payments  mergers  consolidations  distributions  sales of assets and other transactions 
the revolving credit facility contains certain financial covenants a requiring the consolidated interest coverage ratio  as defined  at the partnership level to be not less than to as of the end of any fiscal quarter  b prohibiting the total consolidated leverage ratio  as defined  at the partnership level from being greater than to as of the end of any fiscal quarter  and c prohibiting the senior secured consolidated leverage ratio  as defined  of the operating partnership from being greater than to as of the end of any fiscal quarter 
under the senior note indenture  we are generally permitted to make cash distributions equal to available cash  as defined  as of the end of the immediately preceding quarter  if no event of default exists or would exist upon making such distributions  and the partnership s consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio  as defined  is greater than to we were in compliance with all covenants and terms of the senior notes and the revolving credit facility as of september  partnership distributions we are required to make distributions in an amount equal to all of our available cash  as defined in the partnership agreement  as amended  no more than days after the end of each fiscal quarter to holders of record on the applicable record dates 
available cash  as defined in the partnership agreement  generally means all cash on hand at the end of the respective fiscal quarter less the amount of cash reserves established by the board of supervisors in its reasonable discretion for future cash requirements 
these reserves are retained for the proper conduct of our business  the payment of debt principal and interest and for distributions during the next four quarters 
the board of supervisors reviews the level of available cash on a quarterly basis based upon information provided by management 
on october   we announced a quarterly distribution of per common unit  or on an annualized basis  in respect of the fourth quarter of fiscal payable on november  to holders of record on november  this quarterly distribution included an increase of per common unit  or per common unit on an annualized basis  from the previous quarterly distribution rate representing the twenty third increase since our recapitalization in and a increase in the quarterly distribution rate since the fourth quarter of the prior year 
pension plan assets and obligations our defined benefit pension plan was frozen to new participants effective january  and  in furtherance of our effort to minimize future increases in our benefit obligations  effective january   all future service credits were eliminated 
therefore  eligible participants will receive interest credits only toward their ultimate defined benefit under the defined benefit pension plan 
there were no minimum funding requirements for the defined benefit pension plan during fiscal  or as of september  the plan s projected benefit obligation exceeded the fair value of plan assets by million 
conversely  as of september  the fair value of plan assets exceeded the projected benefit obligation by million 
as a result  the funded status of the defined benefit pension plan declined million during fiscal  which was primarily attributable to an increase in the present value of the benefit obligation due to a general decrease in market interest rates  partially offset by a positive return on plan assets during fiscal the funded status of pension and other postretirement benefit plans are recognized as an asset or liability on our balance sheets and the changes in the funded status are recognized in comprehensive income loss in the year the changes occur 

table of contents our investment policies and strategies  as set forth in the investment management policy and guidelines  are monitored by a benefits committee comprised of five members of management 
during fiscal  the benefits committee proposed and the board of supervisors approved contributions to the plan to improve the funded status of the projected benefit obligation and changed the plan s asset allocation to reduce investment risk and more closely match the expected returns on plan assets to the future cash requirements of the plan 
the implementation of this strategy resulted in a million voluntary contribution in fiscal from cash on hand and changed the asset allocation to reflect a greater concentration of fixed income securities 
the shift in investment strategy to a higher concentration of fixed income securities was intended to reduce investment risk and  over the long term  generate returns on plan assets that largely fund the annual interest on the accumulated benefit obligation 
however  as we experienced in fiscal and fiscal  significant declines in interest rates relevant to our benefit obligations  or poor performance in the broader capital markets in which our plan assets are invested  could have an adverse impact on the funded status of the defined benefit pension plan 
for purposes of measuring the projected benefit obligation  we decreased the discount rate to as of september  from as of september   reflecting current market rates for debt obligations of a similar duration to our pension obligations 
the impact of the basis points reduction in the discount rate on the projected benefit obligation significantly exceeded the actual return on plan assets of in fiscal  thus substantially contributing to the reduction in the funded status of the plan 
for purposes of computing net periodic pension cost for fiscal  and  our assumed long term rate of return on plan assets was  and  respectively  based on the investment mix of our pension asset portfolio  historical asset performance and expectations for future performance 
during fiscal  lump sum benefit payments of million exceeded the combined service and interest costs of the net periodic pension cost 
as a result  we recorded a non cash settlement charge of million in order to accelerate recognition of a portion of cumulative unrecognized losses in the defined benefit pension plan 
these unrecognized losses were previously accumulated as a reduction to partners capital and were being amortized to expense as part of our net periodic pension cost 
during fiscal and fiscal  the amount of the pension benefit obligation settled through lump sum payments did not exceed the settlement threshold  therefore  a settlement charge was not required to be recognized for fiscal or fiscal additional pension settlement charges may be required in future periods depending on the level of lump sum benefit payments made in future periods 
we also provide postretirement health care and life insurance benefits for certain retired employees 
partnership employees who were hired prior to july and retired prior to march are eligible for health care benefits if they reached a specified retirement age while working for the partnership 
partnership employees hired prior to july are eligible for postretirement life insurance benefits if they reach a specified retirement age while working for the partnership 
effective january   we terminated our postretirement health care benefit plan for all eligible employees retiring after march  all active and eligible employees who were to receive health care benefits under the postretirement plan subsequent to march  were provided an increase to their accumulated benefits under the defined benefit pension plan 
our postretirement health care and life insurance benefit plans are unfunded 
effective january   we changed our postretirement health care plan from a self insured program to one that is fully insured under which we pay a portion of the insurance premium on behalf of the eligible participants 

table of contents long term debt obligations and operating lease obligations contractual obligations the following table summarizes payments due under our known contractual obligations as of september  fiscal fiscal fiscal fiscal fiscal fiscal and dollars in thousands thereafter long term debt obligations future interest payments operating lease obligations a self insurance obligations b other contractual obligations total a payments exclude costs associated with insurance  taxes and maintenance  which are not material to the operating lease obligations 
b the timing of when payments are due for our self insurance obligations is based on estimates that may differ from when actual payments are made 
in addition  the payments do not reflect amounts to be recovered from our insurance providers  which was million as of september  and included in other assets on the consolidated balance sheet 
additionally  we have standby letters of credit in the aggregate amount of million  in support of retention levels under our casualty insurance programs and certain lease obligations  which expire periodically through april  operating leases we lease certain property  plant and equipment for various periods under noncancelable operating leases  including approximately of our vehicle fleet  approximately of our customer service centers and portions of our information systems equipment 
rental expense under operating leases was million  million and million for fiscal  and  respectively 
future minimum rental commitments under noncancelable operating lease agreements as of september  are presented in the table above 
off balance sheet arrangements guarantees certain of our operating leases  primarily those for transportation equipment with remaining lease periods scheduled to expire periodically through fiscal  contain residual value guarantee provisions 
under those provisions  we guarantee that the fair value of the equipment will equal or exceed the guaranteed amount upon completion of the lease period  or we will pay the lessor the difference between fair value and the guaranteed amount 
although the fair value of equipment at the end of its lease term has historically exceeded the guaranteed amounts  the maximum potential amount of aggregate future payments we could be required to make under these leasing arrangements  assuming the equipment is deemed worthless at the end of the lease term  is approximately million 
the fair value of residual value guarantees for outstanding operating leases was de minimis as of september  and september  recently issued accounting standards in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued new financial reporting guidance to require more detailed disclosures about employers pension plan assets 
these new disclosures will include more information on investment strategies  major categories of plan assets  concentrations of risk within plan assets and valuation techniques used to measure the fair value of plan assets 
the new guidance is effective for fiscal years ending after december   which will be our fiscal year ending september  since it only addresses disclosures  the adoption of the new guidance is not expected to have an impact on our consolidated financial position  results of operations and cash flows 

table of contents in december  the fasb issued revised accounting guidance concerning business combinations 
among other things  this revised guidance requires an entity to recognize acquired assets  liabilities assumed and any noncontrolling interest at their respective fair values as of the acquisition date  clarifies how goodwill involved in a business combination is to be recognized and measured  as well as requires the expensing of acquisition related costs as incurred 
most of its provisions are effective for business combinations entered into in fiscal years beginning on or after december   which will be our fiscal year beginning september   with early adoption prohibited 
certain provisions  in particular a provision related to the accounting for acquired tax benefits  are required to be applied in future fiscal years regardless of when the business combination occurred 
to the extent our corporate entities generate taxable profits in future years that enable the utilization of tax benefits acquired in the agway energy acquisition  the corresponding reduction in the valuation allowance will be recorded as a reduction in the provision for income taxes 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk commodity price risk we enter into product supply contracts that are generally one year agreements subject to annual renewal  and also purchase product on the open market 
our propane supply contracts typically provide for pricing based upon index formulas using the posted prices established at major supply points such as mont belvieu  texas  or conway  kansas plus transportation costs at the time of delivery 
in addition  to supplement our annual purchase requirements  we may utilize forward fixed price purchase contracts to acquire a portion of the propane that we resell to our customers  which allows us to manage our exposure to unfavorable changes in commodity prices and to ensure adequate physical supply 
the percentage of contract purchases  and the amount of supply contracted for under forward contracts at fixed prices  will vary from year to year based on market conditions 
in certain instances  and when market conditions are favorable  we are able to purchase product under our supply arrangements at a discount to the market 
product cost changes can occur rapidly over a short period of time and can impact profitability 
we attempt to reduce commodity price risk by pricing product on a short term basis 
the level of priced  physical product maintained in storage facilities and at our customer service centers for immediate sale to our customers will vary depending on several factors  including  but not limited to  price  availability of supply  and demand for a given time of the year 
typically  our on hand priced position does not exceed more than four to eight weeks of our supply needs  depending on the time of the year 
in the course of normal operations  we routinely enter into contracts such as forward priced physical contracts for the purchase or sale of propane and fuel oil that  under accounting rules for derivative instruments and hedging activities  qualify for and are designated as normal purchase or normal sale contracts 
such contracts are exempted from fair value accounting and are accounted for at the time product is purchased or sold under the related contract 
under our hedging and risk management strategies  we enter into a combination of exchange traded futures and option contracts  forward contracts and  in certain instances  over the counter option contracts collectively  derivative instruments to manage the price risk associated with priced  physical product and with future purchases of the commodities used in our operations  principally propane and fuel oil  as well as to ensure the availability of product during periods of high demand 
we do not use derivative instruments for speculative or trading purposes 
futures and forward contracts require that we sell or acquire propane or fuel oil at a fixed price for delivery at fixed future dates 
an option contract allows  but does not require  its holder to buy or sell propane or fuel oil at a specified price during a specified time period 
however  the writer of an option contract must fulfill the obligation of the option contract  should the holder choose to exercise the option 
at expiration  the contracts are settled by the delivery of the product to the respective party or are settled by the payment of a net amount equal to the difference between the then current price and the fixed contract price or option exercise price 
to the extent that we utilize derivative instruments to manage exposure to commodity price risk and commodity prices move adversely in relation to the contracts  we could suffer losses on those derivative instruments when settled 
conversely  if prices move favorably  we could realize gains 
under our hedging and risk management strategy  realized gains or losses on derivative instruments will typically offset losses or gains on the physical inventory once the product is sold to customers at market prices 

table of contents market risk we are subject to commodity price risk to the extent that propane or fuel oil market prices deviate from fixed contract settlement amounts 
futures traded with brokers of the nymex require daily cash settlements in margin accounts 
forward and option contracts are generally settled at the expiration of the contract term either by physical delivery or through a net settlement mechanism 
market risks associated with futures  options and forward contracts are monitored daily for compliance with our hedging and risk management policy which includes volume limits for open positions 
open inventory positions are reviewed and managed daily as to exposures to changing market prices 
credit risk futures and fuel oil options are guaranteed by the nymex and  as a result  have minimal credit risk 
we are subject to credit risk with over the counter forward and propane option contracts to the extent the counterparties do not perform 
we evaluate the financial condition of each counterparty with which we conduct business and establish credit limits to reduce exposure to the risk of non performance by our counterparties 
interest rate risk a portion of our borrowings bear interest at prevailing interest rates based upon  at the operating partnership s option  libor  plus an applicable margin or the base rate  defined as the higher of the federal funds rate plus of or the agent bank s prime rate  or libor plus  plus the applicable margin 
the applicable margin is dependent on the level of the partnership s total leverage the total of debt to ebitda 
therefore  we are subject to interest rate risk on the variable component of the interest rate 
we manage our interest rate risk by entering into interest rate swap agreements 
the interest rate swaps have been designated as a cash flow hedge 
changes in the fair value of the interest rate swaps are recognized in other comprehensive income oci until the hedged item is recognized in earnings 
at september   the fair value of the interest rate swaps was million representing an unrealized loss and is included within other current liabilities and other liabilities  as applicable  with a corresponding debit in oci 
derivative instruments and hedging activities all of our derivative instruments are reported on the balance sheet at their fair values 
on the date that futures  forward and option contracts are entered into  we make a determination as to whether the derivative instrument qualifies for designation as a hedge 
changes in the fair value of derivative instruments are recorded each period in current period earnings or oci  depending on whether a derivative instrument is designated as a hedge and  if so  the type of hedge 
for derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges  we formally assess  both at the hedge contract s inception and on an ongoing basis  whether the hedge contract is highly effective in offsetting changes in cash flows of hedged items 
changes in the fair value of derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges are reported in oci to the extent effective and reclassified into cost of products sold during the same period in which the hedged item affects earnings 
the mark to market gains or losses on ineffective portions of cash flow hedges are immediately recognized in cost of products sold 
changes in the fair value of derivative instruments that are not designated as cash flow hedges  and that do not meet the normal purchase and normal sale exemption  are recorded within cost of products sold as they occur 
cash flows associated with derivative instruments are reported as operating activities within the consolidated statement of cash flows 

table of contents at september   the fair value of derivative instruments described above resulted in current derivative assets unrealized gains of million included within other current assets  non current derivative assets of million included within other assets  million of derivative liabilities unrealized losses included within other current liabilities and non current derivative liabilities of million included within other liabilities 
cost of products sold included unrealized non cash gains of million and million for the years ended september  and september   respectively  attributable to the change in fair value of derivative instruments not designated as cash flow hedges 
our outstanding commodity related derivatives mature between fiscal and fiscal  and have a weighted average maturity of approximately months as of september  sensitivity analysis in an effort to estimate our exposure to unfavorable market price changes in commodities related to our open positions under derivative instruments  we developed a model that incorporates the following data and assumptions a 
the fair value of open positions as of september  for each of the future periods 
b 
the estimated forward market prices as of september  as derived from the nymex for traded commodities for each of the future periods 
c 
the market prices determined in b 
above were adjusted adversely by a hypothetical change in the forward prices and compared to the fair value amounts in a 
above to project the potential negative impact on earnings that would be recognized for the respective scenario 
based on the sensitivity analysis described above  the hypothetical adverse change in market prices for each of the future months for which a future or option contract exists indicates a reduction in potential future net gains of million as of september  the above hypothetical change does not reflect the worst case scenario 
actual results may be significantly different depending on market conditions and the composition of the open position portfolio
