item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations this discussion should be read in conjunction with the financial statements of the company and notes thereto 
the company s subsidiaries are defined in note of the financial statements 
liquidity and capital resources cash flow provided by operations for the year ended december   was million  compared to million in the prior year 
excluding the effects of significant unforeseen expenses or other income  our cash flow from operations fluctuates primarily because of variations in oil and gas production and prices or changes in working capital accounts 
our oil and gas production will vary based on actual well performance but may be curtailed due to factors beyond our control 
hurricanes in the gulf of mexico may shut down our production for the duration of the storm s presence in the gulf or damage production facilities so that we cannot produce from a particular property for an extended amount of time 
in addition  downstream activities on major pipelines in the gulf of mexico can also cause us to shut in production for various lengths of time 
our realized oil and gas prices vary due to world political events  supply and demand of products  product storage levels  and weather patterns 
we sell the vast majority of our production at spot market prices 
accordingly  product price volatility will affect our cash flow from operations 
to mitigate price volatility we sometimes lock in prices for some portion of our production through the use of financial instruments 
if our exploratory drilling results in significant new discoveries  we will have to expend additional capital in order to finance the completion  development  and potential additional opportunities generated by our success 
we believe that  because of the additional reserves resulting from the successful wells and our record of reserve growth in recent years  we will be able to access sufficient additional capital through additional bank financing 
the company has in place both a stock repurchase program and a limited partnership interest repurchase program 
spending under these programs in was million 
the company expects to expend substantially less in because of the drop in energy prices 
the company currently maintains two credit facilities totaling million  with a combined current borrowing base of million 
the bank reviews the borrowing base semi annually and  at their discretion  may decrease or propose an increase to the borrowing base relative to a redetermined estimate of proved oil and gas reserves 
our oil and gas properties are pledged as collateral for the line of credit and we are subject to certain financial covenants defined in the agreement 
we are currently in compliance with these financial covenants 
if we do not comply with these covenants on a continuing basis  the lenders have the right to refuse to advance additional funds under the facility and or declare all principal and interest immediately due and payable 
during the second quarter of  the company s offshore subsidiary arranged a subordinated credit facility with a private lender controlled by a director of the company 
the facility provides availability of million and is secured by properties released by the bank and pledged under this agreement 
the current advances under this credit facility are million due january it is the goal of the company to increase its oil and gas reserves and production through the acquisition and development of oil and gas properties 
the company also continues to explore and consider opportunities to

index to financial statements further expand its oilfield servicing revenues through additional investment in field service equipment 
however  the majority of the company s capital spending is discretionary  and the ultimate level of expenditures will be dependent on the company s assessment of the oil and gas business environment  the number and quality of oil and gas prospects available  the market for oilfield services  and oil and gas business opportunities in general 
critical accounting estimates proved oil and gas reserves proved oil and gas reserves directly impact financial accounting estimates  including depreciation  depletion and amortization 
proved reserves represent estimated quantities of natural gas  crude oil  condensate  and natural gas liquids that geological and engineering data demonstrate  with reasonable certainty  to be recoverable in future years from known reservoirs under economic and operating conditions existing at the time the estimates were made 
the process of estimating quantities of proved oil and gas reserves is very complex  requiring significant subjective decisions in the evaluation of all available geological  engineering and economic data for each reservoir 
the data for a given reservoir may also change substantially over time as a result of numerous factors including  but not limited to  additional development activity  evolving production history and continual reassessment of the viability of production under varying economic conditions 
consequently  material revisions upward or downward to existing reserve estimates may occur from time to time 
depreciation  depletion and amortization for oil and gas properties the quantities of estimated proved oil and gas reserves are a significant component of our calculation of depletion expense and revisions in such estimates may alter the rate of future expense 
holding all other factors constant  if reserves were revised upward or downward  earnings would increase or decrease respectively 
depreciation  depletion and amortization of the cost of proved oil and gas properties are calculated using the unit of production method 
the reserve base used to calculate depletion  depreciation or amortization is the sum of proved developed reserves and proved undeveloped reserves for leasehold acquisition costs and the cost to acquire proved properties 
the reserve base includes only proved developed reserves for lease and well equipment costs  which include development costs and successful exploration drilling costs 
estimated future dismantlement  restoration and abandonment costs  net of salvage values  are taken into account 
results of operations as compared to the company had net income of  in as compared to  in the significant components of net income are discussed below

index to financial statements oil gas prices received excluding the impact of derivatives were increase decrease oil price gas price changes in production are due to additional production from properties added throughout the increase in oil production is from our west texas properties 
lease operating expenses increased by to  in as compared to  in the difference is attributable to costs associated with properties added during and repairs made to marginal wells currently economic due to higher product price levels 
this increase also reflects the overall price increase in oil field services 
general and administrative expenses increased by to  in as compared to  in a large portion of this increase is the result of increased compensation expense 
in addition there was approximately  of due diligence expenses incurred in related to screening offshore acquisitions 
depreciation and depletion increased by to  in from  in this increase is attributed to the company s offshore properties coupled with the added properties in our west texas area 
interest expense decreased by to  in from  in due to decreased average debt coupled with a large decrease in average interest rates 
the average interest rates paid on outstanding bank borrowings subject to interest during and were and respectively 
as of december  and  the total outstanding borrowings were  and  respectively 
income tax expense of  in represents a effective rate as compared to the effective rate of in the primary reason for the lower effective rate is that percentage depletion deductions  which create a permanent difference  are more significant as a percentage of book income when book income is lower  as it was in current tax expense in of  was partially offset by a benefit of  due to a decline in deferred tax liability 
the current federal tax expense for is above the statutory rate primarily due to depletion deductions being lower for tax than for book income purposes 
this lower depletion is due to a lower basis in oil and gas properties due to prior year intangible costs having been expensed for tax purposes but capitalized for book 
this difference was partially offset by the deduction of current year intangible drilling cost
