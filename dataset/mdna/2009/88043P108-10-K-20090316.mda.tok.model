overview dollars in thousands except share data in this item the results of operations for the year compared to reflected a increase in net income and a increase in diluted earnings per share 
the increase in earnings resulted primarily from a increase in net interest income because of higher average loan balances 
the net interest margin for was 
the increased revenue was partially offset by increases in non interest expense and the provision for loan losses 
the year reflected a continuation of the bank s trend of rapid asset growth  increasing by  or from  at december  to  at december  net loans increased by or  from december  to december   while total deposits increased by or  during that same period 
the corporation s growth in assets was a result of growth in the market area and effective marketing 
the improvement in results including net income and earnings per share was a result of the business focus of the bank 
from to  the bank s market area experienced explosive growth 
in williamson county  demographic information shows a growth in the number of households from to estimates from snl financial lc show that by the number of households in this county will have grown by another 
although estimates of growth are not guaranteed and actual growth may be affected by factors beyond the corporation s control  management believes that the projected growth of the bank s market area will positively impact the bank s future growth 

table of contents the bank has also grown by marketing to business owners that have been left without a long standing banking relationship 
the middle tennessee area has experienced several bank mergers or acquisitions in the last ten years resulting in the termination of many long standing relationships 
these acquisitions also resulted in loan funding decisions being made out of state  creating unpredictability for local lending personnel and uncertainty for local businesses 
the bank has taken advantage of this uncertainty by offering loans at a fair rate and funded locally in a timely manner 
management believes the competitive advantage created by this environment will continue to positively impact results from operations 
the business bank operating strategy has enabled management to focus on managing results 
rather than focusing on building a multi branch infrastructure including hiring and construction of buildings  management focuses on managing net interest margin aggressively and controlling non interest expense 
this has resulted in a decrease in the net interest margin from to non interest expense is controlled by efficiently staffing the bank s operations 
in  that resulted in in assets per employee at year end 
management believes that the business bank operating strategy will continue to be an effective model in the future

the increase in non interest expense was a result of the increase in personnel and general operating expenses attributable to the corporation s growth 
net interest income the primary source of earnings for the bank is net interest income  which is the difference between the interest earned on interest earning assets and the interest paid on interest bearing liabilities 
the major factors which affect net interest income are changes in volumes and yield on earning assets as well as the volumes and the cost of interest bearing liabilities 
management s ability to respond to changes in interest rates by effective asset liability management techniques is critical to maintaining the stability of the net interest margin and the momentum of the bank s primary source of earnings 
during  the federal reserve open market committee fomc decreased short term interest rates by basis points 
during   of the corporation s net loan growth occurred in floating rate construction loans and approximately of the  increase in commercial loans was related to floating rate transactions 
management expects to continue its practice of competing for loans based on providing superior service rather than the lowest price

management s investment strategy is to accept a lower immediate yield in the investment portfolio by targeting shorter term investments 
the bank s investment policy requires a minimum portfolio level equal to of total assets and a maximum portfolio level of of total assets 
management has maintained the portfolio at the lower end of the policy guidelines with the portfolio at  and of total assets at year end in  and  respectively 
the investment portfolio at december  was  compared to  at year end the interest earned on investments rose from  in to  in  as a result of higher average portfolio balances as well as increased yields 
the average yield on the investment portfolio investments rose from in to in  or basis points 
the investment portfolio at december  was  compared to  at year end the average yield on the investment portfolio was in compared to in net interest margin analysis the net interest margin is impacted by the average volumes of interest sensitive assets and interest sensitive liabilities and by the difference between the yield on interest sensitive assets and the cost of interest sensitive liabilities spread 
loan fees collected at origination represent an additional adjustment to the yield on loans 
the bank s spread can be affected by economic conditions  the competitive environment  loan demand and deposit flows 
the net yield on earning assets is an indicator of the effectiveness of a bank s ability to manage the net interest margin by managing the overall yield on assets and the cost of funding those assets 
the two factors that make up the spread are the interest rates received on loans and the interest rates paid on deposits 
the bank has been disciplined in raising interest rates on deposits only as the market demands and thereby managing the cost of funds 
also  the bank has not competed for new loans on interest rate alone but has relied on effective marketing to business customers 
business customers are not influenced by interest rates alone but are influenced by other factors such as timely funding 
the net interest margin declined from in to in because the yield on earning assets decreased faster than the cost of funds  resulting in a compression on the yield on earning assets during interest income increased by  or  from  in to  in the increase was primarily a result of increased loan volume

provision for loan losses management assesses the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses with a combination of qualitative and quantitative factors 
at inception  each loan is assigned a risk rating that ranges from rr to rr an rr assignment indicates a superior credit  rr represents an excellent credit  rr represents an above average credit  and rr designates an average credit 
the assignment of a risk rating is based on an evaluation of the credit risk in the transaction 
the evaluation includes consideration of the borrower s financial capacity  collateral  cash flows  liquidity  and alternative sources of repayment 
if a loan deteriorates and the level of risk increases  management downgrades the loan to rr watch  rr criticized  or rr substandard  depending on the circumstances 
a review by an independent accounting firm of the assigned risk ratings is an integral part of the bank s external loan review program 
management reviews the loan portfolio regularly to determine if loans should be placed on non accrual for revenue recognition 
if a loan is placed on non accrual  all interest earned since the last current payment is immediately reversed 
loans may remain on non accrual status until the underlying collateral is repossessed and valued or until the amount of loss in the credit can be reasonably determined 
once collateral is repossessed and appraised  the collateral is recorded as a repossession at the lower of fair value or the investment in the related loan 
any difference between the estimated fair value of the collateral and the loan balance is charged off 
variances in fair value estimates are recorded as a gain or loss on sale when the collateral is sold 
non accrual loans totaled   and  at year end  and  respectively 
these amounts represented  and  respectively  of net loans at the end of each year 
management uses the weighted average risk rating to monitor the overall credit quality and trends in the loan portfolio 
at december   the weighted average risk rating of the  net loan portfolio was 
at december   the weighted average risk rating of the  net loan portfolio was 
the board of directors reviews the weighted average risk rating of loans booked during the previous month 
in addition  the board reviews monthly all credits classified rr or higher 
management closely monitors other key loan quality indicators including delinquencies  changes in the portfolio mix and general economic conditions 
these actions provide a degree of objectivity in assessing the risk in the portfolio and establishing an adequate loan loss reserve 
to the extent that actual and anticipated losses differ  adjustments are made to the loan loss provision or to the level of the allowance for loan losses 
at december   the loan loss reserve of  was of gross loans of  the provision for loan losses in was  an increase of  or  above the provision of  expensed in of this provision   or  was attributable to loan growth recorded during the remainder of the loan loss provision in funded net charge offs of  
table of contents the provision for loan losses in was  an increase of  or  above the provision of  expensed in of this provision   or  was attributable to loan growth recorded during the remainder of the loan loss provision in funded net charge offs of  the bank targets small and medium sized businesses as loan customers 
because of their size  these borrowers may be less able to withstand competitive or economic pressures than larger borrowers in periods of economic weakness 
if loan losses occur to a level where the loan loss reserve is not sufficient to cover actual loan losses  the bank s earnings will decrease 
the bank uses an independent accounting firm to review its loans quarterly for quality in addition to the reviews that may be conducted by bank regulatory agencies as part of their usual examination process 
the following table presents information regarding non accrual  past due and restructured loans at december     and december  dollars in thousands non accrual loans number amount accruing loans which are contractually past due days or more as to principal and interest payments number amount loans defined as troubled debt restructurings number amount gross interest income lost on the non accrual loans interest income included in net income on the accruing loans accruing loans that are contractually past due days or more as to principal and interest payments are inflated by  because of three loans days past due 
management has resolved this issue in the first quarter of the ratio of allowance for loan losses to non performing assets  less these three loans  would have been versus the ratio of reported in item of this annual report on form k 
as of december   there were no loans classified for regulatory purposes as doubtful or substandard that have not been disclosed in the above table  which i represent or result from trends or uncertainties that management reasonably expects will materially impact future operating results  liquidity  or capital resources  or ii represent material credits about which management is aware of any information which causes management to have serious doubts as to the ability of such borrowers to comply with the loan repayment terms 
the bank had no tax exempt loans during the years ended december  and december  the bank had no loans outstanding to foreign borrowers at december  and december

management believes that the allowance was adequate at december

in a typical retail bank  non interest income consists primarily of service charges and fees on deposit accounts and mortgage origination fees 
because of the business focus of the bank and its lack of a large retail customer base  revenues from these traditional sources will remain modest 
the bank earned in mortgage origination fees in compared to earned in  a decline of or 
the decline in mortgage loan demand and mortgage origination income was attributed to the disruption in the mortgage market in management believes that in the mortgage unit will provide a value added service with modest revenue results 
the bank earned  in on a series of loan sale transactions compared to  in in addition to lending in the local marketplace  the bank provides collateral based loans to business borrowers in other states through two types of indirect funding programs 
management has identified a network of community banks eager to purchase quality assets 
management has installed appropriate systems and processes to sell assets to other banks located in slower growing markets and believes that loan sales will be a recurring source of revenue 
in  the bank earned  on a series of loan sale transactions 
the bank earned in mortgage origination fees in compared to earned in  a decline of or

management views the control of operating expense as a critical element in the success of the business bank strategy 
the bank operates more efficiently than most peer banks because it conducts business from a single location and does not provide banking services for many retail customers with high transaction volume 
management targets  in assets per full time employee as a measure of staffing efficiency 
management believes that the growth of the bank will offer additional opportunities to leverage personnel resources 
the bank does not expect to hire employees in  so salaries and benefits expense may increase slightly  but the target for assets per employee will remain at  non interest expense for was  an increase of  or  over the  expensed in approximately of the increase was attributable to the increase in professional fees audit  legal  and accounting  and approximately of the increase was attributable to the addition of new employees during the year

year end net loans were  up  or over the year end total net loans of  the bank s business bank model of operation results in a higher level of earning assets than most peer banks 
earning assets are defined as assets that earn interest income 
earning assets include short term investments  the investment portfolio and net loans 
the bank maintains a relatively high level of earning assets because few assets are allocated to facilities  cash and due from bank accounts used for transaction processing 
earning assets at december  were  or of total assets of  earning assets at december  were  or of total assets of  management targets an earning asset to total asset ratio of or higher 
this ratio is expected to generally continue at these levels  although it may be affected by economic factors beyond the bank s control 
liabilities the bank relies on increasing its deposit base to fund loan and other asset growth 
the williamson county marketplace is highly competitive with financial institutions and banking facilities as of june  
the bank competes for local deposits by offering attractive products with premium rates 
the bank expects to have a higher average cost of funds for local deposits than most competitor banks because of its single location and lack of a branch network 
management s strategy is to offset the higher cost of funding with a lower level of operating expense and firm pricing discipline for loan products 
the bank has promoted electronic banking services by providing them without charge and by offering in bank customer training 
the bank also obtains funding in the wholesale deposit market which is accessed by means of an electronic bulletin board 
this electronic market links banks and sellers of deposits to deposit purchasers such as credit unions  school districts  labor unions  and other organizations with excess liquidity 
deposits may be raised in or increments in maturities from two weeks to five years 
management believes the utilization of the electronic bulletin board is highly efficient and the average rate has been generally less than rates paid in the local market 
participants in the electronic market pay a modest annual licensing fee and there are no transaction charges 
management has established policies and procedures to govern the acquisition of funding through the wholesale market 
wholesale deposits are categorized as purchased time deposits on the detail of deposits shown in this item management may also  from time to time  engage the services of a deposit broker to raise a block of funding at a specified maturity date

loan policy lending activity is conducted under guidelines defined in the bank s loan policy 
the loan policy establishes guidelines for analyzing financial transactions including an evaluation of a borrower s credit history  repayment capacity  collateral value  and cash flow 
loans may be at a fixed or variable rate  with the maximum maturity of fixed rate loans set at five years 
all lending activities of the bank are under the direct supervision and control of the officers loan committee  the executive committee of the board and  in some cases  the full board of directors

the bank s established maximum loan volume to deposits is 
the executive committee of the board makes a monthly review of loans that are days or more past due and the full board of directors makes a quarterly review of loans that are days or more past due 
management of the bank periodically reviews the loan portfolio  particularly non accrual and renegotiated loans 
the review may result in a determination that a loan should be placed on a non accrual status for income recognition 
in addition  to the extent that management identifies potential losses in the loan portfolio  it reduces the book value of such loans  through charge offs  to their estimated collectible value 
the bank s policy is that accrual of interest is discontinued on a loan when management of the bank determines that collection of interest is doubtful based on consideration of economic and business factors affecting collection efforts 
when a loan is classified as non accrual  any unpaid interest is reversed against current income 
interest is included in income thereafter only to the extent received in cash 
the loan remains in a non accrual classification until such time as the loan is brought current  when it may be returned to accrual classification 
when principal or interest on a non accrual loan is brought current  if in management s opinion future payments are questionable  the loan would remain classified as non accrual 
after a non accrual or renegotiated loan is charged off  any subsequent payments of either interest or principal are applied first to any remaining balance outstanding  then to recoveries and lastly to income 
the bank s underwriting guidelines are applied to four major categories of loans  commercial and industrial  consumer  agricultural and real estate which includes residential  construction and development and certain other real estate loans 
the bank requires its loan officers and loan committee to consider the borrower s character  the borrower s financial condition  the economic environment in which the loan will be repaid  as well as  for commercial loans  the borrower s management capability and the borrower s industry 
before approving a loan  the loan officer or committee must determine that the borrower is creditworthy  is a capable manager  understands the specific purpose of the loan  understands the source and plan of repayment  and determine that the purpose  plan and source of repayment as well as collateral are acceptable  reasonable and practical given the normal framework within which the borrower operates 
the maintenance of an adequate loan loss reserve is one of the fundamental concepts of risk management for every financial institution 
management is responsible for ensuring that controls are in place to monitor the adequacy of the loan loss reserve in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles gaap  the bank s stated policies and procedures  and regulatory guidance 
quantification of the level of reserve which is prudently conservative  but not excessive  involves a high degree of judgment 
management s assessment of the adequacy of the loan loss reserve considers a wide range of factors including portfolio growth  mix  collateral and geographic diversity  and terms and structure 
portfolio performance trends  including past dues and charge offs  are monitored closely 
management s assessment includes a continuing evaluation of current and expected market conditions and the potential impact of economic events on borrowers 
management s assessment program is monitored by an ongoing loan review program conducted by an independent accounting firm and periodic examinations by bank regulators 
management uses a variety of financial methods to quantify the level of the loan loss reserve 
at inception  each loan transaction is assigned a risk rating that ranges from rr excellent to rr average 
the risk rating is determined by an analysis of the borrower s credit history and capacity  collateral  and cash flow 
the weighted average risk rating of the portfolio provides an indication of overall risk and identifies trends 
the portfolio is additionally segmented by loan type  collateral  and purpose 
loan transactions that have exhibited signs of increased risk are downgraded to a watch  critical  or substandard classification  ie  rr  rr and rr  respectively 
these loans are closely monitored for rehabilitation or potential loss and the loan loss reserve is adjusted accordingly 

table of contents it is management s intent to maintain a loan loss reserve that is adequate to absorb current and estimated losses which are inherent in a loan portfolio 
the historical loss ratio net charge offs as a percentage of average loans was  and for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the year end loan loss reserve as a percentage of the end of period loans was  and  respectively  for the same years 
because of the commercial emphasis of the bank s operation  management has kept a reserve level in excess of historical results 
the provision for loan losses for was  an increase of  over the  provision for in  expenses reflected the impact of  in charge offs during the year and the incremental provision required as a result of the  increase in loan volume 
credit risk management and reserve for loan losses credit risk and exposure to loss are inherent parts of the banking business 
management seeks to manage and minimize these risks through its loan and investment policies and loan review procedures 
management establishes and continually reviews lending and investment criteria and approval procedures that it believes reflect the risk sensitive nature of the bank 
the loan review procedures are set to monitor adherence to the established criteria and to ensure that on a continuing basis such standards are enforced and maintained 
management s objective in establishing lending and investment standards is to manage the risk of loss and provide for income generation through pricing policies 
the bank targets small and medium sized businesses as loan customers 
because of their size  these borrowers may be less able to withstand competitive or economic pressures than larger borrowers in periods of economic weakness 
if loan losses occur to a level where the loan loss reserve is not sufficient to cover actual loan losses  the bank s earnings will decrease 
the bank uses an independent accounting firm to review its loans for quality in addition to the reviews that may be conducted by bank regulatory agencies as part of their usual examination process 
management regularly reviews the loan portfolio and determines the amount of loans to be charged off 
in addition  management considers such factors as the bank s previous loan loss experience  prevailing and anticipated economic conditions  industry concentrations and the overall quality of the loan portfolio 
while management uses available information to recognize losses on loans and real estate owned  future additions to the allowance may be necessary based on changes in economic conditions 
in addition  various regulatory agencies  as an integral part of their examination process  periodically review the allowances for losses on loans and real estate owned 
such agencies may require the bank to recognize additions to the allowances based on their judgments about information available at the time of their examinations 
in addition  any loan or portion thereof which is classified as a loss by regulatory examiners is charged off

an asset or liability is said to be interest rate sensitive within a specific time period if it will mature or reprice within that time period 
the interest rate sensitivity gap is defined as the difference between the dollar amount of rate sensitive assets re pricing during a period and the volume of rate sensitive liabilities re pricing during the same period 
a gap is considered positive when the amount of interest rate sensitive assets exceeds the amount of interest rate sensitive liabilities 
a gap is considered negative when the amount of interest rate sensitive liabilities exceeds the amount of interest rate sensitive assets 
during a period of rising interest rates  a negative gap would tend to adversely affect net interest income while a positive gap would tend to result in an increase in net interest income 
during a period of falling interest rates  a negative gap would tend to result in an increase in net interest income while a positive gap would tend to adversely affect net interest income

table of contents investment policy the objective of the bank s investment policy is to invest funds not otherwise needed to meet the loan demand of its market area to earn the maximum return for the bank  yet still maintain sufficient liquidity to meet fluctuations in the bank s loan demand and deposit structure 
in doing so  the bank balances the market and credit risks against the potential investment return  makes investments compatible with the pledge requirements of the bank s deposits of public funds  maintains compliance with regulatory investment requirements and assists the various public entities with their financing needs 
the asset liability and investment committee has full authority over the investment portfolio and makes decisions on purchases and sales of securities 
the entire portfolio  along with all investment transactions occurring since the previous board of director s meeting  is reviewed by the board at each monthly meeting 
the investment policy allows portfolio holdings to include short term securities purchased to provide the bank s needed liquidity and longer term securities purchased to generate level income for the bank over periods of interest rate fluctuations 
loan portfolio the bank had net loans of  at december  as the loan portfolio is concentrated in davidson county and williamson county  there is a risk that the borrowers ability to repay the loans could be affected by changes in local economic conditions

capital resources liquidity liquidity of primary importance to depositors  creditors and regulators is the ability to have readily available funds sufficient to repay fully maturing liabilities 
the bank s liquidity  represented by cash and cash due from banks  is a result of its operating  investing and financing activities 
in order to ensure funds are available at all times  the bank devotes resources to projecting on a monthly basis the amount of funds that will be required and maintains relationships with a diversified customer base so funds are accessible 
liquidity requirements can also be met through short term borrowings or the disposition of short term assets which are generally matched to correspond to the maturity of liabilities 
although the bank has no formal liquidity policy  in the opinion of management  its liquidity levels are considered adequate 
the bank is subject to general fdic guidelines which do not require a minimum level of liquidity 
management believes its liquidity ratios meet or exceed these guidelines 
management does not know of any trends or demands that are reasonably likely to result in liquidity increasing or decreasing in any material manner 

table of contents impact of inflation and changing prices the financial statements and related financial data presented herein have been prepared in accordance with gaap which require the measurement of financial position and operating results in terms of historical dollars without considering the changes in the relative purchasing power of money over time and a result of inflation 
the impact of inflation on operations of the bank is reflected in increased operating costs 
unlike most industrial companies  virtually all of the assets and liabilities of the bank are monetary in nature 
as a result  interest rates have a more significant impact on the bank s performance than the effects of general levels of inflation 
interest rates do not necessarily move in the same direction or in the same magnitude as the price of goods and services 
capital adequacy capital adequacy refers to the level of capital required to sustain asset growth over time and to absorb losses 
to continue to grow  the bank must increase capital by generating earnings  issuing equity securities  borrowing funds or a combination of those activities 
if growth exceeds expectations  the bank may need to raise capital in the capital markets 
the bank s ability to raise capital will depend in part on conditions in the capital markets which are outside the bank s control 
if the bank cannot raise capital on terms acceptable to it  the bank s ability to continue growing would be materially impaired 
the objective of the bank s management is to maintain a level of capitalization that is sufficient to take advantage of profitable growth opportunities while meeting regulatory requirements including remaining well capitalized 
this is achieved by improving profitability through effectively allocating resources to more profitable businesses  improving asset quality  strengthening service quality and streamlining costs 
the primary measures used by management to monitor the results of these efforts are the ratios of average equity to average assets  average tangible equity to average tangible assets and average equity to net loans 
the federal reserve board has adopted capital guidelines governing the activities of bank holding companies 
these guidelines require the maintenance of an amount of capital based on risk adjusted assets so that categories of assets with potentially higher credit risk will require more capital backing than assets with lower risk 
in addition  banks and bank holding companies are required to maintain capital to support  on a risk adjusted basis  certain off balance sheet activities such as loan commitments 
the corporation and the bank are required to maintain certain capital ratios 
these include tier i  total capital and leverage ratios 
certain ratios for the corporation and the bank for and are set forth below capital level meeting regulatory definition of corporation bank well capitalized tier i capital ratio total risk based ratio leverage ratio based solely on analysis of federal banking regulatory categories  it appears on december  that the corporation and the bank fall within the well capitalized categories under the regulations 
off balance sheet arrangements the bank is a party to financial instruments with off balance sheet risk in the normal course of business to meet the financing needs of its customers 
these financial instruments include commitments to extend credit and standby letters of credit 
those instruments involve  to varying degrees  elements of credit risk in excess of the amount recognized in the balance sheet 
the contract or notional amounts of those instruments reflect the extent of involvement the bank has in those particular financial instruments 

table of contents the bank s exposure to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by the other party to the financial instrument is represented by the contractual or notional amount of those instruments 
the bank uses the same credit policies in making commitments and conditional obligations as it does for on balance sheet instruments 
financial instruments for which contract amounts represented credit risk as of december dollars in thousands fixed rate variable rate fixed rate variable rate fixed rate variable rate commitments to extend credit standby letters of credit and financial guarantees commitments to make loans are generally made for periods of one year or less 
the fixed rate loan commitments have interest rates ranging from to and maturities ranging from two months to five years 
commitments to extend credit are agreements to lend to a customer as long as there is no violation of any condition established in the contract 
commitments generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses and may require payment of a fee 
since many of the commitments are expected to expire without being drawn upon  the total commitment amounts do not necessarily represent future cash requirements 
the bank evaluates each customer s creditworthiness on a case by case basis 
the amount of collateral obtained if deemed necessary by the bank upon extension of credit is based on management s credit evaluation 
collateral held varies but may include accounts receivable  inventory  property  plant and equipment  and income producing commercial properties 
standby letters of credit are conditional commitments issued by the bank to guarantee the performance of a customer to a third party 
those guarantees are primarily issued to support public and private borrowing arrangements  including commercial paper  bond financing and similar transactions 
all letters of credit are due within one year or less of the original commitment date 
the credit risk involved in issuing letters of credit is essentially the same as that involved in extending loan facilities to customers 
contractual obligations at december   the bank had certain contractual obligations as shown below 
payments due by period contractual obligations total less than year years years more than years dollars in thousands deposits without a stated maturity certificates of deposit subordinated long term debt capital lease obligations operating lease obligations purchase obligations other long term liabilities total excludes interest

sfas r clarifies the definitions of both a business combination and a business 
all business combinations will be accounted for under the acquisition method previously referred to as the purchase method 
this standard defines the acquisition date as the only relevant date for recognition and measurement of the fair value of consideration paid 
sfas r requires the acquirer to expense all acquisition related costs 
sfas r will also require acquired loans to be recorded net of the allowance for loan losses on the date of acquisition 
sfas r defines the measurement period as the time after the acquisition date during which the acquirer may make adjustments to the provisional amounts recognized at the acquisition date 
this period cannot exceed one year  and any subsequent adjustments made to provisional amounts are done retrospectively and restate prior period data 
the provisions of this statement are effective for business combinations during fiscal years beginning after december  the corporation has not determined the impact that sfas r will have on its financial position and results of operations and believes that such determination will not be meaningful until the corporation enters into a business combination 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk quantitative and qualitative analysis of market risk like all financial institutions  the corporation is subject to market risk from changes in interest rates 
interest rate risk is inherent in the balance sheet because of the mismatch between the maturities of rate sensitive assets and rate sensitive liabilities 
if rates are rising  and the level of rate sensitive liabilities exceed the level of rate sensitive assets  the net interest margin will be negatively impacted 
conversely  if rates are falling  and the level of rate sensitive liabilities is greater than the level of rate sensitive assets  the impact on the net interest margin will be favorable 
managing interest rate risk is further complicated by the fact that all rates do not change at the same pace  in other words  short term rates may be rising while longer term rates remain stable 
in addition  different types of rate sensitive assets and rate sensitive liabilities react differently to changes in rates 
to manage interest rate risk  the corporation must take a position on the expected future trend of interest rates 
rates may rise  fall or remain the same 
the asset liability committee of the bank develops its view of future rate trends by monitoring economic indicators  examining the views of economists and other experts  and understanding the current status of the corporation s balance sheet 
the corporation s annual budget reflects the anticipated rate environment for the next months 
the asset liability committee conducts a quarterly analysis of the rate sensitivity position 
the results of the analysis are reported to the board 
the asset liability committee uses a computer model to analyze the maturities of rate sensitive assets and liabilities 
the model measures the gap  which is the difference between the dollar amount of rate sensitive assets re pricing during a period and the volume of rate sensitive liabilities re pricing during the same period 
gap is also expressed as the ratio of rate sensitive assets divided by rate sensitive liabilities 
if the ratio is greater than one  the dollar value of assets exceeds the dollar value of liabilities and the balance sheet is asset sensitive 
conversely  if the value of liabilities exceeds the value of assets  the ratio is less than one and the balance sheet is liability sensitive 
policy requires management to maintain the gap within a range of to 
the model measures scheduled maturities in periods of three months  four to months  one to five years and over five years 
the chart below illustrates the corporation s rate sensitive position at december  management uses the one year gap as the appropriate time period for setting strategy 

table of contents rate sensitivity gap analysis maturities dollars in thousands floating months months years over years total interest earnings assets federal funds sold interest bearing deposits in banks securities us government agencies mortgage backed and corporate debt securities total securities total loans total interest earning assets other assets total assets interest bearing liabilities deposits interest checking money market and savings time deposits total deposits federal funds purchased short term borrowings subordinated long term debt total interest bearing liabilities other liabilities shareholders equity total liabilities and shareholders equity rate sensitive gap by period cumulative gap cumulative gap as a percent of total rate sensitive assets rate sensitive liabilities cumulative 
table of contents in  the fomc decreased short term interest rates by basis points 
the corporation is now positioned for a falling rate environment by maintaining a moderately liability sensitive balance sheet in which more liabilities will reprice than assets 
at year end  the corporation s one year ratio was 
the interest rate risk model that defines the gap position also performs a rate shock test of the balance sheet 
the rate shock procedure measures the impact on the economic value of equity eve which is a measure of long term interest rate risk 
eve is the difference between the market value of the assets and the liabilities and is the liquidation value of the bank 
in this analysis  the model calculates the discounted cash flow or market value of each category on the balance sheet 
the percent change in eve is a measure of the volatility of risk 
regulatory guidelines specify a maximum change of for a bps rate change 
at december   the percent change in eve for a plus or minus bps was well within that range at and  respectively 
the one year gap of indicates that the bank would show an increase in net interest income in a falling rate environment  and the eve rate shock shows that the eve would rise in a falling rate environment 
the eve simulation model is a static model that provides information only at a certain point in time 
for example  in a rising rate environment  the model does not take into account actions that management might take to change the impact of rising rates on the bank 
given that limitation  it is still useful is assessing the impact of an unanticipated movement in interest rates 
the above analysis may not on its own be an entirely accurate indicator of how net interest income or eve will be affected by changes in interest rates 
income associated with interest earning assets and costs associated with interest bearing liabilities may not be affected uniformly by changes in interest rates 
in addition  the magnitude and duration of changes in interest rates may have a significant impact on net interest income 
interest rates on certain types of assets and liabilities fluctuate in advance of changes in general market rates  while interest rates on other types may lag behind changes in general market rates 
the asset liability committee develops its view of future rate trends by monitoring economic indicators  examining the views of economists and other experts  and understanding the current status of the corporation s balance sheet  and conducts a quarterly analysis of the rate sensitivity position 
the results of the analysis are reported to the board
