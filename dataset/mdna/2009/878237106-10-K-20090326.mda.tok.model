risk factors in this annual report on form k for the year ended january  for further information 
we undertake no obligation to revise or update publicly any forward looking statements for any reason 
factors that could cause actual results to differ materially include the following global economic downturn competition narrow margins dependence on information systems acquisitions and dispositions exposure to natural disasters  war and terrorism dependence on independent shipping companies impact of policy changes labor strikes risk of declines in inventory value product availability vendor terms and conditions loss of significant customers customer credit exposure need for liquidity and capital resources  fluctuations in interest rates foreign currency exchange rates  exposure to foreign markets changes in income tax and other regulatory legislation changes in accounting rules volatility of common stock price overview tech data is a leading distributor of information technology it products  logistics management and other value added services 
we distribute microcomputer hardware and software products to value added resellers  direct marketers  retailers and corporate resellers 
our offering of value added customer services includes training and technical support  external financing options  configuration services  outbound telemarketing  marketing services and a suite of electronic commerce solutions 
we manage our business in two geographic segments the americas including north america and latin america and europe 
a key tenet of our strategy is our ability to leverage our efficient cost structure combined with our multiple service offerings to generate demand and cost efficiencies for our vendors and customers 
the it distribution industry in which we operate is characterized by narrow gross profit as a percentage of sales gross margin and narrow income from operations as a percentage of sales operating margin 
historically  our gross and operating margins have been impacted by intense price competition  as well as changes in terms and conditions with our vendors  including those terms related to rebates  price protection  product returns and other incentives 
we expect these conditions to continue in the foreseeable future and  therefore  we will continue to proactively evaluate our pricing policies and inventory management practices in response to potential changes in our vendor terms and conditions and the general market environment 

table of contents in addition to focusing on superior execution  we continue to drive diversification and the realignment of our customer and vendor portfolio to help drive long term profitability throughout all of our operations 
for example  our joint venture with brightstar corporation  one of the world s largest wireless distributor and supply chain solutions providers  distributes mobile phones and other wireless devices to a variety of customers including mobile operators  dealers  agents  retailers and e tailers in certain european markets 
the joint venture also allows us to sell our core it products to a new customer base serving the mobility market 
in addition  we continue to strengthen our position with the small and medium business customer segment in several countries we operate  both organically and through acquisition 
as we continue to diversify  we continuously monitor the extension of credit and other terms and conditions offered to our customers to prudently balance risk  profitability and return on invested capital 
from a balance sheet perspective  we require working capital primarily to finance accounts receivable and inventory 
we have historically relied upon debt  trade credit from our vendors  and accounts receivable financing programs for our working capital needs 
at january   we had a debt to capital ratio calculated as total debt divided by the aggregate of total debt and total shareholders equity of 
the current economic environment has presented a number of challenges 
the rapid decline in it demand in several markets has required payroll and other cost reductions to mitigate the impact of the decline in sales and gross profit 
in addition  the downturn has resulted in vendor rebate goals being more difficult to achieve in those markets where it demand has declined 
this has put even greater pressure on our gross margin  as we may not be able to completely offset the reduced vendor rebates by increasing our prices to our customers or reducing our costs 
finally  the downturn has resulted in a global tightening of credit 
this has recently extended to those institutions insuring us against credit risks in several markets  primarily in europe 
this recent trend could impact the credit lines we offer to our customers 
on the other hand  this trend could have a positive effect on our results to the extent that our vendors rely more on distributors with the financial strength of tech data to distribute their products 
in addition  these constraints could impact the financing available to our customers through financial institutions and as a result  we may experience a higher level of customer defaults than we have seen in recent years 
all of these trends are expected to continue throughout fiscal as we manage through these challenges and evaluate our pricing  credit management and purchasing policies and make adjustments  if any  within our customer or vendor portfolio or our cost structure  we may experience sales declines in many of the markets we operate  negatively impacting our financial results 
the extent of the negative impact on our operating results will depend upon the length and severity of the global economic downturn 
in spite of the recent global challenges  throughout fiscal  we made measurable progress towards improving the profitability of our european operations 
however  our business was challenged during both our third and fourth quarters as a result of the weakness in the global economy and the rapid devaluation of most foreign currencies against the us dollar  particularly in the month of october 
during the third quarter of fiscal  we incurred a foreign currency exchange loss of approximately million  with approximately of this loss occurring in the european region 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  the company continued to experience foreign currency volatility and recorded a million foreign currency exchange loss  with approximately of this loss occurring in the european region 
the primary factor contributing to the foreign currency exchange loss in both the third and fourth quarters was the use of certain portions of inventory as an economic hedge against foreign currency exposure in accounts payable 
in such situations  we normally expect our product selling prices to customers to fluctuate with changes in the foreign currency exchange rates when such product is purchased in a currency other than the currency in which the inventory is sold 
we were able to recover a significant portion of this foreign currency exchange loss through increased gross margin in both the third and fourth quarters of fiscal this is a strong example of our disciplined pricing and inventory management practices in action 
however  to the extent that foreign currencies remain volatile and the market conditions remain competitive  we may incur significant foreign currency exchange losses in the future and there can be no assurance as to the amount of additional gross margin we will be able to realize to offset such losses 
considering the various challenges faced during fiscal  including an uncertain macroeconomic environment  volatile currencies  deteriorating financial markets and an overall decline in demand for technology products and services globally  we were pleased with the company s fiscal financial performance 
we achieved year over year sales growth in europe on a euro basis when several of our competitors experienced a decline in sales in the region 
we believe our improved performance allowed us to improve our market share position during fiscal we continue to make investments in the region to leverage our pan european infrastructure and to diversify our product portfolio 
in the americas  we continued to experience heightened competitive pricing conditions and felt pressure from economic softness in the region 
within our canadian and latin american operations  we also experienced foreign currency volatility against the us dollar  although the impact on the overall americas business was not as significant as the european region 
as a result  our fiscal net sales growth and operating margins in the americas fell short of prior year levels achieved in the region 
while the americas results may not be at the level of recent years  considering the economic environment  we believe the region continues to provide solid profitability and returns on invested capital 
in fiscal  we continued to make strategic investments in the americas  through the enhancement of our customer facing tools and general it infrastructure related to logistics  finance and other functions in the region 

table of contents in may  we completed the acquisition of certain assets of scribona  ab  a publicly traded it distributor in the nordic region of europe  with operations in sweden  finland and norway scribona 
the acquisition expands the company s presence in the nordics 
in connection with the acquisition  we paid approximately million in cash for the net value of the acquired assets including inventory and certain other assets and the assumption of certain liabilities 
the asset purchase agreement also provides for an additional earn out payment of up to up to million euros million at january   if certain performance objectives are met 
we believe the acquisition is an important step in our strategy to drive growth and leverage our infrastructure in the european region 
we believe our strategy focused on execution  diversification and innovation will provide further improvements to our financial results 
however  the current macroeconomic environment and related softening demand in it spending within the markets in which we conduct business may hinder our ability to maintain or improve our operating margins  both in europe and the americas 
as a result  we are constantly monitoring the factors that we can control  including our management of costs  working capital and capital spending and we will continue to work to manage our net sales  profitability and market share 
we will also continue to make targeted strategic investments across our operations in it enhancements and new business opportunities 
critical accounting policies and estimates the information included within md a is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosures 
on an on going basis  we evaluate these estimates  including those related to bad debts  inventory  vendor incentives  goodwill and intangible assets  deferred taxes  and contingencies 
our estimates and judgments are based on currently available information  historical results  and other assumptions we believe are reasonable 
actual results could differ materially from these estimates 
we believe the critical accounting policies discussed below affect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
accounts receivable we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
in estimating the required allowance  we take into consideration the overall quality and aging of the receivable portfolio  the existence of credit insurance and specifically identified customer risks 
also influencing our estimates are the following the large number of customers and their dispersion across wide geographic areas  the fact that no single customer accounts for more than of our net sales  the value and adequacy of collateral received from customers  if any  our historical loss experience and the current economic environment 
if actual customer performance were to deteriorate to an extent not expected by us  additional allowances may be required which could have an adverse effect on our consolidated financial results 
conversely  if actual customer performance were to improve to an extent not expected by us  a reduction in allowances may be required which could have a favorable effect on our consolidated financial results 
inventory we value our inventory at the lower of its cost or market value  with cost being determined on the first in  first out method 
we write down our inventory for estimated obsolescence equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated market value based upon an aging analysis of the inventory on hand  specifically known inventory related risks such as technological obsolescence and the nature of vendor terms surrounding price protection and product returns  foreign currency fluctuations for foreign sourced product  and assumptions about future demand 
market conditions or changes in terms and conditions by our vendors that are less favorable than those projected by management may require additional inventory write downs  which could have an adverse effect on our consolidated financial results 
vendor incentives we receive incentives from vendors related to cooperative advertising allowances  infrastructure funding  volume rebates and other incentive agreements 
these incentives are generally under quarterly  semi annual or annual agreements with the vendors  however  some of these incentives are negotiated on an ad hoc basis to support specific programs mutually developed with the vendor 
unrestricted volume rebates and early payment discounts received from vendors are recorded when they are earned as a reduction of inventory and as a reduction of cost of products sold as the related inventory is sold 
vendor incentives earned for specifically identified cooperative advertising programs and infrastructure funding are recorded as adjustments to product costs or selling  general and administrative expenses  depending on the nature of the programs 
we also provide reserves for receivables on vendor programs for estimated losses resulting from vendors inability to pay or rejections by vendors of claims 
should amounts recorded as outstanding receivables from vendors be deemed uncollectible  additional allowances may be required which could have an adverse effect on our consolidated financial results 

table of contents goodwill  intangible assets and other long lived assets the carrying value of goodwill is reviewed at least annually for impairment and may also be reviewed more frequently if current events and circumstances indicate a possible impairment 
an impairment loss is charged to expense in the period identified 
we also examine the carrying value of our intangible assets with finite lives  which includes capitalized software and development costs  purchased intangibles  and other long lived assets as current events and circumstances warrant determining whether there are any impairment losses 
if indicators of impairment are present and future cash flows are not expected to be sufficient to recover the assets carrying amount  an impairment loss is charged to expense in the period identified 
factors that may cause a goodwill  intangible asset or other long lived asset impairment include negative industry or economic trends and significant underperformance relative to historical or projected future operating results 
our valuation methodologies include  but are not limited to  a discounted cash flow model  which estimates the net present value of the projected cash flows of our reporting units and a market approach  which evaluates comparative market multiples applied to our reporting units businesses to yield a second assumed value of each reporting unit 
if actual results are substantially lower than our projections underlying these assumptions  or if market discount rates substantially increase  our future valuations could be adversely affected  potentially resulting in future impairment charges 
income taxes we record valuation allowances to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized 
in assessing the adequacy of a recorded valuation allowance  we consider all positive and negative evidence and a variety of factors including the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities  historical and projected future taxable income  and prudent and feasible tax planning strategies 
if we determine we would be able to use a deferred tax asset in the future in excess of its net carrying value  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset valuation allowance would be made to reduce income tax expense  thereby increasing net income in the period such determination was made 
should we determine that we are unable to realize all or part of our net deferred tax assets in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset valuation allowance would be made to income tax expense  thereby reducing net income in the period such determination was made 
contingencies we accrue for contingent obligations  including estimated legal costs  when the obligation is probable and the amount is reasonably estimable 
as facts concerning contingencies become known  we reassess our position and make appropriate adjustments to the financial statements 
estimates that are particularly sensitive to future changes include those related to tax  legal  and other regulatory matters such as imports and exports  the imposition of international governmental controls  changes in the interpretation and enforcement of international laws in particular related to items such as duty and taxation  and the impact of local economic conditions and practices  which are all subject to change as events evolve and as additional information becomes available during the administrative and litigation process

our fiscal sales performance in the americas is the result of softer demand throughout the region  especially during the second semester  and an increase in competitive pricing conditions compared to the prior year 
our sales growth on a euro basis in europe is primarily the result of the may acquisition of scribona  ab  and growth in our german operations offset by lower it demand within most of the other european countries in which we operate  as well as our continuous efforts to remix our customer portfolio in europe 
we are pleased with our improved performance in europe in fiscal and we believe it is a reflection of our improved stability and stronger execution in the majority of our european operations 
declining average selling prices for the majority of the products we sell continued to have a negative impact on our sales results within both the americas and europe 
our consolidated net sales were billion in fiscal  an increase of when compared to fiscal on a regional basis  during fiscal  net sales in the americas increased by over fiscal and increased by in europe a decrease of 
table of contents on a euro basis 
our fiscal sales performance in the americas is primarily the result of stronger execution and increased sales and product management resources compared to the same period of the prior year 
these actions delivered strong growth across the americas  most notably in the direct marketer and small and medium sized business space 
the year over year sales decline in euros can largely be attributed to our conscious efforts to remix our customer portfolio across europe to those markets providing more acceptable operating margins and or requiring less working capital to serve 
these efforts are consistent with our focus on increasing our overall return on capital employed in the european region 
declining average selling prices for the majority of the products we sell continued to have a negative impact on our sales results within both the americas and europe 
gross profit gross profit as a percentage of net sales gross margin during fiscal was  a basis point increase from in fiscal the increase in gross margin is primarily attributable to improvements in our inventory  pricing and freight management practices  continued changes in the customer and product mix worldwide and a recovery of foreign currency exchange losses  as further discussed below 
these results were partially offset by competitive pricing conditions  particularly in the americas 
gross margin during fiscal was  a basis point increase from in fiscal the increase in gross margin is primarily attributable to continued improvements in our inventory and pricing management practices in europe as well as continued changes in the customer and product mix worldwide  partially offset by the competitive pricing conditions in the americas 
the competitive environment and declines in current economic conditions within the markets in which we conduct business may hinder our ability to maintain and or continue to improve gross margin from its current level 
operating expenses selling  general and administrative expenses sg a sg a as a percentage of net sales increased to in fiscal  compared to in fiscal the increase in sg a as a percentage of sales in fiscal is primarily due to a lower level of net sales on a year over year basis in the americas  our investments to support our sales growth in europe  as well as our acquisition of certain assets from nordic based scribona  ab and the related consulting and integration costs of million in fiscal in absolute dollars  worldwide sg a increased by million in fiscal compared to fiscal the year over year increase in worldwide sg a is primarily attributable to the stronger euro versus the us dollar and the factors discussed above 
sg a as a percentage of net sales decreased to in fiscal  compared to in fiscal the decrease in sg a as a percentage of net sales in fiscal is primarily the result of improvements in credit performance  productivity improvements and the leveraging of our fixed costs in europe  offset by strategic investments made in personnel and information systems to support our long term growth and productivity initiatives

these increases were partially offset by a reduction in credit costs  as discussed above  and cost decreases of million of external consulting costs related to the european restructuring program incurred during fiscal that did not recur in fiscal goodwill impairment in conjunction with the company s policy  the company s million of goodwill was tested for impairment at january  in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  the impairment testing included a determination of the fair value of the company s reporting units  which are also the company s operating segments  using market multiples and discounted cash flows modeling 
the results of the testing  which reflected the improvement in the company s european operations  indicated that the fair value of the company s reporting units was greater than the carrying value of the company s reporting units  including goodwill 
as a result  no goodwill impairment was recorded at january  
table of contents in fiscal  due to certain indicators of impairment within our european reporting unit  the company performed an impairment test for goodwill as of july  this testing included the determination of the european reporting unit s fair value using market multiples and discounted cash flows modeling 
the company s reduced earnings and cash flow forecast for our european region resulted in the company determining that a goodwill impairment charge was necessary 
as of july   the company recorded a million non cash charge for the goodwill impairment in europe 
loss on disposal of subsidiaries we incurred losses on the disposal of subsidiaries of million during fiscal  comprised of million of losses related to the closure of our uae operations and a million loss related to the sale of our israel operations 
the loss related to the closure of our uae operations includes a million impairment on our investment in the uae due to a foreign currency exchange loss previously recorded in shareholders equity as a component of other comprehensive income and million in severance costs and certain asset write offs related to the exit 
the million loss related to the sale of our israel operations includes a million impairment on our investment in israel due to a foreign currency exchange loss previously recorded in shareholders equity as a component of other comprehensive income and million in selling costs see further discussion in note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
restructuring charges no restructuring charges were incurred during fiscal restructuring charges were million and million during fiscal and  respectively 
as further discussed below  these restructuring charges include the charges related to the closure of the german logistics center  announced in the second quarter of fiscal  and charges related to the european restructuring program completed in october closure of european logistics center on may   our board of directors approved the exit from our logistics center in germany the moers logistics center 
the decision to exit this logistics center was made to enable the company to capitalize on the long term synergies of having one logistics center serving germany  austria and the czech republic and to reduce the company s expenses 
in connection with the moers logistics center exit  tech data is expanding its logistics center located in bor  czech republic 
the company expects the net result of these transactions to be a reduction in our future operating expenses 
during the year ended january   the company completed its exit of the moers logistics facility and recorded million in restructuring charges related to the closure  comprised of million of workforce reductions and million for facility costs and other fixed asset write offs 
european restructuring program in may  we announced a formal restructuring program to better align the european operating cost structure with the business environment prevailing at the time 
as of october   the initiatives related to the european restructuring program had been completed 
during fiscal  we recorded credits of million related to changes in estimates of previously recorded restructuring accruals  comprised of a million credit for facility costs and a million credit for workforce reductions 
during fiscal  we incurred million related to the restructuring program  comprised of million for workforce reductions and million for facility costs 
in total  from inception through completion of the program  we incurred million related to the restructuring program  comprised of million for workforce reductions and million for facility costs 
interest expense  discount on sale of accounts receivable  interest income interest expense increased to million in fiscal compared to million in the prior year 
the increase in interest expense in fiscal is primarily attributable to an increase in the average outstanding debt balances  partially offset by a decrease in interest rates on revolving credit loans in certain jurisdictions 
interest expense decreased to million in fiscal compared to million in the prior year 
the decrease in interest expense in fiscal is primarily attributable to two factors 
first  we issued million of convertible senior debentures in the fourth quarter of fiscal  which bear interest at 
second  we improved our daily management of our cash conversion cycle  which resulted in lower average outstanding debt balances 
the interest expense reduction resulting from these two factors was partially offset by higher interest rates on revolving credit loans during fiscal compared to the prior year 
discount on the sale of accounts receivable totaled million  million and million  respectively  in fiscal  and the decrease in the discount on sale of accounts receivables in fiscal was due to the decrease in the accounts receivable sold and a decrease in the discount rate related to the sale of the accounts receivable 
the decrease in the discount on sale of accounts receivable for fiscal compared to fiscal is primarily related to a decrease in the average period outstanding of the accounts receivable sold from fiscal through fiscal 
table of contents interest income decreased to million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal the decrease in interest income during fiscal is primarily attributable to a decrease in the average cash balances invested and a decrease in interest rates during fiscal compared to the same period of the prior year 
interest income increased to million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal the increase in interest income during fiscal is primarily attributable to higher average cash balances available for investment and higher interest rates earned on short term cash investments compared to the prior year 
foreign currency exchange loss gain we realized a net foreign currency exchange loss of million during fiscal  with approximately of this loss occurring in the european region  compared to a net foreign currency exchange gain of million in fiscal and a foreign currency exchange gain of million in fiscal as a result of subsidiaries outside of the us purchasing certain inventory in currencies other than the currency in which the inventory is sold  we recognize net foreign currency exchange gains and losses primarily due to the fluctuation in the value of the us dollar versus the euro  and to a lesser extent  the euro and the us dollar versus other currencies 
it is our policy to minimize foreign currency exchange gains and losses through an effective hedging program 
under this program  we will typically enter into forward contracts to hedge a portion of our net monetary exposure 
in certain cases where we expect our product selling prices to fluctuate with changes in foreign currency exchange rates  we consider the value of such inventory on hand as a hedge against the related foreign currency denominated accounts payable 
under this strategy  to the extent we incur a foreign currency exchange loss gain on the underlying accounts payable denominated in the foreign currency as a result of changes in foreign currency exchange rates  we would typically expect to see a corresponding increase decrease in selling prices upon the sale of the respective inventory 
the million net foreign currency exchange loss in fiscal can be primarily attributed to the use of certain portions of inventory as an economic hedge against foreign currency exposure in accounts payable 
we were able to recover a significant portion of this foreign currency exchange loss through increased gross margin in the third and fourth quarters of fiscal however  to the extent that foreign currencies remain volatile and the market conditions remain competitive  we may incur significant foreign currency exchange losses in the future and there can be no assurance as to the amount of additional gross margin we will be able to realize to offset such losses 
we will continue to use inventory as an economic hedge to offset related foreign currency exposure in accounts payable where we believe there is product selling price elasticity related to changes in underlying foreign currency exchange rates 
our hedging policy continues to prohibit speculative foreign currency exchange transactions 
provision for income taxes our effective tax rate for continuing operations was in fiscal and in fiscal the change in the effective tax rate during fiscal compared to fiscal is primarily due to the relative mix of earnings and losses within the taxing jurisdictions in which we operate and changes in the amounts of income tax reserves and valuation allowances 
in fiscal  we reversed a net amount of million of income tax reserves primarily due to statute expirations and resolution of income tax examinations 
in fiscal  a million deferred tax valuation allowance for brazil was reversed and was recorded as an income tax benefit 
on an absolute dollar basis  the provision for income taxes increased to million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal the change in the provision for income taxes is primarily due to an increase in earnings in certain countries in which we operate and the adjustments to income tax reserves and valuation allowances discussed above 
our effective tax rate for continuing operations was in fiscal and in fiscal the change in the effective tax rate during fiscal compared to fiscal is primarily the result of the fiscal goodwill impairment in europe of million  which is non deductible for tax purposes  and an increase in net operating losses in certain tax jurisdictions for which no tax benefit was recognized 
the change in the effective tax rate between fiscal and fiscal was also impacted by the reversal of a million deferred tax valuation allowance for brazil in fiscal  which was recorded as an income tax benefit 
in addition  in fiscal  we recorded an million increase in the deferred tax valuation allowance related to net operating losses recorded in previous years in certain jurisdictions in europe 
on an absolute dollar basis  the provision for income taxes increased to million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal the increase in the provision for income taxes is primarily the result of increased income within both the americas and europe in fiscal compared to fiscal  the million reversal of the brazilian valuation allowance on deferred tax assets in fiscal  and the effect of the million increase in the deferred tax valuation allowance related to certain jurisdictions in europe in fiscal 
table of contents to the extent we generate future consistent taxable income within those operations currently requiring the valuation allowance  the valuation allowance on the related deferred tax assets will be reduced  thereby reducing tax expense and increasing net income in the same period 
the underlying net operating loss carryforwards remain available to offset future taxable income in the specific jurisdictions requiring the valuation allowance  subject to applicable tax laws and regulations 
the effective tax rate differed from the us federal statutory rate of during fiscal  and  due to the relative mix of earnings or losses within the tax jurisdictions in which we operate such as a losses in tax jurisdictions where we are not able to record a tax benefit  b earnings in tax jurisdictions where we have previously recorded a valuation allowance on deferred tax assets  and c earnings in lower tax jurisdictions for which no us taxes have been provided because such earnings are planned to be reinvested indefinitely outside the united states 
the effective tax rate was also affected by the reversal of income tax reserves during the fiscal years discussed above 
the overall effective tax rate will continue to be dependent upon the geographic distribution of our earnings or losses and changes in tax laws or interpretations of these laws in these operating jurisdictions 
we monitor the assumptions used in estimating the annual effective tax rate and make adjustments  if required  throughout the year 
if actual results differ from the assumptions used in estimating our annual income tax rates  future income tax expense could be materially affected 
our future effective tax rates could be adversely affected by lower earnings than anticipated in countries with lower statutory rates  changes in the relative mix of taxable income and taxable loss jurisdictions  changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets or liabilities or changes in tax laws or interpretations thereof 
in addition  our income tax returns are subject to continuous examination by the internal revenue service and other tax authorities 
we regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income taxes 
to the extent we prevail in matters for which accruals have been established or are required to pay amounts in excess of such accruals  our effective tax rate could be materially affected 
minority interest in net loss of joint venture minority interest in net loss of joint venture was million in fiscal and million in fiscal and reflects the loss of our european joint venture attributable to brightstar corporation s ownership share in the joint venture  as the joint venture is a consolidated subsidiary in our financial statements 
the joint venture commenced sales in the third quarter of fiscal  and to date the joint venture s results of operations have not been significant 
discontinued operations  net of tax the results of operations and the gain on sale of the training business have been reclassified and presented as discontinued operations  net of tax  within the consolidated statement of operations for all periods presented 
in fiscal  we realized income from discontinued operations  net of tax  of million  comprised of a million gain  net of tax  on the sale of the training business and million of income from operations of the training business prior to the sale in march impact of inflation during the fiscal years ended january   and  we do not believe that inflation had a material impact on our consolidated operations or on our financial position 
quarterly data seasonality our quarterly operating results have fluctuated significantly in the past and will likely continue to do so in the future as a result of currency fluctuations and seasonal variations in the demand for the products and services we offer 
narrow operating margins may magnify the impact of these factors on our operating results 
recent historical seasonal variations have included an increase in european demand during our fiscal fourth quarter and decreased demand in other fiscal quarters  particularly quarters that include summer months 
given that a significant portion of our net sales are derived from europe  the worldwide results closely follow the seasonality trends in europe 
additionally  the life cycles of major products  as well as the impact of future acquisitions and dispositions  may also materially impact our business  financial condition  or results of operations 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for further information regarding our quarterly results 
liquidity and capital resources our discussion of liquidity and capital resources includes an analysis of our cash flows and capital structure  which includes both continuing and discontinued operations for all periods presented 
the absence of cash flows from discontinued operations is not expected to affect the company s future liquidity

we continue to focus on working capital management by monitoring several key metrics  including our cash conversion cycle also referred to as net cash days and owned inventory levels  that we use to manage our working capital 
our net cash days are defined as days of sales outstanding in accounts receivable dso plus days of supply on hand in inventory dos  less days of purchases outstanding in accounts payable dpo 
owned inventory is calculated as the difference between our inventory and accounts payable balances divided into the inventory balance 
our net cash days improved slightly to days at the end of fiscal compared to days at the end of fiscal our owned inventory level the percentage of inventory not financed by our vendor partners was a negative at the end of fiscal  meaning our accounts payable balances exceeded our inventory balances by

net cash used in financing activities of million during fiscal primarily reflects million of net repayments on our revolving credit lines and long term debt and million used in the repurchase of  shares of our common stock  offset by million in proceeds received for the reissuance of treasury stock related to the exercises of equity based incentives and purchases made through our espp and million of capital contributions from our partner in the european joint venture discussed above 
as of january  we maintained a receivables securitization program with a syndicate of banks  expiring in october  which allows us to transfer an undivided interest in a designated pool of us accounts receivable  on an ongoing basis  to provide 
table of contents security or collateral for borrowings up to million 
we pay interest on our committed receivables securitization program at designated commercial paper rates plus an agreed upon margin rate of at january  
additionally  we maintained a million multi currency revolving credit facility with a syndicate of banks  amended in march  which expires in march we pay interest under this facility at the applicable libor rate plus a margin based on our credit ratings rate of at january  
in addition to these credit facilities  we maintained uncommitted lines of credit and overdraft facilities totaling approximately million at january  average interest rate on the borrowing was at january  
the total capacity of the aforementioned credit facilities was approximately billion  of which million was outstanding at january  our credit agreements contain limitations on the amounts of annual dividends and repurchases of common stock 
additionally  the credit agreements require compliance with certain warranties and covenants 
the financial ratio covenants contained within the credit agreements include a debt to capitalization ratio  an interest to ebitda as defined in the credit agreements ratio  and a tangible net worth requirement 
at january   we were in compliance with all such covenants 
the ability to draw funds under these credit facilities is dependent upon sufficient collateral in the case of the receivables securitization program and meeting the aforementioned financial covenants  which may limit our ability to draw the full amount of these facilities 
as of january   the maximum amount that could be borrowed under these facilities  in consideration of the availability of collateral and the financial covenants  was approximately million 
at january   we had issued standby letters of credit of million 
these letters of credit typically act as a guarantee of payment to certain third parties in accordance with specified terms and conditions 
the issuance of these letters of credit reduces our available capacity under the above mentioned facilities by the same amount 
in december  we issued million of convertible senior debentures due the debentures bear interest at per year 
we pay interest on the debentures on june and december of each year 
in addition  beginning with the period commencing on december  and ending on june  and for each six month period thereafter  we will pay contingent interest on the interest payment date for the applicable interest period  if the market price of the debentures exceeds specified levels 
the convertible senior debentures are convertible into our common stock and cash anytime after june   or i if the market price of the common stock  as defined  exceeds of the conversion price per share of common stock  or ii if the company calls the debentures for redemption  or iii upon the occurrence of certain corporate transactions  as defined 
holders have the right to convert the debentures into shares per  principal amount of debentures  equivalent to a conversion price of approximately per share 
upon conversion  we will deliver cash equal to the lesser of the aggregate principal amount of the debentures to be converted and our total conversion obligation and shares of our common stock in respect of the remainder  if any  of our conversion obligation 
holders have the option to require us to repurchase the debentures in cash on any of the fifth  tenth or fifteenth anniversary dates from the issue date at of the principal amount plus accrued interest to the repurchase date 
the debentures are redeemable in whole or in part for cash at our option at any time on or after december  additionally  the debentures are senior  unsecured obligations and rank equally in right of payment with all of our other unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness 
the debentures are effectively subordinated to all of our existing and future secured debt and are structurally subordinated to the indebtedness and other liabilities of our subsidiaries 
the proceeds from the offering were used to repay short term debt and for other general corporate purposes 
in june  our board of directors authorized a share repurchase program of up to million of our common stock 
during the second and third quarters of fiscal  we repurchased  shares at an average of per share  for a total cost  including expenses  of million in connection with this repurchase program 
in september  our board of directors authorized a share repurchase program of up to million of our common stock 
as of january   the share repurchase program authorized in september was complete 
during fiscal  we repurchased  shares comprised of  shares purchased in connection with the our share repurchase program and shares purchased outside of the stock repurchase program  at an average of per share  for a total cost  including expenses  of million 
for our share repurchase programs  the number of shares purchased and the timing of the purchases was based on working capital requirements  general business conditions and other factors  including alternative investment opportunities 
shares we repurchase are held in treasury for general corporate purposes  including issuances under employee equity incentive plans 
our debt to capital ratio was at january  we believe that our existing sources of liquidity  including cash resources and cash provided by operating activities  supplemented as necessary with funds available under our credit arrangements  will provide sufficient resources to meet our present and future working capital and cash requirements for at least the next months 
changes in our credit rating or other market factors may increase our interest expense or other costs of capital or capital may not be available to us on acceptable terms to fund our working capital needs 
the company will continue to need additional financing  including debt financing 
the inability to obtain such sources of capital could have an adverse effect on the company s business 
the company s credit facilities contain various financial and other covenants that may limit the company s ability to borrow or limit the company s flexibility in responding to business conditions 

table of contents contractual obligations as of january   future payments of long term debt and amounts due under future minimum lease payments  including minimum commitments under it outsourcing agreements  are as follows in thousands operating leases capital leases long term debt total fiscal year thereafter total payments less amounts representing interest total principal payments fair value renewal and purchase options and escalation clauses exist for a substantial portion of the operating leases included above 
purchase orders for the purchase of inventory and other goods and services are not included in the table above 
we are not able to determine the aggregate amount of such purchase orders that represent contractual obligations  as purchase orders typically represent authorizations to purchase rather than binding agreements 
for the purposes of this table  contractual obligations for purchase of goods or services are defined as agreements that are enforceable and legally binding on tech data and that specify all significant terms  including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased  fixed  minimum or variable price provisions  and the approximate timing of the transaction 
our purchase orders are based on our current demand expectations and are fulfilled by our vendors within short time horizons 
we do not have significant non cancelable agreements for the purchase of inventory or other goods specifying minimum quantities or set prices that exceed our expected requirements for the next three months 
we also enter into contracts for outsourced services  however  the obligations under these contracts were not significant and the contracts generally contain clauses allowing for cancellation without significant penalty 
at january   we have million recorded as a current liability for uncertain tax positions under the provisions of fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of sfas no 
fin no 

fin we are not able to reasonably estimate the timing of long term payments  or the amount by which our liability will increase or decrease over time  therefore  the long term portion of our fin no 
liability of million has not been included in the contractual obligations table above see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
off balance sheet arrangements synthetic lease facility we have a synthetic lease facility the synthetic lease with a group of financial institutions under which we lease certain logistics centers and office facilities from a third party lessor 
during the second quarter of fiscal  we renewed our existing synthetic lease with a new lease agreement that expires in june properties leased under the synthetic lease are located in clearwater and miami  florida  fort worth  texas  fontana  california  suwanee  georgia  swedesboro  new jersey  and south bend  indiana 
the synthetic lease has been accounted for as an operating lease and rental payments are calculated at the applicable libor rate plus a margin based on our credit ratings 
during the first four years of the lease term  we may  at our option  purchase any combination of the seven properties  at an amount equal to each of the property s cost  as long as the lease balance does not decrease below a defined amount 
during the last year of the lease term  until days prior to the lease expiration  we may  at our option  i purchase a minimum of two of the seven properties  at an amount equal to each of the property s cost  ii exercise the option to renew the lease for a minimum of two of the seven properties or iii exercise the option to remarket a minimum of two of the seven properties and cause a sale of the properties 
if we elect to remarket the properties  we have guaranteed the lessor a percentage of the cost of each property  in the aggregate amount of approximately million the residual value 
we have also provided a residual value guarantee related to the synthetic lease  which has been recorded at the estimated fair value of the residual guarantee 
the sum of future minimum lease payments under the synthetic lease is approximately million at january  and such amounts are included in the future minimum lease payments presented above 
the synthetic lease contains covenants that must be complied with  similar to the covenants described in certain of the credit facilities 
as of january   we were in compliance with all such covenants 

table of contents guarantees as is customary in the it industry  to encourage certain customers to purchase product from us  we have arrangements with certain finance companies that provide inventory financing facilities for our customers 
in conjunction with certain of these arrangements  we have agreements with the finance companies that would require us to repurchase certain inventory  which might be repossessed from the customers by the finance companies 
due to various reasons  including among other items  the lack of information regarding the amount of saleable inventory purchased from us still on hand with the customer at any point in time  our repurchase obligations relating to inventory cannot be reasonably estimated 
repurchases of inventory by us under these arrangements have been insignificant to date 
we also provide additional financial guarantees to finance companies on behalf of certain customers 
the majority of these guarantees are for an indefinite period of time  where we would be required to perform if the customer is in default with the finance company related to purchases made from the company 
the company reviews the underlying credit for these guarantees on at least an annual basis 
as of january  and  the aggregate amount of guarantees under these arrangements totaled approximately million and million  respectively  of which approximately million and million  respectively  was outstanding 
we believe that  based on historical experience  the likelihood of a material loss pursuant to the above guarantees is remote 
item a 
qualitative and quantitative disclosures about market risk as a large global organization  we face exposure to adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates 
these exposures may change over time as business practices evolve and could have a material impact on our financial results in the future 
in the normal course of business  we employ established policies and procedures to manage our exposure to fluctuations in the value of foreign currencies 
it is our policy to utilize financial instruments to reduce risks where internal netting cannot be effectively employed 
additionally  we do not enter into derivative instruments for speculative or trading purposes 
with respect to our internal netting practices  we will consider inventory as an economic hedge against foreign currency exposure in accounts payable in certain circumstances 
this practice offsets such inventory against corresponding accounts payables denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the subsidiary buying the inventory  when determining our net exposure to be hedged using traditional forward contracts 
under this strategy  we would expect to increase or decrease our selling prices for product purchased in foreign currencies based on fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates affecting the underlying accounts payable 
to the extent we incur a foreign currency exchange loss gain on the underlying accounts payable denominated in the foreign currency  we would expect to see a corresponding increase decrease in gross profit as the related inventory is sold 
this strategy can result in a certain degree of quarterly earnings volatility as the underlying accounts payable is remeasured using the foreign currency exchange rate prevailing at the end of each period  or settlement date if earlier  whereas the corresponding increase decrease in gross profit is not realized until the related inventory is sold 
our foreign currency exposure relates to our international transactions in europe  canada and latin america  where the currency collected from customers can be different from the currency used to purchase the product 
during fiscal and  the underlying exposures are denominated primarily in the following currencies us dollar  british pound  canadian dollar  czech koruna  danish krone  euros  norwegian krone  polish zloty  swedish krona and swiss franc 
our foreign currency risk management objective is to protect our earnings and cash flows from the adverse impact of exchange rate changes through the use of foreign currency forward  option and swap contracts to hedge both intercompany and third party loans  accounts receivable and accounts payable 
we are also exposed to changes in interest rates primarily as a result of our short term and long term debt used to maintain liquidity and to finance working capital  capital expenditures and business expansion 
interest rate risk is also present in the forward foreign currency contracts hedging intercompany and third party loans 
our interest rate risk management objective is to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to minimize overall borrowing costs 
to achieve our objective  we use a combination of fixed and variable rate debt 
the nature and amount of our long term and short term debt can be expected to vary as a result of future business requirements  market conditions and other factors 
as of january  and  approximately and  respectively  of our outstanding debt had fixed interest rates 
we utilize various financing instruments  such as receivables securitization  leases  revolving credit facilities  convertible senior debentures and trade receivable purchase facilities  to finance working capital needs 
to the extent that there are changes in interest rates  the fair value of the company s fixed rate debt may fluctuate 
in order to provide an assessment of the company s foreign currency exchange rate and interest rate risk  the company performed a sensitivity analysis using a value at risk var model 
the var model consisted of using a monte carlo simulation to generate  random market price paths 
the var model determines the potential impact of the fluctuation in foreign exchange rates and interest rates assuming a one day holding period  normal market conditions and a confidence level 
the var is the maximum expected loss in fair value for a given confidence interval to the company s foreign exchange and debt portfolio due to adverse movements in the rates 
the model is not intended to represent actual losses but is used as a risk estimation and management tool 
firm commitments  assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies were excluded from the model 
the following table represents the estimated maximum potential one day loss in fair value  calculated using the var model at january  and we believe that the hypothetical loss in fair value of our foreign exchange derivatives would be offset by the gains in the value of the underlying transactions being hedged 

table of contents var as of january  january  in thousands currency rate sensitive financial instruments interest rate sensitive financial instruments combined portfolio actual future gains and losses associated with the company s derivative positions may differ materially from the analyses performed as of january  due to the inherent limitations associated with predicting the changes in the timing and amount of interest rates  foreign currency exchanges rates  and the company s actual exposures and positions
