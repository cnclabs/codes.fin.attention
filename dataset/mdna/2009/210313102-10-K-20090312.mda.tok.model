our survey customers pay a flat monthly fee of that enables them to receive and track a maximum of  survey responses 
we offer discounts for multiple product purchases and prepayments and to non profits 
for the year ended december   the average monthly amount that we charged a customer for our email marketing solution alone was approximately 
in addition  in  our average monthly total revenue per email marketing customer  including all sources of revenue  was 
we believe that the simplicity of on demand deployment combined with our affordable subscription fees and functionality facilitate adoption of our products by our target customers 
from january through december  at least of our customers in a given month have continued to subscribe to our email marketing product in the following month 

table of contents our email marketing customer base has steadily increased from approximately  at the end of to over  as of december  we measure our customer base as the number of email marketing customers that we bill directly in the last month of a period 
we market our products and acquire our customers through a variety of sources including online marketing through search engines and advertising on online networks and other websites  offline marketing through radio advertising  local seminars and other marketing efforts  contractual relationships with over  active channel partners  referrals from our growing customer base  general brand awareness and the inclusion of a link to our website in the footer of more than billion emails currently sent by our customers each month 
in  our cost of customer acquisition  which we define as our total sales and marketing expense divided by the gross number of email marketing customers added during the year  was approximately per email marketing customer  implying payback on a revenue basis in less than a year 
this implied payback is calculated by dividing the acquisition cost per email marketing customer by the average monthly total revenue per email marketing customer 
our on demand email marketing product was first offered commercially in in  our revenue was million and our net loss was million 
on october   we completed our initial public offering  in which we sold and issued  shares of common stock at a price of per share 
we raised approximately million in net proceeds after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and other offering costs 
on april   we completed a secondary public offering of  shares of common stock  of which  shares were sold by us and  shares were sold by existing stockholders  at a price to the public of per share 
we raised approximately million  net of underwriting discounts and commissions and other offering costs 
sources of revenue we derive our revenue principally from subscription fees from our customers 
our revenue is driven primarily by the number of paying customers and the subscription fees for our products and is not concentrated within any one customer or group of customers 
in  our top email marketing customers accounted for approximately of our total email marketing revenue 
we do not require our customers to commit to a contractual term  however  our customers are required to prepay for subscriptions on a monthly  semi annual  or annual basis by providing a credit card or check form of payment 
fees are recorded initially as deferred revenue and then recognized as revenue on a daily basis over the prepaid subscription period 
we also generate a small amount of revenue from professional services  which primarily consist of ancillary services related to our products 
revenue generated from professional services accounted for less than of gross revenue for each of the years ended december   and cost of revenue and operating expenses we allocate certain occupancy and general office related expenses  such as rent  utilities  office supplies and depreciation of general office assets to cost of revenue and operating expense categories based on headcount 
as a result  an occupancy expense allocation is reflected in cost of revenue and each operating expense category 
cost of revenue 
cost of revenue consists primarily of wages and benefits for software operations and customer support personnel  credit card processing fees  and depreciation  maintenance and hosting of our software applications underlying our product offerings 
we allocate a portion of customer support costs relating to assisting trial customers to sales and marketing expense 
the expenses related to our hosted software applications are affected by the number of customers who subscribe to our products and the complexity and redundancy of our software applications and hosting infrastructure 
we expect cost of revenue to increase in absolute dollars and increase slightly as a percentage of revenue in as compared to as we will experience a full year of operating our second sales and support office and a second third party hosting facility  both of which became operational in over the longer term  we anticipate that these expenses will increase in absolute dollars as we expect to increase our 
table of contents number of customers  but decrease slightly as a percentage of revenue due to efficiencies created by our expected growth in revenue 
research and development 
research and development expenses consist primarily of wages and benefits for product strategy and development personnel 
we have focused our research and development efforts on improving ease of use  functionality and technological scalability of our existing products as well as developing new offerings 
we primarily expense research and development costs 
the small percentage of direct development costs related to software enhancements which add functionality are capitalized and depreciated as a component of cost of revenue 
we expect that on an annual basis research and development expenses will increase in absolute dollars as we continue to enhance and expand our product offerings  but decrease as a percentage of revenue as we expect to continue to grow our revenue at a faster rate 
sales and marketing 
sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of advertising and promotional costs  wages and benefits for sales and marketing personnel  partner referral fees  and the portion of customer support costs that relate to assisting trial customers 
advertising costs consist primarily of pay per click payments to search engines  other online and offline advertising media  including radio and print advertisements  as well as the costs to create and produce these advertisements 
advertising costs are expensed as incurred 
promotional costs consist primarily of public relations  memberships  and event costs 
our advertising and promotional expenses have historically been highest in the fourth quarter of each year as this reflects a period of increased sales and marketing activity for many small organizations 
in order to continue to grow our business and brand and category awareness  we expect that we will continue to commit substantial resources to our sales and marketing efforts 
as a result  we expect that on an annual basis sales and marketing expenses will increase in absolute dollars  but decrease as a percentage of revenue as we expect to continue to grow our revenue at a faster rate 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses consist primarily of wages and benefits for administrative  human resources  internal information technology support  finance and accounting personnel  professional fees  certain taxes and other corporate expenses 
we expect that general and administrative expenses will increase as we continue to add personnel in connection with the anticipated growth of our business and incur costs related to operating as a public company 
therefore  we expect that our general and administrative expenses will increase in absolute dollars  but remain generally consistent as a percentage of revenue as we expect to continue to grow our revenue at a similar rate 
critical accounting policies our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of our financial statements and related disclosures requires us to make estimates  assumptions and judgments that affect the reported amount of assets  liabilities  revenue  costs and expenses  and related disclosures 
we believe that the estimates  assumptions and judgments involved in the accounting policies described below may have the greatest potential impact on our financial statements and  therefore  consider these to be our critical accounting policies 
accordingly  we evaluate our estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis 
our actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions and conditions 
see note to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form k for information about these critical accounting policies  as well as a description of our other significant accounting policies 
revenue recognition 
we provide access to our products through subscription arrangements whereby a customer is charged a fee for access to our products 
subscription arrangements include access to use our software via the internet and support services  such as telephone support 
we follow the guidance of the sec staff accounting bulletin  or sab  no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements  and emerging issues task force  or eitf  issue no 
 application of aicpa statement of position to arrangements that include the right to use software stored on another entity s hardware  which applies when customers do not have the right to take possession of the software and use it on another entity s hardware 
when there is evidence of an arrangement  the fee is fixed or determinable and collectability is deemed probable  we recognize revenue on a daily basis over the subscription period as the services are delivered 
we consider 
table of contents delivery to have occurred at the time the customer has paid for the product and gained access to their account via a log in and password 
we also offer professional services to our customers primarily for ancillary services related to our products 
professional services revenue is accounted for separately from subscription revenue based on the guidance of eitf issue no 
 accounting for revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables  as those services have value on a standalone basis and do not involve a significant degree of risk or unique acceptance criteria and as the fair value of our subscription services is evidenced by their availability on a standalone basis 
professional services revenue is recognized as the services are performed 
income taxes 
income taxes are provided for tax effects of transactions reported in the financial statements and consist of income taxes currently due plus deferred income taxes related to timing differences between the basis of certain assets and liabilities for financial statements and income tax reporting 
deferred taxes are determined based on the difference between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect in the years in which the differences are expected to reverse 
a valuation allowance for the net deferred tax assets is provided if  based upon the weight of available evidence  it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
software and website development costs 
we follow the guidance of the american institute of certified public accountants statement of position no 
 accounting for the costs of computer software developed or obtained for internal use  and eitf issue no 
 accounting for web site development costs  in accounting for the development costs of our on demand products and website development costs whereby certain direct costs to develop functionality as well as certain upgrades and enhancements that are probable to result in additional functionality are capitalized 
the costs incurred in the preliminary stages of development are expensed as incurred 
once an application has reached the development stage  internal and external costs  if direct and incremental  are capitalized until the software is substantially complete and ready for its intended use 
we depreciate capitalized software over a three year period commencing when the asset is placed in service 
costs associated with the development of internal use software capitalized during the years ended december   and were   and  respectively 
redeemable convertible preferred stock warrant 
we accounted for freestanding warrants and other similar instruments related to shares that are redeemable in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards  or sfas  no 
 accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity 
under sfas no 
 the freestanding warrant that was related to our redeemable convertible preferred stock was classified as a liability on the balance sheet 
the warrant was subject to re measurement at each balance sheet date prior to its exercise in october the changes in fair value as determined using the black scholes option pricing model were recognized as a component of other income expense  net 
stock based compensation 
effective january   we adopted sfas no 
r  or sfas r  share based payment  a revision of sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  and related interpretations 
sfas r superseded accounting principles board  or apb  opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and related interpretations 
sfas r requires all share based compensation to employees and directors  including grants of stock options  to be valued at fair value on the date of grant  and to be expensed over the applicable service period 
we adopted this statement using the prospective transition method which does not result in restatement of our previously issued financial statements and requires only new awards or awards that are modified  repurchased or canceled after the effective date to be accounted for under the provisions of sfas r 
pursuant to the income tax provisions included in sfas r  we have elected the short cut method of computing the hypothetical pool of additional paid in capital that is available to absorb future tax benefit shortfalls 
determining the appropriate fair value model and calculating the fair value of stock based payment awards require the use of highly subjective estimates and assumptions  including the estimated fair value of common stock  expected life of the stock based payment awards and stock price volatility 
commencing in the fourth quarter of  we used the quoted market price of our common stock to establish the fair value of the common stock underlying the options 
because there was no public market for our common stock prior to our 
table of contents initial public offering  for those earlier periods  our board of directors determined the fair value of common stock taking into account our most recently available valuation of common stock 
for the year ended december  and until the completion of our initial public offering of common stock in october  we obtained quarterly contemporaneous common stock valuations to assist our board of directors in determining the fair value of common stock 
in the first quarter of  the fair value of common stock was estimated using the guideline public company method 
the valuation considered numerous factors  including peer group trading multiples  the amount of preferred stock liquidation preferences  the illiquid nature of our common stock  our small size  lack of historical profitability  short term cash requirements and the redemption rights of preferred stockholders 
beginning in the second quarter of  our quarterly common stock valuations were prepared using the probability weighted expected return method 
under this methodology  the fair market value of common stock was estimated based upon an analysis of future values for our company assuming various outcomes 
the share value was based on the probability weighted present value of expected future investment returns considering each of the possible outcomes available to us as well as the rights of each share class 
during  and  we used the black scholes option pricing model to value our option grants and determine the related compensation expense 
the assumptions used in calculating the fair value were as follows year ended december  weighted average risk free interest rate expected term in years weighted average expected volatility expected dividends these assumptions represented our best estimates  but the estimates involved inherent uncertainties and the application of our judgment 
as a result  if factors change and we use significantly different assumptions or estimates  our stock based compensation expense could be materially different 
prior to october  we had been a private company and lacked company specific historical and implied volatility information 
therefore  we estimated our expected volatility based on the historical volatility of our publicly traded peer companies and  commencing in october  our own volatility 
we expect to continue to estimate volatility based on the historic volatility of our peer companies and our own company until such time as we have adequate historical data regarding the volatility of our own traded stock price 
the expected term of options has been determined utilizing the simplified method as prescribed by sab no 
 share based payment and sab no 
 which allows the continued use of the simplified method for options granted after december  the risk free interest rate used for each grant is based on a us treasury instrument with a term similar to the expected term of the option 
sfas r requires that we recognize compensation expense for only the portion of options that are expected to vest 
in developing a forfeiture rate estimate  we have considered our historical experience to estimate pre vesting option forfeitures 
if our actual forfeiture rate is materially different from the estimate  our stock based compensation expense could be significantly different from what we have recorded in the current period 
we have unrecognized compensation expense associated with outstanding stock options at december  of million  which is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of years

if required  additional financing may not be available on terms that are favorable to us  if at all 
if we raise additional funds through the issuance of equity or convertible debt securities  the percentage ownership of our stockholders will be reduced and these securities might have rights  preferences and privileges senior to those of our current stockholders or we may be subject to covenants that restrict how we conduct our business 
no assurance can be given that additional financing will be available or that  if available  such financing can be obtained on terms favorable to our stockholders and us 
the markets in which we operate are suffering from the effects of a significant economic recession 
we have limited experience operating our business during an economic downturn 
we do not know if our current business model will operate as effectively during an economic downturn 
furthermore  we are unable to predict the likely duration and severity of the current adverse economic conditions in the us and other countries  but the longer the duration the greater risks we face in operating our business 
therefore  the current economic conditions could have a significant adverse impact on our operating results and working capital 
during the last three years  inflation and changing prices have not had a material effect on our business 
in light of the current economic recession  we are unable to predict whether inflation or changing prices will materially affect our business in the foreseeable future

we do not have any interest in entities referred to as variable interest entities  which include special purpose entities and other structured finance entities

we are currently assessing the impact of the adoption of sfas for non financial assets and liabilities on our financial statements 
in june  the eitf of the fasb reached a consensus on eitf issue no 
 accounting by lessees for maintenance deposits under lease agreements
