item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations when you read this section of this report  it is important that you also read the financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this report 
this section contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results could differ materially from those we anticipate in these forward looking statements for many reasons  including the factors described below and in the section entitled risk factors 
overview we are a vertically integrated dermatology company that is developing and marketing levulan pdt and other products for common skin conditions 
our currently marketed products include  among others  levulan kerastick topical solution with pdt  the blu u brand light source  and certain products acquired in the march  merger with sirius laboratories  inc  including clindareach 

table of contents historically  we devoted most of our resources to advancing the development and marketing of our levulan pdt pd technology platform 
in addition to our marketed products  our drug  levulan brand of aminolevulinic acid hcl  or ala  in combination with light  has been studied in a broad range of medical conditions 
when levulan is used and followed with exposure to light to treat a medical condition  it is known as levulan photodynamic therapy  or pdt 
when levulan is used and followed with exposure to light to detect medical conditions  it is known as levulan photodetection  or levulan pd 
the kerastick is our proprietary applicator that delivers levulan 
the blu u is our patented light device 
the levulan kerastick topical solution with pdt and the blu u were launched in the united states  or us  in september for the treatment of non hyperkeratotic actinic keratoses  or aks  of the face or scalp under a former dermatology collaboration 
aks are precancerous skin lesions caused by chronic sun exposure that can develop over time into a form of skin cancer called squamous cell carcinoma 
in addition  in september we received clearance from the united states food and drug administration  or fda  to market the blu u without levulan pdt for the treatment of moderate inflammatory acne vulgaris and general dermatological conditions 
sirius laboratories  inc  or sirius  a dermatology specialty pharmaceuticals company  was founded in with a primary focus on the treatment of acne vulgaris and acne rosacea 
nicomide  its key product  is a vitamin mineral product formerly prescribed by dermatologists 
in april  we were notified by actavis totowa  llc  the manufacturer of nicomide  that actavis would cease manufacturing several prescription vitamins  including nicomide  due to continuing discussions with the fda 
as we previously disclosed  actavis totowa had received notice that the fda considers prescription dietary supplements to be unapproved new drugs 
in response to this notification and subsequent discussions with the fda  we stopped the sale and distribution of nicomide as a prescription product in june on august   we entered into a worldwide non exclusive patent license agreement to our patent covering nicomide  or license agreement  with river s edge pharmaceuticals  llc  or river s edge  and an amendment to our settlement agreement with river s edge 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
the amendment to the settlement agreement allows river s edge to manufacture and market a prescription product that could be substitutable for nicomide pursuant to the terms of the license agreement and changes certain payment obligations of river s edge for sales of its substitutable product 
in consideration for granting the license  we are being paid a share of the net revenues  as defined in the license agreement  of river s edge s licensed product sales under the license agreement 
we are also considering other options  including the possible sale of the product and related patent or the launch of a non prescription dietary supplement in compliance with the dietary supplement health and education act  or dshea 
we are in discussions with the fda regarding dshea labeling including the use of the trademark 
should we re launch the product with a dshea label  we expect both the price and volume of the nicomide dshea labeled product to be considerably less than historic prescription nicomide levels 
we are responsible for manufacturing our levulan kerastick and for the regulatory  sales  marketing  and customer service and other related activities for all of our products  including our levulan kerastick 
our current objectives include increasing the sales of our products in the united states  canada  latin america  and korea  launching levulan with our partners in additional latin american and asian countries and continuing our levulan pdt clinical development program for immunosuppressed solid organ transplant recipients  or sotr 
to further these objectives  we entered into a marketing and distribution agreement with stiefel laboratories  inc in january granting stiefel an exclusive right to distribute the levulan kerastick in mexico  central and south america 
on march   stiefel notified us that the brazilian authorities had published the final pricing for the product which was acceptable to stiefel and to us 
stiefel launched the product in brazil in april the product was launched in argentina  chile  colombia and mexico during the fourth quarter of similarly  in january  we entered into a marketing and distribution agreement with daewoong pharmaceutical co  ltd 
and daewoong s wholly owned subsidiary  dnc daewoong derma plastic surgery network company  together referred to as daewoong  granting daewoong exclusive rights to distribute the levulan kerastick in certain asian countries 
in the fourth quarter of  the korean food and drug administration  or kfda  approved levulan kerastick for pdt for the treatment of actinic keratosis  and daewoong launched our product in korea 
recently  we granted 
table of contents daewoong the right to distribute our product in japan on a named patient basis to test this market 
through the end of  the rate of adoption of our therapy in these markets has been slower than we had anticipated at the outset of these agreements 
our current objectives include increasing the sales of our products in these markets 
we believe that historical issues related to reimbursement negatively impacted the economic competitiveness of our therapy with other ak therapies and hindered its adoption in the past 
though we believe that current centers for medicare and medicaid services  or cms  reimbursement levels allow us to be competitive  we continue to support efforts to improve reimbursement levels to physicians 
most major private insurers have approved coverage for our ak therapy  however some private insurers still do not provide adequate coverage 
when we learn of these issues  we educate the insurers and are often able to facilitate a change in their coverage policy 
we believe that with potential future improvements  along with our education and marketing programs  a more widespread adoption of our therapy should occur over time 
we intend to seek reimbursement coverage for use of our blu u to treat acne following the analysis of the results of our phase iib clinical trial 
as a result of the current global credit and financial market conditions  government authorities and private insurers may be unable to satisfy their reimbursement obligations or may delay payment 
in addition  federal and state health authorities may reduce medicare and medicaid reimbursements  and private insurers may increase their scrutiny of claims 
a reduction in the availability or extent of reimbursement could negatively affect our product sales and revenues 
see the section below entitled research and development costs 
we are developing levulan pdt and pd under an exclusive worldwide license of patents and technology from parteq research and development innovations  the licensing arm of queen s university  kingston  ontario  canada 
in january   we filed a request for reexamination with the uspto of one of the queen s patents that cover our approved indication for ak 
we also own or license certain other patents relating to methods for using pharmaceutical formulations which contain our drug and related processes and improvements 
in the united states  dusa  dusa pharmaceuticals  inc  levulan  kerastick  blu u  nicomide  nicomide t  clindareach  meted  and psoriacap are registered trademarks 
several of these trademarks are also registered in europe  australia  canada  and in other parts of the world 
numerous other trademark applications are pending 
as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of approximately  we cannot predict whether any of our products will achieve significant enough market acceptance or generate sufficient revenues to enable us to become profitable on a sustainable basis 
if our domestic pdt revenue growth rates in continue in  we expect to become cash flow positive and profitable on a quarterly basis sometime late in we recorded significant impairment changes of goodwill during the fourth quarter of and the third quarter of achieving our goal of becoming a profitable operating company is dependent upon greater acceptance of our pdt therapy by the medical and consumer constituencies  increased sales of our products and other factors contained in this report 
we recognize that we have to continue to demonstrate the clinical value of our unique therapy  and the related product benefits as compared to other well established conventional therapies  in order for the medical community to accept our products on a large scale 
we are aware that physicians have been using levulan with the blu u using short incubation times  and with light devices manufactured by other companies  and for uses other than our fda approved use 
while we are not permitted to market our products for so called off label uses  we believe that these activities are positively affecting the sales of our products 
as of december   we had a staff of employees  including part time employees  as compared to full time employees  including part time employees  at the end of  including marketing and sales  production  maintenance  customer support  and financial operations personnel  as well as those who support research and development programs for dermatology and internal indications 
at december   our sales force was comprised of employees 
we may add to or reduce our headcount during as business circumstances deem necessary 

table of contents transactions during  dusa entered into a number of transactions river s edge nicomide we ceased the sale and distribution of nicomide as a prescription product in june on august   we entered into a worldwide non exclusive patent license agreement to our patent covering nicomide with river s edge pharmaceuticals  and an amendment to our settlement agreement and mutual release  or settlement agreement  described below  with river s edge 
the amendment to the settlement agreement allows river s edge to manufacture and market a prescription product that could be substitutable for nicomide pursuant to the terms of the license agreement and changes certain payment obligations of river s edge for sales of its substitutable product 
in consideration for granting the license  we are being paid a share of the net revenues  as defined in the license agreement  of river s edge s licensed product sales under the license agreement 
we are also considering the possible sale of the product and the related patent 
royalty revenues recorded pursuant to the license agreement are recorded in product revenues in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations 
in october  as part of the settlement of litigation between dusa and river s edge  we entered into the settlement agreement to dismiss the lawsuit brought by us against river s edge asserting a number of claims arising out of river s edge s alleged infringement of our nicomide patent  us patent no 
 under which we had marketed  distributed and sold nicomide 
as part of the original terms of the settlement agreement  river s edge agreed to pay us for every bottle of nic above  bottles that was substituted for nicomide after september  the net gain from settlement of litigation for the years ended december  and was  and  respectively 
in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations the net gain on settlement is recorded as a separate component of operating expenses 
winston laboratories  inc on or about january   winston laboratories  inc  or winston  and the former sirius entered into a license agreement relating to a sirius product  psoriatec known by winston as micanol revising a former agreement 
the original micanol license agreement granted an exclusive license  with limitation on rights to sublicense  to all property rights  including all intellectual property and improvements  owned or controlled by winston to manufacture  sell and distribute products containing anthralin  in the united states 
on january   our wholly owned subsidiary  sirius  entered into the micanol transition license agreement with winston 
the transition license agreement amends the original micanol license agreement which was due to expire pursuant to its terms on january  the parties entered into the transition license agreement to extend the term of the micanol license agreement to september  in order to allow us to sell our last batch of product  to reduce the period of time that we are required to maintain product liability insurance with respect to the distribution and sale of products containing anthralin after the termination of the transition license agreement and to confirm the allocation of certain costs and expenses relating to the product during and after the transition period 
psoriatec is a product that is regulated under the fda s marketed unapproved drug policy guide 
dusa placed its psoriatec inventory on hold and following discussions with the fda  notified the fda in july that dusa would cease marketing psoriatec at the termination of its license agreement  which expired on september  in october  winston filed a notice demanding arbitration of claims relating to alleged breach of the license agreements and seeking damages in excess of  the parties are currently in settlement discussions 
the company does not expect any potential settlement payment to be material to its financial condition or the results of its operations

table of contents national biological corporation amended and restated purchase and supply agreement on june   we signed an amended and restated purchase and supply agreement with national biological corporation  or nbc  the principal manufacturer of our blu u light source 
this agreement provides for the elimination of certain exclusivity clauses  permits us to order on a purchase order basis without minimums  and includes other modifications of the original agreement providing both parties greater flexibility related to the development and manufacture of light sources and the associated technology within the field of pdt 
on december   we signed the second amendment to the amended and restated purchase and supply agreement with nbc  which extends the agreement until june   and gives us an option to further extend the term for an additional two years subject only to agreement on price terms to be negotiated in good faith 
the parties are actively engaged in discussions to further extend the term of the agreement 
critical accounting policies and estimates critical accounting policies are those that require application of management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain and may change in subsequent periods and that can significantly affect our financial position and results of operations 
our accounting policies are disclosed in note to the consolidated financial statements 
we have discussed these policies and the underlying estimates used in applying these accounting policies with our audit committee 
since not all of these accounting policies require management to make difficult  subjective or complex judgments or estimates  they are not all considered critical accounting policies 
we consider the following policies and estimates to be critical to our financial statements 
revenue recognition and provisions for estimated reductions to gross revenues we recognize revenues in accordance with staff accounting bulletin sab no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements  as amended by sab no 
 revenue recognition 
accounting for revenue transactions relies on certain estimates that require difficult  subjective and complex judgments on the part of management 
for revenues associated with contractual agreements with multiple deliverables  we apply the revenue recognition criteria outlined in sec staff accounting bulletin topic  revenue recognition sab topic and eitf  revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables 
accordingly  revenues from contractual agreements are recognized based on the performance requirements of those agreements 
as prescribed by eitf  we analyze each contract in order to separate each deliverable into separate units of accounting and then recognize revenue for those separated units at their fair values as earned in accordance with the sab topic or other applicable revenue recognition guidance 
photodynamic therapy pdt drug and device products revenues on the kerastick and blu u product sales in the us and canada are recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  the price is fixed and determinable  delivery has occurred  and collection is probable 
product sales made through distributors  historically  have been recorded as deferred revenue until the product was sold by the distributors to the end users because we did not have sufficient history with our distributors to be able to reliably estimate returns 
beginning in the first quarter of  we began recognizing revenue as product is sold to distributors because we believe we have sufficient history to reliably estimate returns from distributors beginning january  this change in estimate was not material to our revenues or results of operations 
we offer programs that allow physicians access to our blu u device for a trial period 
no revenue is recognized on these units until the physician elects to purchase the equipment and all other revenue recognition criteria are met 
we have entered into exclusive marketing  distribution and supply agreements with distributors in latin america and korea that contain multiple deliverables 
revenues on the kerastick product sales made under these agreements are recorded in accordance with eitf as described below 
stiefel laboratories agreement 
in january  as amended in september  we entered into an exclusive marketing  distribution and supply agreement with stiefel laboratories  inc for levulan pdt in 
table of contents latin america 
under the agreement  stiefel is required to purchase levulan kerastick from us and make up front  milestone and royalty payments 
stiefel may cancel the agreement if there is a breach of contract  if either party files for bankruptcy  or if its sales during any year are less than its minimum purchase obligations

we are obligated under the agreement to provide multiple deliverables  the primary deliverables being license product distribution rights and commercial product supply 
the agreement establishes a fixed supply price per unit  as well as a royalty based on a percentage of the net sales price to end users 
under eitf the deliverables under the agreement are treated as a single unit of accounting 
we determine attribution methods for each of the separate payment streams 
revenues from unit sales of levulan kerastick are recognized based on end user demand as we do not have sufficient data to determine product acceptance in the marketplace and therefore do not have the ability to estimate product returns 
royalty revenues are recorded each quarter based on stiefel s reported net sales for that quarter and are included in product revenues 
the agreement also establishes minimum purchase quantities over the first five years following regulatory approval  and since stiefel s sales to third parties during the contract year ended october were below its minimum purchase obligations  stiefel has the right to cancel the agreement 
the non refundable up front payments are being recognized into revenues on a straight line basis commencing upon the first product shipments in a country over the remaining contractual term of the agreement  which is years 
milestone payments based on cumulative units shipped into a country will initially be deferred and then recognized on a straight line basis over the then remaining contractual term  with a cumulative catch up based on the number of years into the contract such milestone is attained 
as of december  and  in accordance with our policy of deferring revenues on new product launches  we have deferred revenues of  and  respectively  related to product shipments of levulan kerastick into mexico and argentina that have not yet been sold through to the end user customers 
deferred revenues at december  and associated with milestone payments received from stiefel are  and  respectively 
daewoong agreement

daewoong may cancel the agreement only if there is a breach of contract or if either party files for bankruptcy 
under the terms of the agreement  daewoong will make up to million in milestone payments to us  million of which was paid upon contract execution during the first quarter of and another million of which was paid during the fourth quarter of upon achieving regulatory approval in korea 
the milestone payments are non refundable 
product shipments are subject to return and refund only if the product does not comply with technical specifications 
we are obligated under the agreement to provide multiple deliverables  the primary deliverables being license product distribution rights and commercial product supply 
the agreement establishes a fixed supply price per unit  as well as an excess purchase price component if the average selling price to end users exceeds a certain threshold 
under eitf the deliverables under the agreement are treated as a single unit of accounting 
we determine attribution methods for each of the separate payment streams 
revenues from unit sales of levulan kerastick are recognized based on end user demand as we do not have sufficient data to determine product acceptance in the marketplace and therefore do not have the ability to estimate product returns 
excess purchase price revenues are recorded each quarter based on daewoong s reported net sales for that quarter and are included in product revenues

photocure agreement 
on may   we entered into a patent license agreement under which we granted photocure asa a non exclusive license under the patents we license from parteq for ala esters 
in addition  we granted a non exclusive license to photocure for its existing formulations of hexvix and metvix known in the us as metvixia for any patent we own now or in the future 
photocure is obligated to pay us royalties on sales of its ester products to the extent they are covered by our patents in the us and certain other territories 
as part of the agreement  photocure paid us a prepaid royalty in the amount of million 
revenues recognized pursuant to the photocure agreement have not been material to date 
the balance of the prepaid royalty under the photocure agreement is included in deferred revenues in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets 
non pdt drug products we recognize revenue for sales of non pdt drug products when substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership have transferred to the customer  which generally occurs on the date of shipment to wholesale customers  with the exceptions described below 
revenue is recognized net of revenue reserves  which consist of allowances for discounts  returns  rebates  chargebacks and fees paid to wholesalers under distribution service agreements 
in the case of sales made to wholesalers as a result of incentives and that are in excess of the wholesaler s ordinary course of business inventory level  substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership do not transfer upon shipment and  accordingly  such sales are recorded as deferred revenue and the related costs as deferred cost of revenue until the product is sold through to the wholesalers customers on a first in  first out basis 
we evaluate inventory levels at our wholesaler customers through an analysis that considers  among other things  wholesaler purchases  wholesaler shipments to retailers  available end user prescription data obtained from third parties and on hand inventory data received directly from our three largest wholesaler customers 
we believe that this evaluation of wholesaler inventory levels  allows us to make reasonable estimates for our applicable revenue related reserves 
additionally  our products are sold to wholesalers with a product shelf life that allows sufficient time for our wholesaler customers to sell the products in their inventory through to retailers and  ultimately  to end user consumers prior to product expiration 
for new product launches where we do not have the ability to reliably estimate returns  revenue is recognized based on end user demand  which is typically based on dispensed subscription data  or ship through data as reported by our international distribution partners 
when inventories have been reduced to targeted stocking levels at wholesalers or distribution partners  and we have sufficient data to determine product acceptance in the marketplace which allows us to estimate product returns  we recognize revenue upon shipment  net of discounts and allowances 
sales returns we account for sales returns in accordance with financial accounting standards board fasb statement no 
 revenue recognition when right of return exists  by establishing an accrual in an amount equal to our estimate of sales recorded for which the related products are expected to be returned 
we determine the estimate of the sales return accrual primarily based on historical experience regarding sales and related returns and incorporating other factors that could impact sales returns in the future 
these other factors include levels of inventory in the distribution channel  estimated shelf life  product recalls  product discontinuances  price changes of competitive products  introductions of generic products and introductions of competitive new products 
our policy is to accept returns when product is within six months of expiration 
we consider all of these factors and adjust the accrual periodically to reflect actual experience 
in the pdt drug and device products segment  product sales made through distributors  historically  had been recorded as deferred revenue until the product was sold by the distributors to the end users because we did not have sufficient history with our distributors to be able to reliably estimate returns 

table of contents chargebacks  rebates and discounts chargebacks typically occur when suppliers enter into contractual pricing arrangements with end user customers  including certain federally mandated programs  who then purchase from wholesalers at prices below what the supplier charges the wholesaler 
since we only offer preferred pricing to end user customers under federally mandated programs  chargebacks have not been significant 
our rebate programs can generally be categorized into the following two types medicaid rebates and consumer rebates 
medicaid rebates are amounts owed based on legal requirements with public sector benefit providers after the final dispensing of the product by a pharmacy to a benefit plan participant 
consumer rebates are amounts owed as a result of mail in coupons that are distributed by health care providers to consumers at the time a prescription is written 
we offer our wholesaler customers a prompt pay discount 
we evaluate the amount accrued for prompt pay discounts by analyzing the unpaid invoices in our accounts receivable aging subject to a prompt pay discount 
prompt pay discounts are known within to days of sale  and therefore can be reliably estimated based on actual and expected activity at each reporting date 
we record these discounts at the time of sale and they are accounted for as a reduction of revenues 
inventory inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market value 
cost is determined using the first in  first out method 
inventories are continually reviewed for slow moving  obsolete and excess items 
inventory items identified as slow moving are evaluated to determine if an adjustment is required 
additionally  our industry is characterized by regular technological developments that could result in obsolete inventory 
although we make every effort to assure the reasonableness of our estimates  any significant unanticipated changes in demand  technological development  or significant changes to our business model could have a significant impact on the value of our inventory and our results of operations 
we use sales projections to estimate the appropriate level of inventory reserves  if any  that are necessary at each balance sheet date 
valuation of long lived  intangible assets and goodwill we review long lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in business circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of assets may not be fully recoverable or that the useful lives of these assets are no longer appropriate 
factors considered important which could trigger an impairment review include significant changes relative to i projected future operating results  ii the use of the assets or the strategy for the overall business  iii business collaborations  and iv industry  business  or economic trends and developments 
each impairment test is based on a comparison of the undiscounted cash flow to the recorded value of the asset 
if it is determined that the carrying value of long lived or intangible assets may not be recoverable  the asset is written down to its estimated fair value on a discounted cash flow basis 
at december  and  respectively  total property  plant and equipment had a net carrying value of  and  including  at december  associated with our manufacturing facility 
as of december  and  respectively  we had intangible assets totaling  and  recorded in deferred charges and other assets relating to the unamortized balance of payments made in to a light source supplier related to an amendment to our agreement and to a licensor related to the reacquisition of our product rights in canada 
the payment to the light source supplier was fully amortized during on march   the company acquired all of the outstanding common stock of sirius laboratories  inc all goodwill and intangible assets recorded in connection with the sirius acquisition have been charged to the accompanying statements of operations as impairments as of december  we agreed to pay additional consideration in future periods to the former sirius shareholders based upon the achievement of total cumulative sales milestones for the sirius products over the period ending months from the date of close 
the first cumulative sales milestone was achieved during the three month period ended september   and accordingly a cash payment in the amount of million was paid to the former sirius shareholders during the third quarter of the payment was recorded initially as goodwill and then subsequently deemed impaired and expensed during the same period 
during the fourth quarter of  we performed our annual test for goodwill impairment as required by fasb statement no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas 
we used december st as the date of our annual goodwill impairment test 
based on the review  we recorded an impairment charge to goodwill of million  which was all associated with the non pdt drug products reporting unit and 
table of contents represented the entire goodwill balance 
as discussed in more detail in note to the consolidated financial statements  the impairment charge is primarily related to our revised estimate of cash flows associated with the sirius products and product pipeline 
decisions related to the product pipeline are based on a number of factors  most importantly  our development partner s  altana  inc s  receipt of a non approvable letter from the fda in the fourth quarter of with respect to its anda supplement covering one of the potential products we acquired from sirius 
we paid and or accrued  in milestone payments in the fourth quarter of as a result of our decision not to pursue this product or any additional potential products from the acquisition 
in  we reviewed the valuation of our intangible assets and goodwill associated with nicomide for impairment as a result of a decision by the us courts to dissolve a preliminary injunction that had previously enjoined a competitor from manufacturing and selling a generic and recorded a write down of million in  representing the remaining net asset value of the intangible assets as of december  share based compensation we measure all employee share based compensation awards using a fair value based method and record share based compensation expense in our financial statements if the requisite service to earn the award is provided 
in accordance with fasb statement no 
r  share based payment sfas r  we recognize the expense attributable to stock awards that are granted or vest in periods ending subsequent to the adoption of sfas r in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations 
for more information about our share based compensation  see note to the consolidated financial statements 
derivative financial instruments we follow fasb statement no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities sfas  for the common stock purchase warrants in connection with the october private placement 
the warrants are accounted for as derivative liabilities at fair value in accordance with sfas the warrants do not meet the criteria in paragraph a of sfas that a contract should not be considered a derivative instrument if it is indexed to its own stock and classified as a component of stockholders equity 
we record the warrant liability at its fair value using the black scholes option pricing model and revalue it at each reporting date until the warrants are exercised or expire 
changes in the fair value of the warrants are reported in our statements of operations as non operating income or expense under the caption gain on change in fair value of warrants 
the fair value of the warrants is subject to significant fluctuation based on changes in our stock price  expected volatility  remaining contractual life and the risk free interest rate 
the market price for our common stock has been and may continue to be volatile 
consequently  future fluctuations in the price of our common stock may cause significant increases or decreases in the fair value of the warrants

for the year ended december   kerastick revenues were  representing an increase of  or  over the comparable totals of  kerastick unit sales to end users for the year ended december  were  including  sold in canada and  sold in korea 
this represents an increase from  kerastick units sold in the year ended december   including  sold in canada and  sold in korea 
our average net selling price for the kerastick increased to for the year ended december  from in our average net selling price for the kerastick includes sales made directly to our end user customers  as well as sales made to our distributors  in canada  korea and the rest of the world 
the increase in kerastick revenues was driven mainly by increased sales volumes in the united states  due in part to our continued focus on the medical dermatology market  and internationally  through our distribution agreements with stiefel and daewoong  and an increase in our average unit selling price 
for the year ended december   blu u revenues were  essentially flat in comparison with blu u revenues of  the slight decrease in blu u revenues were driven by slightly lower sales volumes which were offset by an increase in our average selling price 
in the year ended december   there were units sold  versus units in the total consists of units sold in the united states and in korea by daewoong 
the total consists of sold in the united states  sold in canada and in korea 
our average net selling price for the blu u increased to  for the year ended december  from  for our blu u evaluation program allows customers to take delivery for a limited number of blu u units for a period of up to four months for private practitioners and up to one year for hospital clinics  before a purchase decision is required 
at december   there were approximately units in the field pursuant to this evaluation program  compared to units 
table of contents in the field at december  the units are classified as inventory in the financial statements and are being amortized during the evaluation period to cost of goods sold using an estimated life for the equipment of three years 
non pdt drug product revenues reflect the revenues generated by the products acquired as part of our acquisition of sirius 
total non pdt drug product revenues for the year ended december  were  compared to  for the year ended december  the substantial majority of the non pdt product revenues were from sales of nicomide and nicomide related royalties 
in april  we were notified by actavis totowa  llc  the manufacturer of nicomide  that actavis would cease manufacturing several prescription vitamins  including nicomide  due to continuing discussions with the fda 
as we previously disclosed  actavis totowa had received notice that the fda considers prescription dietary supplements to be unapproved new drugs 
in response to this notification and subsequent discussions with the fda  we stopped the sale and distribution of nicomide as a prescription product in june we are in discussions with the fda regarding new labeling  compliant with dshea  including use of the trademark 
should we re launch the product with a dshea label  we expect both the price and volume of the nicomide dshea labeled product to be considerably less than historic prescription nicomide levels 
we are also considering other options  including the possible sale of the product and related patent or the launch of a non prescription dietary supplement in compliance with dshea 
on august   we entered into a worldwide non exclusive patent license agreement to our patent covering nicomide with river s edge pharmaceuticals  llc and an amendment to our settlement agreement with river s edge 
the amendment to the settlement agreement allows river s edge to manufacture and market a prescription product that could be substitutable for nicomide pursuant to the terms of the license agreement and changes certain payment obligations of river s edge for sales of its substitutable product 
in consideration for granting the license  we are being paid a share of the net revenues  as defined in the license agreement  of river s edge s licensed product sales under the license agreement 
nicomide sales in were negatively impacted by residual levels of nic  that were substituted for nicomide  remaining in the distribution channel subsequent to the settlement with river s edge 
the settlement agreement is described in note to the consolidated financial statements 
the increase in our total revenues in results from increased pdt segment revenues in the united states  as well as our pdt product launches in korea and the rest of the world 
however  we must continue to increase sales from these levels in order for us to become profitable 
photocure received fda approval to market metvixia for treatment of aks in july  and this product  which would be directly competitive with our levulan kerastick product  could be launched at any time 
while we are entitled to royalties from photocure on its net sales of metvixia  a large dermatology company has the marketing rights in the us  which may adversely affect our ability to maintain or increase our levulan market 
nonetheless  we remain confident that sales should continue to increase through increased consumption of our pdt segment products by our existing customers  as well as the addition of new customers 
we expect to be able to grow our pdt segment revenues in the united states during  due in part to the increase in reimbursement of our pdt related procedure fee  which became effective january   as well as our price increases  which were effective october  and january  although we expect growth in our pdt segment revenues  a portion of our customer base  ie  those focusing on the cosmetic market  are more susceptible to the uncertain economic conditions facing our markets  and reduced sales to that customer base could be expected until the economy recovers 
the vast majority of our international sales and medi spa sales falls into this market 
we expect our non pdt revenues for to be significantly reduced compared to since we are no longer manufacturing and marketing nicomide as a prescription product 
we are evaluating alternative manufacturing  labeling and distribution strategies in order to re launch nicomide on the market and we are also considering opportunities to sell the product 
also see the section entitled risk factors any failure to comply with government regulations in the united states and elsewhere will limit our ability to market our products and become profitable

table of contents kerastick gross margins for the year ended december  were  versus for the year ended december  the increase in margin is mainly attributable to an increase in our average unit selling price and lower overall manufacturing costs due to increased production volumes 
our long term goal is to achieve higher gross margins on kerastick sales which will be significantly dependent on increased volume 
we believe that we can achieve improved gross margins on our kerastick during due to the anticipated increased volumes from continued growth 
blu u margins for the year ended december  were  versus for the year ended december  the decrease in gross margin is a result of an increase in our direct blu u product costs  offset in part by an increase in our average selling price per unit 
our short term strategy is to at a minimum break even on device sales in an effort to drive kerastick sales volumes 
non pdt drug product margins reflect the gross margin generated by the products acquired as part of our merger with sirius 
total margin for the year ended december  was compared with for the year ended december  during  non pdt product margins were negatively impacted by our discontinuance of sales of nicomide as a prescription product 
research and development costs research and development costs for were  as compared to  in the increase in compared to was due primarily to increased spending on our phase iib clinical trial on acne and a million prescription drug user fee act pdufa charge related to our approved ak indication 
in october  we announced the results from our phase iib clinical trial to compare the safety and efficacy of pdt using dusa s blu u brand light plus vehicle containing levulan aminolevulinic acid hcl to that of pdt using the blu u plus vehicle without levulan the control group in patients with moderate to severe facial acne vulgaris 
while both groups showed a statistically significant reduction in lesions from baseline  the results did not demonstrate statistically significant difference between the control and levulan pdt groups 
therefore  dusa will not pursue further clinical development of levulan pdt with blu u for moderate to severe acne 
however  we do expect to continue to support investigator initiated studies in moderate to severe acne with levulan and various light sources 
we intend to file a k application with the fda for an expansion of our blu u label to include severe acne and we have filed a patent application to cover an invention arising from the study 
we are planning to initiate a proof of concept clinical trial  which we expect will include up to patients  at up to ten clinical sites across the united states  for the treatment of actinic keratoses and chemoprevention of non melanoma skin cancers in immunosuppressed solid organ transplant recipients  or sotr  who have demonstrated that they are at risk of developing multiple squamous cell carcinomas

we expect marketing and sales costs for to be relatively flat in comparison to  and to decrease as a percentage of revenues 
general and administrative costs general and administrative costs for the year ended december  were  as compared to  for the year ended december  the decrease is mainly attributable to a decrease in legal expenses  which were incurred in due to the river s edge litigation  offset in part by increased compensation costs  which include the severance and stock compensation costs related to the departure of an officer during the year see note

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rates our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment portfolio 
we do not use derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio 
our investment policy specifies credit quality standards for our investments and limits the amount of credit exposure to any single issue  issuer or type of investment 
our investments consist of united states government securities and high grade corporate bonds 
all investments are carried at market value  which approximates cost 
in response to the instability in the global financial markets  we have regularly reviewed our marketable securities holdings  and have reduced or avoided investing in securities deemed to have increased risk 
as of december   the weighted average rate of return on our investments was 
if market interest rates were to increase immediately and uniformly by basis points from levels as of december   the fair market value of the portfolio would decline by  declines in interest rates could  over time  reduce our interest income 
derivative financial instruments the warrants that we issued on october  in connection with the private placement of our common stock were determined to be derivative financial instruments and accounted for as a liability 
these warrants are revalued on a quarterly basis with the change in value reflected in our earnings 
we value these warrants using various assumptions  including the company s stock price as of the end of each reporting period  the historical volatility of the company s stock price  and risk free interest rates commensurate with the remaining contractual term of the warrants 
changes in the company s stock price or in interest rates would result in a change in the value of the warrants
