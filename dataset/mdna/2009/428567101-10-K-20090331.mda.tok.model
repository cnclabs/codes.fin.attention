item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
overview hibbett sports  inc operates sporting goods stores in small to mid sized markets  predominantly in the southeast  southwest  mid atlantic and lower midwest regions of the united states 
our stores offer a broad assortment of quality athletic equipment  footwear and apparel with a high level of customer service 
as of january   we operated a total of retail stores composed of hibbett sports stores  sports additions athletic shoe stores and sports co 
superstores in states 
our primary retail format and growth vehicle is hibbett sports  a  square foot store located primarily in strip centers which are usually influenced by a wal mart store or in enclosed malls 
over the last several years  we have concentrated and expect to continue our store base growth in strip centers versus enclosed malls 
we believe hibbett sports stores are typically the primary sporting goods retailers in their markets due to the extensive selection of quality branded merchandise and a high level of customer service 
we do not expect that the average size of our stores opening in fiscal will vary significantly from the average size of stores opened in fiscal the deteriorating global economic conditions experienced in fiscal had an adverse effect on us 
we experienced a slight decline in net income in fiscal and an overall decline in net sales of equipment and licensed apparel 
the impact of these decreases was offset by net sales increases in footwear and accessories and our continued successful implementation of our growth strategy 
as a result  our gross profit increased in fiscal compared to fiscal we historically have increases in comparable store net sales in the low to mid single digit range 
we plan to increase total company wide square footage by approximately in fiscal  which is less than our increases over the last several years of between and 
we believe total sales percentage growth will be low to mid single digits in fiscal over the past several years  we have increased our product margin due to improved vendor discounts  fewer retail reductions and increased efficiencies in logistics 
we have also experienced favorable leveraging of store occupancy costs 
we expect a slight improvement in product margin rate in fiscal attributable primarily to increased efficiencies from our previous investment in systems 
although the macroeconomic environment will provide many challenges in the short term  our management believes that our business fundamentals remain strong and that we are well positioned for the future 
we are a leader in the markets in which we compete and we will continue to benefit from our comparatively low operating costs compared to the costs of our competitors 
we intend to manage our costs and inventories prudently as dictated by the current economic environment 
although at a slower pace than in prior years  we intend to continue to invest in initiatives to prepare for long term growth 
our management expects that the unfavorable global economic conditions experienced in the second half of fiscal will continue 
the economy is expected to have a negative impact on customer discretionary spending  which may negatively impact our net sales in fiscal due to our increased net sales  we have historically leveraged our store operating  selling and administrative expenses 
based on projected net sales  we expect operating  selling and administrative rates to increase somewhat in fiscal  primarily due to lower than normal historical sales growth and increases in the statutory minimum wage 
we also expect to continue to generate sufficient cash to enable us to expand and remodel our store base and to provide capital expenditures for both distribution center and technology upgrade projects 
hibbett maintains a merchandise management system that allows us to identify and monitor trends 
however  this system does not produce us generally accepted accounting principle gaap financial information by product category 
therefore  it is impracticable to provide gaap net sales by product category

fiscal compared to fiscal net sales 
net sales increased million  or  to million for the weeks ended january   from million for the weeks ended february  we attribute this increase to the following factors we opened hibbett sports stores while closing hibbett sports stores for net stores opened of stores in the weeks ended january  new stores and stores not in the comparable store net sales calculation accounted for million of the increase in net sales 
store openings and closings are reported net of relocations 
we experienced a increase in comparable store net sales for the weeks ended january  compared to the weeks ended february  higher comparable store net sales contributed million to the increase in net sales 
although we saw a decrease in store traffic  items per sales transaction improved by 
the slight increase in comparable store net sales was primarily attributable to an increase in the number of items per transaction and improved efficiencies in systems that enhanced our ability to offer the right product in the right store 
we also believe that the close proximity of our stores  coupled with branded merchandise selection and the higher average fuel costs for most of the year  encouraged the customer in our smaller markets to shop closer to home 
we experienced the following trends in fiscal children s footwear performed well  while women s footwear weakened 
men s marquee product performed well 
the decline in the urban apparel business was offset by increases in mixed martial arts apparel and equipment 
our strip center stores outperformed our enclosed mall stores 
comparable store net sales data for the period reflects sales for our traditional format hibbett sports and sports additions stores open throughout the period and the corresponding period of the prior fiscal year 
if a store remodel or relocation results in the store being closed for a significant period of time  its sales are removed from the comparable store base until it has been open a full months 
during the weeks ended january   stores were included in the comparable store net sales comparison 
our four sports co 
stores are not and have never been included in the comparable store net sales comparison because we have not opened a superstore since september nor do we plan to open additional superstores in the future 
gross profit 
cost of goods sold includes the cost of inventory  occupancy costs for stores and occupancy and operating costs for the distribution center 
gross profit was million  or of net sales  in the weeks ended january   compared with million  or of net sales  in the week period of the prior fiscal year 
we attribute this increase in gross profit to improvement in shrinkage and markdowns 
store occupancy experienced its largest decrease in rent expense due to favorable lease terms resulting from co tenancy violations and from renegotiating certain leases  while utility expenses increased as a percent to net sales 
distribution expenses experienced decreases in data processing costs while fuel costs increased 
store operating  selling and administrative expenses 
store operating  selling and administrative expenses were million  or of net sales  for the weeks ended january   compared with million  or of net sales  for the weeks ended february  expenses contributing to this increase included salary and benefit costs in our stores increased by basis points resulting primarily from increased incentive sales pay and increases in the minimum wage 
these expenses increased by basis points at the administrative level primarily as the result of increased bonus accruals 
legal fees decreased by basis points due to the settlement of employment litigation early in the year 
inventory counting expenses decreased by basis points as the result of taking fewer second store inventories compared to a year ago 
data processing costs decreased by basis points as we passed the anniversary of our implementation of our new merchandising system 
freight and shipping expenses increased overall by basis points  but have been decreasing with lower fuel costs in the last half of our fiscal year 
stock based compensation accounted for a decrease of basis points primarily due to lower stock prices in fiscal compared to fiscal depreciation and amortization 
depreciation and amortization as a percentage of net sales was in the weeks ended january   and in the weeks ended february  the average lease term of new store leases added in fiscal compared to those added in fiscal decreased in lease terms to years compared to years  respectively 
we attribute the slight increase in depreciation expense as a percent to net sales primarily due to a change in estimate of the economic useful life of leasehold improvements in certain underperforming stores 
provision for income taxes 
provision for income taxes as a percentage of net sales was in the weeks ended january   compared to for the weeks ended february  the combined federal  state and local effective income tax rate as a percentage of pre tax income was for fiscal and for fiscal fiscal compared to fiscal net sales 
net sales increased million  or  to million for the weeks ended february   from million for the weeks ended february  we attribute this slight increase to the following factors we opened hibbett sports and sports additions stores while closing hibbett sports stores for net stores opened of stores in the weeks ended february  new stores and stores not in the comparable store net sales calculation accounted for million of the increase in net sales 
store openings and closings are reported net of relocations 
we experienced a decrease in comparable store net sales for the weeks ended february  compared to the weeks ended january  primarily as the result of a decrease in store traffic resulting from a difficult economic environment in our industry 
net sales increased for the weeks ended february  compared to the weeks ended january  net sales from the rd week of fiscal accounted for approximately million or approximately 
we believe the decrease in comparable store net sales is attributable to overall economic pressures on our consumers resulting from the housing slump  rising fuel prices and anxiety over the economy in general 
additionally  our results were impacted by a weakening in our urban markets as we believe those fashion dollars historically used for high priced athletic shoes and fashion items shifted to high priced electronics 
we experienced the following trends in fiscal we experienced an overall decline in footwear and equipment sales 
pro licensed apparel continued its slow down  especially in nba licensed product 
we saw a negative shift in our urban fashion apparel and footwear 
comparable store net sales data for the period reflects sales for our traditional format hibbett sports and sports additions stores open throughout the period and the corresponding period of the prior fiscal year 
if a store remodel or relocation results in the store being closed for a significant period of time  its sales are removed from the comparable store base until it has been open a full months

our four sports co 
stores are not and have never been included in the comparable store net sales comparison because we have not opened a superstore since september nor do we plan to open additional superstores in the future 
gross profit 
cost of goods sold includes the cost of inventory  occupancy costs for stores and occupancy and operating costs for the distribution center 
gross profit was million  or of net sales  in the weeks ended february   compared with million  or of net sales  in the week period of the prior fiscal year 
we attribute this decrease in gross profit to a slight decrease in product margins and the deleveraging of store occupancy costs and distribution expenses 
store occupancy experienced its largest increases in rent expense and utilities expenses as a percent to net sales 
distribution expenses were impacted primarily in data processing costs resulting from contract labor costs to support information technology upgrades and projects 
store operating  selling and administrative expenses 
store operating  selling and administrative expenses were million  or of net sales  for the weeks ended february   compared with million  or of net sales  for the weeks ended february  expenses contributing to this increase included salary and benefit costs in our stores increased by basis points while decreasing basis points at the administrative level 
store costs were impacted by the lower than expected sales growth and larger than normal fourth quarter store openings  while administrative salaries decreased as a result of lost bonuses 
net advertising expenses increased basis points due to the increased advertising efforts for new and low performing stores 
stock based compensation accounted for basis points 
the expense associated with the movement of certain grant dates into the first quarter as compared to a year ago was somewhat offset by a higher than normal forfeiture of awards resulting from employee turnover and loss of performance based awards 
depreciation and amortization 
depreciation and amortization as a percentage of net sales was in the weeks ended february   and in the weeks ended february  the average lease term of new store leases added in fiscal compared to those added in fiscal decreased in lease terms to years compared to years  respectively 
we attribute the increase in depreciation expense as a percent to net sales to the shorter lease terms  as well as  the information systems placed in service as of february  provision for income taxes 
provision for income taxes as a percentage of net sales was in the weeks ended february   compared to for the weeks ended february  the combined federal  state and local effective income tax rate as a percentage of pre tax income was for fiscal and for fiscal the decrease in rate over last year is primarily the result of the favorable resolution of certain state tax issues  lower than historical stock option exercise behavior  and higher than historical equity forfeitures offset somewhat by the permanent differences related to incentive stock options 
liquidity and capital resources our capital requirements relate primarily to new store openings  stock repurchases and working capital requirements 
our working capital requirements are somewhat seasonal in nature and typically reach their peak near the end of the third and the beginning of the fourth quarters of our fiscal year 
historically  we have funded our cash requirements primarily through our cash flow from operations and occasionally from borrowings under our revolving credit facilities 
our consolidated statements of cash flows are summarized as follows in thousands fiscal year ended january  february  february  net cash provided by operating activities net cash used in investing activities net cash used in financing activities net increase decrease in cash and cash equivalents operating activities 
cash flow from operations is seasonal in our business 
typically  we use cash flow from operations to increase inventory in advance of peak selling seasons  such as pre christmas and back to school 
inventory levels are reduced in connection with higher sales during the peak selling seasons and this inventory reduction  combined with proportionately higher net income  typically produces a positive cash flow 
in recent periods  we have experienced a trend of increasing free rent provisions in lieu of cash construction allowances in our leases 
we believe this is primarily the result of the tightening of commercial credit on our landlords 
because of this  the non cash portion of landlord allowances has also experienced increases 
net cash provided by operating activities was million for the weeks ended january  compared with net cash provided by operating activities of million and million in the weeks ended february  and the weeks ended february   respectively 
inventory levels have continued to increase year over year as the number of stores have increased  although the inventory per store is trending slightly down to flat 
the increase in inventory used cash of million  million and million during fiscal   and  respectively  while the accounts payable increase provided cash of million and million during fiscal and fiscal  respectively  as we managed cash while protecting vendor discounts 
during fiscal  the accounts payable decrease used cash of million 
net income provided cash of million  million and million during fiscal  and  respectively 
also offsetting uses of cash were non cash charges  including depreciation and amortization expense of million  million and million during fiscal  fiscal and fiscal  respectively  and stock based compensation expense of million  million and million during fiscal  and  respectively 
investing activities 
cash used in investing activities in the fiscal periods ended january   february  and february  totaled million  million and million  respectively 
net purchases of investments were million and million during fiscal and fiscal  respectively  compared to net redemptions of short term investments of million during fiscal gross capital expenditures used million  million and million during fiscal  fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
we use cash in investing activities to build new stores and remodel or relocate existing stores 
furthermore  net cash used in investing activities includes purchases of information technology assets and expenditures for our distribution facility and corporate headquarters 
we opened new stores and relocated and or remodeled existing stores during the weeks ended january  we opened new stores and relocated and or remodeled existing stores during the weeks ended february  we opened new stores and relocated and or remodeled existing stores during the weeks ended february we estimate the cash outlay for capital expenditures in the fiscal year ended january  will be approximately million  which relates to the opening of approximately new stores  remodeling of selected existing stores  information system upgrades and various improvements at our headquarters and distribution center 
of the total budgeted dollars for capital expenditures for fiscal  we anticipate that approximately will be related to the opening of new stores and remodeling and or relocating existing stores 
approximately will be related to information systems with the remaining related primarily to office expansion  distribution center improvement and security equipment for our stores 
as of january   we had an approximate million outlay remaining on enhancements to our merchandising system relating to inventory planning 
we anticipate these upgrades will be implemented in the first half of fiscal and believe these enhancements will enable us to analyze and generally improve sales across all markets and merchandise by allowing us to better analyze inventory at the store level 
financing activities 
net cash used in financing activities was million in the weeks ended january  compared to million and million in the weeks ended february  and the weeks ended february   respectively 
the cash fluctuation as compared to prior fiscal years was primarily the result of the repurchase of our common stock 
we expended million  million and million on repurchases of our common stock during fiscal  fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
financing activities also consisted of proceeds from transactions in our common stock and the excess tax benefit from the exercise of incentive stock options 
as stock options are exercised  we will continue to receive proceeds and expect a tax deduction  however  the amounts and timing cannot be predicted 
at january   we had two unsecured revolving credit facilities that allow borrowings up to million and million  respectively  and which renew in august and december  respectively 
the facilities do not require a commitment or agency fee nor are there any covenant restrictions 
we plan to renew these facilities as they expire and do not anticipate any problems in doing so  however  no assurance can be given that we will be granted a renewal or terms which are acceptable to us 
at february   we had a revolving credit facility that allowed borrowings up to million and which renewed in august the facility did not require a commitment or agency fee and there were no covenant restrictions associated with the facility 
at february   we had a revolving credit facility that allowed borrowings up to million and renewed annually in november 
the facility did not require a commitment or agency fee and there were no covenant restrictions associated with the facility 
as of january   february  and february   we had no debt outstanding under any of our facilities 
based on our current operating and store opening plans and plans for the repurchase of our common stock  we believe we can fund our cash needs for the foreseeable future through cash generated from operations and  if necessary  through periodic future borrowings against our credit facilities 
the following table lists the aggregate maturities of various classes of obligations and expiration amounts of various classes of commitments related to hibbett sports  inc at january  payment due by period in thousands contractual obligations total less than year years years more than years long term debt obligations capital lease obligations operating lease obligations purchase obligations other long term liabilities total see part ii  item  consolidated financial statement note debt
