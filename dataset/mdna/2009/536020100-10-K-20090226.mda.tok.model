table of contents item a 
risk factors our business has many risks 
factors that could materially adversely affect our business  financial position  operating results or liquidity and the trading price of our units are described below 
this information should be considered carefully  together with other information in this report and other reports and materials we file with the sec 
we may not have sufficient cash flow from operations to pay the quarterly distribution at the current distribution level and future distributions to our unitholders may fluctuate from quarter to quarter 
we may not have sufficient cash flow from operations each quarter to pay the quarterly distribution at the current distribution level 
under the terms of our limited liability company agreement  the amount of cash otherwise available for distribution will be reduced by our operating expenses and any cash reserve amounts that our board of directors establishes to provide for future operations  future capital expenditures  future debt service requirements and future cash distributions to our unitholders 
the amount of cash we can distribute on our units principally depends upon the amount of cash we generate from our operations  which will fluctuate from quarter to quarter based on  among other things produced volumes of oil  gas and ngl  prices at which oil  gas and ngl production is sold  level of our operating costs  payment of interest  which depends on the amount of our indebtedness and the interest payable thereon  and level of our capital expenditures 
in addition  the actual amount of cash we will have available for distribution will depend on other factors  some of which are beyond our control  including availability of borrowings under our credit facility to pay distributions  the costs of acquisitions  if any  fluctuations in our working capital needs  timing and collectibility of receivables  restrictions on distributions contained in our credit facility  prevailing economic conditions  and the amount of cash reserves established by our board of directors for the proper conduct of our business 
as a result of these factors  the amount of cash we distribute to our unitholders in any quarter may fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter and may be significantly less than the current distribution level 
we actively seek to acquire oil and gas properties 
acquisitions involve potential risks that could adversely impact our future growth and our ability to increase or pay distributions 
any acquisition involves potential risks  including  among other things the risk that reserves expected to support the acquired assets may not be of the anticipated magnitude or may not be developed as anticipated  the risk of title defects discovered after closing  inaccurate assumptions about revenues and costs  including synergies  significant increases in our indebtedness and working capital requirements  an inability to transition and integrate successfully or timely the businesses we acquire  the cost of transition and integration of data systems and processes  the potential environmental problems and costs  the assumption of unknown liabilities  limitations on rights to indemnity from the seller  the diversion of management s attention from other business concerns  increased demands on existing personnel and on our corporate structure  
table of contents customer or key employee losses of the acquired businesses  and the failure to realize expected growth or profitability 
the scope and cost of these risks may ultimately be materially greater than estimated at the time of the acquisition 
further  our future acquisition costs may be higher than those we have achieved historically 
any of these factors could adversely impact our future growth and our ability to increase or pay distributions 
if we do not make future acquisitions on economically acceptable terms  then our growth and ability to increase distributions will be limited 
our ability to grow and to increase distributions to our unitholders is partially dependent on our ability to make acquisitions that result in an increase in available cash flow per unit 
we may be unable to make such acquisitions because we are unable to identify attractive acquisition candidates or negotiate acceptable purchase contracts with them  unable to obtain financing for these acquisitions on economically acceptable terms  or outbid by competitors 
in any such case  our future growth and ability to increase distributions will be limited 
furthermore  even if we do make acquisitions that we believe will increase available cash flow per unit  these acquisitions may nevertheless result in a decrease in available cash flow per unit 
we have significant indebtedness under our credit facility and senior notes 
our credit facility has substantial restrictions and financial covenants and we may have difficulty obtaining additional credit  which could adversely affect our operations and our ability to pay distributions to our unitholders 
we have significant indebtedness under our credit facility and senior notes 
as of january   we had an aggregate of approximately billion outstanding under our credit facility and senior notes with additional borrowing capacity of approximately million 
as a result of our indebtedness  we will use a portion of our cash flow to pay interest and principal when due  which will reduce the cash available to finance our operations and other business activities and could limit our flexibility in planning for or reacting to changes in our business and the industry in which we operate 
the credit facility restricts our ability to obtain additional financing  make investments  lease equipment  sell assets and engage in business combinations 
we also are required to comply with certain financial covenants and ratios 
our ability to comply with these restrictions and covenants in the future is uncertain and will be affected by the levels of cash flow from our operations and events or circumstances beyond our control 
our failure to comply with any of the restrictions and covenants could result in an event of default  which  if it continues beyond any applicable cure periods  could cause all of our existing indebtedness to be immediately due and payable 
we depend on our credit facility for future capital needs 
we have drawn on our credit facility to fund or partially fund quarterly cash distribution payments  since we use operating cash flows for drilling and development of oil and gas properties and acquisitions and borrow as cash is needed 
absent such borrowing  we would have at times experienced a shortfall in cash available to pay our declared quarterly cash distribution amount 
if there is an event of default by us under our credit facility that continues beyond any applicable cure period  we would be unable to make borrowings to fund distributions 
availability under our credit facility is determined semi annually at the discretion of the lenders and is based in part on oil  gas and ngl prices 
significant declines in oil  gas or ngl prices may result in a decrease in our borrowing base 
the lenders can unilaterally adjust the borrowing base and the borrowings permitted to be outstanding under the credit facility 
any increase in the borrowing base requires the consent of all the lenders 
outstanding borrowings in excess of the borrowing base must be repaid immediately  or we must pledge other properties as additional collateral 
we do not currently have any substantial unpledged properties  and we may not have the financial resources in the future to make any mandatory principal prepayments required under the credit facility 
significant declines in our production or significant declines in realized oil  gas or ngl prices for prolonged periods and resulting decreases in our borrowing base may force us to reduce or suspend distributions to our unitholders 

table of contents our ability to access the capital and credit markets to raise capital on favorable terms will be affected by our debt level and by disruptions in the capital and credit markets  which could adversely affect our operations and our ability to pay distributions to our unitholders 
the cost of raising money in the debt and equity capital markets has increased substantially while the availability of funds from those markets generally has diminished significantly 
also  as a result of concerns about the stability of financial markets and the solvency of counterparties specifically  the cost of obtaining money from the credit markets generally has increased as some major financial institutions have consolidated and others may consolidate in the future  some lenders may increase interest rates  enact tighter lending standards  refuse to refinance existing debt at maturity on favorable terms or at all and may reduce or cease to provide funding to borrowers 
if we are unable to refinance our credit facility on terms that are as favorable as those in our existing credit facility  or at all  our ability to fund our operations and our ability to pay distributions could be affected 
our variable rate indebtedness subjects us to interest rate risk  which could cause our debt service obligations to increase significantly 
borrowings under our credit facility bear interest at variable rates and expose us to interest rate risk 
if interest rates increase  our debt service obligations on the variable rate indebtedness would increase even though the amount borrowed remained the same  and our net income and cash available for servicing our indebtedness would decrease 
increases in interest rates could adversely affect the demand for our units 
an increase in interest rates may cause a corresponding decline in demand for equity investments  in particular for yield based equity investments such as our units 
any such reduction in demand for our units resulting from other more attractive investment opportunities may cause the trading price of our units to decline 
our commodity derivative activities could result in financial losses or could reduce our income  which may adversely affect our ability to pay distributions to our unitholders 
to achieve more predictable cash flow and to reduce our exposure to adverse fluctuations in the prices of oil  gas and ngl  we enter into commodity derivative contracts for a significant portion of our production 
if we experience a sustained material interruption in our production or if we are unable to perform our drilling activity as planned  we might be forced to satisfy all or a portion of our derivative obligations without the benefit of the cash flow from our sale of the underlying physical commodity  resulting in a substantial reduction of our liquidity 
disruptions in the capital and credit markets as a result of the global financial crisis may adversely affect our derivative positions 
we cannot be assured that our counterparties will be able to perform under our derivative contracts 
if a counterparty fails to perform and the derivative arrangement is terminated  our cash flow  and ability to pay distributions could be impacted 
commodity prices are volatile  and a significant decline in commodity prices for a prolonged period would reduce our revenues  cash flow from operations and profitability  and we may have to lower our distribution or may not be able to pay distributions at all 
our revenue  profitability and cash flow depend upon the prices of and demand for oil  gas and ngl 
the oil  gas and ngl market is very volatile and a drop in prices can significantly affect our financial results and impede our growth 
changes in oil  gas and ngl prices have a significant impact on the value of our reserves and on our cash flow 
prices for these commodities may fluctuate widely in response to relatively minor changes in the supply of and demand for them  market uncertainty and a variety of additional factors that are beyond our control  such as the domestic and foreign supply of and demand for oil  gas and ngl  the price and level of foreign imports  the level of consumer product demand  weather conditions  
table of contents overall domestic and global economic conditions  political and economic conditions in oil and gas producing countries  including those in the middle east and south america  the ability of members of the organization of petroleum exporting countries to agree to and maintain price and production controls  the impact of the us dollar exchange rates on oil  gas and ngl prices  technological advances affecting energy consumption  domestic and foreign governmental regulations and taxation  the impact of energy conservation efforts  the proximity and capacity of pipelines and other transportation facilities  and the price and availability of alternative fuels 
in the past  the prices of oil  gas and ngl have been extremely volatile  and we expect this volatility to continue 
if commodity prices decline significantly for a prolonged period  our cash flow from operations will decline  and we may have to lower our distribution or may not be able to pay distributions at all 
future price declines or downward reserve revisions may result in a write down of our asset carrying values 
declines in oil  gas and ngl prices may result in our having to make substantial downward adjustments to our estimated proved reserves 
if this occurs  or if our estimates of development costs increase  production data factors change or drilling results deteriorate  accounting rules may require us to write down  as a non cash charge to earnings  the carrying value of our properties for impairments 
we are required to perform impairment tests on our assets periodically and whenever events or changes in circumstances warrant a review of our assets 
to the extent such tests indicate a reduction of the estimated useful life or estimated future cash flows of our assets  the carrying value may not be recoverable and therefore would require a write down 
we may incur impairment charges in the future  which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations in the period incurred and on our ability to borrow funds under our credit facility  which in turn may adversely affect our ability to make cash distributions to our unitholders 
unless we replace our reserves  our reserves and production will decline  which would adversely affect our cash flow from operations and our ability to make distributions to our unitholders 
producing oil  gas and ngl reservoirs are characterized by declining production rates that vary depending upon reservoir characteristics and other factors 
the overall rate of decline for our production will change if production from our existing wells declines in a different manner than we have estimated and can change when we drill additional wells  make acquisitions and under other circumstances 
thus  our future oil  gas and ngl reserves and production and  therefore  our cash flow and income  are highly dependent on our success in efficiently developing and exploiting our current reserves and economically finding or acquiring additional recoverable reserves 
we may not be able to develop  find or acquire additional reserves to replace our current and future production at acceptable costs  which would adversely affect our cash flow from operations and our ability to make distributions to our unitholders 
our estimated reserves are based on many assumptions that may prove to be inaccurate 
any material inaccuracies in these reserve estimates or underlying assumptions will materially affect the quantities and present value of our reserves 
no one can measure underground accumulations of oil  gas and ngl in an exact way 
reserve engineering requires subjective estimates of underground accumulations of oil  gas and ngl and assumptions concerning future oil  gas and ngl prices  production levels  and operating and development costs 
as a result  estimated quantities of proved reserves and projections of future production rates and the timing of development expenditures may prove to be inaccurate 
independent petroleum engineering firms prepare estimates of our proved reserves 
some of our reserve estimates are made without the benefit of a lengthy production history  which are less reliable than estimates based on a lengthy production history 
also  we make certain assumptions regarding future oil  gas and ngl prices  production levels  and operating and development costs that may prove incorrect 
any significant variance from these assumptions by actual figures could greatly affect our estimates of reserves  the economically recoverable quantities of oil  gas and ngl attributable to any particular group of properties  the classifications of reserves based 
table of contents on risk of recovery and estimates of the future net cash flows 
numerous changes over time to the assumptions on which our reserve estimates are based  as described above  often result in the actual quantities of oil  gas and ngl we ultimately recover being different from our reserve estimates 
the present value of future net cash flows from our proved reserves is not necessarily the same as the current market value of our estimated oil  gas and ngl reserves 
we base the estimated discounted future net cash flows from our proved reserves on prices and costs in effect on the day of estimate 
however  actual future net cash flows from our oil and gas properties also will be affected by factors such as actual prices we receive for oil  gas and ngl  the amount and timing of actual production  the timing and success of development activities  supply of and demand for oil  gas and ngl  and changes in governmental regulations or taxation 
in addition  the discount factor  required to be used pursuant to sfas when calculating discounted future net cash flows  may not be the most appropriate discount factor based on interest rates in effect from time to time and risks associated with us or the oil and gas industry in general 
our development operations require substantial capital expenditures  which will reduce our cash available for distribution 
we may be unable to obtain needed capital or financing on satisfactory terms  which could lead to a decline in our reserves 
the oil and gas industry is capital intensive 
we make and expect to continue to make substantial capital expenditures in our business for the development  production and acquisition of oil  gas and ngl reserves 
these expenditures will reduce our cash available for distribution 
we intend to finance our future capital expenditures with cash flow from operations and our financing arrangements 
our cash flow from operations and access to capital are subject to a number of variables  including our proved reserves  the level of oil  gas and ngl we are able to produce from existing wells  the prices at which we are able to sell our oil  gas and ngl  and our ability to acquire  locate and produce new reserves 
if our revenues or the borrowing base under our credit facility decrease as a result of lower oil  gas and ngl prices  operating difficulties  declines in reserves or for any other reason  we may have limited ability to obtain the capital necessary to sustain our operations at current levels 
our credit facility restricts our ability to obtain new financing 
if additional capital is needed  we may not be able to obtain debt or equity financing on terms favorable to us  or at all 
if cash generated by operations or available under our credit facility is not sufficient to meet our capital requirements  the failure to obtain additional financing could result in a curtailment of our development operations  which in turn could lead to a possible decline in our reserves 
we may decide not to drill some of the prospects we have identified  and locations that we decide to drill may not yield oil  gas and ngl in commercially viable quantities 
our prospective drilling locations are in various stages of evaluation  ranging from a prospect that is ready to drill to a prospect that will require additional geological and engineering analysis 
based on a variety of factors  including future oil  gas and ngl prices  the generation of additional seismic or geological information  the availability of drilling rigs and other factors  we may decide not to drill one or more of these prospects 
as a result  we may not be able to increase or maintain our reserves or production  which in turn could have an adverse effect on our business  financial position or results of operations 
the cost of drilling  completing and operating a well is often uncertain  and cost factors can adversely affect the economics of a well 
our efforts will be uneconomic if we drill dry holes or wells that are productive but do not produce enough oil  gas and ngl to be commercially viable after drilling  operating and other costs 
if we drill 
table of contents future wells that we identify as dry holes  our drilling success rate would decline  which could have an adverse effect on our business  financial position or results of operations 
our business depends on gathering and transportation facilities 
any limitation in the availability of those facilities would interfere with our ability to market the oil  gas and ngl we produce  and could reduce our cash available for distribution and adversely impact expected increases in oil  gas and ngl production from our drilling program 
the marketability of our oil  gas and ngl production depends in part on the availability  proximity and capacity of gathering and pipeline systems 
the amount of oil  gas and ngl that can be produced and sold is subject to limitation in certain circumstances  such as pipeline interruptions due to scheduled and unscheduled maintenance  excessive pressure  physical damage to the gathering or transportation system  or lack of contracted capacity on such systems 
the curtailments arising from these and similar circumstances may last from a few days to several months 
in many cases  we are provided only with limited  if any  notice as to when these circumstances will arise and their duration 
in addition  some of our wells are drilled in locations that are not serviced by gathering and transportation pipelines  or the gathering and transportation pipelines in the area may not have sufficient capacity to transport additional production 
as a result  we may not be able to sell the oil  gas and ngl production from these wells until the necessary gathering and transportation systems are constructed 
any significant curtailment in gathering system or pipeline capacity  or significant delay in the construction of necessary gathering and transportation facilities  would interfere with our ability to market the oil  gas and ngl we produce  and could reduce our cash available for distribution and adversely impact expected increases in oil and gas production from our drilling program 
we depend on certain key customers for sales of our oil  gas and ngl 
to the extent these and other customers reduce the volumes they purchase from us or delay payment  our revenues and cash available for distribution could decline 
further  a general increase in non payment could have an adverse impact on our financial position and results of operations 
for the year ended december   dcp midstream partners  lp  conocophillips and enbridge energy accounted for approximately  and  respectively  of our total volumes from continuing operations  or in the aggregate 
for the year ended december   dcp midstream partners  lp and conocophillips accounted for approximately and  respectively  of our total volumes from continuing operations  or in the aggregate 
to the extent these and other customers reduce the volumes of oil  gas or ngl that they purchase from us  our revenues and cash available for distribution could decline 
many of our leases are in areas that have been partially depleted or drained by offset wells 
our key project areas are located in some of the most active drilling areas of the producing basins in the united states 
as a result  many of our leases are in areas that have already been partially depleted or drained by earlier offset drilling 
this may inhibit our ability to find economically recoverable quantities of reserves in these areas 
our identified drilling location inventories are scheduled out over several years  making them susceptible to uncertainties that could materially alter the occurrence or timing of their drilling  resulting in temporarily lower cash from operations  which may impact our ability to pay distributions 
our management has specifically identified and scheduled drilling locations as an estimation of our future multi year drilling activities on our existing acreage 
as of december   we had identified  drilling locations  of which  were proved undeveloped locations and  were other locations 
these identified drilling locations represent a significant part of our growth strategy 
our ability to drill and develop these locations depends on a number of factors  including the availability of capital  seasonal conditions  regulatory approvals  oil  gas and ngl prices  costs and drilling results 
in addition  degolyer and macnaughton has not estimated proved reserves for the  other drilling locations we have identified and scheduled for drilling  and therefore there may be greater uncertainty with respect to the success of drilling wells at these drilling locations 
our final determination on whether to drill any of these drilling locations will be dependent upon the factors described above as well as  to some degree  the results of our drilling activities with respect to our proved drilling locations 
because of these uncertainties  we do not know if the numerous drilling locations we have identified will be drilled within our expected timeframe or will ever be drilled or if we will be able to produce oil  gas and ngl from these or any other 
table of contents potential drilling locations 
as such  our actual drilling activities may materially differ from those presently identified  which could adversely affect our business 
drilling for and producing oil  gas and ngl are high risk activities with many uncertainties that could adversely affect our financial position or results of operations and  as a result  our ability to pay distributions to our unitholders 
our drilling activities are subject to many risks  including the risk that we will not discover commercially productive reservoirs 
drilling for oil  gas and ngl can be uneconomic  not only from dry holes  but also from productive wells that do not produce sufficient revenues to be commercially viable 
in addition  our drilling and producing operations may be curtailed  delayed or canceled as a result of other factors  including the high cost  shortages or delivery delays of equipment and services  unexpected operational events  adverse weather conditions  facility or equipment malfunctions  title problems  pipeline ruptures or spills  compliance with environmental and other governmental requirements  unusual or unexpected geological formations  loss of drilling fluid circulation  formations with abnormal pressures  fires  blowouts  craterings and explosions  and uncontrollable flows of oil  gas and ngl or well fluids 
any of these events can cause increased costs or restrict our ability to drill the wells and conduct the operations which we currently have planned 
any delay in the drilling program or significant increase in costs could impact our ability to generate sufficient cash flow to pay quarterly distributions to our unitholders at the current distribution level 
increased costs could include losses from personal injury or loss of life  damage to or destruction of property  natural resources and equipment  pollution  environmental contamination  loss of wells and regulatory penalties 
we ordinarily maintain insurance against certain losses and liabilities arising from our operations 
however  it is impossible to insure against all operational risks in the course of our business 
additionally  we may elect not to obtain insurance if we believe that the cost of available insurance is excessive relative to the perceived risks presented 
losses could therefore occur for uninsurable or uninsured risks or in amounts in excess of existing insurance coverage 
the occurrence of an event that is not fully covered by insurance could have a material adverse impact on our business activities  financial position and results of operations 
because we handle oil  gas and ngl and other hydrocarbons  we may incur significant costs and liabilities in the future resulting from a failure to comply with new or existing environmental regulations or an accidental release of hazardous substances into the environment 
the operations of our wells  gathering systems  turbines  pipelines and other facilities are subject to stringent and complex federal  state and local environmental laws and regulations 
these include  for example the federal clean air act and comparable state laws and regulations that impose obligations related to air emissions  the federal clean water act and comparable state laws and regulations that impose obligations related to discharges of pollutants into regulated bodies of water  the federal resource conservation and recovery act rcra  and comparable state laws that impose requirements for the handling and disposal of waste from our facilities  and the comprehensive environmental response  compensation and liability act of cercla  also known as superfund  and comparable state laws that regulate the cleanup of hazardous substances that may have been released at properties currently or previously owned or operated by us or at locations to which we have sent waste for disposal 

table of contents failure to comply with these laws and regulations may trigger a variety of administrative  civil and criminal enforcement measures  including the assessment of monetary penalties  the imposition of remedial requirements  and the issuance of orders enjoining future operations 
certain environmental statutes  including the rcra  cercla and analogous state laws and regulations  impose strict  joint and several liability for costs required to clean up and restore sites where hazardous substances have been disposed of or otherwise released 
moreover  it is not uncommon for neighboring landowners and other third parties to file claims for personal injury and property damage allegedly caused by the release of hazardous substances or other waste products into the environment 
there is an inherent risk that we may incur environmental costs and liabilities due to the nature of our business and the substances we handle 
for example  an accidental release from one of our wells or gathering pipelines could subject us to substantial liabilities arising from environmental cleanup and restoration costs  claims made by neighboring landowners and other third parties for personal injury and property damage  and fines or penalties for related violations of environmental laws or regulations 
moreover  the possibility exists that stricter laws  regulations or enforcement policies could significantly increase our compliance costs and the cost of any remediation that may become necessary 
we may not be able to recover these costs from insurance 
for a more detailed discussion of environmental and regulatory matters impacting our business  see part i 
item business environmental matters and regulation 
we are subject to complex federal  state  local and other laws and regulations that could adversely affect the cost  manner or feasibility of doing business 
our operations are regulated extensively at the federal  state and local levels 
environmental and other governmental laws and regulations have increased the costs to plan  design  drill  install  operate and abandon oil and gas wells 
under these laws and regulations  we could also be liable for personal injuries  property damage and other damages 
failure to comply with these laws and regulations may result in the suspension or termination of our operations and subject us to administrative  civil and criminal penalties 
moreover  public interest in environmental protection has increased in recent years  and environmental organizations have opposed  with some success  certain drilling projects 
part of the regulatory environment in which we operate includes  in some cases  legal requirements for obtaining environmental assessments  environmental impact studies and or plans of development before commencing drilling and production activities 
in addition  our activities are subject to the regulations regarding conservation practices and protection of correlative rights 
these regulations affect our operations and limit the quantity of oil  gas and ngl we may produce and sell 
a major risk inherent in our drilling plans is the need to obtain drilling permits from state and local authorities 
delays in obtaining regulatory approvals or drilling permits  the failure to obtain a drilling permit for a well or the receipt of a permit with unreasonable conditions or costs could have a material adverse effect on our ability to develop our properties 
additionally  the regulatory environment could change in ways that might substantially increase the financial and managerial costs of compliance with these laws and regulations and  consequently  adversely affect our ability to pay distributions to our unitholders 
for a description of the laws and regulations that affect us  see part i 
item business environmental matters and regulation 
our management may have conflicts of interest with the unitholders 
our limited liability company agreement limits the remedies available to our unitholders in the event unitholders have a claim relating to conflicts of interest 
conflicts of interest may arise between our management on one hand  and the company and our unitholders on the other hand  related to the divergent interests of our management 
situations in which the interests of our management may differ from interests of our non affiliated unitholders include  among others  the following situations our limited liability company agreement gives our board of directors broad discretion in establishing cash reserves for the proper conduct of our business  which will affect the amount of cash available for distribution 
for example  our management will use its reasonable discretion to establish and maintain cash reserves sufficient to fund our drilling program  our management team  subject to oversight from our board of directors  determines the timing and extent of our drilling program and related capital expenditures  asset purchases and sales  borrowings  issuances of 
table of contents additional membership interests and reserve adjustments  all of which will affect the amount of cash that we distribute to our unitholders  and affiliates of our directors are not prohibited from investing or engaging in other businesses or activities that compete with the company 
we do not have the same flexibility as other types of organizations to accumulate cash and equity to protect against illiquidity in the future 
unlike a corporation  our limited liability company agreement requires us to make quarterly distributions to our unitholders of all available cash reduced by any amounts of reserves for commitments and contingencies  including capital and operating costs and debt service requirements 
the value of our units may decrease in direct correlation with decreases in the amount we distribute per unit 
accordingly  if we experience a liquidity problem in the future  we may have difficulty issuing more equity to recapitalize 
our tax treatment depends on our status as a partnership for federal income tax purposes  as well as our not being subject to a material amount of entity level taxation by individual states 
if the irs were to treat us as a corporation for federal income tax purposes or we were to become subject to entity level taxation for state tax purposes  taxes paid  if any  would reduce the amount of cash available for distribution 
the anticipated after tax economic benefit of an investment in our units depends largely on our being treated as a partnership for federal income tax purposes 
we have not requested  and do not plan to request  a ruling from the irs on this or any other tax matter that affects us 
if we were treated as a corporation for federal income tax purposes  we would pay federal income tax on our taxable income at the corporate tax rates  currently at a maximum rate of  and would likely pay state income tax at varying rates 
distributions would generally be taxed again as corporate distributions  and no income  gain  loss  deduction or credit would flow through to unitholders 
because a tax may be imposed on us as a corporation  our cash available for distribution to our unitholders could be reduced 
therefore  treatment of us as a corporation would result in a material reduction in the anticipated cash flow and after tax return to our unitholders  likely causing a substantial reduction in the value of our units 
current law or our business may change so as to cause us to be treated as a corporation for federal income tax purposes or otherwise subject us to entity level taxation 
in addition  because of widespread state budget deficits and other reasons  several states are evaluating ways to subject partnerships and limited liability companies to entity level taxation through the imposition of state income  franchise or other forms of taxation 
for example  we are required to pay texas franchise tax at a maximum effective rate of of our total revenue apportioned to texas in the prior year 
imposition of a tax on us by any other state would reduce the amount of cash available for distribution to our unitholders 
unitholders may be subject to taxable gains upon dispositions of properties 
we may dispose of properties in transactions that result in gains that will be allocated to you  and such gains may be either ordinary gains or capital gains to you 
even where we dispose of properties that are capital assets  what otherwise would be capital gains to you may be recharacterized as ordinary gains in order to recapture ordinary deductions that were previously allocated to you related to the same properties 
in addition  such an allocation of ordinary or capital gains may increase your taxable income  and you may be required to pay federal income taxes and state and local income taxes  even if we have not made a cash distribution to you subsequent to our disposal of the properties 
your allocable share of the taxable gains also may be greater than your interest in our profits 
if you contributed property in exchange for our units  your capital account would have been credited with the fair market value of the property at the time your book basis  which may have exceeded your tax basis of property 
this could also be the case if you held our units at a time when we issued additional units to other unitholders resulting in a revaluation of our assets 
gains are required to be allocated to you in order to eliminate this book tax disparity 

table of contents our unitholders may have more complex tax reporting and may be required to pay taxes on income even if they do not receive any cash distributions from us 
our unitholders are required to pay federal income taxes and  in some cases  state and local income taxes on their share of our taxable income  whether or not they receive cash distributions from us 
our unitholders may not receive cash distributions from us equal to their share of our taxable income or even equal to the actual tax liability that results from their share of our taxable income 
furthermore  distributions to unitholders in excess of the total net taxable income they were allocated  decreases their tax basis  which will become ordinary taxable income to them if the unit is later sold at a price greater than their tax basis  even if the price received is less than their original cost 
in addition to federal income taxes  our unitholders will likely be subject to other taxes  including state and local taxes  unincorporated business taxes and estate  inheritance or intangible taxes that are imposed by the various jurisdictions in which we do business or own property now or in the future  even if they do not reside in any of those jurisdictions 
our unitholders will likely be required to file foreign  state and local income tax returns and pay state and local income taxes in some or all of these jurisdictions 
further  our unitholders may be subject to penalties for failure to comply with those requirements 
in  we have done business and owned assets in west virginia  virginia  pennsylvania  new york  virginia  california  oklahoma  kansas  new mexico  illinois  indiana  arkansas  colorado  kentucky  louisiana  mississippi  montana  north dakota  south dakota and texas 
as we make acquisitions or expand our business  we may do business or own assets in other states in the future 
it is the responsibility of each unitholder to file all united states federal  state and local tax returns that may be required of such unitholder
