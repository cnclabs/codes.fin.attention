item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview as of march   we own  license or franchise locations in states  the district of columbia and foreign countries  of which are company owned and operate under the names california pizza kitchen  california pizza kitchen asap  and la food show and the remaining of which operate under franchise or license arrangements 
during our years of operating history  we believe we have developed strong brand awareness and demonstrated the appeal of our concept in a wide variety of geographic areas 
our concept was  and still remains  to take our customers favorite food cravings and put them on a pizza to figuratively put the world on a pizza 
we opened our first casual dining restaurant in in beverly hills  california and grew steadily to restaurants by early our concept  with its signature line of innovative  premium pizzas  open flame ovens in exhibition style kitchens and excellent guest service  attracted pepsico  which bought a controlling interest in our company in may during the approximate five year period when pepsico was our controlling stockholder  we opened restaurants  of which were subsequently closed 
we experimented with different locations and different restaurant sizes  ranging from  square feet to more than  square feet 
our rapid expansion strained our infrastructure  resulted in a variety of management and operational changes  diverted our attention from the execution of our concept and led to disappointing operating results and financial performance  including a decline in comparable restaurant sales in at the end of  pepsico concluded that it would sell or otherwise divest all of its restaurant businesses  including california pizza kitchen 
in september  we consummated a series of transactions to effect a merger and leveraged recapitalization through which an investor group led by bruckmann  rosser  sherrill co  lp acquired pepsico s interest in our company 
in  we instituted an accelerated growth plan  focusing largely on further penetrating our existing markets 
between january and december  we opened company owned  full service restaurants and three cpk asap restaurants 
following rapid expansion  the board of directors asked richard rosenfield and larry flax  co founders and co chairmen of the board  to reassume the responsibilities of co ceos 
in connection with this management change  we reviewed our restaurant portfolio  as well as our operations and growth strategy  and decided to slow down our new restaurant opening schedule  emphasizing quality and profitability beginning in fiscal we introduced our new prototype full service restaurant in fiscal  which was larger than our former prototype 
the new prototype is approximately  square feet  has approximately indoor and outdoor seats and has been designed to create a more comfortable experience to enhance our dinner business 
costs on average are less than million for inline restaurants  our predominant structural environment 
this excludes pre opening costs  which average approximately  to  per restaurant 
during the months following the opening of a new restaurant  customer traffic generally settles into a more normalized pattern 
additionally  our new restaurants usually require a to day period after opening to reach their targeted restaurant level operating margin due to cost of sales and labor inefficiencies commonly associated with new restaurants 
as a result  a significant number of restaurant openings in any single fiscal quarter  accompanied with their associated pre opening costs  could have a significant impact on our consolidated results of operations for that period 
therefore  our results of operations for any single fiscal quarter are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for any other fiscal quarter or for a full fiscal year 

table of contents our revenues are comprised of restaurant sales  license fees  domestic franchise royalties  international franchise royalties and other income 
our restaurant sales are comprised almost entirely of food and beverage sales  license fees are from our trademark license agreement with kraft  and domestic and international franchise royalties consist of monthly royalty income and initial franchise fees 
cost of sales is comprised of food  beverage and paper supplies  labor  and direct operating and occupancy expenses 
the components of food  beverage and paper supplies are variable and increase with sales volume 
labor costs include direct hourly and management wages  stock based compensation  bonuses and taxes and benefits for restaurant employees 
direct operating and occupancy costs include restaurant supplies  marketing costs  fixed rent  percentage rent  common area maintenance charges  utilities  real estate taxes  repairs and maintenance and other related restaurant costs 
direct operating and occupancy costs generally increase with sales volume but decline as a percentage of restaurant sales 
general and administrative costs include all corporate and administrative functions that support existing operations and provide infrastructure to facilitate our future growth 
components of this category include management  supervisory and staff salaries and related employee benefits  stock based compensation  travel and relocation costs  information systems  training  corporate rent and professional and consulting fees 
depreciation and amortization principally includes depreciation on capital expenditures for restaurants 
pre opening costs  which are expensed as incurred  currently consist of rent from the date construction begins through the restaurant opening date  the costs of hiring and training the initial work force  travel  the cost of food used in training  marketing costs  the cost of the initial stocking of operating supplies and other direct costs related to the opening of a restaurant 
in calculating comparable company owned restaurant sales  we include a restaurant in the comparable base once it has been open for months 
as of december   we had company owned restaurants that met this criterion

potential fluctuations in quarterly results and seasonality our quarterly operating results may fluctuate significantly as a result of a variety of factors  including the timing of new restaurant openings and related expenses  profitability of new restaurants  increases or decreases in comparable restaurant sales  general economic conditions  consumer confidence in the economy  changes in consumer preferences  competitive factors  changes in food costs  changes in labor costs  war and weather conditions 
in the past  we have experienced significant variability in pre opening costs from quarter to quarter 
these fluctuations are primarily a function of the timing of restaurant openings 
we typically incur the most significant portion of pre opening costs associated with a given restaurant in the month of opening 
in addition  our experience to date has been that labor and direct operating and occupancy costs associated with a newly opened restaurant during the first three to four months of operation are often materially greater than what will be expected after that time  both in aggregate dollars and as a percentage of restaurant sales 
accordingly  the number and timing of new restaurant openings in any quarter has had  and is expected to continue to have  a significant impact on quarterly pre opening costs  labor and direct operating and occupancy costs 
our business is also subject to seasonal fluctuations 
historically  sales in most of our restaurants have been higher during the summer months and winter holiday season 
as a result  we expect our highest earnings to occur in those periods 
as a result of all of these factors  results for any one quarter are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for any other quarter or for any full year 

table of contents liquidity and capital resources we fund our capital requirements principally through cash flow from operations and borrowings from our line of credit 
in  net cash flows provided by operating activities were million compared to million in and million in net cash flow provided by operating activities exceeded net income for primarily due to the effects of depreciation and amortization  loss on impairment of property and equipment  non cash compensation charges  deferred rent credits and store closure costs partially offset by net changes in net deferred tax assets 
we use working capital and borrowings from our line of credit to fund the development and construction of new restaurants and remodel our existing restaurants 
net cash used in investing activities  which was related entirely to capital expenditures  was million in capital expenditures resulted from million incurred on new restaurants and million incurred on capitalized maintenance  remodeling and other costs 
we opened full service restaurants and one la food show restaurant in net cash used in financing activities was million in and resulted from stock repurchases  partially offset by borrowings from our line of credit and net proceeds from issuance of common stock 
net proceeds from issuance of common stock were million for compared to million for and consisted of purchases under our employee stock purchase plan of million for both years  and common stock option exercises of million and million  respectively 
on august   the board of directors authorized a stock repurchase program august program to acquire the company s common stock from time to time in the open market and through privately negotiated transactions 
under the august program  up to million of the company s common stock could be reacquired from time to time over a month period 
the company repurchased no shares in under the august program 
during fiscal  the company repurchased  shares for million in the open market and  shares for million through a collared accelerated share repurchase agreement asr 
this aggregate of million completed the august program 
the company entered into the asr with bank of america  na bank of america  an unrelated third party  on february  the company funded the asr from borrowings under its revolving credit facility and available cash balances 
the payment for the asr was made in full upon execution of the agreement and was recorded as a reduction to stockholders equity 
the program concluded on june  the company accounted for this transaction in accordance with emerging issues task force eitf issue no 
 accounting for an accelerated share repurchase program 
on july   the board of directors authorized an additional stock repurchase program july program to acquire the company s common stock from time to time in the open market and through privately negotiated transactions 
under the july program  up to million of the company s common stock could be reacquired from time to time over a month period 
during fiscal  the company repurchased  shares in the open market for an aggregate price of million under the july program 
in january  the company entered into a second amendment to its amended and restated credit agreement the amendment with bank of america to amend the amended and restated credit agreement dated june  the original credit agreement 
the amendment increased the revolving line of credit from million to million 
on may   the company replaced its million credit facility by entering into a new five year revolving credit facility the facility with a syndicate of banks  featuring a maximum available borrowing capacity of million 
the facility contains an uncommitted option to increase  subject to satisfaction of certain conditions  the maximum borrowing capacity by up to an additional million 
the facility contains certain restrictive and financial covenants  including that the company maintain a minimum consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio and a maximum lease adjusted leverage ratio 
the facility is guaranteed by one of the company s subsidiaries and stipulates certain events of default 
borrowings 
table of contents under the facility bear interest at either libor or the prime rate  at the company s option  plus a spread ranging from to basis points for libor loans or zero to basis points for prime rate loans 
the company also pays a commitment fee on the unused facility ranging from to basis points per annum 
both the interest rate spread and the commitment fee level depend on the lease adjusted leverage ratio as defined in the terms of the facility 
the facility also includes a million sublimit for standby letters of credit 
as of december   the company had borrowings outstanding under the facility totaling million with an average annual interest rate of 
availability under the line of credit is also reduced by outstanding letters of credit totaling million as of december   which are used to support the company s self insurance programs 
available borrowings under the line of credit were million as of december  the facility matures in may as of december   the company is in compliance with all debt covenants 
the company expects to use any excess capital generated in to pay down debt 
our capital requirements  including costs related to opening additional restaurants  have been and will continue to be significant  but will slow in due to the weak macroeconomic environment 
our future cash requirements and the adequacy of available funds will depend on many factors  including the pace of expansion  real estate markets  site locations and the nature of the arrangements negotiated with landlords 
we believe that our current cash balances  together with anticipated cash flows from operations and funds anticipated to be available from our credit facility  will be sufficient to satisfy our working capital and capital expenditure requirements on a short term and long term basis 
changes in our operating plans  acceleration of our expansion plans  lower than anticipated sales  increased expenses  failure to maintain financial covenants under our credit facility  financial and non financial covenant requirements or other events may cause us to seek additional financing sooner than anticipated 
additional financing may not be available on acceptable terms  or at all 
failure to obtain additional financing as needed could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations 
as of december   we had no financing transactions  arrangements or other relationships with any unconsolidated entities or related parties 
additionally  we had no financing arrangements involving synthetic leases or trading activities involving commodity contracts 
as of december   the company had cash and cash equivalents of million 
available cash and cash equivalents are held in accounts managed by third party financial institutions and consist of invested cash and cash in the company s operating accounts 
the invested cash is held in interest bearing funds managed by third party financial institutions 
these funds invest in high quality money market instruments  including primarily short term debt securities of us and foreign issuers 
to date  the company has experienced no loss or lack of access to its invested cash or cash equivalents  however  the company can provide no assurances that access to its invested cash and cash equivalents will not be impacted by adverse conditions in the financial markets 
at any point in time the company also has a range of approximately million to million in its operating accounts with third party financial institutions 
these balances exceed the federal deposit insurance corporation fdic insurance limits 
while the company monitors the cash balances in its operating accounts on a daily basis and adjusts the cash balances as appropriate  these cash balances could be impacted if the underlying financial institutions fail or are subject to other adverse conditions in the financial markets 
to date  the company has experienced no loss or lack of access to cash in its operating accounts 
off balance sheet arrangements as part of our ongoing business  we do not participate in transactions that generate relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships  such as entities often referred to as structured finance or variable interest entities vies  which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes 
as of december   we are not involved in any vie transactions and do not otherwise have any off balance sheet arrangements 

table of contents contractual commitments the following table summarizes our contractual commitments as of december  in millions payments due by period total less than year years years more than years operating lease obligations long term debt purchase obligations fin liability represents aggregate minimum lease payments 
most of the leases also require contingent rent in addition to the minimum rent based on a percentage of sales and require expenses incidental to the use of the property 
purchase obligations represent estimated construction commitments and exclude agreements that are cancelable without significant penalty 
critical accounting policies critical accounting policies are those that we believe are most important to portraying our financial condition and results of operations and also require the greatest amount of subjective or complex judgments by management 
judgments or uncertainties regarding the application of these policies may result in materially different amounts being reported under different conditions or using different assumptions 
we consider the following policies to be the most critical in understanding the judgments that are involved in preparing our consolidated financial statements 
property and equipment property and equipment is recorded at cost 
property and equipment is depreciated over the assets estimated useful lives using the straight line method 
leasehold improvements are amortized using the straight line method over the estimated useful life of the asset or the term of the related lease  whichever is shorter 
the lives for furniture  fixtures and equipment are or years 
the lives for buildings and leasehold improvements are the shorter of years or the term of the related operating lease 
the cost of repairs and maintenance is expensed when incurred  while expenditures for refurbishments and improvements that extend the useful life of an asset are capitalized 
a reduction in the useful life of our property and equipment could increase annual depreciation expense for the related assets 
in  after an evaluation and analysis of all of our leases  unit performance  relationships with landlords and a fixed asset review  we now include the renewal option period in our calculation of lease term for locations as the exercise of the option period is probable and failure to exercise such option would result in an economic penalty 
as such  the useful lives of certain leaseholds previously depreciated over the shorter of years or the term of the related lease was extended from to years 
to provide consistency with elements of occupancy cost calculated using the lease term  the period over which straight line rent and the amortization of deferred rent credits is calculated was also extended 
these changes were accounted for as a change in accounting estimate under statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting changes and error corrections 
in  this change resulted in a decrease in depreciation expense of  an increase in rent expense of  a decrease in operating income of  and no impact on earnings per share 
operating leases all of our restaurant leases are classified as operating leases 
the lease term includes renewal option periods only in instances in which the exercise of the renewal option can be reasonably assured and failure to exercise 
table of contents such option would result in an economic penalty 
we recognize rent over the lease term  which begins on the date of possession and includes the build out period  which represents the period from construction start date through the completion of construction 
rent from the date of possession through the restaurant opening date is included as rent expense in pre opening expenses 
tenant improvement allowances are recognized as deferred rent credits and amortized over the lease term as a reduction of rent expense on the consolidated statements of income and as a component of operating activities on the consolidated statements of cash flows 
goodwill and intangible assets goodwill represents the residual purchase price after allocation of the purchase price of net assets acquired 
goodwill and intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives are not amortized  but are subject to annual impairment tests 
intangible assets deemed to have definite lives are amortized over their estimated useful lives 
intangible assets primarily represent the cost of transferable liquor licenses and are deemed to have indefinite lives 
the company tests for impairment of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets at a minimum on an annual basis in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
impairment tests are performed with respect to goodwill at the reporting unit level 
this approach is deemed appropriate as the goodwill component is part of a business that is managed by the same management team  applying identical metrics in evaluating performance of the goodwill related business as they do the other parts of the company s business and the goodwill related business has economic characteristics that are similar to the other parts of the company s business 
the company reviews the recoverability of goodwill based on both a discounted cash flow analysis and multiple of earnings analysis comparing the fair value of the reporting unit to the carrying value 
generally  the company performs its annual assessment for impairment during the fourth quarter of its fiscal year and will perform the analysis more frequently if there are any impairment indicators identified during the year 
as of december   management determined there was no impairment of goodwill 
there can be no assurance that future goodwill impairment tests will not result in a charge to earnings 
long lived asset impairments and store closure costs we assess the impairment of long lived assets  including restaurant sites and other assets  when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the assets or the asset group may not be recoverable 
the asset impairment review process assesses the recovery of an asset based on estimated future cash flows 
management has determined that restaurants with operating cash flows of less than a defined target should be regularly monitored to determine if impairment charges should be taken 
an impairment loss is recognized when estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset plus net proceeds expected from the disposition of the asset if any are less than the related asset s carrying amount 
impairment losses are measured as the amount by which the carrying amounts of the assets exceed their fair values 
the net proceeds expected from the disposition of the asset are determined by independent quotes or expected sales prices developed through internal review 
estimates of future cash flows and expected sales are judgments based on our experience and knowledge of local operations 
these estimates can be significantly impacted by changes in real estate market conditions  the economic environment  capital spending decisions and inflation 
for any properties that are planned to be closed and are under long term lease agreements  the present value of any remaining liability under the lease  discounted using an internal  after tax hurdle rate and net of expected sublease rental that could be reasonably obtained for the property is recognized as a liability and expensed when the criteria for sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  have been met 
the value of any equipment and leasehold improvements related to a closed store is reduced to reflect net recoverable value 
through our internal review  we estimate the subtenant income  future cash flows and asset recovery values based on their historical experience and our knowledge of the market in which the store to be closed is located  the results of our previous efforts to dispose of similar assets and the current economic conditions 
specific real estate markets  the economic environment and inflation affect the actual cost of disposition for these leases and related assets 

table of contents self insurance the company is self insured for a significant portion of its employee workers compensation  general liability  automobile and health insurance obligations 
the company maintains stop loss coverage with third party insurers to limit its total exposure 
the accrued liabilities associated with these programs are based on historical claims data and our estimate of the ultimate costs to be incurred to settle known claims and claims incurred but not reported as of the balance sheet date 
the estimated liability is not discounted and is based on a number of assumptions and factors  including historical trends  actuarial assumptions and economic conditions 
if actual trends  including the severity or frequency of claims  differ from our estimates  our financial results could be impacted 
income taxes we currently have significant deferred tax assets  which are subject to periodic recoverability assessments 
realizing our deferred tax assets principally depends upon our achieving projected future taxable income 
we may change our judgments regarding future profitability due to future market conditions and other factors 
we may adjust our deferred tax asset balances if our judgments change 
our tax rate may be affected by future acquisitions  changes in the geographic composition of our income from operations  changes in our estimates of credits or deductions and the resolution of issues arising from tax audits with various tax authorities 
we adopted financial accounting standards board interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
fin on january   which prescribes recognition and measurement criteria in addition to classification  interim period accounting and significantly expanded disclosure provisions for uncertain tax positions that are expected to be taken in our corporate tax return 
restaurant  royalty and franchise revenues revenues from the operation of company owned restaurants are recognized when sales occur 
royalty fees from our licensing agreement with kraft are recognized on a quarterly basis and are based on a percentage of kraft s sales of our premium frozen products 
royalty fees from franchise restaurants are based on a percentage of restaurant revenues and are recognized in the period the related franchised restaurants revenues are earned 
pre opening costs we follow statement of position sop  reporting on the costs of start up activities  which was issued by the accounting standards executive committee and provides guidance on the financial reporting of start up costs and organization costs 
the sop requires costs of start up activities and organization costs to be expensed as incurred as a charge against operations 
stock based compensation sfas no 
r  share based payment sfas r requires the measurement and recognition of compensation cost at fair value for all share based payments  including stock options and restricted stock awards 
we adopted sfas r using the modified prospective transition method and  as a result  did not retroactively adjust results from prior periods 
under this transition method  stock based compensation is recognized for expense related to the remaining nonvested portion of all stock awards granted prior to january   based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the original provisions of sfas  and expense related to all stock awards granted on or subsequent to january   based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the provisions of sfas r 
the black scholes valuation model is applied in determining the fair value of option awards  which is then amortized on a straight line basis over the requisite service period

inflation the primary inflationary factors affecting our operations are food and labor costs 
a large number of our restaurant personnel are paid at rates based on the applicable minimum wage  and increases in the minimum wage directly affect our labor costs 
many of our leases require us to pay taxes  maintenance  repairs  insurance and utilities  all of which are generally subject to inflationary increases 
we believe inflation has not had a material impact on our results of operations in recent years

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our market risk exposures are related to our cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities 
cash and cash equivalents are invested in highly liquid short term investments with maturities of less than three months as of the date of purchase

changes in interest rates affect the investment income we could earn on our investments and  therefore  impact our cash flows and results of operations 
as of december   we did not hold any marketable securities in our cash and cash equivalents or other current assets 
however  we are subjected to market risk related to our investments in mutual funds and corporate owned life insurance contracts coli used to support our deferred compensation executive retirement savings plan ersp to the extent these investments are not equivalent to the related liability 
the full impact of gains or losses in marketable securities related to the program is reflected in net income

many of the food products purchased by us are affected by changes in weather  production  availability  seasonality  economic factors and other factors outside our control 
in an effort to control some of this risk  we have entered into some fixed price purchase commitments with terms of no more than one year
