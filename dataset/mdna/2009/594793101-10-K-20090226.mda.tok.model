item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview micrel designs  develops  manufactures and markets a range of high performance analog power ics  mixed signal and digital ics 
these products address a wide range of end markets including cellular handsets  enterprise and portable computing  enterprise and home networking  wide area and metropolitan area networks and industrial equipment 
the company also manufactures custom analog and mixed signal circuits and provides wafer foundry services for customers who produce electronic systems for communications  consumer and military applications 
to enhance the readers understanding of the company s performance  the following chronological overview of the company s results for the years through have been provided 
in the first quarter of  broad based strength in customer demand  combined with continued lean channel inventories resulted in the highest quarterly booking level for micrel since calendar year net revenues increased on a sequential basis to million and were above the net revenues of the year ago period 
the sequential growth in net revenues was primarily the result of increased demand from customers serving the wireline communications end market and higher resales of the company s products through its distributors  partially offset by seasonal declines in sales to the wireless handset primarily in korea and computing end markets 
first quarter of gross margin of was the highest quarterly gross margin as of that time in the company s history 
in the second quarter of  overall order rates moderated from the levels experienced in the first quarter 
second quarter net revenues of million increased by sequentially and were above the prior year period 
the growth in net revenues continued to be led by demand from customers serving the wireline communications end market 
this growth was partially offset by continued weakness in demand from korean based customers serving the wireless handset end market as they experienced a sequential decline in handset shipments during the second quarter 
second quarter gross margin of declined by as compared to the first quarter of in the third quarter of  overall order rates declined on a sequential basis  primarily because the company s sell through distributors reduced orders and consumed backlog in an attempt to control inventory levels 
third quarter net revenues of million increased by sequentially 
continued strength from the industrial end market  combined with a rebound in the company s wireless handset business  led the product revenue growth in the third quarter 
third quarter net revenues included million associated with a patent license that was previously under litigation 
third quarter gross margin of was the highest level in the company s history 
the settlement of intellectual property matters  and related licensing revenues and expenses  resulted in million of net pre tax operating income included in the third quarter  increasing third quarter net income by per diluted share 
fourth quarter order rates were slightly lower than the third quarter  and remained below the level of fourth quarter revenues as customers attempted to reduce inventory levels 
fourth quarter net revenues were million  a decrease of from third quarter revenues of million 
the sequential decline in sales resulted primarily from reduced demand from wireless handset manufacturers combined with lower distribution revenues and the absence of patent license revenue 
gross margin of declined from the previous quarter primarily due to lower revenues and the impact of reduced manufacturing volumes leading to less absorption of fixed cost 
page 
table of contents management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued micrel s overall financial performance in was one of the best on an annual basis in the company s history 
revenues of million were the second highest annual amount ever recorded 
total sales increased by over the million posted in gross margin of improved for the fourth consecutive year and reached the highest level in the company s history  exceeding previous peak levels recorded in the year when revenues were higher than income from operations of million increased by from the million recorded in operating margin improved to from in year net income was million  or per diluted share  an increase of from million  or per diluted share in year net income and earnings per share were the second highest ever recorded by micrel on an annual basis 
operating cash flow for the year of was million 
during the first quarter of  customers continued to control their inventories closely 
however  the order rates the company experienced during the quarter suggested that customer and channel inventories had fallen to levels consistent with end demand 
micrel s first quarter bookings increased in all major geographic regions resulting in an growth in orders compared with fourth quarter levels 
the total overall amount of new orders booked in the first quarter exceeded revenues 
the sequential improvement in bookings was driven by higher order levels from customers serving the high speed communications  wireless handset and industrial end markets 
order rates increased for both oem customers and sell through distributors  while bookings from micrel s asian based sell in distributors were flat from fourth quarter levels 
first quarter revenues were million  less than the million recorded in the fourth quarter and lower than the million posted in the first quarter of seasonal declines in sales to customers serving the computing  wireless handset and consumer end markets were partially offset by higher resales through the company s sell through distributors 
gross margin increased sequentially to despite lower revenues and inventory reduction due to a combination of lower manufacturing costs and a higher gross margin sales mix 
first quarter operating profit was million  or of sales 
the company s on hand inventory declined on a sequential basis 
overall channel inventories remained relatively flat from the end of  with increases at the company s sell through distributors offset by lower inventory levels at micrel s sell in distributors 
in the second quarter of  order lead times remained in the four to six week range 
although customers continued to closely monitor their inventories  the dollar amount of second quarter bookings exceeded the company s revenue level 
second quarter revenues were million  a sequential increase of over the million recorded in the first quarter  and lower than the million posted in the year ago period 
the sequential growth in second quarter revenues was led by increased sales to customers serving the communications and computing end markets  offsetting lower sales of the company s products to major korean wireless handset customers 
gross margin of increased from the prior year period and decreased by from the first quarter 
during the second quarter  the company operated at a lower level of factory utilization  which had the combined effect of reducing both inventory levels and gross margin 
channel inventories also declined on a sequential basis as the company s major global sell through distributors attempted to take advantage of readily available semiconductor component supplies to increase their working capital turns 
page 
table of contents management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued demand for the company s products in the third quarter of was generally seasonal in nature 
bookings from industrial and wireline communication customers softened  while holiday and back to school related markets such as wireless handsets  computing and consumer were more robust 
faced with concerns about the growth of the us economy  the company s sell through distributors were cautious throughout the third quarter as they saw their orders slow and inventories build 
the overall amount of orders booked by the company in the third quarter was approximately the same as the revenue level for the quarter 
customers continued to control their inventories very closely during the third quarter in the face of short lead times  due in part to their belief that the semiconductor industry had sufficient inventory and or the ability to deliver sufficient quantities to meet customer demand in this shorter lead time environment 
micrel s order lead times decreased throughout the quarter  starting out at about five weeks in july and declining to three to four weeks in september 
third quarter revenues were million  up slightly compared to the second quarter  and lower than the million posted in the year ago period 
an increase in third quarter sales to customers in the wireless handset and consumer end market was offset by lower revenues from customers in the wireline communications end market  arising from lower shipments to major chinese communications customers as they trimmed inventory levels 
gross margin decreased from in the second quarter to in the third quarter of  and decreased from in the year ago period 
during the third quarter  the company reduced on hand inventory levels despite a higher level of factory utilization 
channel inventories increased by approximately one week over the second quarter due to seasonally slower distribution sales of the company s products 
third quarter operating profit was million  or of revenues 
in the fourth quarter of  the increasingly uncertain macroeconomic environment appeared to heighten the company s customer s focus on maintaining lean inventories 
global distributors and certain oem customers informed the company that they attempted to minimize inventory at year end 
as a consequence  customer orders and purchases declined more quickly than usual in the month of december  resulting in a quarterly book to bill ratio of less than one  and impacting fourth quarter revenues 
revenues for the fourth quarter of decreased from the third quarter to million and were essentially flat to the revenues in the year ago period 
sales to customers serving the consumer  computing and the wire line communications end markets declined on a sequential basis  partially offset by increased sales of the company s ethernet products during the quarter 
gross margin decreased to in the fourth quarter from in the third quarter primarily as a result of a less favorable sales mix 
fourth quarter operating profit was million  or of revenues 
on hand inventories increased during the fourth quarter  while channel inventories decreased by approximately one week from the end of the third quarter 
micrel s financial performance in remained solid 
total year gross margin of was the second highest in the company history 
net income for fiscal increased to million  or per diluted share  compared with net income of million  or per diluted share in included in pre tax income was a million gain associated with a first quarter legal settlement  which after income taxes  was equivalent to million or per diluted share 
cash flows from operations of million during the year enabled the repurchase of million shares of common stock for million  representing approximately of the shares outstanding at the beginning of the year 
in addition  the company commenced a per common share cash dividend payment to shareholders in the second quarter of page 
table of contents management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued in the first quarter of  bookings levels rebounded from the fourth quarter of  resulting in the highest quarterly booking level since q and a book to bill ratio significantly above one 
first quarter revenues of million increased sequentially compared to fourth quarter revenues of million and increased compared to revenues of million recorded in the prior year period 
the increase in revenues was primarily due to stronger demand from the wire line communications  digital tv  industrial and voice over ip end markets  which offset seasonal declines in sales to the computing and wireless handset end markets 
revenues through micrel s sell through distributors increased in the first quarter and the number of weeks of distribution channel inventory decreased slightly on a sequential basis 
gross margin improved to in the first quarter of from in the fourth quarter of while at the same time inventory levels were reduced 
first quarter operating profit was million  or of revenues 
earnings per diluted share for the first quarter of increased to per share from per share reported in the fourth quarter of during the first quarter of  the company became engaged in its first proxy contest since going public in  with a small activist hedge fund  obrem capital management llc ocm 
this issue resulted in micrel incurring incremental operating expenses on this matter of  during the first quarter  million in the second quarter   in the third quarter and million in the fourth quarter of see proxy contest expense in the results of operations section in management discussions and analysis of financial conditions and results of operations 
in the second quarter of  total bookings remained firm  resulting in a book to bill ratio above one 
second quarter bookings were paced by demand from customers serving the communications  industrial  and wireless handset end markets 
customers remained very cautious  which continued to keep order lead times in the to week range 
in the second quarter  micrel posted its highest sequential revenue growth rate in four years 
second quarter revenues of million came in at the high end of the company s guidance  increasing by million  or  from the first quarter  and were up by million  or from the prior year period 
the growth in revenues was led by stronger demand from customers serving the wireline communications  wireless handset  and wi fi voice over ip end markets  combined with record sales through the company s global sell through distributors 
the turns fill percentage for the second quarter was slightly above 
gross margin was  which was about the same as the first quarter of second quarter operating profit was million  or of sales 
a total of million of proxy contest expenses reduced micrel s operating income by approximately in the second quarter  and also had the effect of reducing operating margin by approximately in the second quarter 
second quarter net income was million  or per diluted share 
this compares with first quarter net income of million  or per diluted share  and net income of million or per diluted share in the prior year period 
expenses related to the company s proxy contest reduced net income by per share in the second quarter 
financial markets in the united states  europe and asia experienced extreme disruption in the second half of the fiscal year ending december   including  among other things  extreme volatility in security prices  severely diminished liquidity and credit availability  rating downgrades of certain investments and declining valuations of others 
in the third quarter of  concerns related to the deterioration in the global financial and credit markets  including with respect to the availability and cost of credit  contributed to instability in worldwide capital and credit markets and diminished expectations for the us and global economy 
these conditions worsened in the fourth quarter of  and combined with uncertainty about the global economy in general  contributed to volatility of unprecedented levels and a further economic slowdown 
although governments have taken unprecedented actions in an attempt to alleviate the credit crisis  customers and consumers began to cut back on spending in order to conserve cash in the third quarter of this resulted in the slowing of orders from micrel s distributors and direct oem customers  which continued into the fourth quarter of page 
table of contents management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued during the third quarter of  total bookings were less than revenues  resulting in a book to bill ratio of less than one 
third quarter bookings decreased abruptly in the last two weeks of the quarter 
notwithstanding the order decrease  resales of the company s products from global sell through distributors remained strong throughout the quarter and represented an all time record for the company 
in the third quarter  micrel posted million in revenue  a decrease of sequentially and an increase of from third quarter of the sequential quarter decrease in sales primarily resulted from reduced demand from customers serving the wireline communications  wi fi voice over ip and foundry sales to a major solar end customer 
this was offset by slight increases in the computer and consumer markets 
the oem turns fill percentage for the third quarter was approximately 
third quarter gross margin was  down from in q research and development spending was million  or of revenues in the third quarter compared to million or of revenues in the second quarter 
selling  general and administrative expenses were million  or of sales  down from million in the second quarter 
gaap operating income was million  or of sales 
this compares to operating income of million in the second quarter and million in the prior year period 
other income  net was unchanged quarter to quarter at thousand 
the effective tax rate was for the third quarter 
third quarter net income was million  or per diluted share 
this compares with second quarter net income of million  or per diluted share  and gaap net income of million or per diluted share in the year ago 
fourth quarter revenue of million decreased by million  or  from million in the third quarter 
fourth quarter revenues were lower by million  or  from million in the same period last year 
the sequential and year over year decrease in revenues was due to tight year end inventory control in most geographies  channels and end markets as a result of the worldwide financial crisis 
the worldwide macroeconomic recession in the fourth quarter caused the company s customers to focus on maintaining lean inventories 
the company s global distributors and a number of major oem customers took action to minimize inventories at year end 
as a consequence  customer orders and purchases declined in november and december after strong activity in october 
for the fourth quarter  micrel s overall book to bill ratio was below one 
order lead times from the company s customers remained relatively short at from three to six weeks during the quarter 
fourth quarter gross margin was  compared to in the third quarter 
the decrease in gross margin was the result of factory underutilization and additional inventory reserves due to a lower sales forecast 
fourth quarter net income of million  or per diluted share compares with third quarter net income of million  or per diluted share  and net income of million or per diluted share in the same period in for the year ended december   micrel s financial performance continued to be solid  especially in light of the current economic conditions 
the company performed well in a difficult environment 
full year revenues of million were up slightly  compared with million in net income for fiscal was million  or per diluted share  compared with net income of million  or per diluted share in included in net income was a million pre tax gain associated with a first quarter legal settlement  which after income taxes  is equivalent to per diluted share 
gross margins for were compared to in the company s design efforts resulted in a record number of new product releases in solid cash flows from operations of million during the year enabled the repurchase of million shares of common stock  or approximately of the shares outstanding at the beginning of the year 
in addition  micrel continued a dividend payment to shareholders in  representing management s confidence in micrel s operating performance and commitment to enhancing shareholder value 
page 
table of contents management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued the company derives a substantial portion of its net revenues from standard products 
for  and the company s standard products sales accounted for   and  respectively  of the company s net revenues 
the company believes that a substantial portion of its net revenues in the future will depend upon standard products sales  although such sales as a proportion of net revenues may vary as the company adjusts product output levels to correspond with varying economic conditions and demand levels in the markets which it serves 
the standard products business is characterized by short term orders and shipment schedules  and customer orders typically can be canceled or rescheduled without significant penalty to the customer 
since most standard products backlog is cancelable without significant penalty  the company typically plans its production and inventory levels based on forecasts of customer demand  which is highly unpredictable and can fluctuate substantially 
in addition  the company is limited in its ability to reduce costs quickly in response to any revenue shortfalls 
the company may experience significant fluctuations in its results of operations 
factors that affect the company s results of operations include the volume and timing of orders received  changes in the mix of products sold  the utilization level of manufacturing capacity  competitive pricing pressures and the successful development of new products 
these and other factors are described in further detail later in this discussion and in item a 
as a result of the foregoing or other factors  including the global economic crisis  there can be no assurance that the company will not experience material fluctuations in future operating results on a quarterly or annual basis  which could materially and adversely affect the company s business  financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
revision of prior period financial statements during the fourth quarter of  the company identified an error related to its calculation of deferred income on shipments to distributors deferred income 
upon review of its calculations  management determined that the estimated shipping margin percentage used to calculate the deferred income balance was incorrect and this resulted in an understatement of deferred income and related cost of sales 
the company assessed the materiality of this error on prior periods financial statements in accordance with the sec s staff accounting bulletin no 
sab  and concluded that the error was not material to any prior annual or interim periods but would be material to the year ended december  if the entire correction was recorded in the current year 
accordingly  in accordance with the sec s staff accounting bulletin no 
sab  the and financial statements presented herein have been revised to correct for the immaterial error 
in addition  an adjustment was also recorded to reduce the beginning retained earnings at january  for the cumulative impact of this error on prior periods 
the revision had no net impact on the company s consolidated statement of cash flows for the years ended december   and see 
note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
page 
table of contents management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued critical accounting policies and estimates the financial statements included in this form k and discussed within this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
on an on going basis  management evaluates its estimates and judgments 
management bases its estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
for a detailed discussion of the company s significant accounting policies  see 
note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
the company considers certain accounting policies related to revenue recognition  inventory valuation  share based accounting  income taxes  and litigation to be critical to the fair presentation of its financial statements 
revenue recognition and receivables 
micrel generates revenue by selling products to oem s  distributors and stocking representatives 
stocking representative firms may buy and stock the company s products for resale or may act as the company s sales representative in arranging for direct sales from the company to an oem customer 
the company s policy is to recognize revenue from sales to customers when the rights and risks of ownership have passed to the customer  when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  the product has been delivered  the price is fixed or determinable and collection of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured 
micrel allows certain distributors located in north america and europe  and in certain countries in asia  significant return rights  price protection and pricing adjustments subsequent to the initial product shipment 
as these returns and price concessions have historically been significant  and future returns and price concessions are difficult to reliably estimate  the company defers recognition of revenue and related cost of sales in the balance sheet line item deferred income on shipments to distributors derived from sales to these distributors until they have resold the company s products to their customers 
although revenue and related cost of sales are not recognized  the company records an accounts receivable and relieves inventory at the time of initial product shipment 
as standard terms are fob shipping point  payment terms are enforced from shipment date and legal title and risk of inventory loss passes to the distributor upon shipment 
in addition  where revenue is deferred upon shipment and recognized on a sell through basis  the company may offer price adjustments to its distributors to allow the distributor to price the company s products competitively for specific resale opportunities 
the company estimates and records an allowance for distributor price adjustments for which the specific resale transaction has been completed  but the price adjustment claim has not yet been received and recorded by the company 
sales to oem customers and stocking representatives are recognized based upon the shipment terms of the sale transaction when all other revenue recognition criteria have been met 
the company does not grant return rights  price protection or pricing adjustments to oem customers 
the company offers limited contractual stock rotation rights to stocking representatives 
in addition  the company is not contractually obligated to offer  but may infrequently grant  price adjustments or price protection to certain stocking representatives on an exception basis 
at the time of shipment to oems and stocking representatives  an allowance for returns is established based upon historical return rates  and an allowance for price adjustments is established based on an estimate of price adjustments to be granted 
actual future returns and price adjustments could be different than the allowance established 
page 
table of contents management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued the company also maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated uncollectible accounts receivable 
this estimate is based on an analysis of specific customer creditworthiness and historical bad debts experience 
actual future uncollectible amounts could exceed the doubtful accounts allowance established 
inventory valuation 
inventories are stated at the lower of cost first in  first out method or market 
the company records adjustments to write down the cost of obsolete and excess inventory to the estimated market value based on historical and forecasted demand for its products 
if actual future demand for the company s products is less than currently forecasted  additional inventory adjustments may be required 
once an inventory write down provision is established  it is maintained until the product to which it relates is sold or otherwise disposed of 
this treatment is in accordance with accounting research bulletin and sec staff accounting bulletin restructuring and impairment charges 
share based compensation 
effective january   micrel adopted the provisions of sfas no 
r using the modified prospective transition method 
under sfas no 
r share based compensation is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized as expense in the statement of operations 
to determine fair value  the company uses the black scholes valuation model which requires input factors such as expected term  stock price volatility  dividend yield and risk free interest rate 
in addition  sfas no 
r requires an estimate of expected forfeiture rates of stock grants and share based compensation expense is to be only recognized for those shares expected to vest 
determining the input factors  such as expected term  expected volatility and estimated forfeiture rates  requires significant judgment based on subjective future expectations 
income taxes 
deferred tax assets and liabilities result primarily from temporary timing differences between book and tax valuation of assets and liabilities  and state research and development credit carryforwards 
the company must regularly assess the likelihood that future taxable income levels will be sufficient to ultimately realize the tax benefits of these deferred tax assets 
as of december   the company believes that future taxable income levels will be sufficient to realize the tax benefits of these deferred tax assets and has not established a valuation allowance 
should the company determine that future realization of these tax benefits is not more likely than not  a valuation allowance would be established  which would increase the company s tax provision in the period of such determination 
effective january   the company adopted the provisions of fasb interpretation fin no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
fin no 
contains a two step approach to recognizing and measuring uncertain tax positions accounted for in accordance with sfas no 
the first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit  including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes  if any 
the second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount which is more than likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement 
the company considers many factors when evaluating and estimating its tax positions and tax benefits  which may require periodic adjustments and which may not accurately anticipate actual outcomes 
litigation 
the semiconductor industry is characterized by frequent litigation regarding patent and other intellectual property rights 
in the past three years  the company has concluded cases involving intellectual property claims see 
note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
an estimated liability is accrued when it is determined to be probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated 
the liability accrual is charged to income in the period such determination is made 
the company regularly evaluates current information available to determine whether such accruals should be made

net revenues 
net revenues increased slightly to million for the year ended december  compared to million in due to increased standard product revenues which were partially offset by decreased other products revenues 
for the year ended december   net revenues decreased to from million in due to decreased standard product revenues which were partially offset by increased other products revenues 
standard product revenues increased to million  which represented of net revenues for the year ended december   compared to million and of net revenues for these increases resulted primarily from increased sales of standard products to the networking  telecommunications and consumer end markets 
other products revenues which consist primarily of custom and foundry products revenues and revenues from the license of patents  decreased to million  which represented of net revenues for the year ended december   compared to million and of net revenues for this decrease resulted primarily from decreased foundry product shipments 
the current global economic slowdown  unprecedented volatility in the capital markets and severely diminished liquidity and credit availability has exacerbated the ongoing weakness in the semiconductor industry 
this has materially softened demand for the company s products  and management is not able to predict whether macroeconomic conditions will continue to deteriorate or improve 
the persistence of such conditions could have a significant adverse effect on the company s revenues  profitability and results of operations 
page 
table of contents management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued customer demand for semiconductors can change quickly and unexpectedly 
the company s revenue levels have been highly dependent on the amount of new orders that are received for which product is requested to be delivered to the customer within the same quarter 
within the semiconductor industry these orders that are booked and shipped within the quarter are called turns fill orders 
when the turns fill level exceeds approximately of quarterly revenue  it makes it very difficult to predict near term revenues and income 
because of the long cycle time to build its products  the company s lack of visibility into demand when turns fill is high makes it difficult to predict what product to build to match future demand 
during  the company averaged from approximately to oem turns fill per quarter compared to approximately to turns fill per quarter during as noted in item a risk factors and above in the overview section of this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  a trend has developed over the last several years whereby customers in the semiconductor supply chain have worked to minimize the amount of inventory of semiconductors they hold 
as a consequence  customers are generally providing less order backlog to the company and other semiconductor suppliers  and relying on short lead times to buffer their build schedules 
shorter lead times reduce visibility into end demand and increase the reliance on turns fill orders 
to deal with these market forces while maintaining reliable service levels  the company and other semiconductor suppliers are carrying higher relative levels of inventory compared with historical averages prior to the reluctance of customers to provide order backlog together with short lead times and the uncertain growth rate of the world economy  make it difficult to precisely predict future levels of sales and profitability 
international sales represented   and of net revenues for the years ended december   and  respectively 
on a dollar basis  international sales increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the comparable period in these increases resulted primarily from increased shipments of standard products to the networking  high speed communications and the telecommunications end markets in europe and asia 
the trend for the company s customers to move their electronics manufacturing to asian countries has brought increased pricing pressure for micrel and other semiconductor manufacturers 
asian based manufacturers are typically more concerned about cost and less concerned about the capability of the integrated circuits they purchase 
this can make it more difficult for united states based companies to differentiate themselves except by price 
the increased concentration of electronics procurement and manufacturing in the asia pacific region has led  and may continue to lead  to continued price pressure for the company s products in the future 
share based compensation 
effective january   the company adopted the fair value recognition provisions of sfas no 
r using the modified prospective transition method and therefore has not restated results for prior periods 
the company s results of operations for the years ended december   and were impacted by the recognition of non cash expense related to the fair value of share based compensation awards 
during  micrel recorded million in pre tax share based compensation expense  of which million is included in cost of revenues  million is included in research and development expense and million is included in sales  general and administrative expense

gross profit is affected by a variety of factors including the volume of product sales  product mix  manufacturing capacity utilization  product yields and average selling prices 
the company s gross margin decreased to for the year ended december  from for this decrease in gross margin resulted primarily from an increase in sales mix of lower margin products in as compared to for the year ended december   the company s gross margin decreased to from for the decrease in gross margin resulted primarily from reduced revenue levels to cover fixed manufacturing costs 
depreciation and amortization as a percent of sales increased to for as compared to for due to additional depreciation on new equipment purchases combined with a decrease in annual revenues 
the gross margin was also affected by a greater sales mix of lower margin products and lower revenues from the license of patents 
research and development expenses 
research and development expenses as a percentage of net revenues represented for each of the years ended december  and on a dollar basis  research and development expenses increased  or to million for from million in these increases were primarily due to increased prototype fabrication costs 
the company believes that the development and introduction of new products is critical to its future success and expects to continue its investment in research and development activities in the future 
for the year ended december  research and development expenses increased million or to million from million in these increases were primarily due to increased staffing costs 
selling  general and administrative expenses

proxy contest expense 
during the first quarter of  the company became engaged in its first proxy contest since going public in  with a small activist hedge fund  obrem capital management llc ocm 
this issue resulted in micrel incurring incremental expenses on this matter of  during the first quarter  million in the second quarter   in the third quarter and million in the fourth quarter of these expenses consist primarily of outside consulting and legal fees 
subsequent to a special meeting of shareholders on may   at which the company s shareholders rejected all proposals set forth by ocm  ocm agreed to withdraw its slate of nominees for the board of directors  and support micrel s board nominees at the upcoming annual meeting of shareholders

provision for income taxes 
for the year ended december   the provision for income taxes was million or of income before taxes as compared to of income before taxes for the tax rate decrease resulted primarily from a greater impact of federal and state research and development credits and federal qualified production activity deductions due to reduced income before income taxes 
the provision for income taxes differs from taxes computed at the federal statutory rate primarily due to the effects of non deductible share based compensation expense  state income taxes  federal and state research and development credits and federal qualified production activity deductions
