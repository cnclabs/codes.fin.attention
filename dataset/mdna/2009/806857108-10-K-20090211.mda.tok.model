such forward looking statements should be read in conjunction with our disclosures under item a 
risk factors of this report 
executive overview as progressed  early optimism of continuing growth in oil and natural gas exploration and production activity was dampened by growing evidence of weakening economic conditions that began to significantly weigh upon the energy markets in early october 
while such weakening did not prevent oil prices from ramping up steeply to per barrel in july  the velocity of the subsequent reversal to under per barrel by the end of the year was supported by economic reports and forecasts that confirmed the majority of the oecd organization for economic co operation and development countries to be in recession by the end of the third quarter 
consequently  global oil demand forecasts for dropped from quarter to quarter and it became apparent that moderating oil demand growth in the non oecd economies would no longer be sufficient to offset a continuing three year demand decline within the oecd countries 
as a result  saw the first global oil demand decrease in years 
in the fourth quarter opec elected to cut production by a total of million barrels per day to remove supply and support prices  however  the time taken for these cuts to be felt in the market  and for the resultant increased spare capacity to be reabsorbed by future growth  was large enough for e p customers to cut investment 
this translated to lower demand and weaker prices for oilfield services in an increasing number of areas late in the fourth quarter 
the natural gas markets presented a similar picture 
while activity was initially maintained in the first part of the year  the developing recession in the latter part of led to lower industrial demand in the developed economies although commercial and residential demand was maintained 
in north america  supply increased by in largely as a result of industry deployment of advanced drilling  production and completion technologies leading to higher gas production and consequently greater storage levels in spite of lower canadian imports and decreased lng liquified natural gas supplies 
consequently  more lng has become available for other international importers and  as a result  the majority of the developed economies are well supplied for their needs 
within the united states  the world s largest natural gas market  this translated to reduced gas exploration and production investment with lower demand for oilfield services and consequent pressure on service pricing in a number of areas by the fourth quarter as the market price of natural gas fell 
in international markets however  increasing demand for natural gas in the developing economies led to sustained drilling activity with drilling rigs previously deployed on oil exploration and development moving to natural gas activity in some regions 
within this volatile market  schlumberger oilfield services revenue in grew by versus  with demand strongest in international markets 
year on year growth rates reached in latin america  in europe cis africa  in middle east asia and in north america 
all technologies experienced double digit growth  most notably in well services  drilling measurements and wireline 
these results mask  however  a rapid reversal that occurred late in the year in response to the worsening economic climate  and  after three quarters of overall growth  revenues in the fourth quarter declined sequentially through weakening local currencies and reduced customer spending  in addition to seasonal factors 
a variety of new schlumberger products and services contributed to growth in these included further penetration of scanner family advanced wireline logging services and scope imaging while drilling technologies into new markets as customers sought to increase their understanding of complex reservoirs 
growth through measurement integration also extended into the production domain with offerings such as the stimmap live real time fracture monitoring service that combines the measurement capability of wireline with the pressure pumping expertise of well services to track the progress of fracture stimulation in real time 
table of contents part ii  item to be able to control the operation for maximum effect 
other new production related services included active coiled tubing services that combine a downhole sensor package with a fiber optic communications system to monitor coiled tubing enabled operations in real time 
acquisitions in also served to increase schlumberger capabilities or added specific new technologies to the portfolio 
in canada  schlumberger and first reserve corporation acquired saxon energy services inc  a land drilling contractor with major activity in north and south america 
schlumberger had already enjoyed a long association with saxon  including operation of joint ventures in mexico and colombia for the supply of drilling services that support integrated project management activities 
also in canada  schlumberger acquired the business of extreme engineering limited  a leading supplier of unmanned measurement while drilling systems to land markets in the united states and canada 
other technology acquisitions included integrated exploration systems  a germany based technology leader in petroleum systems modeling  and staag imaging  a houston based provider of leading edge depth imaging technologies for seismic data processing 
the performance of westerngeco  where full year revenue fell by versus  was limited by a combination of lower multiclient sales  reduced land activity  and cost inflation that affected marine operations 
among these factors  multiclient sales were particularly weak with the sharp decrease reported in the first quarter not being reversed later in the year as a clear indication of customers restricting discretionary spending for seismic data 
contract awards remained strong  however  and westerngeco reported a record backlog of billion at the end of the year  up million from the end of the third quarter 
in spite of this weaker than expected performance  westerngeco made significant progress in the introduction of new technology during the year 
these included a new proprietary full azimuth marine acquisition technique  known as coil shooting  that leverages the signal fidelity and streamer steering capability of q technology to provide resolution in sub salt applications where wide azimuth techniques mobilize too many resources 
coil shooting provides the same quality survey but uses only one vessel to do so 
in other new technology developments  the uniq latest generation land acquisition system was unveiled 
this substantially increases the number of acquisition channels available and in combination with proprietary vibrator source technology delivers a sharper image and wider coverage 
the sharp drop in oil and gas prices in the latter part of that resulted in lower activity  higher inventories  and the belief that demand will erode further in as a result of the economic slowdown  has led to rapid and substantial reductions in exploration and production expenditure 
at current prices most of the new categories of hydrocarbon resources such as heavy oil  tar sands  coal to liquids  or gas to liquids are not economic to develop 
in addition  it will take time for inflation to be removed from the e p supply chain to bring finding and development costs more in line with lower oil and gas prices 
schlumberger therefore expects activity to weaken across the board  with the most significant declines occurring in north american gas drilling  russian oil production enhancement  and in mature offshore basins 
exploration offshore will also be somewhat curtailed but commitments already planned are likely to be honored 
seismic expenditures  particularly for multiclient data  are likely to decrease from the levels of furthermore  pricing erosion will compound these effects on revenue 
in this market we are taking the necessary actions early in to adjust our operating cost base while preserving our long term commitments to technology development  key skill sets and service and product quality 
the most important indicator of a future recovery in oilfield services activity will be a stabilization and recovery in the demand for oil 
the recent years of increased exploration and production spending  however  have not been sufficient to substantially improve the supply situation 
the age of the production base  accelerating decline rates and the smaller size of recently developed fields will mean that any prolonged reduction in investment will lead to a strong rebound in activity in the future

oilfield services fourth quarter results fourth quarter revenue of billion was lower sequentially but was higher year on year 
sequentially  europe cis africa revenue declined primarily due to a weakening of the local currencies against the us dollar and from lower activity in russia as the result of reduced customer spending and seasonal slowdowns 
in latin america  revenue fell due to weaker local currencies and lower activity in the venezuela trinidad tobago and mexico central america geomarkets 
middle east asia declined on lower activity in the australia papua new guinea new zealand and qatar geomarkets 
these decreases  however  were partially offset by an increase in north america as the result of strong activity in the us gulf of mexico and us land west geomarkets 
local currency changes reduced oilfield services fourth quarter revenue by approximately 
fourth quarter pretax operating income of billion was lower sequentially but higher year on year 
sequentially  pretax operating margin decreased from to primarily as a result of reduced activity levels in the europe cis africa  latin america and middle east asia areas  partially offset by the improvement in overall activity and a more favorable revenue mix in north america 
north america revenue of billion increased sequentially and year on year 
pretax operating income of million increased sequentially and year on year 

table of contents part ii  item sequentially  the us gulf of mexico geomarket activity recovered from the slowdown experienced during the hurricane season of the third quarter and realized further growth on a higher ultra deep water rig count that led to strong demand for wireline  well testing and well services technologies 
the us land west geomarket revenue increased on strong demand for well services and drilling measurements services and artificial lift products while the alaska geomarket experienced a seasonal increase in activity that resulted in robust demand for well services and drilling measurements technologies 
sis experienced growth from strong year end software and hardware sales 
these increases were partially offset by decreased revenue in the us land central and north geomarkets on reducing rig count that accelerated at quarter end 
canada geomarket revenue was also lower primarily as the result of the weakening of the canadian dollar 
pretax operating margin improved sequentially from to mainly as a result of stronger activity levels and increased high margin services in the us gulf of mexico  us land west and alaska geomarkets 
these increases were partially offset by pricing pressure in the us land central and north geomarkets 
latin america revenue of billion was lower sequentially but increased year on year 
pretax operating income of million decreased sequentially and year on year 
sequentially  revenue in the venezuela trinidad tobago geomarket declined as a result of lower demand for wireline and well services technologies and completions products  while the mexico central america geomarket experienced lower activity in integrated project management ipm projects 
these decreases were partially offset by higher offshore exploration related activity in the brazil geomarket that led to robust demand for wireline  well testing and drilling measurements services  while activity in the peru colombia ecuador geomarket increased due to strong demand for artificial lift and sis products 
area revenue was also reduced by approximately due to the weakening of local currencies against the us dollar 
pretax operating margin declined sequentially from to from lower activity and a less favorable revenue mix in the venezuela trinidad tobago geomarket  reduced gain share from ipm projects in the peru colombia ecuador geomarket  and cost inflation and a less favorable revenue mix in the mexico central america geomarket 
europe cis africa revenue of billion decreased sequentially but increased year on year 
pretax operating income of million decreased sequentially but was higher year on year 
sequentially  area revenue was lower due to the weakening of local currencies against the us dollar particularly in the north sea  continental europe and russia 
additionally  russia experienced significant reductions in activity from lower customer spending and the seasonal slowdown in sakhalin 
lower framo revenue also contributed to the decline 
these decreases were partially offset by significantly increased activity in the libya geomarket from strong demand for artificial lift products and for drilling measurements  well testing and wireline services  as well as in the continental europe geomarket from higher demand for wireline and drilling measurements technologies 
pretax operating margin decreased sequentially from to primarily due to lower activity and a less favorable revenue mix in the north sea and nigeria gulf of guinea geomarkets and russia 
the decrease in framo revenue also contributed to this result 
middle east asia revenue of billion was lower sequentially but higher year on year 
pretax operating income of million decreased sequentially but increased year on year 
sequentially  area revenue declined mainly as a result of weather related effects in the australia papua new guinea new zealand and china japan korea geomarkets  lower activity in qatar  a less favorable activity 
table of contents part ii  item mix in brunei malaysia philippines and reduced customer spending in the china japan korea and arabian geomarkets 
these declines primarily affected demand for wireline  drilling measurements and well services technologies  but were partially offset by the positive impact of retroactive price adjustments for a wireline contract in addition to growth in the gulf geomarket for artificial lift products and well services and drilling measurements technologies 
pretax operating margin declined sequentially from to primarily due to the overall lower level of activity in the area as well as a less favorable revenue mix in the arabian and india geomarkets 
total year results full year revenue of billion increased versus driven by area growth of in latin america  in europe cis africa  in middle east asia and in north america 
all technologies experienced double digit growth most notably in well services  drilling measurements and wireline 
pretax operating income of billion in was higher than however  pretax operating margin declined basis points bps to primarily due to reduced pricing for well stimulation services in the us land geomarkets  a higher mix of low margin third party managed services in the mexico central america geomarket and cost inflation across all areas 
north america revenue of billion grew versus growth was led by the us land west geomarket mostly due to increased gas shale activity that resulted in robust demand for well services and drilling measurements technologies and by the us land central geomarket on higher rig activity and strong artificial lift product sales 
the canada geomarket revenue was higher from demand for well services and drilling measurements technologies while the us gulf of mexico geomarket grew on increased deepwater activity the resulted in strong demand for drilling measurements and wireline services in addition to completion systems products 
pretax operating margin decreased bps to primarily as the result of lower pricing for well stimulation services in the us land geomarkets and cost inflation across the area 
latin america revenue of billion was higher than on double digit growth across all geomarkets 
the mexico central america geomarket increased on significantly higher ipm activity while the peru colombia ecuador geomarket also experienced increased ipm activity in addition to robust demand for wireline services and for artificial lift and sis products 
the brazil geomarket grew on higher offshore activity that resulted in stronger demand for well testing  wireline and well services technologies 
the venezuela trinidad and tobago geomarket experienced increased demand for wireline  drilling measurements and well services activities 
pretax operating margin of declined bps versus as a result of an increased mix of low margin third party managed services in the mexico central america geomarket and cost inflation across the area 
europe cis africa revenue of billion increased versus the same period last year 
growth was led by russia which experienced strong demand for wireline  well services and drilling measurements technologies 
the west south africa  north sea and caspian geomarkets grew on increased exploration related services as well as strong demand for well services technologies 
the continental europe geomarket was higher due to strong drilling related activities and demand for sis products 
the consolidation of framo also contributed to the increase 

table of contents part ii  item pretax operating margin decreased bps to primarily as a result of reduced pricing in the libya geomarket and a less favorable revenue mix in the nigeria gulf of guinea geomarket and russia 
the consolidation of framo also reduced total area margin 
middle east asia revenue of billion was higher than the prior year 
all geomarkets experienced growth  most notably in the arabian  australia papua new guinea new zealand  gulf  and east mediterranean geomarkets 
among the technologies  growth was strongest in wireline  drilling measurements  well services and well testing 
pretax operating margin was nearly flat at as the positive impact of the higher overall activity level was offset by cost inflation 
total year results full year revenue of billion increased versus  led by area growths of in both the middle east asia  and in europe cis africa and in latin america  while north america remained essentially flat 
pretax operating income of billion in was higher than pretax operating margins of improved bps in versus higher activity and expansion of higher margin new technology deployment across europe cis africa  middle east asia and latin america areas were the principal contributors to this performance 
in north america  pricing erosion in pressure pumping well stimulation activities moderated year on year margin growth within the area 
among the geomarkets  the greatest increases in revenue were recorded in the north sea  followed by mexico central america  arabian  west south africa  and venezuela trinidad tobago 
significant demand was seen for all technologies led by drilling measurements  wireline  well testing  and completions systems as customers continued to improve exploration and production performance in the search for new hydrocarbon reserves and in the need to increase production and boost recovery from existing fields 
north america revenue of billion increased marginally over primarily due to higher demand for drilling measurements  well testing and wireline activities in the us land central  us land north and the us gulf coast geomarkets 
however  this performance was offset by pricing erosion in well stimulation activities across the area 
activity across us land continued to grow driven by the increase in rig count and higher service intensity in unconventional natural gas reservoirs 
however  weakness in natural gas prices and excess well stimulation related pressure pumping capacity led to a year on year decline in pricing in stimulation related activities 
the us gulf coast geomarket continued to grow driven by demand for exploration related activities 
in canada year on year revenue declined sharply due to operator slowdown driven by weakness in natural gas prices and uncertainty over the fiscal regime 
pretax operating margin declined by bps to primarily due to lower pricing in well stimulation related activities across the area together with lower activity in canada 
latin america revenue of billion in increased over  led by a surge in ipm related activity in mexico following the budget related slowdowns in the previous year  followed by the growth in exploration related activities in the peru columbia ecuador and latin america south geomarkets 
the venezuela trinidad tobago geomarket also grew with higher rig count driven activity in addition to finalization of the contracts related to drilling barges 

table of contents part ii  item the mexico central america geomarket recorded robust growth with the start of several integrated projects 
peru columbia ecuador and latin america south witnessed strong growth in exploration related activities 
demand was strong for all technologies led by ipm  followed by drilling measurements  wireline and well testing services 
pretax operating margin increased strongly by bps to reach 
this increase resulted mainly from a favorable activity mix and improved pricing 
europe cis africa revenue of billion in increased over with the highest growth recorded in the north sea  west south africa and north africa geomarkets 
strong revenue increases were recorded in the north sea  west south africa and north africa driven by the expansion of exploration related activities 
geomarkets in russia continued to grow strongly due to a combination of organic growth and the completion of the acquisition of tyumenpromgeofizika during the second quarter of the year 
pretax operating margins increased by bps to reach 
this performance was due to a combination of increased activity  improved pricing and accelerated new technology deployment across most geomarkets partially offset by a pricing decline in well stimulation activities in the east russia and subdued activity in nigeria 
middle east asia revenue of billion in increased over with the largest increases recorded in the arabian geomarket  followed by east mediterranean  australia papua new guinea  qatar  gulf and india 
the australia papua new guinea geomarket recorded the highest growth rate in the area driven by higher exploration related activity 
growth in east mediterranean  qatar  gulf and india resulted from higher exploration and development activity while the arabian geomarket continued to grow  albeit at a lower rate than the previous year  as new rig additions slowed down in saudi arabia 
pretax operating margin increased by bps to an impressive 
this performance was driven by continued increase in activity and pricing increases together with deployment of higher margin wireline and drilling measurements new technologies 
westerngeco fourth quarter results fourth quarter revenue of million decreased sequentially and year on year 
pretax operating income of million was lower sequentially and lower year on year 
sequentially  marine revenue decreased significantly due to seasonal vessel transits  dry docks and project startups 
multiclient revenue was also down markedly as customers reduced discretionary spending 
land revenue  however  increased due to higher utilization and the start of new projects in latin america and africa while data processing recorded modest growth 
pretax operating margin decreased sequentially from to due to lower marine vessel utilization  higher transits and the slowdown in multiclient sales  the effects of which were only partially offset by the higher land crew utilization 
total year results full year revenue of billion was lower than multiclient revenue was down  primarily as the result of significantly lower client discretionary spending in the fourth quarter of  while land 
table of contents part ii  item decreased on lower crew utilization 
these decreases were partially offset by a revenue increase in marine  as a result of additional vessel capacity and higher pricing  and a increase in data processing  which experienced a growth in activity in all geographic areas 
pretax operating margin of decreased basis points due to significantly lower multiclient sales  reduced land activity and cost inflation that affected marine operations 
revenue backlog was billion at the end of  compared to billion at the end of  of which an estimated billion is expected to be realized in total year results full year revenue of billion increased versus pretax operating income of billion in was higher than pretax operating margin reached an increase of bps in versus demonstrating continued high vessel utilization  pricing increases in marine and accelerating demand for exploration driven seismic services 
q technology revenue reached billion  representing of full year revenue 
marine revenue grew due mainly to strong activity in asia  middle east  india  europe and north america as operators continued to focus on new exploration horizons 
high vessel utilization  continued adoption of q technology and improved pricing contributed to this performance 
multiclient revenue increased driven by higher sales in north america as the demand for e dog and e cat surveys remained strong during the first half of the year augmented by strong demand for e octopus surveys during the second half 
data processing revenue increased  reflecting higher acquisition volumes  higher levels of q processing  and higher activity in india  asia  north africa  europe and the caspian 
land revenue increased with the continued adoption of q land technology in africa and in the middle east

although these contractual obligations are considered enforceable and legally binding  the terms generally allow schlumberger the option to reschedule and adjust their requirements based on business needs prior to the delivery of goods 
refer to note of the consolidated financial statements for details regarding schlumberger s pension and other postretirement benefit obligations 

table of contents part ii  item as discussed in note of the consolidated financial statements  included in the schlumberger consolidated balance sheet at december  is approximately million of liabilities associated with uncertain tax positions in the over jurisdictions in which schlumberger conducts business 
due to the uncertain and complex application of tax regulations  combined with the difficulty in predicting when tax audits throughout the world may be concluded  schlumberger cannot make reliable estimates of the timing of cash outflows relating to these liabilities 
schlumberger has outstanding letters of credit guarantees which relate to business performance bonds  custom excise tax commitments  facility lease rental obligations  etc 
these were entered into in the ordinary course of business and are customary practices in the various countries where schlumberger operates 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires schlumberger to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses 
the following accounting policies involve critical accounting estimates because they are particularly dependent on estimates and assumptions made by schlumberger about matters that are inherently uncertain 
a summary of all of schlumberger s significant accounting policies is included in note to the consolidated financial statements 
schlumberger bases its estimates on historical experience and on various assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
multiclient seismic data the westerngeco segment capitalizes the costs associated with obtaining multiclient seismic data 
the carrying value of the multiclient seismic data library at december  and was million and million  respectively 
such costs are charged to cost of goods sold and services based on the percentage of the total costs to the estimated total revenue that schlumberger expects to receive from the sales of such data 
however  under no circumstances will an individual survey carry a net book value greater than a year straight line amortized value 
the carrying value of surveys is reviewed for impairment annually as well as when an event or change in circumstance indicates an impairment may have occurred 
adjustments to the carrying value are recorded when it is determined that estimated future revenues  which involve significant judgment on the part of schlumberger  would not be sufficient to recover the carrying value of the surveys 
significant adverse changes in schlumberger s estimated future cash flows could result in impairment charges in a future period 
for purposes of performing the annual impairment test of the multiclient library  future cash flows are analyzed primarily based on two pools of surveys united states and non united states 
the united states and non united states pools were determined to be the most appropriate level at which to perform the impairment review based upon a number of factors including i various macroeconomic factors that influence the ability to successfully market surveys and ii the focus of the sales force and related costs 
certain larger surveys are analyzed for impairment on a survey by survey basis 
these surveys are typically significantly prefunded by customers and accordingly  management has determined that it is not appropriate to include them within the united states and non united states pools for impairment review purposes 

table of contents part ii  item allowance for doubtful accounts schlumberger maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts in order to record accounts receivable at their net realizable value 
a significant amount of judgment is involved in recording and making adjustments to this reserve 
allowances have been recorded for receivables believed to be uncollectible  including amounts for the resolution of potential credit and other collection issues such as disputed invoices 
depending on how such potential issues are resolved  or if the financial condition of schlumberger customers were to deteriorate resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  adjustments to the allowance may be required 
goodwill  intangible assets and long lived assets schlumberger records as goodwill the excess of purchase price over the fair value of the tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired 
statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas  requires goodwill to be tested for impairment annually as well as when an event or change in circumstance indicates an impairment may have occurred 
goodwill is tested for impairment by comparing the fair value of schlumberger s individual reporting units to their carrying amount to determine if there is a potential goodwill impairment 
if the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value  an impairment loss is recorded to the extent that the implied fair value of the goodwill of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value 
for purposes of performing the impairment test for goodwill as required by sfas  schlumberger s reporting units are primarily the geographic areas comprising the oilfield services segment in addition to the westerngeco segment 
schlumberger estimates the fair value of these reporting units using a discounted cash flow analysis and or applying various market multiples 
determining the fair value of a reporting unit is a matter of judgment and often involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions 
schlumberger s estimates of the fair value of each of its reporting units were significantly in excess of their respective carrying values at the time of the annual goodwill impairment tests for  and long lived assets  including fixed assets and intangible assets  are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
in reviewing for impairment  the carrying value of such assets is compared to the estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected from the use of the assets and their eventual disposition 
if such cash flows are not sufficient to support the asset s recorded value  an impairment charge is recognized to reduce the carrying value of the long lived asset to its estimated fair value 
the determination of future cash flows as well as the estimated fair value of long lived assets involves significant estimates on the part of management 
if there is a material change in economic conditions or other circumstances influencing the estimate of future cash flows or fair value  schlumberger could be required to recognize impairment charges in the future 
schlumberger evaluates the remaining useful life of its intangible assets on a periodic basis to determine whether events and circumstances warrant a revision to the remaining estimated amortization period 
income taxes schlumberger s tax filings are subject to regular audit by the tax authorities in most of the over jurisdictions in which it conducts business 
these audits may result in assessments for additional taxes which are resolved with the authorities or  potentially  through the courts 
tax liabilities are recorded based on estimates of additional taxes which will be due upon the conclusion of these audits 
estimates of these tax liabilities are made based upon prior experience and are updated in light of changes in facts and circumstances 
however  due to the uncertain and complex application of tax regulations  it is possible that the ultimate resolution of audits may result in liabilities which could be materially different from these estimates 
in such an event  schlumberger will record additional tax expense or tax benefit in the period in which such resolution occurs 

table of contents part ii  item pension and postretirement benefits schlumberger s pension and postretirement benefit obligations are described in detail in note to the consolidated financial statements 
the obligations and related costs are calculated using actuarial concepts  which include critical assumptions related to the discount rate  expected return on plan assets and medical cost trend rates 
these assumptions are important elements of expense and or liability measurement and are updated on an annual basis  or upon the occurrence of significant events 
the discount rate schlumberger uses reflects the prevailing market rate of a portfolio of high quality debt instruments with maturities matching the expected timing of the payment of the benefit obligations 
the following summarizes the discount rates utilized by schlumberger for its various pension and postretirement benefit plans the discount rate utilized to determine the liability for schlumberger s united states pension plans and postretirement medical plans was at both december  and december  the weighted average discount rate utilized to determine the liability for schlumberger s international pension plans was at december  and at december  the discount rate utilized to determine expense for schlumberger s united states pension plans and postretirement medical plans was increased from in to in the weighted average discount rate utilized to determine expense for schlumberger s international pension plans was increased from in to in a higher discount rate decreases the present value of benefit obligations and decreases expense 
the expected rate of return for our retirement benefit plans represents the average rate of return expected to be earned on plan assets over the period that benefits included in the benefit obligation  are expected to be paid 
the expected rate of return for schlumberger s united states pension plans has been determined based upon expectations regarding future rates of return for the investment portfolio  with consideration given to the distribution of investments by asset class and historical rates of return for each individual asset class 
the expected rate of return on plan assets for the united states pension plans was in and the expected rate of return on plan assets for the international plans was in and a lower expected rate of return would increase pension expense 
schlumberger s medical cost trend rate assumptions are developed based on historical cost data  the near term outlook and an assessment of likely long term trends 
the overall medical cost trend rate assumption utilized in both and was graded to over the next four years and thereafter 
the following illustrates the sensitivity to changes in certain assumptions  holding all other assumptions constant  for the united states and international pension plans stated in millions change in assumption effect on pretax pension expense effect on dec
