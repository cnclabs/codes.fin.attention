item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
statutory accounting principles require reserves to be reported net of reinsurance 
accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  or gaap  require reserves to be reported on a gross basis  ie  before reinsurance  with a corresponding asset established for the reinsurance recoverable 
when compared on a net basis  our statutory and gaap reserves are identical  with the exception of ddr reserves of approximately million and million  at december  and  respectively  which are required to be carried as unearned premium reserves for statutory accounting purposes 
reinsurance 
in accordance with industry practice  we cede to other insurance companies some of the potential liability under insurance policies we have underwritten 
this practice  called reinsurance  helps us reduce our net liability on individual risks  stabilize our underwriting results and increase our underwriting capacity 
however  if the reinsurer fails to meet its obligations  we remain liable for policyholder obligations 
as payment for sharing a portion of our risk  we are also required to share a part of the premium we receive on the related policies 
we determine the amount and scope of reinsurance coverage to purchase each year based upon an evaluation of the risks accepted  consultations with reinsurance brokers and a review of market conditions  including the availability and pricing of reinsurance 
our reinsurance arrangements are generally renegotiated annually 
the following table identifies our principal reinsurers  their percentage of our aggregate reinsured risk based upon amounts recoverable and their respective am best ratings as of december  am best company classifies an a rating as excellent and an a rating as superior

we are not aware of any collectability or credit issues with any of our reinsurers as of december  capital and surplus 
to ensure the security of our policyholders  we must maintain an amount of qualifying assets in excess of total liabilities 
this excess  or surplus  is the principal measure used by state insurance regulators  and rating agencies such as am best company  to evaluate our financial strength 
medical professional liability insurers generally attempt to keep this surplus level at least equal to their annual net premiums written 
the net premiums written to surplus ratio for our insurance subsidiaries was at both december  and competition the medical professional liability insurance industry is highly competitive 
we compete with numerous insurance companies and various self insurance mechanisms 
we believe that the principal competitive factors in our insurance business are service  quality  name recognition  breadth and flexibility of coverages  financial stability and  to a lesser degree  price 
we believe we compare favorably with many of our competitors based on our excellent service to customers  our close relationship with the medical community  primarily through various medical societies  which affords us a high degree of name recognition  our ability to customize product features and programs to fit the needs of our customers and our long history of financial stability 
these factors will vary by state based on the relative strength of our competitors in each market 
am best company rating am best company  or am best  rates the financial strength and ability to meet policyholder obligations of our insurance subsidiaries 
during  our primary insurance subsidiary  american physicians  received an upgrade in its am best rating from b to a our am best rating is the fourth highest of rating levels 
the a rating is considered excellent  and according to am best  companies rated a are deemed secure 
am best assigns an a rating to insurers that have  on average  excellent balance sheet strength  operating performance and business profiles when compared to the standards established by am best  and in am best s opinion  have an excellent ability to meet their ongoing obligations to policyholders 
an insurance company s rating is a potential source of competitive advantage or disadvantage in the marketplace 
rating agencies such as am best evaluate insurance companies based on their financial strength and ability to pay claims  factors that are more relevant to policyholders and potential customers who are purchasing insurance  as well as agents who are advising customers  than investors 
financial strength ratings by rating agencies are not ratings of securities or recommendations to buy  hold  or sell any security 
important agency relationship one of the primary agencies through which we write medical professional liability insurance is scw agency group  inc  or scw 
scw is principally owned by william b 
cheeseman  our former president and chief executive officer and director 
mr 
cheeseman ceased to be an employee of the company at the end of and ceased to be a director in commissions scw receives on premiums it writes for apcapital s insurance subsidiaries typically account for around of its total revenues 
direct premiums written for us by scw during  and totaled million  million and million respectively  representing  and of the company s direct premiums written during such years 
commission expense we incurred related to scw approximated million  million and million in  and  respectively 
the commission rates we have paid to scw have been the same as the commission rates we paid to our other agents 
effective january  we renewed for another five years our contract with scw 
the agreement provides for american physicians to be the exclusive medical professional liability carrier scw represents in the states of michigan  illinois and beginning in october  ohio  subject to limited exceptions  such as a downgrade of our am best rating 
we continue to have the right to appoint other agents in all three of these states 
scw may continue to represent other insurance companies in states other than michigan  illinois and ohio for lines of business other than medical professional liability 
the contract provides for scw to be paid commissions consistent with the marketplace 
insurance regulatory matters general 
insurance companies are subject to supervision and regulation relating to numerous aspects of their business and financial condition in the states in which they transact business 
the nature and extent of such regulation varies from jurisdiction to jurisdiction 
our insurance companies are subject to supervision and regulation by the office of financial and insurance regulation for the state of michigan  or ofir  and other state departments of insurance 
these regulators establish standards of solvency  license insurers and agents  establish guidelines for investments by insurers  review premium rates  review the provisions which insurers must make for current losses and future liabilities  review transactions involving a change in control and require the filing of periodic reports relating to financial condition 
in addition  state regulatory examiners  including ofir  perform periodic financial examinations of insurance companies 
such regulation is generally intended for the protection of policyholders rather than shareholders 
american physicians is licensed to write insurance in a total of states 
however  our current focus of operations is on our core states in the midwest and new mexico 
holding company regulation 
most states  including michigan  have enacted legislation that regulates insurance holding company systems such as ours 
each insurance company in a holding company system is required to register with the insurance supervisory agency of its state of domicile and furnish information concerning the operations of companies within the holding company system that may materially affect the operations  management or financial condition of the insurers within the system 
these laws permit ofir or any other relevant insurance departments to examine apcapital s insurance subsidiaries at any time  to require disclosure of material transactions between apcapital and its insurance subsidiaries  and to require prior approval of sales or purchases of a material amount of assets and the payment of extraordinary dividends 
ofir conducted a financial examination as of december  of each of our three insurance subsidiaries 
no adjustments were proposed as a result of the examinations 
holding company laws also limit the amount of dividends payable by insurance subsidiaries to the parent company 
under michigan law  the maximum dividend that may be paid to apcapital from its insurance subsidiaries during any twelve month period  without prior approval of ofir  is the greater of of each insurance company s statutory surplus  as reported on the most recent annual statement filed with ofir  or the statutory net income  excluding realized gains  for the period covered by such annual statement 
accordingly  million of dividends can be paid in without prior regulatory approval 
however  as dividends totaling million were paid in  the million that can be paid in is subject to limitation based on the timing and amount of the dividends that were paid in the preceding months 
change of control 
the michigan insurance code requires that ofir receive prior notice of and approve a change of control for apcapital or any of its michigan domiciled insurance subsidiaries 
the michigan insurance code contains a complete definition of control 
in simplified terms  a person  corporation  or other entity would obtain control of american physicians or apcapital if they possessed  had a right to acquire possession  or had the power to direct any other person acquiring possession  directly or indirectly  of or more of the voting securities of either company 
to obtain approval for a change of control  the proposed acquirer must file an application with ofir containing detailed information such as the identity and background of the acquirer and its affiliates  the sources of and amount of funds to be used to effect the acquisition  and financial information regarding the proposed acquirer 
risk based capital requirements 
in addition to other state imposed insurance laws and regulations  ofir enforces requirements developed by the national association of insurance commissioners  or naic  that require insurance companies to calculate and report information under a risk based formula that attempts to measure capital and surplus needs based on the risks in a company s mix of products and investment portfolio 
under the formula  we first determine our risk based capital base level by taking into account risks with respect to our assets and underwriting risks relating to our liabilities and obligations 
we then compare our total adjusted capital to the base level 
our total adjusted capital is determined by subtracting our liabilities from our assets in accordance with rules established by ofir 
a ratio of total adjusted capital to risk based capital of less than may give rise to enhanced regulatory scrutiny or even a regulatory takeover of the insurer  depending on the extent to which the ratio is less than the risk based capital ratio for american physicians has always exceeded as of december   american physicians risk based capital base level was million and its total adjusted capital was million  for a ratio of iris requirements 
the naic has also developed a series of financial ratios  referred to as the insurance regulatory information system  or iris  for use by state insurance regulators in monitoring the financial condition of insurance companies 
the naic has established an acceptable range of values for each of the iris financial ratios 
generally  an insurance company will become the subject of increased scrutiny when four or more of its iris ratio results fall outside the range deemed acceptable by the naic 
the nature of increased regulatory scrutiny resulting from iris ratio results outside the acceptable range is subject to the judgment of the applicable state insurance department  but generally will result in accelerated reviews of annual and quarterly filings 
in  american physicians did not generate any iris ratios that varied from values within the naic s acceptable range 
guaranty fund 
we participate in various guaranty associations in the states in which we write business that protect policyholders and claimants against losses due to insolvency of insurers 
when an insolvency occurs  the associations are authorized to assess member companies up to the amount of the shortfall of funds  including expenses 
member companies are assessed based on the type and amount of insurance written during the previous calendar year 
we make estimated accruals for our portion of the assessments as information becomes available 
employees as of december   we had employees 
none of the employees are covered by a collective bargaining unit and we believe that employee relations are good 
uncertainties relating to forward looking statements our reports  filings and other public announcements contain certain statements that describe our management s beliefs concerning future business conditions and prospects  growth opportunities and the outlook for our business and industry based upon information currently available 
such statements are forward looking statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of wherever possible  we have identified these statements with words such as will  should  likely  believes  expects  anticipates  estimates  plans or similar expressions 
our forward looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties and represent our outlook only as of the date of this report 
we claim the protection of the safe harbor for forward looking statements contained in the private securities litigation reform act of for all of our forward looking statements 
while we believe that our forward looking statements are reasonable  you should not place undue reliance on any such forward looking statements  which speak only as of the date made 
because these forward looking statements are based on estimates and assumptions that are subject to significant business  economic and competitive uncertainties  many of which are beyond our control or are subject to change  actual results could be materially different 
factors that might cause such a difference include  without limitation  the risks and uncertainties discussed from time to time in our reports filed with the securities and exchange commission  including those listed in item a risk factors in this report 
other factors not currently anticipated by management may also materially and adversely affect our financial condition  liquidity or results of operations 
except as required by applicable law  we do not undertake  and expressly disclaim  any obligation to publicly update or alter our statements whether as a result of new information  events or circumstances occurring after the date of this report or otherwise 
item a 
risk factors 
an investment in our common stock involves numerous risks and uncertainties 
you should carefully consider the following information about these risks 
any of the risks described below could result in a significant or material adverse effect on our future results of operations  cash flows or financial condition 
we believe the most significant of these risks and uncertainties are as follows increased competition could adversely affect our ability to sell our products at premium rates we deem adequate  which may result in a decrease in premium volume 
the medical professional liability insurance business tends to cycle through what are often referred to as hard and soft markets 
a hard market is generally characterized as a period of rapidly raising premium rates  tightened underwriting standards  narrowed coverage and the withdrawal of insurers from certain markets 
soft markets are usually characterized by relatively flat or slow rising premium rates  less stringent underwriting standards  expanded coverage and strong competition among insurers 
the medical professional liability insurance market is currently in a soft market 
recent industry wide favorable claim trends and the accompanying competitive pressures they bring could adversely impact our ability to obtain rate increases we deem necessary to adequately cover insured risks  which could ultimately result in a decrease in premium volume as physicians currently insured with us elect to place their coverage elsewhere 
our reserves for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses are based on estimates that may prove to be inadequate to cover our losses 
the process of estimating the reserves for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses involves significant judgment and is complex and imprecise due to the number of variables and assumptions inherent in the estimation process 
these variables include the effects on ultimate loss payments of internal factors such as changes in claims handling practices and changes in the mix of our products  as well as external factors such as changes in loss frequency and severity trends  economic inflation  judicial trends and legislative and regulatory changes 
in addition  medical professional liability claims may take several years to resolve due to typical delays in reporting claims to us  the often lengthy discovery process  and the time necessary to defend the claim 
also  claims with similar characteristics may result in very different ultimate losses depending on the state or region where the claim occurred 
all of these factors contribute to the variability in estimating ultimate loss payments  especially since the effects of many of these variables cannot be directly quantified  and may require us to make significant adjustments in our reserves from time to time 
any such adjustments could materially and adversely affect our results of operations for the period with respect to which the adjustment is made 
due to the current volatility of losses in the medical professional liability and workers compensation markets  adjustments have occurred in each of the last several years 
market illiquidity and volatility associated with the current financial crisis makes the fair values of our investments increasingly difficult to estimate  and may have other unforeseen consequences that we are currently unable to predict 
investment securities traded in active markets are valued at quoted market prices 
all other investment securities are valued based on broker quotes or through the use of various pricing models that require the application of judgment in selecting the appropriate assumptions based on observable or unobservable market data 
volatile and illiquid markets increase the likelihood that investment securities may not behave in historically predictable manners  resulting in fair value estimates that are either over or understated compared with actual amounts that could be realized upon disposition or maturity of the security 
in addition  the ultimate effects of the recent market volatility  credit crisis  and overall economic downturn may have unforeseen consequences on the credit quality  liquidity and financial stability of the issuers of securities we hold  or reinsurers with which we do business 
as recent market experience indicates  such deteriorations in financial condition can occur rapidly  leaving us unable to react to such a scenario in a prudent manner consistent with our historical practices in dealing with more orderly markets 
this in turn could adversely and negatively affect our results of operations  liquidity or financial condition 
an interruption or change in current marketing and agency relationships could reduce the amount of premium we are able to write 
we currently carry the endorsement of the michigan state medical society  the new mexico medical society  and other such organizations  which we believe provides us with a competitive advantage 
if the endorsement of these organizations were to lapse  we could see a reduction in our premium volumes in markets such as michigan and new mexico  where such organizations carry influence 
in addition  approximately of our medical professional liability direct premiums written are produced by agencies 
one agency in particular  the scw agency group  inc  produced approximately of our medical professional direct premiums written during each of the last three years 
an interruption or change in the relationship with any of these agencies could adversely and materially impact the amount of premiums we are able to write 
if we are unable to obtain or collect on ceded reinsurance  our results of operations and financial condition may be adversely affected 
we use reinsurance arrangements to limit and manage the amount of risk we retain and stabilize our underwriting results 
the amount and cost of reinsurance available to us is subject  in large part  to prevailing market conditions beyond our control 
our ability to provide insurance at competitive premium rates and coverage limits on a continuing basis depends in large part upon our ability to secure adequate reinsurance in amounts and at rates that are commercially reasonable 
furthermore  we are subject to credit risk with respect to our reinsurers because reinsurance does not relieve us of liability to our insureds for the risks ceded to reinsurers 
a significant reinsurer s inability or refusal to reimburse us under the terms of our reinsurance agreements would result in a charge to income that could materially and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition for the period in which the charge is incurred 
the risk of a reinsurer defaulting on its obligations to us is typically greater in times of economic uncertainty  such as are currently being experienced around the world 
accordingly  we cannot be assured that we will continue to be able to obtain affordable reinsurance from creditworthy reinsurers 
our geographic concentration in certain midwestern states and new mexico ties our performance to the business  economic  regulatory and legislative conditions in those states 
approximately of our total medical professional liability direct premiums written in were written in the states of illinois  michigan  ohio  kentucky and new mexico 
because of this concentration  unfavorable business  economic or regulatory conditions in these states could adversely impact the amount of premiums we are able to write  the costs associated with loss settlement and other expenses 
a downgrade in the am best company rating of our primary insurance subsidiary could reduce the amount of business we are able to write 
rating agencies  such as am best company  rate insurance companies based on financial strength as an indication of a company s ability to meet policyholder obligations 
our primary insurance subsidiary  american physicians  has an am best rating of a excellent 
an insurance company s rating  and in particular its am best rating  can be a potential source of competitive advantage or disadvantage in the marketplace 
accordingly  a downgrade in our am best rating could adversely affect our position in the marketplace and could result in a reduction in the amount of business we are able to write 
changes in interest rates could adversely impact our results of operation  cash flows and financial condition 
a significant portion of our assets are invested in interest bearing fixed income securities 
in recent years  we have earned our investment income primarily from interest income on these investments 
a decrease in prevailing interest rates  as recently experienced  will reduce the return on our investment portfolio as we reinvest the proceeds of securities that mature at rates below those of the securities that mature and our cash and cash equivalent assets earn less interest 
the reduced investment income will also reduce our operating cash flows 
conversely  an increase in interest rates would reduce the carrying value of our available for sale fixed income securities as the market value of these securities is typically inversely related to interest rates  which could result in a charge to income if determined to be other than temporary 
an increase in short term interest rates would also increase the interest payments associated with our long term debt as those obligations pay a variable rate of interest that is in part based on the three month london inter bank offered rate 
any of these consequences may have a material adverse effect on our revenues  cash flows and assets  including the amount of net unrealized appreciation on investments shown on our balance sheet 
the unpredictability of court decisions could have a material impact on our operations 
the financial position or results of operations of our insurance subsidiaries may also be adversely affected by court decisions that expand insurance coverage beyond the intention of the insurer at the time it originally issued an insurance policy 
in addition  a significant jury award  or series of awards  against one or more of our insureds could require us to pay large sums of money in excess of our reserve amounts 
our business could be adversely affected by the loss of one or more key employees 
we are heavily dependent upon our senior management and the loss of the services of our senior executives could adversely affect our business 
our success has been  and will continue to be  dependent on our ability to retain the services of existing key employees and to attract and retain additional qualified personnel in the future 
the loss of the services of key employees or senior managers  or the inability to identify  hire and retain other highly qualified personnel in the future  could adversely affect the quality and profitability of our business operations 
the insurance industry is subject to regulatory oversight that may impact the manner in which we operate our business  our ability to obtain future premium rate increases  the type and amount of our investments  the levels of capital and surplus deemed adequate to protect policyholder interests  or the ability of our insurance subsidiaries to pay dividends to the holding company 
our insurance business is subject to extensive regulation by the applicable state agencies in the jurisdictions in which we operate  and especially by ofir  as our insurance companies are domiciled in that state 
these state agencies have broad regulatory powers designed to protect policyholders  not shareholders or other investors 
these powers include  but are not limited to  the ability to place limitations on the types and amounts of our investments  review and approve or deny premium rate increases  set standards of solvency to be met and maintained  review reserve levels  review change in control transactions  limit the ability to pay dividends  prescribe the form and content of  and to examine  our statutory basis financial statements  and place limitations on our ability to transact business with and between our affiliated insurance companies 
failure to comply with these regulations could result in consequences resulting from a regulatory examination to a regulatory takeover 
if we fail to comply with insurance industry regulations  or if those regulations become more burdensome to us  we may not be able to operate profitably or may be more limited in the amount of dividends our insurance subsidiaries can make to apcapital 
our status as an insurance holding company with no direct operations could adversely affect our ability to meet our debt obligations and fund future share repurchases 
apcapital is an insurance holding company 
as such  it has no ongoing operations and its primary assets are the stock of its insurance subsidiaries 
the availability of cash needed by apcapital to meet its obligations on its outstanding debt  repurchase outstanding shares of its common stock and pay its operating expenses is largely dependent upon dividends that it receives from its insurance subsidiaries 
the payment of dividends by our insurance subsidiaries is regulated by state insurance laws  which restrict the amount of dividends that can be made without prior approval by ofir 
legislative or judicial changes in the tort system may have adverse or unintended consequences that could materially and adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 
changes in laws  at either the national or state level  that limit jury awards for non economic damages relating to medical malpractice claims  commonly referred to as tort reform  could have unintended adverse consequences for insurers 
for example  when tort reform legislation was passed in illinois  the new law made certain reporting requirements regarding rate filings more burdensome 
as a consequence  an increase in claims frequency or severity may adversely affect our results of operations as it may be more difficult to obtain approval from regulators for rate increases we deem necessary 
applicable law and various provisions in our articles and bylaws may prevent and discourage unsolicited attempts to acquire apcapital that you may believe are in your best interests or that might result in a substantial profit to you 
apcapital is subject to provisions of michigan corporate and insurance laws that have the effect of impeding a change of control by requiring prior approval of a change of control transaction by the ofir and the board of directors 
in addition  apcapital s articles of incorporation and bylaws include provisions which allow for the issuance of blank check preferred stock without further shareholder approval  set high vote requirements for certain amendments to the articles of incorporation and bylaws  establish a staggered board  limit the ability of shareholders to call special meetings  and require unanimity for shareholder action taken without a meeting 
these provisions may discourage a takeover attempt that you consider to be in your best interests or in which you would receive a substantial premium over the then current market price 
in addition  approval by the ofir of a change of control transaction may be withheld even if the transaction would be in the shareholders best interest if it determines that the transaction would be detrimental to policyholders 
as a result you may not have an opportunity to participate in such a transaction

critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect amounts reported in the accompanying consolidated financial statements and related notes 
these estimates and assumptions are evaluated on an on going basis based on historical developments  market conditions  industry trends and other information we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
there can be no assurance that actual results will conform to our estimates and assumptions  and that reported results of operations will not be materially adversely affected by the need to make accounting adjustments to reflect changes in these estimates and assumptions from time to time 
adjustments related to changes in estimates are reflected in the company s earnings in the period those estimates changed 
the following policies are those we believe to be the most sensitive to estimates and judgments or involve revenue recognition 
our other accounting policies are described in note to our consolidated financial statements 
unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses our consolidated financial statements include estimated reserves for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses related to our various insurance lines of business 
our actuaries utilize standard actuarial techniques to project ultimate losses 
these projections are prepared using the company s data  including the number of claims reported and paid  and the average severity of reported and paid claims  as well as industry data 
this process assumes that past experience  adjusted for the effects of current developments and anticipated trends  is an appropriate basis for predicting future events 
based on these quantitative as well as other qualitative factors  such as a review of current pricing and underwriting initiatives  an evaluation of reinsurance costs and retention levels  and the current reserving practices of the company s claims department  we select a best estimate of ultimate future losses  and then record this best estimate in the company s consolidated financial statements 
we receive an annual statement of opinion by an independent consulting actuary concerning the adequacy of our reserves  as required by insurance regulatory authorities 
when a claim is reported to us  claims personnel establish a case reserve for the estimated amount of the ultimate payment 
the process of estimating the case reserves reflects an informed judgment based upon insurance reserving practices appropriate for the relevant line of business and on the experience and knowledge of the estimator regarding the nature and value of the specific claim  the severity of injury or damage  and the policy provisions relating to the type of loss 
we also maintain reserves for claims incurred but not reported  commonly referred to as ibnr  to provide for future reporting of already incurred claims and development on reported claims 
these two components  case reserves and the reserve for ibnr claims constitute the liability for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses  and together represent our best estimate of the ultimate cost of settling our claims obligations 
the estimation of the ultimate liability for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses is an inherently uncertain process and does not represent an exact calculation of that liability 
many internal and external factors can influence the estimation process  and even minor changes in assumptions regarding these factors can have a substantial impact on the projection of the ultimate liability 
with lines of business like medical professional liability that often have claims with complex and technical facts and circumstances that take many years to investigate and close  the lack of information available to the claims personnel when a claim is first reported often makes establishing accurate case reserves difficult 
as the discovery phase of the claim proceeds  better information regarding the nature and severity of the claim becomes available  enabling claims personnel to establish a more accurate  often higher  case reserve for the claim 
this process of periodically evaluating and adjusting case reserves results in case reserve development 
this case reserve development is one of the factors that our actuaries consider when establishing ultimate loss estimates 
some of the variables that may impact how they view case reserve development and its impact include internal factors such as our underwriting and claims handling practices and changes in the mix of our products and policy limits offered 
however  our actuaries also consider other factors such as the frequency and severity of reported and ibnr claims 
loss frequency and severity trends are considered in the estimation of the ultimate liability of losses and loss adjustment expenses 
claim frequency is measured in various ways 
the most common measure is the number of claims reported to us and is typically adjusted for the relative exposure  either in terms of the number of insureds or earned premiums 
claim frequency is also measured in terms of the number of claims reported to us on which we make loss payments  also known as indemnity payments  as opposed to claims on which we pay only expenses or close without any payment 
claim frequency impacts not only our projection of the number of ibnr claims associated with our occurrence business  but is also evaluated to determine the cause of changes in frequency 
in periods where claims frequency is declining  we consider whether this means that non meritorious claims are no longer being filed  which would have an impact on the percentage of claims that will ultimately have loss or indemnity payments and which could impact the projection of ultimate losses 
claim severity is often measured on a paid  reported and ultimate basis 
paid severity represents the cost of payments associated with loss settlement and is typically measured as an average of paid losses per claim closed  per claim closed with payment  and per claim closed with a loss settlement payment 
reported severity is usually measured as our average case reserve per open claim 
ultimate severity takes into account not only the severity of losses currently being paid and losses in our open claims inventory  but also a variety of qualitative and quantitative factors 
one such factor considered by the actuaries with low frequency  high severity lines of business such as medical professional liability is a supposition that if fewer claims are reported to us  those claims are likely to have a higher average severity than the average severity of claims associated with a larger population of claims 
implicit in this supposition is an assumption that the claims that are still being reported to us are those of greater merit and potential severity  and the claims that are no longer being reported were the non meritorious claims that were closed at little or no cost 
other external factors such as economic inflation  judicial trends and legislative and regulatory changes can also have a substantial impact on our reserve estimate assumptions 
for example  when tort reform legislation is passed in a state  we estimate its impact on both the frequency and severity of losses 
in addition  we evaluate whether or not the legislation will stand if it is legally challenged in the courts 
as it often takes several years for medical professional liability claims to be resolved three to six years on average from the time the loss is reported the ultimate payment can be difficult to project due to typical delays in reporting claims to us  the often lengthy discovery process  and the time necessary to defend the claim 
in the intervening time  changes in the judicial climate in a given jurisdiction can occur  which can impact the ultimate amount of loss settlement 
substantial changes in the economic environment can also occur during this period 
our actuaries also consider the effects of our various reinsurance treaties  and the varying retention levels and co participations we have on any given year as these will have an impact on the loss reserves we cede to our reinsurers 
all of the above factors contribute to the variability inherent in estimating ultimate loss payments  especially since the effects of many of these variables cannot be directly quantified on a prospective basis 
in accordance with standard actuarial practices  we use a variety of methods when making our reserve estimate projections 
these methods include paid development  incurred development  average loss  and bornhuetter ferguson 
the paid development method estimates ultimate losses by reviewing paid loss patterns and applying them to accident years with further expected changes in paid loss 
the incurred development method is similar to the paid development method  but it uses case incurred losses instead of paid losses 
case incurred losses are defined as paid losses plus the claims department s provision for open claims case reserves 
the average loss method multiplies a projected number of ultimate claims by an estimated ultimate average loss for each accident year to produce ultimate loss estimates 
the bornhuetter ferguson method is a combination of the paid or incurred development method and the average loss method 
the various reserving methods described above produce a range of possible reserve amounts 
the selection of the best estimate reserve within the range requires careful actuarial judgment and analysis of diagnostic statistics such as those described above 
in an effort to better explain the inherent uncertainty in our net loss and loss adjustment expense reserves  we have developed a reasonable range of estimates around the net carried reserves as of december  the range is disclosed and explained in financial condition 
with long tailed  low frequency  high severity lines of business such as medical professional liability  changes in the actuarially projected ultimate loss frequency and severity can have an even greater impact on the balance of recorded reserves than with most other property and casualty insurance lines 
while we believe that our estimates of ultimate projected losses are adequate based on information known to us  there can be no assurance that additional significant reserve changes will not be necessary in the future given the many variables inherent in such estimates and the extended period of time that it can take for claim patterns to emerge 
the assumptions and methodologies used in estimating and establishing the reserve for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses are continually reviewed and any adjustments are reflected as income or expense in the period in which the adjustment is made 
historically  such adjustments have not exceeded of our recorded net reserves as of the beginning of the period  but they can materially affect our results of operations when an adjustment is made 
due to the current volatility of losses in the medical professional liability industry  adjustments were necessary in each of the last several years 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for a table showing changes in the loss reserve during each of the last three years  which table is incorporated herein by reference 
with the exception of reserves for extended reporting period claims discussed below  we do not discount our reserves to recognize the time value of money 
investments the company classifies all investment securities as either held to maturity or available for sale at the date of purchase based on the company s ability and intent to hold individual securities until they mature 
in addition  on a periodic basis  the company reviews its fixed income and equity security portfolio for proper classification as trading  available for sale or held to maturity 
based on such a review in  we transferred a significant portion of our fixed income security portfolio from the available for sale category to the held to maturity category 
securities were transferred at their estimated fair value 
any unrealized gains or losses  net of taxes  at the date of transfer continue to be reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income  and are being amortized over the remaining life of the securities through other comprehensive income 
available for sale fixed income and equity securities are reported at their estimated fair value  with any unrealized gains and losses reported net of any related tax effects  as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income 
any change in the estimated fair value of available for sale investment securities during the period is reported as unrealized appreciation or depreciation  net of any related tax effects  in other comprehensive income 
held to maturity securities  other than those transferred to the held to maturity category as described above  are carried at amortized cost 
investment income includes amortization of premium and accrual of discount for both held to maturity and available for sale securities on the yield to maturity method if investments are acquired at other than par value 
the fair values of our investment securities are determined by following the guidance and hierarchy in sfas no 
if securities are traded in active markets  quoted prices are used to measure fair value level 
if quoted prices are not available  prices are obtained from various independent pricing vendors based on pricing models that consider a variety of observable inputs level 
benchmark yields  prices for similar securities in active markets and quoted bid or ask prices are just a few of the observable inputs utilized 
prices determined by the model are then compared with prices provided by other pricing vendors and against prior prices to confirm that deviations are within tolerable limits 
if the pricing vendors are unable to provide a current price for a security  a fair value is developed using alternative sources based on a variety of less objective assumptions and inputs level 
we currently have only two level securities in our investment portfolio  which are publicly traded equity securities 
we have two level securities  one of which is valued by a pricing vendor using a pricing model as discussed above 
however  due to a lack of comparable values from other pricing vendors with which to validate the fair value of this security  we have elected to classify this security as a level the other level security is valued based on cash flows  interest rate and other assumptions made by us  and results in a fair value for the security that approximates its par value 
the rest of our fixed income security portfolio consists of securities deemed to be level  and are valued in accordance with the processes and procedures discussed above and in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report for level fair values 
we periodically review our investment portfolio for any potential credit quality or collection issues and for any securities with respect to which we consider a decline in fair value to be other than temporary 
investments which are considered to be other than temporarily impaired  or otti  are written down to their estimated fair value as of the end of the period in which the otti was noted and the amount written down is recognized as a current period expense 
subsequent recoveries in the fair value of impaired securities are not reported in income  but rather as unrealized gains  net of tax  in comprehensive income 
inherent in our evaluation of a particular security are assumptions and estimates about the operations of the issuer  and its future liquidity and earnings potential 
some of the factors considered in evaluating whether a decline in fair value is other than temporary are our ability and intent to retain the investment for a period of time sufficient to allow for an anticipated recovery in value  the recoverability of principal and interest related to the security  the duration and extent to which the fair value has been less than cost for equity securities  or amortized cost for fixed maturity securities  the financial condition  near term and long term earnings and cash flow prospects of the issuer  including relevant industry conditions and trends  and implications of rating agency actions  and the specific reasons that a security is in a significant unrealized loss position  including market conditions that could affect access to liquidity 
during we recorded an expense of  related to the impairment of bonds whose decline in fair value was deemed to be other than temporary 
these bonds were subsequently sold in  with a gain of  based on the new cost basis  recognized upon their sale 
we recorded no expenses for otti charges during at december  we had approximately million of unrealized losses on our available for sale investment security portfolio and million of unrecognized losses on our held to maturity investment security portfolio 
approximately million of the held to maturity unrecognized losses pertained to securities that had been in an unrecognized loss position for more than twelve months 
all unrealized or unrecognized losses at december  were considered to be interest rate related and temporary in nature 
for further information regarding the nature and amounts of these unrealized and unrecognized losses  see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report 
reserve for extended reporting period claims a portion of the coverage that physicians purchase under claims made policies is for an additional death  disability and retirement  or ddr  insurance benefit 
this ddr coverage provides coverage to the physician for any prior incidents occurring during the coverage period that are reported after their death  disability or retirement 
the loss exposure associated with this product is known as extended reporting period claims 
the reserve for extended reporting period claims coverage is recorded during the term of the original claims made policy  based on the present value of future estimated benefits  including morbidity and mortality assumptions  less the present value of expected future premiums associated with this ddr coverage 
the reserves for these claims fluctuate based on the number of physicians who are eligible for this coverage and their age 
any changes in the ddr reserves are reflected as an expense in the period in which we become aware that an adjustment is necessary 
at december  and  our recorded ddr reserves were million and million  respectively  which include a discount related to the present value calculation of approximately million and million  respectively 
revenue recognition insurance premium income is generally recognized on a daily pro rata basis over the respective terms of the policies in force  which is generally one year 
certain extended reporting endorsements  often referred to as tail coverage  allow extended reporting of insured events after the termination of the original claims made policy by modifying the exposure period of the underlying contract 
tail coverage can modify the exposure period for a definite or indefinite period 
premiums associated with tail policies that provide coverage for a definite period are earned over the period additional coverage is provided using the daily pro rata method 
premiums for tail policies that provide additional coverage for an indefinite period are fully earned at the date of issuance 
unearned premiums represent the portion of premiums written which are applicable to the unexpired terms of policies in force 
reinsurance reinsurance premiums and losses related to reinsured business are accounted for on bases consistent with those used in accounting for the original policies issued and the terms of the reinsurance contracts 
premiums ceded to other companies are reported as a reduction of premium income 
reinsured losses incurred are reported as a reduction of gross losses incurred 
prior to  a portion of the policyholder premium ceded to the reinsurers under our primary professional liability reinsurance contract was swing rated  or experience rated  on a retrospective basis 
these swing rated contracts were subject to a minimum and maximum premium range to be paid to the reinsurers depending upon the extent of losses ultimately paid by the reinsurers 
under these treaties  we paid a provisional premium during the initial policy year  and recorded a liability that represented our best estimate of the additional premium due under the treaty based on the reinsurers expected ultimate experience under the treaty 
as this estimated liability for future premium payments relied upon our ceded reserve estimates to project the reinsurers anticipated ultimate experience under the treaty  changes in our actuarially estimated ceded loss and loss adjustment expense reserves would also have an impact on the estimated liability for additional premiums 
at december   we had a liability of million recorded for additional premiums under these swing rated treaties 
this represents the maximum amount of additional premiums that could be due under such treaties 
our reinsurance treaties effective on or after january   although no longer swing rated  do contain profit sharing provisions 
in accordance with these provision  if the reinsurers experience under the treaties is favorable  that is the treaties are profitable from the reinsurers perspective  a percentage of the reinsurers profit would be due back to us 
recorded ceded loss experience as of december  does not indicate that any such profit sharing is due back to us 
we commuted our medical professional liability reinsurance treaty agreement effective december  the million of consideration under the commutation  consisting of million in cash and the reduction of swing rated premiums payable of million  were recorded as a reduction of losses and loss adjustment expenses paid thereby reducing losses and loss adjustment expenses incurred in the current year 
in connection with the commutation we released the reinsurers from their obligations under the treaty of million thereby increasing losses and loss adjustment expenses incurred 
the net effect of the commutation was a decrease in losses and loss adjustment expenses of  we evaluate each of our ceded reinsurance contracts at inception to determine if there is sufficient risk transfer to allow the contract to be accounted for as reinsurance under current accounting guidance 
at december  all ceded contracts are accounted for as risk transferring contracts 
we review the financial stability of all of our reinsurers each quarter 
this review includes a ratings analysis  as well as the most recent financial information  of each reinsurer participating in a reinsurance contract 
at december   there were no known issues with the financial solvency of our reinsurers or their ultimate ability to pay amounts due to us 
if we determine that the ultimate ability of a reinsurer is uncertain  we would be required to recognize a reserve and a corresponding expense in the period in which the determination is made 
our reinsurance arrangements are discussed in more detail in item business medical professional liability operations and in item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations results of operations compared to and in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report 
income taxes we estimate our income tax expense based on the best information available to us at year end 
this income tax expense includes a provision for those income taxes that are currently payable  as well as a provision for the deferred impact of certain deductible and taxable temporary differences 
in the months subsequent to the calendar year end  we prepare and file our income tax returns and evaluate any differences between the provisions we recorded in the previous year and the actual amounts per the filed tax returns 
these return to provision differences are recorded as adjustments to income tax expense in the period in which they are identified 
return to provision adjustments for each of the three years ended december  were less than  deferred federal income tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the estimated future tax consequences attributable to the difference between financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities  and their respective tax bases 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date 
a determination must be made for deferred tax assets regarding whether it is more likely than not that sufficient taxable income will exist in future periods when deductible temporary differences are expected to reverse to enable the company to realize the benefit of its deferred tax assets 
if it is determined that it is more likely than not that sufficient taxable income will not exist  a valuation allowance must be recorded for the portion of deferred tax assets the company likely will not realize 
at december  and all deferred tax assets were deemed to be recoverable and no valuation allowance was recorded 
we record any excess tax benefits related to employee share based awards as a credit to additional paid in capital in the year that they are currently deductible in the company s consolidated tax return 
in addition  financial accounting standards board fasb interpretation no 
fin  accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
 accounting for income taxes  requires management to identify  estimate and disclose positions they have taken where the income tax treatment of the position taken is not certain 
our evaluation of the deductibility or taxability of items included in the company s tax returns has not resulted in the identification of any material  uncertain tax positions 
deferred policy acquisition costs deferred policy acquisition costs  or dac  are those costs that vary with and are primarily related to the production of new or renewal business 
costs such as commissions and premium taxes are related to new or renewal business production 
other costs  such as employee salaries  bonuses and benefits  must be allocated between that portion that pertains to new or renewal business production and that which does not 
such cost estimates are made on a department by department basis and are based on time studies 
these policy acquisition costs are deferred and amortized over the period in which the related premiums are earned 
under gaap  the premiums that will be earned in future periods  to which these deferred costs relate  must produce sufficient profits to offset the future expense that will be recognized from the amortization of the dac  that is  the dac must be recoverable 
in evaluating the recoverability of dac  we have made certain assumptions regarding the future amount and timing of costs associated with the business written  such as costs to maintain the policies and the ultimate projected loss and loss adjustment expense payments associated with these policies 
in addition  we have considered future investment income  at an assumed yield  in determining the recoverability of dac 
based on our analysis as of december   the dac of million carried on the consolidated balance sheets  included elsewhere in this report  was deemed to be fully recoverable 
overview of apcapital we are an insurance holding company whose financial performance is heavily dependent upon the results of operations of our insurance subsidiaries 
our insurance subsidiaries are property and casualty insurers that write almost exclusively medical professional liability insurance for physicians and other healthcare professionals throughout the united states  but principally in the midwest and new mexico 
as a property and casualty insurer  our profitability is primarily driven by our underwriting results  which are measured by subtracting incurred loss and loss adjustment expenses and underwriting expenses from net premiums earned 
while our underwriting gain loss is a key performance indicator of our operations  it is not uncommon for a property and casualty insurer to generate an underwriting loss  yet earn a profit overall  because of the availability of investment income to offset the underwriting loss 
an insurance company earns investment income on what is commonly referred to as the float 
the float is money that we hold  in the form of investments  from premiums that we have collected 
while a substantial portion of the premiums we collect will ultimately be used to make claim payments and to pay for claims adjustment expenses  the period that we hold the float prior to paying losses can extend over several years  especially with a long tailed line of business such as medical professional liability 
the key factors that determine the amount of investment income we are able to generate are the rate of return  or yield  on invested assets and the length of time we are able to hold the float 
we focus on the after tax yield of our investments  as significant tax savings can be realized on bonds that pay interest that is exempt from federal income taxes 
for further information regarding the operations of our medical professional liability insurance business is discussed in detail in item business medical professional liability operations 
description of ratios and other metrics analyzed we measure our performance using several different ratios and other key metrics 
these ratios and other metrics are calculated on a gaap basis and include underwriting gain or loss this metric measures the overall profitability of our insurance underwriting operations 
it is the gain or loss that remains after deducting net loss and loss adjustment expenses and underwriting expenses incurred from net premiums earned 
we use this measure to evaluate the underwriting performance of our insurance operations in relation to peer companies 
loss ratio this ratio compares our losses and loss adjustment expenses incurred  net of reinsurance  to our net premiums earned  and indicates how much we expect to pay policyholders for claims and related settlement expenses compared to the amount of premiums we earn 
the calendar year loss ratio uses all losses and loss adjustment expenses incurred in the current calendar year ie  related to all accident years 
the accident year loss ratio  which is a non gaap financial measure  uses only those loss and loss adjustment expenses that relate to the current accident year ie  excludes the effect of development on prior year loss reserves 
we believe the accident year loss ratio is useful in evaluating our current underwriting performance  as it focuses on the relationship between current premiums earned and losses incurred related to the current year 
in the case of each loss ratio  calendar year or accident year  the lower the percentage  the more profitable our insurance business is  all else being equal 
underwriting expense ratio this ratio compares our expenses to obtain new business and renew existing business  plus normal operating expenses  to our net premiums earned 
the ratio is used to measure how efficient we are at obtaining business and managing our underwriting operations 
the lower the percentage  the more efficient we are  all else being equal 
sometimes  however  a higher underwriting expense ratio can result in better business as more rigorous risk management and underwriting procedures may result in the non renewal of higher risk accounts  which can in turn improve our loss ratio  and overall profitability 
the determination of which expenses should be classified as underwriting expenses can vary from company to company 
accordingly  comparability of underwriting expense ratios among and between various companies may be limited 
combined ratio this ratio equals the sum of our loss ratio and underwriting expense ratio 
the lower the percentage  the more profitable our insurance business is 
this ratio excludes the effects of investment income 
as the underwriting expense ratio is a component of the overall combined ratio  comparability between companies may be limited for the reasons discussed above 
investment yield investment yield represents the average return on investments as determined by dividing investment income for the period by the average ending monthly investment balance for the period 
as we use average month ending balances  the yield for certain individual asset classes that are subject to fluctuations in a given month  such as cash and cash equivalents  may be skewed slightly 
however  we believe that when calculated for the cash and invested asset portfolio in its entirety  the overall investment yield is an accurate and reliable measure for evaluating investment performance 
we calculate investment yields using pre tax investment income  which excludes the tax savings benefits of certain tax exempt securities 
our calculation of investment yields may differ from those employed by other companies 
these ratios  when calculated using our reported statutory results  will differ from the gaap ratios as a result of differences in accounting between the statutory basis of accounting and gaap 
additionally  the denominator for the underwriting expense ratio for gaap is net premiums earned  compared to net premiums written for the statutory underwriting expense ratio 
in addition to these measures of operating performance  we also use certain measures to monitor our premium writings and price level changes 
we measure policy retention by comparing the number of policies that were renewed during a given period with the number of policies that expired 
this retention ratio helps us to measure our success at retaining insured accounts 
we also monitor our insured physician count  which counts the number of doctor equivalents associated with all policies 
for this purpose a corporation or ancillary health care provider on a policy is assigned a value of one doctor equivalent 
when used in conjunction with the retention ratio  the insured physician count helps us to monitor the overall increase or decrease in insureds that comprise our premium base 
as a way of evaluating our capital management strategies we measure and monitor our return on equity  or roe  in addition to our results of operations 
we measure roe as our net income for the period  annualized if necessary  divided by our total shareholders equity as of the beginning of the period 
other companies sometimes calculate roe by dividing annualized net income by an average of beginning and ending shareholders equity 
accordingly  the roe percentage we provide may not be comparable with those provided by other companies 
we use a modified version of roe as the basis for determining performance based compensation 
we also track the book value per common share outstanding  which is calculated by dividing shareholders equity as of the end of the period by the total number of common shares outstanding at that date 
evaluating the relationship between the book value per common share and the cost of a common share in the open market helps us compare our stock value with that of our peers and to determine the relative premium that the market places on our stock and the stock of our peers 
results of operations the following table sets forth our results of operations for the years ended december   and on a consolidated basis

the percentage change represents the items change relative to its impact on net income 
a positive percentage change indicates a change in that line item representing an increase to net income  while a negative percentage change represents a decrease to net income 
compared to net income decreased million  or  from to  primarily as a result of decreases in our underwriting gain million and investment income million  partially offset by a million decrease in federal income tax expense 
the underwriting gain decrease was largely the result of a increase in our accident year loss ratio  million less favorable prior year development and a slight increase in our underwriting expense ratio 
our investment income decreased due to the purchase of additional tax exempt securities  which have a lower pre tax yield than comparable quality corporate or mortgage backed securities  and decreases in short term interest rates throughout the million decrease in federal income tax expense was largely attributable to the million decrease in pre tax investment income 
however  the aforementioned purchase of additional tax exempt investment securities produced additional tax savings as well 
premiums the following table shows our direct premiums written by major geographical market as well as total net premiums written and earned for the years ended december  and change dollar percentage dollars in thousands medical professional liability michigan illinois ohio new mexico kentucky all other total direct premiums written net premiums written net to direct premiums written net premiums earned for the year ended december   direct premiums written were down million  or compared with the decrease in direct premiums written for was almost exclusively the result of premium rate reductions  which averaged across all markets in this compares with a decrease in our retention ratio in was  improving from in  and we ended with  insureds  down from year end our average in force premium decreased to approximately  at december   from  at december  the decrease in the average in force premium was primarily the result of the rate decreases discussed above  partially offset by the effect of new policies issued in new business production increased million in to million 
the rate decreases instituted over the last two to three years have been in response to favorable claim trends noted in virtually all markets of the medical professional liability industry 
as these favorable claim trends appear to be industry wide  other medical professional liability insurers have lowered their rates as well  increasing the overall level of price competition in the industry 
we anticipate that the medical professional liability insurance pricing environment will remain highly competitive in  and that if current claim trends hold  additional premium rate decreases are likely 
we plan to adhere to our philosophy of underwriting discipline and adequate pricing  and focusing on retaining our quality book of business 
this strategy may result in the additional loss of premium volume 
however  we remain focused on the overall underwriting results  and not merely top line revenue growth 
the decrease in net premiums written was relatively consistent with the decrease in direct premiums written 
the terms of our reinsurance treaty were very similar to those in the treaty  both in terms of coverage and premium rates 
however  there was a small increase  approximately  in the premium rate charged in compared with  which accounted for the decrease in net premiums written as a percentage of direct premiums written from to our reinsurance treaty contains terms and rates that are similar to those of the treaty effective in as such  we anticipate that our net premiums written  as a percentage of direct  would remain at approximately 
net premiums earned decreased  compared with the decrease in direct and net premiums written of and  respectively 
the decrease in net premiums earned was greater than premiums written in due to the time delay between when premiums are written versus earned 
premiums are earned pro rata over the policy term  usually one year 
therefore  premiums written in will be earned partially in and partially in depending on when the premium was written in accordingly  the premiums earned in related to premiums that were written in and  whereas premiums earned in were attributable to premiums written during and loss and loss adjustment expenses the following table shows the current year verses prior year composition of our net incurred loss and loss adjustment expenses for the years ended december  and change dollar percentage dollars in thousands losses and loss adjustment expenses current year losses prior year development subtotal commutation impact on prior year losses total net incurred loss and lae loss ratio accident year prior years calendar year the percentage change represents the items change relative to its impact on net income 
a positive percentage change indicates a change in that line item representing an increase to net income  while a negative percentage change represents a decrease to net income 
net incurred loss and loss adjustment expenses  which we refer to collectively as losses  decreased million in approximately million of this decrease was the result of the commutation of our medical professional liability reinsurance treaty 
as discussed in critical accounting policies  our reinsurance treaties for policy years and prior were swing rated 
as the swing rated premiums under the treaty were accrued at the maximum  we recognized a gain on the commutation as the profit margin required by the reinsurers under the terms of the commutation was slightly less than additional accrued premiums 
absent the gain on the commutation  incurred losses decreased million 
of the million decrease  million pertained to the current accident year  while favorable development on prior accident years loss reserves decreased  resulting in a million increase in net incurred losses 
the decrease in current accident year losses was attributable to the decrease in net earned premium volume  partially offset by a increase in the accident year loss ratio to for the increase in the accident year loss ratio was due to the premium rate decreases taken in recent years  partially offset by the continued favorable development on prior years loss reserves 
of the million of favorable prior year development  excluding the million effect of the treaty year commutation  million was attributable to medical professional liability reserves  partially offset by million of unfavorable development on workers compensation reserves 
this compares with million of favorable development and million of unfavorable development on medical professional liability and workers compensation loss reserves  respectively  in as discussed in critical accounting policies  the effect of changes in claims frequency introduces a great deal of variability in our reserve estimation process 
we have a practice of being cautious with the assumptions we make concerning emerging trends in claim frequency and severity and do not immediately reflect the impact that any short term declines in frequency may have on our ultimate losses 
in addition  because the historical claims data we use to project future expected results covers more than years  the impact of recent claims trends is often moderated by the substantial pool of historical data 
however  we have now experienced the trend of declining claim frequency and relatively stable paid loss severity for several years in a row  and as a result these trends will begin to be more fully reflected in our reserve assumptions 
as a result of the continued better than expected reported claim frequency and relatively stable paid loss severity  we again experienced favorable development on prior years medical professional liability loss reserves in while claim frequency has declined and paid loss severity remained consistent  our average net case reserves  a potential indicator of future paid claim severity  has been increasing over the last several years 
the following table shows our reported claim frequency  average net paid loss and average net case reserve per open claim over the last five years 
we calculate the average net paid loss by dividing net paid losses for the year by the number of claims closed with a payment  indemnity or expense 
average reported average net case claim net paid reserve per frequency loss open claim the adverse development on workers compensation prior years loss reserves is mostly attributable to increases in the medical portion of indemnity loss reserves on a small number of claims 
with lines of business such as workers compensation where it can take a long time for claims to ultimately be resolved and settled  it is often difficult to ascertain whether increases in case reserves represent a strengthening of the case reserves or if the increases are indicative of an increase in the ultimate severity of the claims 
while we believe that the reserve increases in represent reserve strengthening  we have taken a reasonably cautious approach with regard to the overall reserve levels  which is the reason for the adverse development in as noted in the section financial condition  reserves for unpaid loss and loss adjustment expenses  reserves are inherently uncertain and the ultimate cost to settle claims will likely be more or less than currently anticipated 
actual claim experience will dictate the magnitude and nature  whether favorable or unfavorable  of any future development 
our reserve estimate at december  reflects our best estimate of the future liability as of that date 
however  if current trends continue  we believe that the actual claim experience is more likely to emerge favorably than unfavorably 
underwriting expenses underwriting expenses decreased million  or  in the decrease in underwriting expenses was primarily attributable to the decline in our premium volume and the corresponding decline in those expenses that vary with premium volume 
the underwriting expense ratio increased to in  from in the increase in the underwriting expense ratio was also attributable to our decline in premiums  as we had a lower premium base over which to spread underwriting costs that do not vary with premium volume  such as depreciation  property taxes and other overhead related costs  as well as certain personnel related expenses 
we anticipate that our underwriting expense ratio will increase approximately to in as we launch our new policy and claims system 
many of the costs related to this project have been capitalized over the last months 
with the launch of certain aspects of this new system in the fourth quarter of  and with the remaining portions of the system coming on line in the first half of  we have begun to amortize those costs that we have capitalized 
in addition  salary and benefit costs associated with internal staff who have worked on the development project will no longer be capitalized  which will further increase the underwriting expense ratio 
we believe that the new system will allow us to operate our business more efficiently  thus ultimately enabling us to reduce expenses in the future 
for further discussion of the amortization expense relating to the system  see property  equipment and depreciation in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
investment income investment income decreased million  or in there were two primary factors driving the decrease in investment income 
the first was the decline in short term interest rates throughout  which accounted for approximately million of the decrease 
the second factor was our continued purchase of tax exempt securities in during  we purchased additional tax exempt securities 
these securities replaced higher yielding  taxable corporate and government agency securities that matured  were called  sold or paid down during this shift from higher yielding corporate and government agency securities to lower yielding tax exempt securities accounted for approximately million of the decrease in investment income 
overall our pre tax investment yield for was  a decrease of basis points compared to a yield of for on a net of tax basis  the decline in the investment yield was not as significant  dropping only basis points to for  compared with for while investment markets are likely to remain volatile in  we believe our portfolio  with its emphasis on high quality municipal  corporate and government agency mortgage backed securities  is well positioned to provide solid returns in net realized losses of million in were largely the result of a pre tax charge of million for the impairment of bonds issued by cit group 
although we believed that the ultimate collectability of these securities was not at issue  consistent with our philosophy of maintaining a strong  high quality asset base and thereby protecting the strength of our financial position  we elected to dispose of the securities in question early in the second quarter of to mitigate any further down side risk from continued declines in the market value of these securities 
as the decision to sell the securities was made prior to the release of our first quarter results  the impairment charge was recorded in our first quarter results 
other expenses other expenses consisted of the following for the years ended december  and change dollar percentage dollars in thousands other expenses investment expenses interest expense general and administrative expenses other total other expenses decreased by approximately million 
the decrease was primarily attributable to the decrease in short term interest rates  which reduced the amount of interest expense associated with our long term debt 
we repaid million of our outstanding million in long term debt in the third quarter of  which should reduce the amount of interest in subsequent periods by approximately  per quarter  based on the rates in effect for the fourth quarter of the decrease in general and administrative expenses was the result of reduced legal and other professional service expenses as we have worked to reduce these fees where possible 
federal income taxes the effective tax rate for was compared with for the decrease in effective tax rate was mostly the result of the increase allocation of our investment portfolio to tax exempt securities 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report for a complete reconciliation of the effective tax rate 
compared to net income increased million  or  in compared to  primarily as the result of favorable development on prior years loss reserves  which totaled million in compared to million in partially offsetting the increase in favorable development were declines in realized gains and investment income  and an increase in federal income tax expense 
although net premiums earned decreased million  this was largely offset by a million decrease in current accident year losses and a  decrease in underwriting expenses 
the decreases in accident year losses and underwriting expenses were largely the result of the lower premium volume 
the significant amount of favorable prior year development experienced in was the result of favorable loss trends experienced throughout premiums the following table shows our direct premiums written by major geographical market as well as total net premiums written and earned for the years ended december  and change dollar percentage dollars in thousands medical professional liability michigan illinois ohio new mexico kentucky all other subtotal exited lines of business total direct premiums written net premiums written net to direct premiums written net premiums earned direct premiums written decreased in overall our retention rate in was good  with of policies that expired renewing 
as a result of our retention ratio  our insured physician count decreased only to  at december  from  at december  however  premium rates decreased an average of  and there were minor changes in the composition of our book of business  especially in illinois where we saw a decrease in the number of insureds representing higher risk  higher premium specialties 
although these accounts were largely replaced  they were replaced with policies that had a lower annual premium 
net premiums written did not decrease as significantly as direct premiums written in as a result of an increase in our loss retention to million in  from  in as a result of our increased retention  our ceded premiums written as a percentage of direct premiums written decreased to in  from in premiums are generally earned pro rata over the policy term  usually one year  and as a result fluctuations in earned premiums typically lag fluctuations in written premium 
accordingly  net premiums earned during did not decline as much as net premiums written as we continued to earn in some of the higher premium volume that was written in loss and loss adjustment expenses the decrease in incurred loss and loss adjustment expenses from to was primarily attributable to million of favorable development on prior years loss reserves in  compared with million in in addition  the reduced exposure resulting from the decline in net premiums earned accounted for approximately million of the overall million decrease 
the remaining million of the decrease in incurred losses was the result of a decrease in the current accident year loss ratio  which decreased in spite of the overall premium rate decrease due to the adjustment of the historical loss experience for the significant favorable prior year development recognized in the favorable prior year development in was the result of continued positive trends in claim frequency and relative stability in average paid loss severity 
although we had experienced several consecutive years of declining claim frequency prior to  we had been cautious with regard to recognizing its benefit on ultimate loss estimates 
however  reported claims decreased an additional in and we began to reflect the decline in claims frequency in our ultimate loss estimates as it appeared the decline was in fact a valid trend and not merely an anomaly 
underwriting expenses underwriting expenses decreased  or  in compared with the decrease in underwriting expenses was largely attributable to the decline in net premiums earned  which decreased in compared to  partially offset by  of additional underwriting expense in for costs incurred in connection with the development of our new policy and claims system 
these cost primarily related to activities that could not be capitalized  such as data migration 
investment income investment income decreased million  or in compared to the decrease in investment income in compared to was due to the same factors that caused the decrease in from  principally decreasing short term interest rates and the reinvestment of the proceeds from the maturity or call of higher yielding corporate  government sponsored agency and mortgage backed securities in lower yielding tax exempt municipal bonds 
short term rates did not start decreasing until late in the third quarter of and the turnover in our long term bond portfolio was not as significant in as in  so the impact of these items on investment income compared with was not as significant as the impact in compared to however  investment income in also suffered from a decrease in the undistributed earnings of equity method investees  which decreased from million in to less than million in the decrease in income attributable to equity method investees was the result of the sale of our investment in pic florida in and the absence of gains from the sale of investment real estate property in our real estate llc investment 
the overall pre tax yield on our cash and invested asset portfolio for was  a decrease of basis points when compared with a yield for on a net of tax basis the overall yield for decreased only basis points to from for the net realized losses of  in were the result of a few individually insignificant security sales 
the net realized gain of million reported for the year ended december  was the result of the sale of some of our investment real estate  which resulted in a realized gain of million 
in addition  the sale of proassurance common stock  which we received in exchange for physicians insurance company of wisconsin  or picw  stock in connection with proassurance s acquisition of picw in  resulted in a realized gain of million 
these realized gains in were partially offset by approximately  of impairment charges 
other expenses other expenses for the years ended december  and consisted of the following 
change dollar percentage dollars in thousands other expenses investment expenses interest expense general and administrative expenses other total the overall increase in other expenses was the result of moderate increases in investment expenses due to increased software license fees  and interest expense as a result of a minor increase in the variable interest rate on our million of outstanding debt obligations 
general and administrative expenses increased  primarily as a result of fees and other expenses incurred in connection with the exploration of select merger and acquisition activities 
true other expenses  which consist of costs related to exit activities  such as termination benefits for our workers compensation employees or changes in estimated cash flows relating to sub leased office space in chicago  illinois  actually produced revenue of  in this was primarily the result of a reduction in future estimated variable costs associated with leased office space in chicago  illinois 
federal income taxes the effective tax rate for was compared to for the increase in the effective tax rate  despite an increase in our tax exempt security interest  was a function of the release of  of reserves for uncertain tax positions in  which created a tax benefit  as well as an increase in tax expense in due to an increase in non deductible expenses 
the reserve for uncertain tax positions was released in upon the realization of a refund related to an amendment of a prior years tax return 
the increase in non deductible expenses in pertains primarily to executive compensation in excess of tax deductible limits 
liquidity and capital resources the primary sources of our liquidity  on both a short and long term basis  are funds provided by insurance premiums collected  net investment income  recoveries from reinsurers  proceeds from the maturity or sale of invested assets and principal receipts from our mortgage backed securities 
the primary uses of cash  on both a short and long term basis  are losses  loss adjustment expenses  operating expenses  the acquisition of invested assets and fixed assets  reinsurance premiums  interest payments  taxes  the repayment of long term debt  the payment of cash dividends on apcapital common stock and the repurchase of apcapital s outstanding common stock 
based on historical trends  market and regulatory conditions and our current business plans  we believe that our existing resources and sources of funds  including possible dividend payments from our insurance subsidiaries to apcapital  will be sufficient to meet our short and long term liquidity needs 
however  these trends  conditions and plans are subject to change  and there can be no assurance that our available funds will be sufficient to meet our liquidity needs in the future 
in addition  any acquisition or other extraordinary transaction we may pursue outside of the ordinary course of business could require that we raise additional capital 
parent company apcapital s only material assets are cash and the capital stock of american physicians and its other subsidiaries 
apcapital s cash flow consists primarily of dividends and other permissible payments from its subsidiaries and investment earnings on funds held 
the payment of dividends to apcapital by its insurance subsidiaries is subject to certain limitations imposed by applicable law 
these limitations are described more fully in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
such cross referenced information is incorporated herein by reference 
in accordance with these limits  american physicians could pay ordinary dividends to apcapital of approximately million in without prior regulatory approval 
however  the million that may be paid in is subject to limitation based on the timing and amount of the dividends that were paid in the preceding months 
accordingly  no dividends may be paid  without prior regulatory approval  until the third quarter of  at which time dividends of million may be paid 
the remaining million in ordinary dividend payments are not permitted until december of at december   apcapital s cash and cash equivalent resources totaled approximately million 
we continued the repurchase of shares of our outstanding common stock in a total of  shares were repurchased in at a total cost of million 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements as well as item market for registrant s common equity  related stockholder matters and issuer purchases of equity securities for further details regarding our share repurchase plans 
such cross referenced information is included herein by reference 
in addition to our share repurchases  apcapital paid quarterly cash dividends of per share in  which totaled approximately million for the year 
on february   apcapital s board of directors announced an increase in its quarterly cash dividend to per share 
the first quarter dividend is payable on march  to shareholders of record on march   and is expected to result in a total cash payout of approximately million 
the board s current intention is to continue to pay a comparable cash dividend on a quarterly basis for the foreseeable future 
however  the payment of future dividends will depend on the availability of cash resources at apcapital  prevailing business and market conditions  our financial condition and results of operations  and such other factors as are deemed relevant by the board of directors 
we made net federal income tax payments of approximately million in substantially all of our taxable income is generated by american physicians 
as such  in accordance with inter company tax allocation agreements  it is primarily american physicians responsibility to provide the cash resources to fund our tax obligations 
apcapital generally has had a net positive cash flow from income taxes as it is reimbursed by its subsidiaries for the tax benefit of the loss it generates in accordance with inter company tax allocation agreements 
at december   we had million of long term debt obligations  which are described in greater detail in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
this debt is the obligation of apcapital and pays a variable interest rate of approximately plus the three month libor rate 
in may this debt became callable  in whole or in part  and we repaid million of the original outstanding million in august we frequently evaluate our capital management strategies with the intention of providing the most value to apcapital shareholders and making prudent use of apcapital s cash resources 
any decision to make further repayments would be based on such evaluations  as well as changes in our available cash resources  capital needs and other relevant factors 
consolidated our net cash flow provided by operations was approximately million for the year ended december   compared to million provided by operations in and million in the following table shows the composition of our net cash flows from operations for the years ended december   and dollars in thousands cash from for premiums received investment income collected loss and loss adjustment expenses paid commissions and other acquisition costs net reinsurance impact income taxes paid salaries and other employee costs other net cash flows from operations the decrease in premiums received was the result of the decreases in our direct premiums written primarily due to rate decreases as previously discussed 
loss and loss adjustment expense payments have also been steadily decreasing as our inventory of open claims has decreased over the last several years 
cash from investment income decreased in compared to primarily as a result of a decrease in short term interest rates  as well as an increase in the allocation of our portfolio to tax exempt securities  which had a lower coupon rate than the investment securities they replaced 
income taxes paid in were relatively consistent with as the benefit of minimum tax credits utilized in was mostly offset by lower taxable income in taxes paid in were less than or due partially to lower taxable income and the utilization of our remaining net operating loss carryforwards 
we experienced net positive cash flows related to our reinsurance program in for the first time in several years 
this was primarily due to changes in our reinsurance treaty in that reduced our premium cessions 
the increase in cash from reinsurance of million in compared to was related to the commutation of our reinsurance treaty 
at december  we had received approximately million of the million due from reinsurers as a result of the commutation 
all other operating cash flow categories have remained relatively consistent and stable over the three year period ended december  we have no material planned expenditures for the acquisition of assets  or other expenditures in and beyond  other than expenses incurred in the normal course of operations and the remaining costs associated with the development and implementation of a new policy and claims system 
the original projected cash outflow associated with the project was expected to be approximately million 
through december  the total cost of the project had reached approximately million  which represented substantially all of the costs associated with the project 
at december   we had million of cash and cash equivalents and approximately million of available for sale fixed income securities and million of available for sale equity securities that could be sold to meet short term cash flow needs 
on a long term basis  fixed income securities are purchased on a basis intended to provide adequate cash flows from future maturities to meet future policyholder obligations and ongoing operational expenses 
as of december   we had approximately million  million and million of held to maturity fixed income securities that mature in the next one to five years  five to ten years and more than ten years  respectively 
we also have approximately million of mortgage backed securities that provide periodic principal repayments 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements for further information regarding the anticipated maturities of our fixed income securities 
financial condition in evaluating our financial condition  three factors are the most critical first  the availability of adequate statutory capital and surplus to satisfy state regulators and to support our current am best rating  which currently stands at a excellent  second  the adequacy of our reserves for unpaid loss and loss adjustment expenses  and lastly the quality of assets our investment portfolio 
statutory capital and surplus at december  our statutory capital and surplus  which we refer to collectively as surplus  remained strong at approximately million 
this surplus level resulted in a net premiums written to surplus ratio of based on million of net premiums written 
surplus at december  was approximately million  and our net premiums written to surplus ratio was also the million decrease in surplus in was due to million of dividend payments made by american physicians to apcapital  as well decreases in deferred income taxes and non admitted assets totaling million 
partially offsetting these decreases was an increase in surplus related to million of net income and a million increase in unrealized gains  net of tax 
the company s risk based capital and iris ratios  other measures considered by regulators in evaluating the capital and surplus adequacy of our insurance subsidiaries are discussed under item business insurance regulatory matters

our open and reported claim counts continued to decrease in while our claim counts have continued to decrease  our average net case reserve per open claim increased in average net case reserves are one measure of the severity of claims currently in our inventory 
our medical professional liability net ibnr reserves have also been increasing over the last several years as a result of assumptions we have made in our actuarial projections regarding future case reserve development and ultimate claim severity 
at the same time  the decrease in reported claims has led to a decrease in the number of actuarially projected ibnr claims  resulting in an even greater increase in the average net total reserve per open plus estimated ibnr claim than average net case reserve per open claim 
however  this is appropriate from an actuarial standpoint as it is assumed that the ultimate cost of settling the ibnr claims will exceed the cost of settling claims in our current inventory due to loss cost inflation and other factors

the various reserving methods described in critical accounting policies  unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses produce a range of possible reserve amounts 
in an effort to better explain the inherent uncertainty in our net loss and loss adjustment expense reserves  we have developed a reasonable range of estimates around the net carried reserves as of december   as shown below 
net loss and lae reserves low end recorded high end of range reserves of range in thousands there are several limitations to interpreting reserve ranges 
there are macroeconomic effects that may impact the development of the reserves such as  but not limited to  tort reform  changes in the litigiousness of jurisdictions in which we write business  the influence of legislative actions  and changes in political philosophy 
as a result of these factors  as well as the many other quantitative and qualitative factors described in critical accounting policies  unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses  there can be no assurance that reserves will develop within this range 
the reserve range is a normal distribution  meaning that reserves are more likely to develop around the center of the range  or carried reserves  and less likely as you approach either the high or low end of the range 
however it is meaningful to note the potential variability in the company s net income before the effect of income taxes if actual claims experience were to emerge more favorably  the lower end of the range  or less favorably  the higher end of the range  than anticipated 
the following table shows the effects on pre tax net income if the carried reserves as of december  develop at the low or high end of the range

in addition  we purchase only essential purpose tax exempt bonds 
essential purpose bonds are used to fund projects such as schools  water and sewer  road improvements as well as other necessary services 
these bonds are general obligations and are backed by the full taxing authority of the city  county or state  and have a very low historical rate of default 
our mortgage backed securities are all issued by government sponsored enterprises  principally the federal national mortgage association  or fannie mae  and the federal home loan mortgage corporation  or freddie mac 
all of the fannie mae and freddie mac mortgage backed securities consist of conforming mortgage loans that were issued prior to april  are guaranteed by the issuing government sponsored agency and have support tranches designed to promote the predictability of principal repayment cash flows

we also diversify our holdings so that there is not a significant concentration in any one industry or geographical region 
for additional information regarding the risks inherent in our investment portfolio see item a  quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the increase in other investments to million at december  from million at december  was primarily attributable to the acquisition of additional equity securities 
at december  our available for sale equity securities included in other investments had a fair value of approximately million 
these equity securities represent strategic investments in two insurance companies 
these companies were identified as being undervalued and potentially a long term strategic partner for us 
accordingly  we view these as long term investments and part of our overall capital strategy 
however  as they are marketable securities  they are subject to the volatility inherent in today s equity markets 
at december  both securities were trading above our cost basis 
however  subsequent to december  their market values have declined significantly 
while we view these as temporary declines and our long term strategy has not changed  there could be the potential for other than temporary impairment charges in future periods should their market values not recover

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk general market risk is the risk of loss due to adverse changes in market rates and prices 
we invest primarily in fixed income securities  which are interest sensitive assets 
accordingly  our primary market risk is exposure to changes in interest rates 
in addition  our fixed income securities  both available for sale and held to maturity  are subject to a degree of credit risk 
credit risk is the risk that the issuer will default on interest or principal payments  or both  which could prohibit us from recovering a portion or all of our original investment 
at december  the majority of our investment portfolio was invested in fixed income security investments  as well as cash and cash equivalents 
the fixed income securities primarily consisted of us government and agency bonds  high quality corporate bonds  mortgage backed securities and tax exempt us municipal bonds 
qualitative information about market risk investments in our portfolio have varying degrees of risk 
the primary market risk exposure associated with our available for sale fixed income security portfolio is interest rate risk  which is limited somewhat by our management of duration 
the distribution of maturities and sector concentrations are monitored on a regular basis 
in addition  our fixed income security portfolio is also subject to a degree of credit risk 
credit risk is the risk that amounts due the company by creditors may not ultimately be collected 
at december  all of our fixed income portfolio  both available for sale and held to maturity excluding approximately million of private placement issues  which constitutes of our portfolio was considered investment grade 
we define investment grade securities as those that have a standard poors credit rating of bbb and above 
non investment grade securities typically bear more credit risk than those of investment grade quality 
in addition  we try to limit credit risk by not maintaining fixed income security investments pertaining to any one issuer  with the exception of us government and agency backed securities  in excess of million 
we also try to diversify our holdings so that there is not a significant concentration in any one industry or geographical region 
our tax exempt municipal securities are all insured 
however  when purchasing municipal and other tax exempt securities  we do not rely on the insurance  but rather focus on the credit worthiness of the underlying issuing authority 
in addition  we purchase only essential purpose tax exempt bonds 
essential purpose bonds are used to fund projects such as schools  water and sewer  road improvements as well as other necessary services 
these bonds are general obligations and are backed by the full taxing authority of the city  county or state  and have a very low historical rate of default 
our held to maturity portfolio includes approximately million of mortgage backed securities 
these securities are all issued by government sponsored enterprises  principally the federal national mortgage association  or fannie mae  and the federal home loan mortgage corporation  or freddie mac 
because the held to maturity mortgage backed securities are not carried at estimated fair value  changes in interest rates do not affect the carrying amount of these securities 
however  principal receipts as a result of prepayments may affect our cash flows  as an increase in interest rates will slow principal payments  and a decrease in interest rates will accelerate principal payments 
the fair values of our investment securities are determined by following the guidance and hierarchy in sfas no 
if securities are traded in active markets  quoted prices are used to measure fair value level 
if quoted prices are not available  prices are obtained from various independent pricing vendors based on pricing models that consider a variety of observable inputs level 
benchmark yields  prices for similar securities in active markets and quoted bid or ask prices are just a few of the observable inputs utilized 
prices determined by the model are then compared with prices provided by other pricing vendors and against prior prices to confirm that deviations are within tolerable limits 
if the pricing vendors are unable to provide a current price for a security  a fair value is developed using alternative sources based on a variety of less objective assumptions and inputs level 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding the fair values of our investment securities 
we periodically review our investment portfolio for any potential credit quality or collection issues and for any securities with respect to which we consider any decline in market value to be other than temporary
