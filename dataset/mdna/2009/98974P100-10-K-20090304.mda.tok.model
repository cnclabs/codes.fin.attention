risk factors in these risk factors  we  us  our  and zixcorp refer to zix corporation and its wholly owned subsidiaries 
an investment in our common stock involves a high degree of risk 
you should carefully consider the following risk factors in evaluating an investment in our common stock 
if any of the following risks actually occurs  our business  financial condition  results of operations or cash flow could be materially and adversely affected 
in such case  the trading price of our common stock could decline  and you could lose all or part of your investment 
you should also refer to the other information set forth in this report  including our consolidated financial statements and the related notes 
our operating results  financial condition and business may be adversely affected by unfavorable economic and market conditions 
unfavorable economic and market conditions  including the current recession in the us and the recent financial crisis affecting the banking system and financial markets  could negatively affect our business 
there could be a number of follow on effects from these conditions  including insolvency of key vendors  resulting in product delays  inability of payors to obtain credit to finance purchases of our solutions and services  reduction in technology expenditures by current and potential payors  and increased expense or inability to obtain short term financing of our operations 
one or more of these effects could cause our revenue to decline 
for these reasons  among others  if the current economic and market conditions deteriorate further or do not show 
table of contents improvement  our operating results  financial condition and business could be adversely affected 
we have incurred significant operating losses in previous years and our pocketscript e prescribing service continues to use significant amounts of cash 
we have incurred significant operating losses in previous years and we expect to incur operating losses in our pocketscript e prescribing service operates in an emerging market  and it has consumed a significant amount of cash since we entered the e prescribing business in mid developing this business is costly and we expect the e prescribing business to consume a significant amount of cash ie  be cash flow negative in emerging market businesses involve risks and uncertainties  and there are no assurances that we will be successful in our efforts to achieve profitability for this line of business 
our liquidity and capital resources remain limited 
from a company wide perspective  we expect that our cash flows from operations will be sufficient to fund our ongoing operations during  but there is no assurance this will occur 
consequently  there can be no assurance that our liquidity or capital resource position would allow us to continue to pursue our current business strategy  particularly our e prescribing line of business 
as a result  without achieving growth in our business along the lines we have projected  we would have to alter our business plan or further augment our cash flow position through cost reduction measures  sales of assets  additional financings or a combination of these actions 
there is no assurance that any of these actions would be possible or could be implemented on terms acceptable to us  particularly due to current economic and market conditions see above risk factor 
additionally  one or more of these actions could substantially diminish the value of our common stock 
the market may not broadly accept our email encryption and pocketscript e prescribing services  which would prevent us from operating profitably 
we must be able to achieve broad market acceptance for our email encryption and e prescribing services  at a price that provides an acceptable rate of return relative to our company wide costs in order to operate profitably 
we have not yet been able to do this 
our email encryption business segment has begun to yield positive cash flow from operations  but there are no assurances that it will continue to yield sufficient cash flow to overcome the negative cash flow from the e prescribing segment and our corporate overhead costs 
as noted  our pocketscript e prescribing service operates in an emerging market 
there is no assurance that this market will develop sufficiently to enable us to operate our pocketscript business profitably 
we have been pursuing the e prescribing business since mid  and our pursuit of the business has consumed significant amounts of cash and it is projected to continue to consume cash for the foreseeable future

failure to enter into additional or to maintain existing sponsorship agreements for our pocketscript e prescribing service and generate other revenue sources from our pocketscript service could harm our business 
our pocketscript business has incurred significant operating losses 
through december   significant orders for our pocketscript e prescribing service came from sponsorship agreements with healthcare payors 
under our payor sponsorship business model  we deploy pocketscript to the end user physician and provide the end user physician a subscription to use the service in return for payments from the healthcare payor 
these payments are in the form of guaranteed payments from the healthcare payor or contingent payments that are based on contractually specified performance metrics 
in some cases  these contingent payments could represent a substantial portion of the revenue opportunity under the contract 
the significant majority of all the end user physicians who are using the pocketscript service and for whom we are currently recognizing revenue are doing so under a subscription arrangement that has been paid for  in whole or in part  by a healthcare payor 
if the healthcare payors fail to renew their sponsorships  there is no assurance that the physicians will pay to continue to use the pocketscript service 
moreover  our payor sponsorship contracts now require many of the end user physicians being sponsored by the payor to pay all or a portion of the fees to use our pocketscript e prescribing service 
this contrasts with past practice  where the healthcare payor typically paid the entire subscription fee on behalf of the end user physician 
we have found that the effort and expense to recruit new physicians to use our e prescribing service is increasing as a consequence of this new  payor imposed requirement 
see item management s discussion and analysis of financial conditions and results of operations  liquidity and capital resources  below 
our cash flows from operations in our e prescribing line of business will not be sufficient to fund the business ongoing operations unless we successfully do one or more of the following 
table of contents sign follow on orders with our existing healthcare payors  from whom a significant portion of our cash and revenues are received  sign new sponsorship agreements with new payors  generate significant revenue from contingent payments  maintain and grow existing transaction fees from payors  pharmacy benefit managers and others for the electronic prescriptions processed through our e prescribing service  improve prescriber retention rates  or identify other revenue opportunities for our e prescribing service 
there can be no assurance that we will achieve all or any of these objectives 
if we are not successful in these endeavors  we could be required to revise our business model  exit or reduce the scale of our e prescribing business  collaborate with others in pursuing this business  or raise additional capital 
physicians and other healthcare providers may fail to adopt our pocketscript service 
our pocketscript service is targeted to the emerging market for e prescribing which provides physicians the ability to use a handheld device to prescribe drugs and transmit prescriptions electronically to any retail pharmacy 
through the use of the handheld device  the physician is provided with real time decision support at the point of care  such as insurance formulary and drug interactions  that would normally not be available in a paper prescription process 
this enables the physician to leverage technology for better patient care 
this is an emerging market  and the success of our pocketscript service is dependent  in large measure  on physicians changing the manner in which they write prescriptions 
our challenge is to make this new service attractive to physicians  and ultimately  profitable 
to do so has required  and in the foreseeable future will require  us to invest significant amounts of cash and other resources 
there is no assurance that enough paying users will ultimately be obtained to enable us to operate the pocketscript service profitably 
if we are not successful in these endeavors  we could be required to revise our business model  exit or reduce the scale of our e prescribing business  collaborate with others in pursuing this business  or raise additional capital 
end users of our pocketscript service may not continue to use the service 
we currently estimate approximately  to  active physician users subscribers of the e prescribing service are needed to cover our e prescribing fixed costs 
as of december   the company had approximately  such active prescribers of the service  as compared to approximately  and  such active prescribers as of december   and december   respectfully see the market may not broadly accept our email encryption and pocketscript e prescribing services  which would prevent us from operating profitably and physicians and other healthcare providers may fail to adopt our pocketscript service in risk factors above 
not all users to whom the e prescribing service is deployed will become active users 
furthermore  we have experienced attrition in our base of active users 
thus  there is no assurance that we will be able to achieve a sufficient number of active users to build a successful e prescribing business 
see item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  revenue indicators backlog  orders and deployments 
if we are not successful in these endeavors  we could be required to revise our business model  exit or reduce the scale of our e prescribing business  collaborate with others in pursuing this business  or raise additional capital 
failure to significantly increase our base of pocketscript users or obtain significant prescription transaction fees  or other fees may result in failure to achieve the critical mass of physicians and revenue to build a successful business 
we incur significant up front costs in connection with initially establishing our pocketscript e prescribing service with the physician users 
under our current business model  third party payors typically pay a portion of the variable costs of initially establishing our e prescribing service 
our plan is to obtain additional revenues in the form of recurring annual subscription fees to use our e prescribing service  either paid by the third party payors or the physicians  and additional revenues from prescription transaction fees or other fees to operate this line of business profitably 
increasing our physician user base and increasing prescription transaction fees  or generating other fees  are critical to the success of this plan 
some of the prescription transaction fees that we currently receive are from pharmacy benefit managers  which manage the prescription benefits for their health plan customers  and an electronic script aggregator  which receives scripts written by the physician user of our pocketscript e prescribing service and transmits them via electronic data 
table of contents interchange to retail pharmacies 
our contracts with some of these entities are short term  meaning that the other party could cancel the contract or require us to renegotiate the contract with less favorable terms and conditions 
these unfavorable terms and conditions could increase our costs and could require us to revise our business model 
in sum  there is no assurance as to whether we will be able to maintain  or whether and how quickly we will be able to increase our user base or prescription transaction fees or whether we will be able to generate other fees to such a level that would enable this line of business to operate profitably 
if we are not successful in these endeavors  we could be required to revise our business model  exit or reduce the scale of our e prescribing business  collaborate with others in pursuing this business  or raise additional capital 
competition in our businesses is expected to increase  which could impair our prospects and cause our business to fail 
as the public s and governmental authorities awareness about the need for privacy and security of electronic communications has increased over the past few years  well funded competitors have entered the market for email encryption products and services 
companies that compete with our email encryption service include secure delivery participants  such as ironport acquired by cisco systems inc  pgp corporation  voltage security  certified mail  authentica acquired by emc corporation  secure computing acquired by mcafee  inc  sigaba corporation  and tumbleweed communications corp 
acquired by axway 
in addition  we face competition from vendors of operating systems  networking hardware  network management solutions  security solutions and security software  many of which now  or may in the future  develop or bundle email encryption into their products 
some of these competing companies have substantial information technology security and email protection products and have greater financial resources than us 
in summary  current email encryption customers could move to competitive solutions  which would harm our business 
our pocketscript e prescribing service applies the benefits of e messaging to the medical prescription process by enabling providers to write and transmit prescriptions electronically directly to the pharmacy 
competition is expected to increase in the emerging electronic prescription market as and if this market continues to develop and it becomes generally apparent that there are viable business models for commercial success in this market 
participants in the e prescribing space include allscripts healthcare solutions  dr 
first  inc  iscribe  prematics and rxnt 
competition from these companies and from vendors in related areas  such as electronic medical records vendors who generally include e prescribing services as an element of their service offering is expected to increase 
these competitors could have more financial  technical  and other resources than us 
companies that do not currently compete with us  or only compete with selected products or in selected markets  could become competitors in the future on a larger scale 
companies such as ge healthcare or mckesson corporation would likely offer a broad portfolio of health information technologies for all or some of the pharmaceutical  pharmacy  healthcare provider and managed care markets 
this bundled array of services and solutions could be attractive to our current and potential customers 
favorable regulatory developments could hasten the entrance of these competitors into the market  particularly the e prescribing market 
see regulatory drivers above 
with considerable size and access to capital  they could become significant competitors 
we may face increased competition as these competitors partner with others or develop new solution and service offerings to expand the functionality that they can offer to their customers 
our competitors may  over time  develop new technologies that are perceived as being more secure  effective or cost efficient than our own 
these competitors could successfully garner a significant share of the market  to the exclusion of our company 
furthermore  increased competition could result in pricing pressures  reduced margins  or the failure of our business to achieve or maintain market acceptance  any one of which could materially harm our business 
our inability to successfully and timely develop and introduce new email encryption and e prescribing services and related services and to implement technological changes could harm our business 
the evolving nature of the email encryption and e prescribing businesses require us to continually develop and introduce new and related solutions and services and to improve the performance  features and reliability of our existing solutions and services  particularly in response to competitive offerings 
we incur significant costs to do this 
we have under development new functionality for our email encryption and e prescribing businesses 
we may also introduce new services 
the success of new or enhanced functionalities and services depends on several factors primarily market acceptance 
we may not succeed in developing and marketing new or enhanced functionalities 
table of contents and services that respond to competitive and technological developments and changing customer needs 
this could materially harm our business 
future asset impairments could affect our financial results 
as of december   we have  of goodwill on our balance sheet relating to the email encryption segment 
goodwill is evaluated at least on an annual basis or whenever there is a reason to question if the goodwill values are impaired 
we also have  of property and other long lived assets 
the carrying value of these assets is evaluated whenever there is reason to question if the values are impaired 
future events could impact the valuation of goodwill and long lived assets  which could require us to recognize a non cash charge to earnings 
it is possible that we may incur further charges for other asset impairments in the future as we evaluate the prospects of our various lines of business 
any such charges could materially affect our financial results 
capacity limits on our technology and network hardware and software may be difficult to project  and we may not be able to expand and or upgrade our systems to meet increased use  which would result in reduced revenues 
while we have ample through put capacity to handle our customers requirements for the medium term  at some point if we achieve greater market penetration we may be required to materially expand and or upgrade our technology and network hardware and software 
we may not be able to accurately project the rate of increase in usage of our network 
in addition  we may not be able to expand and or upgrade our systems and network hardware and software capabilities in a timely manner to accommodate increased traffic on our network 
if we do not appropriately expand and or upgrade our systems and network hardware and software in a timely fashion  we may lose customers and revenues 
security interruptions to our data centers could disrupt our business  and any security breaches could expose us to liability and negatively impact customer demand for our solutions and services 
our business depends on the uninterrupted operation of our data centers currently  our zixdata center located in dallas  texas  a united kingdom based data center to service our encrypted email customers in the european union  and the austin  texas data center used for fail over and business continuity services 
we must protect these centers from loss  damage or interruption caused by fire  power loss  telecommunications failure or other events beyond our control 
we carry limited insurance coverage to compensate us for losses that may occur as a result of any of these events 
any damage or failure that causes interruptions in our data centers operations could result in loss of or delay in revenues  failure to achieve market acceptance  diversion of development resources  injury to our reputation  litigation claims  increased insurance costs or increased service and warranty costs 
this could materially harm our business  financial condition and results of operations 
in addition  our ability to provide our services and to support the email encryption and e prescribing services depends on the efficient operation of the internet connections between customers and our data centers 
we depend on internet service providers for these connections 
these providers have experienced periodic operational problems or outages in the past 
any of these problems or outages could adversely affect customer satisfaction 
we do not carry insurance to compensate us for losses that may occur as a result of any of these events 
furthermore  it is critical that our facilities and infrastructure remain secure and the market perceives them to be secure 
despite our implementation of network security measures  our infrastructure may be vulnerable to physical break ins  computer viruses  attacks by hackers and similar disruptions 
in addition  we are vulnerable to coordinated attempts to overload our systems with data  resulting in denial or reduction of service to some or all of our users for a period of time 
we do not carry sufficient insurance to compensate us for all reasonably conceivable losses that may occur as a result of any of these events 
secure messages sent through our messaging portals  in connection with the operation of our email encryption service  include personal healthcare information as well as personal financial information 
this information will reside  for a user specified period of time  in our secure data center network 
also  individual prescription histories transmitted through our e prescribing system and other personally identifiable healthcare information may reside in our secure data center network indefinitely 
federal and state laws impose significant financial penalties for unauthorized disclosure of personal information 
exposure of this information  resulting from any physical or electronic break ins or other security breaches or compromises of this information  could expose us to significant liability  and customers could be reluctant to use our services again 
we do not carry sufficient insurance to compensate us for all reasonably conceivable losses that may occur as a result of any of these events 

table of contents we may have to defend our rights in intellectual property that we use in our services  which could be disruptive and expensive to our business 
we may have to defend our intellectual property rights or defend against claims that we or our customers are infringing the rights of others 
intellectual property litigation and controversies are disruptive and expensive 
infringement claims could require us to develop non infringing services or enter into royalty or licensing arrangements 
royalty or licensing arrangements  if required  may not be obtainable on terms acceptable to us 
our business could be significantly harmed if we are not able to develop or license the necessary technology 
furthermore  it is possible that others may independently develop substantially equivalent intellectual property  thus enabling them to effectively compete against us 
defects or errors in our services could harm our business 
we subject our solutions and services to quality assurance testing prior to release 
regardless of the quality assurance testing  any of our solutions could contain undetected defects or errors 
defects or errors in our pocketscript system could result in inaccurate prescriptions being generated  which could result in injury or death to patients 
undetected defects or errors in any of our solutions and services could result in loss of or delay in revenues  failure to achieve market acceptance  diversion of development resources  injury to our reputation  litigation claims  increased insurance costs  or increased service and warranty costs 
any one of these could prevent us from implementing our business model and achieving the revenues we need to operate profitably 
public key cryptography technology is subject to risks 
our email encryption service and the e prescribing service employ  and future solutions and services may employ  public key cryptography technology and other encryption technologies 
with public key cryptography technology  a public key and a private key are used to encrypt and decrypt messages 
the security afforded by this technology depends  in large measure  on the integrity of the private key  which is dependent  in part  on the application of certain mathematical principles 
the integrity of the private key is predicated on the assumption that it is difficult to mathematically derive the private key from the related public key 
should methods be developed that make it easier to derive the private key  the security of encryption services using public key cryptography technology would be reduced or eliminated and such services could become unmarketable 
this could require us to make significant changes to our services  which could increase our costs  damage our reputation  or otherwise hurt our business 
moreover  from time to time there are public reports of the successful decryption of encrypted messages or encrypted information 
this or related publicity could adversely affect public perception of the security afforded by our services  which could harm our business 
we depend on key personnel 
we depend on the performance of our senior management team including our chairman and ceo  richard d 
spurr  and his direct reports and other key employees  particularly highly skilled technical personnel 
our success depends on our ability to attract  retain and motivate these individuals 
there are no binding agreements with any of our employees that prevent them from leaving our company at any time 
there is competition for these personnel 
in addition  we do not maintain key person life insurance on any of our personnel 
the loss of the services of any of our key employees or our failure to attract  retain and motivate key employees could harm our business 
we rely on third parties 
for certain elements of our service offerings  we sometimes rely on the products and services of third parties 
in particular  we rely on a single supplier for the hand held device used by the prescribing physician users of our e prescribing service 
if these third parties  in general  and this single supplier  in particular  elect to withhold their products or services  significantly raise their prices  or cease supplying the item in question  we could be damaged financially in lower returns on sales and a lessening of competitive advantages if suitable alternatives could not be found in a reasonable period of time 
if critical services and products that we source from third parties were to no longer be made available to us or at a considerably higher price than we currently pay for them  and suitable alternatives could not be found  our business could be harmed 
also  we have data interchange agreements with third parties  who source data and or transport transactions relevant to the overall decision support and electronic prescribing capability offered by our pocketscript service 
these third parties require us to adhere certify to their technical requirements 
our failure to maintain these technical certifications could hurt our competitiveness and impair our ability to secure new customers for our pocketscript service and maintain existing customers 
we could be affected by government regulation 
exports of software solutions and services using encryption 
table of contents technology  such as our email encryption service  are generally restricted by the us government 
although we have obtained us government approval to export our email encryption service to almost all countries  the list of countries to which our solutions and services cannot be exported could be revised in the future 
furthermore  some countries impose restrictions on the use of encryption solutions and services  such as ours 
failure to obtain the required governmental approvals would preclude the sale or use of our solutions and services in international markets and  therefore  harm our ability to grow sales through expansion into international markets 
our largest oem partner does sell and distribute our email encryption service in overseas markets 
in  the federal government mandated e prescribing for medicare prescriptions in connection with the adoption of mippa 
while the existence of this mandate in the future might potentially increase our active user rates and retention rates  there could be adverse effects  such as increased competition or a need for us to change the manner in which we recruit  deploy  and train our physician users 
the american recovery and reinvestment act of contains economic incentives for the adoption of health information technologies  including ehrs that contain an e prescribing component 
the availability of these incentives could increase our effort and expense to recruit new physicians to use our stand alone e prescribing service 
these economic incentives could favor competitors that offer ehrs that contain an e prescribing component by fostering the adoption of such ehrs and thus decreasing our market opportunity 
the federal government has adopted regulations to create an exception to the prohibition on physicians referrals to healthcare entities with which they have financial relationships for certain electronic prescribing arrangements  codified at cfr v  and an exception to the related federal healthcare anti kickback rules for certain electronic prescribing arrangements  codified at cfr 
the purpose of the regulations is to encourage physicians to use electronic prescribing systems to create and deliver prescriptions to the pharmacy 
the regulations seek to accomplish this purpose by creating certain safe harbors that are intended to encourage healthcare entities  such as health insurance companies and hospitals  to provide financial incentives to physicians to use electronic prescribing systems 
these regulations  as they are interpreted and enforced over time  could provide other participants in the market a competitive advantage or could have currently unforeseen consequences that harm our business 
furthermore  boards of pharmacy in the various states in which our e prescribing business operates regulate the process by which physicians write prescriptions 
while regulations in the states in which our e prescribing business currently operates generally permit the electronic writing of prescriptions  such regulations could be revised in the future 
moreover  regulations in states in which our e prescribing business does not currently operate may not be as favorable and may impede our ability to develop business in these states 
also  future state or federal regulation could mandate standards for the electronic writing of prescriptions or for the secure electronic transmittal of personal health information through the internet that our technology and systems do not comply with  which would require us to modify our technology and systems 
many of these standards are currently being pilot tested in their initial form and may be subject to change  accelerated compliance restrictions or select re implementations  based on resulting industry recommendations 
the costs of compliance could be substantial 
the mipaa incentive payments to physicians who use e prescribing will only be paid to physicians that use an e prescribing service that complies with specific certification standards 
the center for medicare and medicaid services cms has conferred on the certification commission for healthcare information technology cchit  a private not for profit organization  the responsibility to develop these standards 
cchit has announced that it will promulgate these standards by mid we will likely incur significant costs to develop the functionalities and features that will be required by these new standards  and there is no assurance that we will achieve the required certification 
this could materially harm our business 
our stock price may be volatile 
the market price of our common stock has fluctuated significantly in the past and is likely to fluctuate in the future 
also  as of february   there was a reported short position in our common stock of  shares approximately of our outstanding number of shares  which may affect the volatility of our stock price 

table of contents we have a significant amount of stock options and warrants outstanding and may issue additional equity securities in the future 
exercise of the outstanding options and warrants  and future issuances of other securities will dilute the ownership interests of existing shareholders 
we have outstanding warrants and options  including options held by our employees  covering approximately million shares of our common stock with exercise prices ranging from to the issuances of shares of common stock in respect of these warrants and options would result in a substantial voting dilution of our current shareholders 
any sales in the public market of the common stock issuable upon exercise of the warrants and options could adversely affect prevailing market prices of our common stock 
in the future  we may determine to seek additional capital funding or to acquire additional businesses  which could involve the issuance of one or more types of equity securities  including convertible debt  common and convertible preferred stock  and warrants to acquire common or preferred stock 
such equity securities could be issued in public or private transactions  at or below the then prevailing market price of our common stock 
in addition  we motivate our employees and attract new employees by issuing shares of our common stock and options to purchase shares of our common stock 
the interest of our existing shareholders may be diluted by any equity securities issued in capital funding financings or business acquisitions and would be diluted by any such future share issuances and stock option grants to employees 
finally  as a result of the anti dilution provisions of certain of the warrants described above  we may be obligated to increase the number of shares that may be acquired upon exercise of our warrants and reduce the exercise price of such warrants 
we might also be obligated to register with the sec additional shares of common stock issuable to the warrant holders for public resale 
we may be required to pay liquidated damages in the event one or more of the registration statements we have filed with the sec for the benefit of third parties ceases to be effective 
we have filed a number of registration statements with the sec for the benefit of third parties 
these registration statements permit the public resale of our common stock held by  or potentially issuable upon the exercise of options or warrants to  these parties 
in some cases  we would be required to pay liquidated damages to the third parties if we fail to maintain the effectiveness of the relevant registration statement for the contractually required period of time 
the amount of damages we would be required to pay could be substantial  as a percentage of our cash on hand  depending on when the registration statement ceased to be effective 
there are no assurances that we will be successful or that we will not encounter other  and even unanticipated  risks 
we discuss other operating  financial or legal risks or uncertainties in our periodic filings with the sec 
we are  of course  also subject to general economic risks

overview we are a leader in providing secure  internet based applications in a saas model 
these applications connect  protect and deliver information in a secure manner  enabling the use of the internet for applications requiring a high level of security in the healthcare  finance  insurance  and government sectors 
our core competency is the ability to deliver these complex service offerings with a high level of availability  reliability  integrity  and particularly security 
we operate under two reporting segments  email encryption service email or email encryption and e prescribing service e prescribing where we offer these services on a subscription basis to our customers who subscribe to use the services for a specified term 
for the year ended december   we achieved our best financial results to date 
a growth in revenue  gross margin and strong cash collections in the email business led to the highest revenue and gross margin 
however  our e prescribing business  is incurring significant losses 
the cash flow we receive from our email business is substantially supporting the cash needs of our e prescribing business  which consumes a significant amount of cash and incurs operating losses 
we primarily sell our email encryption service through direct sales and telesales 
we also use a network of resellers and other distribution partners  particularly other service providers seeking an encryption offering in an oem like relationship 
for e prescribing  we have not emphasized sales directly to physicians  but rather have focused on other stakeholders that benefit from healthcare technology 
in particular  seven health insurance companies use zixcorp s services on behalf of the prescribing doctors in their plans 
because of the potential savings resulting from lower drug spend and improved patient safety  these insurance companies have  in effect  underwritten the deployment and initial subscription costs of the service for the physicians 
strategy and focus areas we believe the growth we experienced during was attributable to the continued development and growth of our email encryption subscription business 
the company seeks to build and maintain reliable revenue growth by adding new customers while retaining a high percentage of existing customers 
after the years required to achieve critical mass in the email business with the subscription model  we believe we entered a new phase of financial stability in the subscription model requires large up front investment to establish the service  but over time  the fixed set up costs are exceeded by the recurring subscription and transaction fees  and incremental costs to add new users are relatively low 
we delivered several new service enhancements during for both our email and e prescribing segments 
for our email business  we completed new development related to establishing a united kingdom based data center in order to support customers of our oem resellers in europe 
we also updated the design of our service to enhance customer network independence  improve capacity and enable improved partitioning for deployment in small and medium businesses 
in areas related to email content scanning and customer policy support we enhanced the spreadsheet scanning capabilities of our service and redesigned significant portions of the zixauditor assessment and reporting software to increase processing through put and improve mail categorization 
for our e prescribing business  our development activities included delivery of new clinical coaching features  significant enhancements to formulary and benefits presentation and enhanced prescriber user interface features and workflow 
we expect to 
table of contents release a new version of our pocketscript technology during the first quarter of  which delivers all necessary features to address new certification requirements for surescripts rxhub 
some of these features will be very beneficial to payors as they extend the breadth of insurance related decision support data to be delivered electronically via new standards and support additional prescription drug plans including those associated with medicare part d 
we continue to balance the cash produced by our more mature segment  email encryption  with the cash required to develop our emerging segment  e prescribing 
operationally  our success is primarily dependent upon the following key metrics rate of new subscriptions termed new first year orders nyfo for the email encryption service  renewal rates for the email encryption service  additional payor sponsorship of the e prescribing service to physicians by new or existing insurance payors  successful adoption and usage of the e prescribing service by physicians  retention of the users physicians of the e prescribing service as indicated by subscription renewals  future transaction fees or related fees associated with the use of the e prescribing service  and our ability to increase business volume with reasonable cost increases 
known trends regarding these key metrics and their implication on our current and future capital requirements are discussed throughout this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations md a there are no assurances we will be successful in our efforts to achieve these key metrics 
our continued growth depends on the timely development and market acceptance of our products and services 
we have experienced improved fundamentals in our cash flow performance during for the first time in our history we were cash flow positive 
we will continue to place a strong emphasis on actions to improve our cash flow  while balancing the need for investments in our developing and emerging markets 
see item a 
risk factors for more information on the risks relevant to our operations and future prospects 
revenue revenue increased by in compared with our growth was driven by a increase in the revenue for our email encryption business where our successful subscription model yielded steady additions to the subscriber base coupled with a high rate of renewing existing customers 
the increase from our email segment was partially offset by a decrease in our e prescribing segment where we saw a reduction in our transaction related fees from one customer and in our deployments during operating margins for the year ended  our gross margin percentage increased almost compared with this increase was primarily driven by increased revenues from our email segment and a reduction in cost of revenues in our e prescribing segment where we deployed fewer physicians during our headcount increased in  reflecting investments in research and development r d  sales and executive management 
other financial highlights for email encryption  our sales backlog was million in  compared with at the end of for email encryption  our total orders for were million  an increase of from the total orders of million our deferred revenue at the end of was million  compared with million at the end of we generated cash flows from operations of million 
our cash and cash equivalents  together with our investments  were million at the end of  compared with million at the end of we maintained a strong renewal rate for eligible email encryption contracts at for we topped million user email addresses with our email encryption service  with an increased growth 
table of contents rate of approximately  new email addresses each week our e prescribing service signed four new sponsorship contracts during the year our e prescribing service processed approximately million e scripts during  an increase of over critical accounting policies and estimates in preparing our consolidated financial statements  we make estimates  assumptions and judgments that can have a significant impact on revenue  loss from operations and net loss  as well as the value of certain assets and liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet 
the application of our critical accounting policies requires an evaluation of a number of complex criteria and significant accounting judgments by us 
management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities 
we evaluate our estimates on a regular basis and make changes accordingly 
senior management has discussed the development  selection and disclosure of these estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors 
actual results may materially differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
if actual results were to differ from these estimates materially  the resulting changes could have a material adverse effect on the consolidated financial statements 
an accounting policy is deemed to be critical if it requires an accounting estimate to be made based on assumptions about complex matters that are highly uncertain at the time the estimate is made  and if different estimates that reasonably could have been used  or changes in the accounting estimates that are reasonably likely to occur periodically  could materially impact the consolidated financial statements 
management believes the following critical accounting policies reflect our more significant estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
our critical accounting policies are as follows revenue recognition income taxes valuation of goodwill and other intangible assets stock based compensation costs for additional discussion of the company s significant accounting policies  refer to note to the consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition we must make significant management judgments and estimates to determine revenue to be recognized in an accounting period 
material differences may result in the amount and timing of our revenue for any period if our management made different judgments or utilized different estimates 
these estimates affect the deferred revenue on our consolidated balance sheet and revenue on our consolidated statements of operations 
estimates regarding revenue affect all of our operating geographies 
we apply the provisions of the eitf abstract no 
 revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables  securities and exchange commission staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements and other related pronouncements 
generally speaking  we develop  market and support applications that connect  protect and deliver information in a secure manner 
our services can be placed into several key revenue categories where each category has similar revenue recognition traits email encryption and e prescribing subscription based services  various transaction fees and related professional services 
the majority of the revenues generated are through direct sales  however  our email encryption service employs a combination of direct sales and a network of distributors and resellers 
under all product categories and distribution models  we recognize revenue after all of the following occur 
table of contents persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  the price is fixed and determinable  and collectability is reasonably assured 
in the event the arrangement has multiple elements with delivered and undelivered elements  revenue for the delivered elements is recognized under the residual method only when vendor specific objective evidence vsoe exists to allocate the fair value of the total fees to the undelivered elements of the arrangement 
when we are engaged in a complex product deployment  customer acceptance may have to occur before the transaction is considered complete 
in this situation  no revenue is recognized until the customer accepts the product 
discounts provided to customers are recorded as reductions in revenue 
both the email encryption and the e prescribing services are subscription based services 
providing these services includes delivering subscribed for software and providing secure electronic communications and customer support throughout the subscription period 
our subscribers generally execute multiple year contracts that are irrevocable and non refundable in nature and require annual  up front payments 
subscription fees received from customers are initially recorded as deferred revenue and then recognized as revenue ratably over the subscription period 
some of our e prescribing services incorporate a transaction fee per event occurrence or when predetermined usage levels have been reached 
these fees are recognized as revenue when the transaction occurs or when the predetermined usage levels have been achieved  and when the amounts are fixed and determinable 
we do not offer stand alone services 
further  our services primarily include manufacturer provided warranty provisions 
we recorded no warranty expense in any of the presented periods 
income taxes two critical elements of our overall accounting for income taxes pertain to the valuation of our deferred tax assets in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  and our adoption of the provisions of fasb interpretation no 
fin  accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
accounting for income taxes  effective january  deferred tax assets are recognized if it is more likely than not that the benefit of the deferred tax asset will be realized on future federal income tax returns 
at december   we continued to provide a full valuation allowance against most of our accumulated us deferred tax assets of  reflecting our historical losses and the uncertainty of future taxable income 
our total deferred tax asset not subject to a valuation allowance  is valued at  and consists of  for us state income tax credits that are substantially certain of realization in because the underlying tax is not contingent on us profitability and  for a canadian deferred tax asset relating to temporary timing differences between gaap and tax related expense 
if we begin to generate us taxable income in a future period or if the facts and circumstances on which our estimates and assumptions are based were to change  thereby impacting the likelihood of realizing the deferred tax assets  judgment would have to be applied in determining the amount of valuation allowance no longer required 
reversal of all or a part of this valuation allowance could have a significant positive impact on operating results in the period that it becomes more likely than not that certain of our deferred tax assets will be realized 
fin prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
fin also provides guidance on de recognition  classification  interest and penalties  accounting in interim periods  disclosure and transition 
prior to the adoption of fin  we had recorded a  tax contingency liability and that amount and the specifics therein have remained unchanged 
as of december   the gross amount of our unrecognized tax benefits  inclusive of the  tax liability  was approximately  included in this balance are tax positions which  if recognized  would impact our effective tax rate 

table of contents valuation of goodwill and other intangible assets we account for the valuation of goodwill and other intangible assets in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  which classifies intangible assets into three categories intangible assets with definite lives subject to amortization  intangible assets with indefinite lives not subject to amortization  and goodwill 
for intangible assets with definite lives  tests for impairment must be performed if conditions exist that indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
for intangible assets with indefinite lives and goodwill  tests for impairment must be performed at least annually or more frequently if events or circumstances indicate that assets might be impaired 
we have intangible assets with definite lives subject to amortization  which became fully amortized in early following their costs being ratably amortized over their respective  estimated useful lives of three years 
we have no intangible assets with indefinite lives not subject to amortization 
our goodwill totaled  or of total assets at december  and  which represents the remaining cost in excess of fair value of net assets acquired in the acquisition of elron software and its subsequent sale in our goodwill is not being amortized  but we do evaluate the goodwill for impairment annually in the fourth quarter  or when there is reason to believe that the value has been diminished or impaired 
evaluations for possible impairment are based upon a comparison of the estimated fair value of the reporting unit to which the goodwill has been assigned to  versus the sum of the carrying value of the assets and liabilities of that unit including the assigned goodwill value 
the fair values used in this evaluation are estimated based on the company s market capitalization  which is based on the outstanding stock and market price of the stock 
impairment is deemed to exist if the net book value of the unit exceeds its estimated fair value 
stock based compensation expense on january   we adopted sfas r  share based payment  which is a revision of sfas  accounting for stock based compensation and supersedes the provisions of accounting principles board apb no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees 
our adoption was on a prospective basis with the straight line amortization method for recognizing stock option compensation costs 
for periods prior to january   we used the intrinsic value method to account for stock based compensation plans under the provisions of apb our share based awards are limited to stock options 
sfas r requires the measurement and recognition of compensation expense for all share based payment awards made to our employees  directors or outside service providers based on the estimated fair value of an award on the grant date 
this standard requires grant date fair value to be estimated using either an option pricing model which is consistent with the terms of the award or a market observed price  if such a price exists 
such cost must be recognized over the period during which an employee  director or outside service provider is required to provide service in exchange for the award  ie  the requisite service period which is usually the vesting period 
the standard also requires us to estimate the number of instruments that will ultimately be earned  rather than accounting for forfeitures as they occur 
we used the black scholes option pricing model bsopm to determine the fair value of option grants made during   and commencing on january   we elected to use the simplified method per sec staff accounting bulletins no 
sab  share based payment  to calculate the estimated life of options granted to employees 
the use of the simplified method under sab was extended beyond december  in accordance with staff accounting bulletin  share based payment  issued on december   until such time when we have sufficient information to make more refined estimates on the estimated life of our options 
the expected stock price volatility was calculated by averaging the historical volatility of our common stock over a term equal to the expected life of the options 
the following weighted average assumptions were applied in determining the fair value of options granted during the respective periods 
table of contents year ended december  risk free interest rate expected option life years expected stock price volatility expected dividend yield fair value of options granted the assumptions used in the bsopm valuation are critical as a change in any given factor could have a material impact on the financial results of the company

vs 
email encryption e prescribing total revenues email encryption revenue increases were driven primarily by our continual addition of new users to the subscriber base  while at the same time renewing a high percentage of existing subscribers whose subscriptions were up for renewal 
we measure additions to the subscriber base by nfyo  which is defined as the portion of new orders that are expected to be recognized into revenue in the first twelve months of the contract 
nfyos and renewal percentages are summarized in the table below new first year order value renewal percentage we perceive an annual change in renewal percentages of approximately  either up or down  to be reasonable and can be due singularly to  or in combination with  new competition entering the marketplace  existing competition introducing new features to their comparable service offerings  pure price competition  and or consolidation of our customer s business 
renewal customers are normally renewed at a price equal to or greater than the price of their previous service period 
our go to market model of selling involves primarily multiple year subscription contracts with the fees paid annually at the inception of each year of service 
as a result  a high percentage of customers subscribe to the email encryption service for a three year term versus a one year term 
we expect this preference for a longer contract term by a high percentage of our customers to continue in  as we have priced our services in a manner that 
table of contents encourages longer term contractual commitments from customers 
our list pricing for email encryption has remained generally consistent in when compared with  although we did announce a slight price increase for our services effective in january we have experienced relatively consistent discount percentages off our list price during the periods shown above 
there are no assurances that potential increased competition in this market or other factors will not result in future price erosion 
price erosion  should it occur  could have a dampening effect on our new orders and or renewal rates as previously discussed 
e prescribing the decrease in revenue between and was largely due to reaching an upper invoicing limit associated with transaction fees for a single payor contract 
one time projects occurring in also contributed to the decrease in revenues when compared to additionally  the impact of fewer e prescribing deployments in approximately deployments in versus approximately  in contributed to the decline in deployment revenue year over year but to a lesser extent 
these decreases were partially offset by an increase in renewal revenues 
the increase in revenues versus was primarily driven by an increase in renewal revenues and transaction usage based fees 
revenue on deployments to new pocketscript users and revenues relating to one time projects increased slightly 
revenue outlook our future revenue growth in is primarily expected to come from continued success in the email encryption business 
with email encryption  we anticipate that with our continued focus on sectors such as healthcare  financial services  insurance and government  along with the increased use of indirect oem distribution channels  we expect to see the business increase its new first year order rate in and fuel an overall  year over year revenue growth rate that is similar to growth in the e prescribing segment is almost entirely dependent on our securing new or expanding existing payor sponsorship contracts  or increasing revenue per prescriber through offering new value added services which may be provided in the future 
despite the decline in new deployments throughout  we remain optimistic for the following reasons we saw in the fourth quarter of success in signing three additional contracts and growing our e prescribing backlog  we further added to our backlog with one additional contract in the first quarter of  we believe there is additional interest on the part of some of our payors in expanding their existing programs  as well as  interest from other prospective payors who are considering our service  and mippa provides an increase in medicare payments to those physicians who use e prescribing beginning january  and later penalizes those physicians that do not use e prescribing 
however  with recent contracts signed or in discussions  our business model is evolving to a longer payback and there can be no assurance that these recent events and or observations in e prescribing will become a catalyst for our company gaining additional business either by expanding existing payor programs or contracting with new payors 
backlog  orders  and deployments company wide backlog our end user order backlog is comprised of contractually bound agreements that we expect to fully amortize into revenue 
as of december   the backlog is comprised of the following elements  of deferred revenue that has been billed and paid   billed but unpaid  and approximately  of unbilled contracts 
the backlog divided by segment is  for email encryption and  for e prescribing 

table of contents the backlog is recognized into revenue as the services are performed 
approximately of the total backlog is expected to be recognized as revenue during the next twelve months 
the timing of revenue is affected by both the length of time required to deploy a service and the length of the service contract 
email encryption orders total order input for email encryption in was  compared with  in total orders include customer orders that management separates into three components for measurement purposes contract renewals  nfyos  and in the case of new multi year contracts  the years beyond the first year of service 
the nfyos were  in and  in e prescribing in e prescribing  we have built a prescriber base by contracting with a number of health insurance companies payors to pay for ie sponsor physicians in their network to receive the e prescribing service at no charge to the prescriber for at least the first year of service 
because we did not secure a significant number of physician sponsorships in  our backlog was largely depleted through much of  and we deployed approximately prescribers versus  in as a result  e prescribing revenue declined in  and we expect it to remain relatively flat through the first half of however  we have recently been successful in signing additional contracts  and at december   we had approximately sponsored  but not yet deployed prescribers in our backlog 
we anticipate a corresponding revenue increase in this business in the second half of nonetheless  there can be no assurance we will be successful in expanding our current payor programs or contracting with new payors 
if we are not successful in this effort and elect not to reduce the related operating expenses  then the e prescribing line of business will continue to consume cash 
the list prices for the initial service period and subsequent annual renewal periods for the e prescribing service at december   were  and  respectively 
however  as we move into  we expect our business model  particularly as it relates to our deployments  to evolve into a longer pay back period 
in light of the new mippa legislation  we have increased the list price for e prescribing renewals in to annually  and we are also considering new ways to expand sources for initial deployment funding 
along with increasing prescriber sponsorships  future revenue growth is dependent on increasing utilization and retention by the sponsored physicians  renewing service contracts for active prescribers  and developing additional transaction based and incremental service fees for new functionality 
the level of active users represents the portion of the total deployed base that is using the service on a consistent basis  making it a key indicator for retention and future revenue opportunity 
in recent quarters  an average of to of deployed prescribers have become active users 
as of december   approximately  active prescribers were using our service  compared to approximately  at year end the reduction in the number of active prescribers resulted from attrition in the ordinary course of business 
however  a large clinic  which accounts for approximately of our total active prescribers  and which has historically received special subscription pricing  has notified us that they will discontinue our e prescribing service later in as they complete their migration to a full electronic medical record solution 
based on the end date of their current service periods  the revenue impact in is expected to be approximately  while the annualized loss in revenue resulting from this event is estimated at approximately  in any case  we continue our efforts to identify solutions for improving the conversion rate of deployed users to active users and for lowering the attrition rate 
sponsorship contracts typically specify that physicians using the e prescribing service assume responsibility for renewing the service after the first year 
while blue cross blue shield of massachusetts renewed the annual sponsorship of its most active users for a fourth year in  beyond this most recent renewal  we are to receive our ongoing renewal payments directly from physicians 
we expect the physicians will be receiving incentive payments from mippa and plan sponsored pay for performance programs in massachusetts 
five of our current payors are continuing to either fully or partially sponsor their most active prescribers for at least one additional year of service 
we attempt to contract directly with those physicians who do not write enough electronic prescriptions to be considered for sponsorship renewal by their original payors 
we recognized  in total transaction and usage based fees revenue during  compared to  in as previously discussed  this decrease was due to our reaching an upper invoicing limit associated with the usage based fees included in a single payor contract 
we had contracted transaction based fees or the equivalent with four health care payors in one of these payors has declined to renew its obligation for  and is instead expected to apply such funds toward the purchase of additional deployments with us 

table of contents nonetheless  we will continue to pursue revenue opportunities from transaction fees from both new and existing customers 
in most cases  there are multiple payors in each market and we believe that those additional non sponsorship payors may be potential sources for supplemental fees in return for certain services such as formulary display  drug to drug interaction checking and reporting 
other sources for transaction fee revenue include parties who benefit from a real time  electronic connectivity with pocketscript users 
for example  we currently have contracts under which we earn fees for sending prescriptions electronically to the pharmacies and for certain transactions involving mail order prescriptions 
the number of prescriptions written using the pocketscript service and transmitted through the zixdata center has continued to grow  with approximately million prescriptions transacted in versus approximately million prescriptions for additionally  we are piloting a disease management program with one of our payors which alerts physicians through the e prescribing service that a patient may be eligible for enrollment in the disease management program 
at our current deployment rates  we cannot achieve our e prescribing business objectives of becoming cash flow sufficient on a stand alone basis in the near term 
however  we believe that the passage of mippa has the possibility of being a catalyst in accelerating the development of the e prescribing market 
with new contracts recently announced and others under discussion  we believe the market has potential and we are continuing to work with our current payors and prospective customers to demonstrate return on investment and other related benefits in an effort to significantly increase the number of sponsored prescribers 
we continue to believe that the payor sponsorship model is the right one to lay the foundation for secure  interoperable healthcare information access and decision support 
however  continued growth in this segment will require additional payor sponsors or a change in the market demand model and increased revenues from transaction fees or the equivalent 
cost of revenues the following table sets forth a year over year comparison of the cost of revenues by product line 
variance variance year ended december  vs 
vs 
email encryption e prescribing total cost of revenues the cost of revenue improvement for the twelve months ended december  versus the twelve months ended december  resulted primarily from a reduced rate of e prescribing deployments 
new e prescribing deployments in were compared to  in additionally  despite higher email encryption revenue  the relatively fixed cost structure of the email encryption business model  combined with slightly lower cost of professional services and lower depreciation expense drove lower cost of revenue between periods for the email encryption product line 
the improvement in cost of revenues for the twelve months ended december   compared to the twelve months ended december   consisted primarily of reductions in depreciation costs and amortization expense as well as lower travel  occupancy and data processing costs 
the decrease in depreciation expense was due principally to a reallocation of depreciation expense from cost of revenues to selling  general  and administrative expense combined with certain assets becoming fully depreciated between periods 
the decrease in amortization expense was due to intangible assets becoming fully amortized 
additionally  travel  occupancy and electronic data processing costs were lower due to cost reduction initiatives commencing in email encryption email encryption s cost of revenues is comprised of costs related to operating and maintaining the zixdata center  a field deployment team  customer service and support and the amortization of company owned  customer based computer appliances 
for email encryption  a significant portion of the total cost of revenues relates to the zixdata center  which currently has excess capacity 
accordingly  cost of revenues is relatively fixed in nature and is expected to remain relatively flat in  and grow at a slower pace than revenue 
e prescribing e prescribing s cost of revenues is comprised of costs related to operating and maintaining the zixdata center  a field prescriber recruiting team  a field deployment team  customer service and support  training 
table of contents and e prescribing device costs 
in e prescribing  a greater proportion of total cost of revenues relates to prescriber recruiting and field deployment activities and device costs 
these are more variable in nature than the zixdata center and accordingly  e prescribing costs are more closely correlated to demand 
as discussed in revenues above  we expect our deployment activities to increase above the level  resulting in an increase of our year over year costs of revenues

table of contents gain on valuation of derivative liabilities on april   we sold  shares of common stock and  warrants to various investors see note to the consolidated financial statements 
due to certain terms included in the private placement and as explained in note to the consolidated financial statements  some elements of the transaction were recorded as derivative liabilities and were revalued each quarter with the change in value being recorded as a gain or loss on the consolidated statements of operations 
for the year ended december   we recorded gains of  on the quarterly revaluation of the derivative liabilities 
on december   the fasb issued staff position eitf  accounting for registration payment arrangements which caused the company to prospectively adjust its accounting for the derivative liabilities relating to the private placement 
based on eitf  we reversed  of the gains originally recorded in the second and third quarters of through a cumulative adjustment to the september   accumulated deficit see note to the consolidated financial statements 
income taxes our company or one of our subsidiaries files income tax returns in the us federal jurisdiction and various states and in the canadian federal and provincial jurisdictions 
two critical elements of our overall accounting for income taxes pertain to the valuation of our deferred tax assets in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes sfas  and the provisions of fasb interpretation no 
fin  accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
accounting for income taxes 
effective at the beginning of the first quarter of  we adopted financial interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
fin  which is a change in accounting for income taxes 
fin contains a two step approach to recognizing and measuring uncertain tax positions accounted for in accordance with sfas no 
the first step is to evaluate the tax position for recognition by determining if the weight of available evidence indicates that it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on audit  including resolution of related appeals or litigation processes  if any 
the second step is to measure the tax benefit as the largest amount that is more than likely of being realized upon settlement 
prior to the adoption of fin  we had recorded a  tax contingency liability and that amount and the specifics therein have remained unchanged 
as of december   the gross amount of our unrecognized tax benefits  inclusive of the  tax liability was approximately  included in this balance are tax positions which  if recognized  would impact our effective tax rate 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 
significant judgment is required in determining any valuation allowance recorded against deferred tax assets 
in assessing the need for a valuation allowance  we consider all available evidence  including past operating results  estimates of future taxable income  and the feasibility of tax planning strategies 
at december   the company continued to provide a full valuation allowance against most of our accumulated us deferred tax assets of  reflecting the company s historical losses and the uncertainty of future taxable income 
our total deferred tax asset not subject to a valuation allowance  is valued at  and consists of  for us state income tax credits that are substantially certain of realization in because the underlying tax is not contingent on us profitability and  for a canadian deferred tax asset relating to temporary timing differences between gaap and tax related expense 
if we begin to generate us taxable income in a future period or if the facts and circumstances on which our estimates and assumptions are based were to change  thereby impacting the likelihood of realizing the deferred tax assets  judgment would have to be applied in determining the amount of valuation allowance no longer required 
reversal of all or a part of this valuation allowance could have a significant positive impact on operating results in the period that it becomes more likely than not that certain of our deferred tax assets will be realized 

table of contents our provision for income taxes is subject to volatility and could be adversely impacted by earnings being lower or higher than anticipated  by tax effects of nondeductible compensation  or by changes in tax laws  regulations  or accounting principles  including accounting for uncertain tax positions or interpretations thereof 
significant judgment is required to determine the recognition and measurement attribute prescribed in fin in addition  fin applies to all income tax positions  including the potential recovery of previously paid taxes  which if settled unfavorably could adversely affect our provision for income taxes or additional paid in capital 
in addition  we are subject to examination of our income tax returns by the internal revenue service and other tax authorities 
we regularly assess the likelihood of adverse outcomes resulting from these examinations to determine the adequacy of our provision for income 
us tax authorities have completed their federal income tax examinations for year canadian tax authorities have conducted no income tax examinations since our commencement of operations in net loss we experienced net losses of   and  in   and respectively 
the following table summarizes previously discussed in this md a unusual components included in the net loss for these three years 
year ended december  unusual items customer deposit forfeiture asset impairment charge loss on impairment of operating lease gain on derivatives loss on extinguishment of convertible debt total unusual items liquidity and capital resources overview based on our performance and current expectations  we believe our cash and cash equivalents  and cash generated from operations  will satisfy our working capital needs  capital expenditures  investment requirements  contractual obligations  commitments  future customer financings  and other liquidity requirements associated with our operations through at least the next twelve months 
however  we operate only two segments  one of which is still developing and emerging  which makes predicting future cash flows difficult 
we plan for and measure our liquidity and capital resources through an annual budgeting process 
at december   our cash and cash equivalents totaled million and we did not have any debt 
we operate two distinct business segments which are in different stages of their life cycle 
our email encryption segment is profitable and is growing in excess of a year 
our e prescribing segment is generating significant losses while still in an emerging phase 
both are subscription businesses that share a common business model 
first  the service is established and maintained  which requires a start up cost and recurring fixed costs 
subscribers are then acquired and brought onto the service  which requires a variable acquisition cost of selling and marketing  installation and deployment 
subscribers are recruited with the goal of reaching a level of subscriber payments that exceed the fixed recurring service costs 
therefore  both the rate at which new subscribers are added and the ability to retain subscribers is essential to operational cash flow 
the recurring nature of the email encryption subscription model makes cash receipts naturally rise in a predictable manner assuming adequate subscription renewal and continued new additions to the subscription base 
adding to the predictability is our model of selling primarily three year contracts with the fees paid annually at the inception of each year of service 
although our email segment is profitable and easier to predict  we continue to closely monitor developments in the e prescribing market and will adjust spending in this area commensurate with expected future returns 

table of contents company wide  we have historically operated where our expenses were in excess of our customer revenues 
during  our cash flow from operations was positive for the first time in the history of zix corporation 
this improvement was primarily driven from increased revenues while holding our costs relatively flat 
we expect this trend to continue in the foreseeable future  and believe a significant portion of our spending is discretionary and flexible and that we have the ability to adjust overall cash spending to react  as needed  to any shortfalls in projected cash 
impact of current economic crisis multiple events during  involving the financial sector of the global economy  have effectively restricted current liquidity within the capital markets throughout the us and around the world 
despite efforts by us treasury and banking regulators to provide liquidity to the financial sector  capital markets continue to remain constrained and volatile 
we expect access to the capital markets to be restricted over the next twelve months and possibly longer should capital markets remain dysfunctional 
although we anticipate funding our operations internally  if we are unable to do so  our ability to raise funds in the capital markets may be restricted due to the current economic situation 
as a result  our ability to raise capital at costs that are similar to market offerings in recent years will likely be limited 
contractual obligations we have total contractual obligations over the next year of  and  over the next three years consisting of various operating office lease agreements 
sources and uses of cash years ended december  net cash provided by used in operations net cash provided by used in investing activities net cash provided by financing activities for  our primary source of liquidity from our operations was the collection of revenue in advance from our customers  accounts receivable from our customers  and the timing of payments to our vendors and service providers 
additionally  we benefited by  from the issuance of common stock to our employees in lieu of cash compensation 
we do not expect to continue this practice in the future 
related to our investing activities  we utilized  to purchase various computing equipment primarily to satisfy customer contracts 
approximately half of these capital purchases were for computer servers for our email segment  which are required to deliver our services 
these purchases were offset by cash inflow from proceeds for an expiring  certificate of deposit 
the cash provided from financing activities was reduced due to minimal activity from the exercise of warrants and stock options 
although we no longer have any debt  we have historically used a significant amount of cash to fund debt obligations 
we do not expect such funding obligations in the immediate foreseeable future 
liquidity summary based on our current budget plans  we believe we have adequate resources and liquidity to sustain operations for the next twelve months 
we have in the past expressed a lack of willingness  relative to other alternatives  to raise capital by issuing new shares of common stock given the recent low price of the company s common stock 
should business results not occur as planned  we would first utilize our existing cash resources and would also consider altering our business plan to augment our cash flow position through cost reduction measures  sales of assets  or other such actions 
there can be no assurance  however  that we would be successful in carrying out any of these measures should they become necessary 
options and warrants of zixcorp common stock 
table of contents we have significant warrants and options outstanding that are currently vested 
there is no assurance that any of these options and warrants will be exercised  therefore the extent of future cash inflow from additional warrant and option activity is not certain 
the following table summarizes the warrants and options that are outstanding as of december  the vested shares are a subset of the outstanding shares 
the value of the shares is the number of shares multiplied by the exercise price for each share 
summary of outstanding options and warrants vested shares total value of included in outstanding outstanding outstanding total value of exercise price range shares shares shares vested shares total off balance sheet arrangements none 
contractual obligations and contingent liabilities and commitments a summary of our fixed contractual obligations and commitments at december  is as follows payments due by period total years operating leases we have severance agreements with certain employees which would require us to pay approximately  if all such employees separated from employment with our company following a change of control  as defined in the severance agreements
