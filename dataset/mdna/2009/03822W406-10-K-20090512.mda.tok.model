industry background the communications industry communications technology has evolved considerably over the last decade due to the substantial growth in the internet and wireless communications 
the emergence of new applications  such as wireless web devices  voice over internet protocol voip  video on demand  third and fourth generation g g wireless services and feature rich smartphones as well as the increase in demand for higher speed  higher bandwidth and ubiquitous remote network access  have increased network complexity and the bandwidth requirements between home and data center 
the continuing adoption of broadband technology  such as streaming media  instant messaging  social networking and e commerce  combined with the increasing availability of next generation wireless devices that incorporate features such as high speed internet browsing  high definition cameras  video recorders and video displays is expected to drive additional data traffic through the network infrastructure in the future 
the different types of data transmitted at various speeds over the internet require service providers and enterprises to invest in efficient multi service equipment that can securely and efficiently process and transport the varied types of network traffic  regardless of whether it is voice  media or data traffic 
to achieve the performance and functionality required by such systems  original equipment manufacturers oems must utilize more complex ics to address both the cost and functionality of a system 
as a result of the pace of new product introductions  the proliferation of standards to be accommodated and the costs and difficulty of designing and producing the required ics  equipment suppliers have increasingly outsourced these ics to semiconductor firms with specialized expertise 
these trends have created a significant opportunity for ic suppliers that can design cost effective solutions for the processing and transport of data 
oems require ic suppliers that possess system level expertise and can quickly bring to market high performance  highly reliable  power efficient ics 
the increase in volume and complexity of network traffic has led to the development of new technologies for more efficient networks 
these technologies provide substantially greater transmission capacity  are less error prone and are easier to maintain than copper networks 
these more efficient networks carry high speed traffic in the form of optical signals that are transmitted and received by complex networking equipment 
to ensure that this equipment and the various networks can communicate with each other  oems and makers of semiconductors have developed numerous communications standards and protocols for the industry 
for example  the synchronous optical network sonet standard in north america and japan and the synchronous data hierarchy sdh standard in the rest of the world became the standards for the transmission of signals over optical fiber 
the sonet sdh standards facilitate high data integrity and improved network reliability  while reducing maintenance and other operation costs by standardizing interoperability among equipment from different vendors 
with exponential increases in data and video traffic and very modest increases in voice traffic  data has become the dominant traffic over all networks today 
as a result  networking infrastructure equipment increasingly emphasizes efficient transporting packet encapsulated data protocols such as internet protocol ip 
optical transport network otn has emerged as a transmission protocol that can provide improved bandwidth utilization at a lower 
table of contents incremental infrastructure cost while being backwards compatible with existing sonet sdh networks 
in addition  access technologies such as gigabit ethernet and passive optical networking pon are increasing the complexity and bandwidth requirements of the network 
the storage industry storage spending represents a significant percentage of information technology it budgets for most enterprises 
regulations such as those issued under the sarbanes oxley act of  the health insurance portability and accountability act of hipaa and those governing the finance industry have driven continued strong demand for high capacity storage within the enterprise and within a wide variety of vertical markets 
in addition  the move from tape based storage to disk based storage has further driven the demand for storage 
the volume of data generated and stored digitally has grown dramatically over the last decade and managing that data is one of the most difficult challenges facing it organizations today 
the enormous growth in storage capacities is also impacting the type of storage being implemented 
it managers across industries are considering less expensive storage technologies to stretch their budgets by reassessing their storage needs and implementing topologies and technologies that are appropriate to the criticality of their stored information 
new drive interface technologies such as sata and sas  provide a much lower cost alternative to traditional enterprise drives 
while sata disk drives are rapidly being deployed in secondary storage applications such as back up  archival and near line storage or the storage of infrequently accessed data  sas is replacing the parallel small computer system interface scsi infrastructure with a serial infrastructure 
sas is also increasingly deployed in traditional fibre channel implementations 
the recent emergence of sas technology has provided the ability to manage both traditional server storage and high capacity sata storage on a single raid controller 
we anticipate that sas will service a significant amount of the high capacity storage market in the coming years 
sas disk drives are increasingly deployed in transactional and enterprise type environments as an alternative to fibre channel drives 
all high performance storage systems implement raid technology  which manages the storage and retrieval of information to and from the disk drives in the server or storage device 
with the need to ensure data availability for many years beyond its creation  raid has become a critical technology for data storage 
raid is a technology in which data is stored in a distributed manner across multiple disk drives to improve system performance and to enhance the ability to survive a hard drive failure 
raid dramatically improves disk access times  provides real time data recovery with uninterrupted access and can increase system uptime and continuous network availability even when a hard drive failure occurs 
raid is a complex technology and it takes many years to mature a raid stack for commercial applications

our embedded processor product line delivers performance and a rich mix of features for internet  communication  data storage  consumer and imaging applications 
our systems architects  design engineers  technical marketing and applications engineers have a thorough understanding of the fiber optic communications and enterprise storage systems for which we design and build application specific standard products 
using this systems expertise  we develop semiconductor and storage connectivity devices to meet the oems high bandwidth requirements 
by understanding the systems into which our products are designed  the end application of our products among carriers and service providers and the requirements driven by their service level agreements  we believe that we are better able to anticipate and develop solutions optimized for the various cost  power and performance trade offs faced by our customers 
we believe that our systems knowledge also enables us to develop more comprehensive  interoperable solutions 
we have developed multiple generations of products that integrate both analog and digital elements on the same ic  while balancing the difficult trade offs of speed  power and timing inherent in very dense high speed applications 
the mixing of digital and analog signals poses difficult challenges for ic designers  particularly at high frequencies 
we have gained significant expertise in mixed signal ic designs through the development of multiple product generations 
we were one of the first companies to embed analog phase locked loops in bipolar chips with digital logic for high speed data transmission and reception applications 
since the introduction of our first on chip clock recovery and clock synthesis products in  we have refined these products and have successfully integrated multiple analog functions and multiple channels on the same ic 
we will continue to apply these competencies in the development of more complex products in the future 
we have developed storage connectivity products that interoperate with server and storage topologies and major operating systems and interfaces 
although we completed the sale of our ware storage adapter business to lsi corporation on april   as discussed in subsequent events in part ii  item  management s discussion and analysis of financial conditions and results of operations  we remain active in the storage industry with our design and sale of embedded storage processor chips and gigabit connectivity solutions with our process products 
we intend to continue working closely with leaders in the storage  networking and computing industries to design and develop new and enhanced storage connectivity products 
we believe that establishing strategic relationships with technology partners is essential to ensure that we continue to design and develop competitive products that integrate well with solutions from other leading participants in the storage markets 

table of contents research and development our research and development expertise and efforts are focused on the development of high performance analog  digital and mixed signal ics for the communications and storage markets and pcbas 
we also develop high performance libraries and design methodologies that are optimized for these applications 
our primary research and development facilities are located in sunnyvale and san diego  california  austin  texas and andover  massachusetts in the united states  ottawa in canada  ho chi minh city in vietnam and pune in india 
during the fiscal years ended march   and  we expended million  million and million  respectively  on research and development activities

on april   after our fiscal year  we completed the sale of our ware storage adapter business to lsi corporation 
see subsequent events in part ii  item  management s discussion and analysis of financial conditions and results of operations for more information 
manufacturing manufacturing of integrated circuits the manufacturing of ics requires a combination of competencies in advanced silicon technologies  package design and manufacturing and high speed test and characterization 
we have obtained access to advanced complementary metal oxide semiconductor cmos and silicon germanium processes through foundry relationships 
we have substantial experience in the development and use of plastic and ceramic packages for high performance applications 
the selection of the optimal package solution is a vital element of the delivery of high performance products and involves balancing cost  size  thermal management and technical performance 
we purchase our ceramic and plastic packages from several vendors including advanced semiconductor engineering ase  amkor  asat  ibm  kyocera  and ntk 
wafer fabrication we do not own or operate foundries for the production of silicon wafers from which our products are made 
we use external foundries such as ibm  taiwan semiconductor manufacturing corporation tsmc and united microelectronics corporation umc for a majority of our production of silicon wafers 
subcontracting our manufacturing requirements eliminates the high fixed cost of owning and operating a semiconductor wafer fabrication facility and enables us to focus our resources on design and test applications where we believe we have greater core competencies and competitive advantages 
assembly and testing our wafer probe and other product testing are conducted at independent test subcontractors 
after wafer testing is complete  the majority of our products are sent to multiple subcontractors for assembly  predominately located in asia 
following assembly  the devices are tested at subcontractors and returned to us ready for shipment 
table of contents to our customers 
certain of these services are available from a limited number of sources and lead times are occasionally extended 
manufacturing of printed circuit board assemblies we believe most component parts used in our atca evaluation boards are standard off the shelf items that can be purchased from two or more sources  other than our proprietary application specific integrated circuits asics and certain ics 
we select suppliers on the basis of functionality  manufacturing capacity  quality and cost 
whenever possible and practicable  we strive to have at least two manufacturing locations for each product 
we encourage our contract manufacturers to purchase the components for our products and assemble them to our specifications 
sales and marketing our sales and marketing strategy is to develop strong  engineering intensive relationships with the design teams of the market leading platforms at our customers 
we maintain close working relationships with these customers so our marketing team can focus on identifying and developing new products that will meet their needs in the future  involving us in the early stages of our customers plans to design new equipment 
we sell our products both directly and through a network of independent manufacturers representatives and distributors 
our direct sales force is technically trained 
expert technical support is critical to our customers success and we provide such support through our field applications engineers  technical marketing team and engineering staff  as well as through our extranet technical support web site 
we augment this strategic account sales approach with domestic and foreign distributors that service primarily smaller accounts purchasing standard ics and pcbas 
typically  these distributors handle a wide variety of products  including those that compete with our products and fill orders for many customers 
for our raid products we primarily used the distribution model and spent a good deal of our sales time supporting their efforts 
we use marketing programs to augment the distribution effort to reach many of our customers 
most of our sales to distributors are made under agreements allowing for price protection and stock rotation of unsold merchandise 
our sales headquarters is located in sunnyvale  california 
we maintain sales offices throughout the world 
net revenues generated from each category of our products as well as information regarding net revenue generated from each of our significant customers and a geographic breakdown of our net revenues is summarized in item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
backlog our sales are made primarily pursuant to standard purchase orders for the delivery of products 
quantities of our products to be delivered and delivery schedules are frequently revised to reflect changes in customers needs  customer orders generally can be cancelled or rescheduled without significant penalty to the customer 
for these reasons  our backlog as of any particular date is not representative of actual sales for any succeeding period and therefore  we believe that backlog is not necessarily a good indicator of future revenue 
competition in the transport communications ic markets  we compete primarily against companies such as lsi  broadcom  cortina and vitesse 
in the embedded processor communications ic market  we compete with technology companies such as freescale semiconductor  cavium and intel 
in addition  some of our customers and potential customers have internal ic or storage designs or manufacturing capabilities with which we compete 
the communications ic market is highly competitive and is subject to rapid technological change 
the nature of the communications ic market is that design cycles are often measured in years 
as such  an ic supplier s timing of delivery to market is critical as once an ic supplier s product is designed into a customer s products  the ic supplier can often enjoy sales of the product for several years 
conversely  if a supplier misses a design cycle or develops an uncompetitive product  the supplier may never generate significant revenues from the product 
we typically face competition at the design stage when our customers are selecting which components to use in their next generation equipment 
we believe that the principal factors of competition for the markets we serve include 
table of contents product performance  quality  reliability  integration  price and time to market  as well as our reputation and level of customer support 
our ability to successfully compete in these markets depends on our ability to design and subcontract the manufacture of new products that implement new technologies and gain end market acceptance in a time efficient and cost effective manner 
proprietary rights we rely in part on patents to protect our intellectual property 
we have been issued approximately patents  which principally cover certain aspects of the design and architecture of our ic and enterprise storage products 
in addition  we have over inventions in various stages of the patenting process in the united states and abroad 
there can be no assurance that any of our pending patent applications or any future applications will be approved  or that any issued patents will provide us with competitive advantages or will not be challenged by third parties or that if challenged  will be found to be valid or enforceable  or that the patents of others will not have an adverse effect on our ability to do business 
there can be no assurance that others will not independently develop similar products or processes  duplicate our products or processes or design around any patents that may be issued to us 
to protect our intellectual property  we also rely on a combination of mask work protection under the federal semiconductor chip protection act of  trademarks  copyrights  trade secret laws  employee and third party nondisclosure agreements and licensing arrangements 
as a general matter  the semiconductor and enterprise storage industries are characterized by substantial litigation regarding patent and other intellectual property rights 
in the past we have been  and in the future may be  notified that we may be infringing on the intellectual property rights of third parties 
we have certain indemnification obligations to customers with respect to the infringement of third party intellectual property rights by our products 
there can be no assurance that infringement claims by third parties or claims for indemnification by customers or end users of our products resulting from infringement claims will not be asserted in the future or that such assertions  if proven to be true  will not materially adversely affect our business  financial condition or operating results 
in the event of any adverse ruling in any such matter  we could be required to pay substantial damages  which could include treble damages  cease the manufacture  use and sale of infringing products  discontinue the use of certain processes or obtain a license under the intellectual property rights of the third party claiming infringement 
there can be no assurance that a license would be available on reasonable terms or at all 
any limitations on our ability to market our products  any delays and costs associated with redesigning our products or payments of license fees to third parties or any failure by us to develop or license a substitute technology on commercially reasonable terms could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and operating results 
environmental matters we are subject to a variety of federal  state and local governmental regulations related to the use  storage  discharge and disposal of toxic  volatile or otherwise hazardous chemicals that were used in our manufacturing process 
any failure to comply with present or future regulations could result in the imposition of fines  the suspension of production or a cessation of operations 
such regulations could require us to acquire costly equipment or incur other significant expenses to comply with environmental regulations or clean up prior discharges 
since  we have been named as a potentially responsible party prp along with a large number of other companies that used omega chemical corporation in whittier  california to handle and dispose of certain hazardous waste material 
we are a member of a large group of prps that has agreed to fund certain remediation efforts at the omega chemical site  which efforts are ongoing

table of contents item a 
risk factors 
risk factors before deciding to invest in us or to maintain or increase your investment  you should carefully consider the risks described below  in addition to the other information contained in this report and in our other filings with the sec 
we update our descriptions of the risks and uncertainties facing us in our periodic reports filed with the sec 
the risks and uncertainties described below and in our other filings are not the only ones facing us 
additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also affect our business 
if any of these known or unknown risks or uncertainties actually occurs  our business  financial condition and results of operations could be seriously harmed 
in that event  the market price for our common stock could decline and you may lose your investment 
the current economic crisis and uncertain political conditions could harm our revenues  operating results and financial condition 
the economies of the united states and other developed countries are currently in a recession 
we cannot predict either the depth or the duration of this economic downturn 
this recession has caused a decline in our near term revenues and it will take some time to return to our previous levels 
the sale of our storage business could increase this time period 
our current operating plans are based on assumptions concerning levels of consumer and corporate spending 
if global and domestic economic and market conditions persist or deteriorate further  we may experience further material impacts on our business  operating results and financial condition which could result in a decline in the price of our common stock 
if economic conditions worsen  we may have to implement additional cost reduction measures or delay certain research and development spending 
we maintain an investment portfolio of various holdings  types  and maturities 
these securities are generally classified as available for sale and  consequently  are recorded on our consolidated balance sheets at fair value with unrealized gains or losses reported as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income 
our portfolio primarily includes fixed income securities mutual funds and preferred stocks  the values of which are subject to market price volatility 
the deterioration of these market prices has had an unfavorable impact on our portfolio and has caused us to record impairment charges to our earnings 
during the fiscal years ended march  and  we recorded other than temporary impairment charges of million and million  respectively 
if the market prices continue to decline or securities continue to be in a loss position over time  we may recognize additional impairments in the fair value of our investments 
adverse economic and market conditions could also harm our business by negatively affecting the parties with whom we do business  including our business partners  our customers and our suppliers 
these conditions could impair the ability of our customers to pay for products they have purchased from us 
as a result  allowances for doubtful accounts and write offs of accounts receivable from our customers may increase 
in addition  our suppliers may experience financial difficulties that could negatively affect their operations and their ability to supply us with the parts we need to manufacture our products 
we have invested in privately held companies  many of which can still be considered in startup or developmental stages 
these investments are inherently risky as the market for the technologies or products they have under development are typically in the early stages and may never materialize 
we could lose all or substantially all of the value of our investments in these companies  and in some cases we have lost all or substantially all of the value of our investment in such entities 

table of contents our operating results may fluctuate because of a number of factors  many of which are beyond our control 
if our operating results are below the expectations of public market analysts or investors  then the market price of our common stock could decline 
some of the factors that affect our quarterly and annual results  but which are difficult to control or predict  are communications  information technology and semiconductor industry conditions  fluctuations in the timing and amount of customer requests for product shipments  the reduction  rescheduling or cancellation of orders by customers  including as a result of slowing demand for our products or our customers products or over ordering of our products or our customers products  changes in the mix of products that our customers buy  the gain or loss of one or more key customers or their key customers  or significant changes in the financial condition of one or more of our key customers or their key customers  our ability to introduce  certify and deliver new products and technologies on a timely basis  the announcement or introduction of products and technologies by our competitors  competitive pressures on selling prices  the ability of our customers to obtain components from their other suppliers  market acceptance of our products and our customers products  fluctuations in manufacturing output  yields or other problems or delays in the fabrication  assembly  testing or delivery of our products or our customers products  increases in the costs of products or discontinuance of products by suppliers  the availability of external foundry capacity  contract manufacturing services  purchased parts and raw materials including packaging substrates  problems or delays that we and our foundries may face in shifting the design and manufacture of our future generations of ic products to smaller geometry process technologies and in achieving higher levels of design and device integration  the amounts and timing of costs associated with warranties and product returns  the amounts and timing of investments in research and development  the amounts and timing of the costs associated with payroll taxes related to stock option exercises or settlement of restricted stock units  costs associated with acquisitions and the integration of acquired companies  products and technologies  the impact of potential one time charges related to purchased intangibles  our ability to successfully integrate acquired companies  products and technologies  the impact on interest income of a significant use of our cash for an acquisition  stock repurchase or other purpose  the effects of changes in interest rates or credit worthiness on the value and yield of our short term investment portfolio  costs associated with compliance with applicable environmental  other governmental or industry regulations including costs to redesign products to comply with those regulations or lost revenue due to failure to comply in a timely manner  the effects of changes in accounting standards  
table of contents costs associated with litigation  including without limitation  attorney fees  litigation judgments or settlements  relating to the use or ownership of intellectual property or other claims arising out of our operations  our ability to identify  hire and retain senior management and other key personnel  the effects of war  acts of terrorism or global threats  such as disruptions in general economic activity and changes in logistics and security arrangements  and global economic recession and industry conditions 
our business  financial condition and operating results would be harmed if we do not achieve anticipated revenues 
we can have revenue shortfalls for a variety of reasons  including the reduction  rescheduling or cancellation of customer orders  declines in the average selling prices of our products  delays when our customers are transitioning from old products to new products  a decrease in demand for our products or our customers products  a decline in the financial condition or liquidity of our customers or their customers  delays in the availability of our products or our customers products  the failure of our products to be qualified in our customers systems or certified by our customers  excess inventory of our products held by our customers  resulting in a reduction in their order patterns as they work through the excess inventory of our products  fabrication  test  product yield  or assembly constraints for our products that adversely affect our ability to meet our production obligations  the failure of one of our subcontract manufacturers to perform its obligations to us  our failure to successfully integrate acquired companies  products and technologies  shortages of raw materials or production capacity constraints that lead our suppliers to allocate available supplies or capacity to other customers  which may disrupt our ability to meet our production obligations  and global economic recession and industry conditions 
our business is characterized by short term orders and shipment schedules 
customer orders typically can be cancelled or rescheduled without significant penalty to the customer 
because we do not have substantial non cancellable backlog  we typically plan our production and inventory levels based on internal forecasts of customer demand  which is highly unpredictable and can fluctuate substantially 
customer orders for our products typically have non standard lead times  which make it difficult for us to predict revenues and plan inventory levels and production schedules 
if we are unable to plan inventory levels and production schedules effectively  our business  financial condition and operating results could be materially harmed 
from time to time  in response to anticipated long lead times to obtain inventory and materials from our outside contract manufacturers  suppliers and foundries  we may order materials in advance of anticipated customer demand 
this advance ordering has in the past and may in the future result in excess inventory levels or unanticipated inventory write downs if expected orders fail to materialize  or other factors render our products less marketable 
if we are forced to hold excess inventory or we incur unanticipated inventory write downs  our financial condition and operating results could be materially harmed 
our expense levels are relatively fixed and are based on our expectations of future revenues 
we have limited ability to reduce expenses quickly in response to any revenue shortfalls 
changes to production volumes and impact of overhead absorption may result in a decline in our financial condition or liquidity 

table of contents our business substantially depends upon the continued growth of the technology sector and the internet 
the technology equipment industry is cyclical and has in the past experienced significant and extended downturns 
the current downturn is significant and we cannot predict how long it will last 
a substantial portion of our business and revenue depends on the continued growth of the technology sector and the internet 
we sell our communications ic products primarily to communications equipment manufacturers that in turn sell their equipment to customers that depend on the growth of the internet 
the current downturn has already caused a reduction in capital spending on information technology 
if this reduction continues or deepens  our business  operating results and financial condition may be materially harmed 
the loss of one or more key customers  the diminished demand for our products from a key customer  or the failure to obtain certifications from a key customer or its distribution channel could significantly reduce our revenues and profits 
a relatively small number of customers have accounted for a significant portion of our revenues in any particular period 
we have no long term volume purchase commitments from our key customers 
one or more of our key customers may discontinue operations as a result of consolidation  liquidation or otherwise 
reductions  delays and cancellation of orders from our key customers or the loss of one or more key customers could significantly reduce our revenues and profits 
we cannot assure you that our current customers will continue to place orders with us  that orders by existing customers will continue at current or historical levels or that we will be able to obtain orders from new customers 
our ability to maintain or increase sales to key customers and attract significant new customers is subject to a variety of factors  including customers may stop incorporating our products into their own products with limited notice to us and may suffer little or no penalty as a result of such action  customers or prospective customers may not incorporate our products into their future product designs  design wins as explained below with customers or prospective customers may not result in sales to such customers  the introduction of new products by customers may occur later or be less successful in the market than planned  we may successfully design a product to customer specifications but the customer may not be successful in the market  sales of customer product lines incorporating our products may rapidly decline or such product lines may be phased out  our agreements with customers typically are non exclusive and do not require them to purchase a minimum quantity of our products  many of our customers have pre existing relationships with our current or potential competitors that may cause our customers to switch from using our products to using competing products  some of our oem customers may develop products internally that would replace our products  we may not be able to successfully develop relationships with additional network equipment vendors  our relationships with some of our larger customers may deter other potential customers who compete with these customers from buying our products  the impact of terminating certain sales representatives or sales personnel as a result of a company workforce reduction or otherwise  and some of our customers and prospective customers may become less viable or fail 

table of contents the occurrence of any one of the factors above could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
there is no guarantee that design wins will become actual orders and sales 
a design win occurs when a customer or prospective customer notifies us that our product has been selected to be integrated with the customer s product 
there can be delays of several months or more between the design win and when a customer initiates actual orders of our product 
following a design win  we will commit significant resources to the integration of our product into the customer s product before receiving the initial order 
receipt of an initial order from a customer following a design win  however  is dependent on a number of factors  including the success of the customer s product  and cannot be guaranteed 
the design win may never result in an actual order or sale 
any significant order cancellations or order deferrals could cause unplanned inventory growth resulting in excess inventory which may adversely affect our operating results 
our customers may increase orders during periods of product shortages or cancel orders if their inventories are too high 
major inventory corrections by our customers are not uncommon and can last for significant periods of time and affect demand for our products 
customers may also cancel or delay orders in anticipation of new products or for other reasons 
cancellations or deferrals could cause us to hold excess inventory  which could reduce our profit margins by reducing sales prices  incurring inventory write downs or writing off additional obsolete products 
inventory fluctuations could affect our results of operations and restrict our ability to fund our operations 
inventory management remains an area of focus as we balance the need to maintain strategic inventory levels to ensure competitive lead times against the risk of inventory obsolescence because of changing technology and customer requirements 
we generally recognize revenue upon shipment of products to a customer 
if a customer refuses to accept shipped products or does not pay for these products  we could miss future revenue projections or incur significant charges against our income  which could materially and adversely affect our operating results 
our customers products typically have lengthy design cycles 
a customer may decide to cancel or change its product plans  which could cause us to lose anticipated sales 
after we have developed and delivered a product to a customer  the customer will usually test and evaluate our product prior to designing its own equipment to incorporate our product 
our customers may need more than six months to test  evaluate and adopt our product and an additional nine months or more to begin volume production of equipment that incorporates our product 
due to this lengthy design cycle  we may experience significant delays from the time we increase our operating expenses and make investments in inventory until the time that we generate revenue from these products 
it is possible that we may never generate any revenue from these products after incurring such expenditures 
even if a customer selects our product to incorporate into its equipment  we cannot guarantee that the customer will ultimately market and sell its equipment or that such efforts by our customer will be successful 
the delays inherent in this lengthy design cycle increases the risk that a customer will decide to cancel or change its product plans 
such a cancellation or change in plans by a customer could cause us to lose sales that we had anticipated 
while our customers design cycles are typically long  some of our product life cycles tend to be short as a result of the rapidly changing technology environment in which we operate 
as a result  the resources devoted to product sales and marketing may not generate material revenue for us  and from time to time  we may need to write off excess and obsolete inventory 
if we incur significant marketing expenses and investments in inventory in the future that we are not able to recover  and we are not able to mitigate those expenses  our operating results could be adversely affected 
in addition  if we sell our products at reduced prices in anticipation of cost reductions but still hold higher cost products in inventory  our operating results would be harmed 

table of contents an important part of our strategy is to focus on the markets for communications equipment 
if we change strategy or are unable to further expand our share of these markets or react timely or properly to emerging trends  our revenues may not grow and could decline 
our markets frequently undergo transitions in which products rapidly incorporate new features and performance standards on an industry wide basis 
if our products are unable to support the new features or performance levels required by oems in these markets  or if our products fail to be certified by oems  we would lose business from an existing or potential customer and may not have the opportunity to compete for new design wins or certification until the next product transition occurs 
if we fail to develop products with required features or performance standards  or if we experience a delay as short as a few months in certifying or bringing a new product to market  or if our customers fail to achieve market acceptance of their products  our revenues could be significantly reduced for a substantial period 
we expect a significant portion of our revenues to continue to be derived from sales of products based on current  widely accepted transmission standards 
if the communications market evolves to new standards  we may not be able to successfully design and manufacture new products that address the needs of our customers or gain substantial market acceptance 
the recent sale of our ware storage adaptor business to lsi corporation marks a change in our strategy 
this change  or any further changes we might make  could have a significant impact on our business  financial condition and results of operations while we are implementing our new strategy 
furthermore  there is no assurance that our new strategy will not fail 
if we do not identify and pursue the correct emerging trends and align ourselves with the correct market leaders  we may not be successful and our business  financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 
customers for our products generally have substantial technological capabilities and financial resources 
some customers have traditionally used these resources to internally develop their own products 
the future prospects for our products in these markets are dependent upon our customers acceptance of our products as an alternative to their internally developed products 
future prospects also are dependent upon acceptance of third party sourcing for products as an alternative to in house development 
network equipment vendors may in the future continue to use internally developed components 
they also may decide to develop or acquire components  technologies or products that are similar to  or that may be substituted for  our products 
if our network equipment vendor customers fail to accept our products as an alternative  if they develop or acquire the technology to develop such components internally rather than purchase our products  or if we are otherwise unable to develop or maintain strong relationships with them  our business  financial condition and results of operations would be materially and adversely affected 
our business strategy may contemplate the acquisition of other companies  products and technologies 
merger and acquisition activities involve numerous risks and we may not be able to address these risks successfully without substantial expense  delay or other operational or financial problems 
acquiring products  technologies or businesses from third parties is part of our business strategy 
the risks involved with merger and acquisition activities include potential dilution to our stockholders  use of a significant portion of our cash reserves  diversion of management s attention  failure to retain or integrate key personnel  difficulty in completing an acquired company s in process research or development projects  amortization of acquired intangible assets and deferred compensation  customer dissatisfaction or performance problems with an acquired company s products or services  
table of contents costs associated with acquisitions or mergers  difficulties associated with the integration of acquired companies  products or technologies  difficulties competing in markets that are unfamiliar to us  ability of the acquired companies to meet their financial projections  and assumption of unknown liabilities  or other unanticipated events or circumstances 
any of these risks could materially harm our business  financial condition and results of operations 
as with past acquisitions  future acquisitions could adversely affect operating results 
in particular  acquisitions may materially and adversely affect our results of operations because they may require large one time charges or could result in increased debt or contingent liabilities  adverse tax consequences  substantial additional depreciation or deferred compensation charges 
our past purchase acquisitions required us to capitalize significant amounts of goodwill and purchased intangible assets 
as a result of the slowdown in our industry and reduction of our market capitalization  we have been required to record significant impairment charges against these assets as noted in our financial statements 
in the fiscal year ended march  we recorded a goodwill impairment charge of million to continuing operations 
the goodwill impaired was previously assigned to the process and transport reporting units in the amounts of million  million  respectively 
in the fiscal year ended march   we recorded a goodwill impairment charge of million to continuing operations for the process reporting unit 
in the fiscal years ended march   and  we recorded goodwill impairment charges to discontinued operations of million  million and million  respectively  for the store reporting unit 
these market conditions continuously change and it is difficult to project how long this current economic downturn may last 
these conditions have caused a decline in our near term revenues and it will take some time to ramp back up to our previous levels 
additionally  market values have deteriorated which has had an unfavorable impact on our valuations which are part of the goodwill and purchased intangible asset impairment tests 
there can be no assurances that market conditions will not deteriorate further or that our market capitalization will not decline further 
at march   we had million of purchased intangible assets 
we cannot assure you that we will not be required to take additional significant charges as a result of impairment to the carrying value of these assets  due to further adverse changes in market conditions 
our industry and markets are subject to consolidation  which may result in stronger competitors  fewer customers and reduced demand 
there has been industry consolidation among communications ic companies  network equipment companies and telecommunications companies in the past 
we expect this consolidation to continue as companies attempt to strengthen or hold their positions in evolving markets 
consolidation may result in stronger competitors  fewer customers and reduced demand  which in turn could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results  and financial condition 
our operating results are subject to fluctuations because we rely heavily on international sales 
international sales account for a significant part of our revenues and may account for an increasing portion of our future revenues 
the revenues we derive from international sales may be subject to certain risks  including foreign currency exchange fluctuations  changes in regulatory requirements  tariffs  rising protectionism and other barriers  timing and availability of export licenses  political and economic instability  difficulties in accounts receivable collections  difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations  difficulties in managing distributors  
table of contents difficulties in obtaining governmental approvals for communications and other products  reduced or uncertain protection for intellectual property rights in some countries  longer payment cycles to collect accounts receivable in some countries  burdens of complying with a wide variety of complex foreign laws and treaties  potentially adverse tax consequences  and a worsening economic condition that may trail any improvements in the united states 
we are subject to risks associated with the imposition of legislation and regulations relating to the import or export of high technology products 
we cannot predict whether quotas  duties  taxes or other charges or restrictions upon the importation or exportation of our products will be implemented by the united states or other countries 
because sales of our products have been denominated to date primarily in united states dollars  increases in the value of the united states dollar could increase the price of our products so that they become relatively more expensive to customers in the local currency of a particular country  leading to a reduction in sales and profitability in that country 
future international activity may result in increased foreign currency denominated sales 
gains and losses on the conversion to united states dollars of accounts payable and other monetary assets and liabilities arising from international operations may contribute to fluctuations in our results of operations 
some of our customer purchase orders and agreements are governed by foreign laws  which may differ significantly from laws in the united states 
as a result  our ability to enforce our rights under such agreements may be limited compared with our ability to enforce our rights under agreements governed by laws in the united states 
our cash and cash equivalents and portfolio of short term investments and long term marketable securities are exposed to certain market risks 
we maintain an investment portfolio of various holdings  types of instruments and maturities 
these securities are recorded on our consolidated balance sheets at fair value with unrealized gains or losses reported as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income loss  net of tax 
our investment portfolio is exposed to market risks related to changes in interest rates and credit ratings of the issuers  as well as to the risks of default by the issuers and lack of overall market liquidity 
substantially all of these securities are subject to interest rate and credit rating risk and will decline in value if interest rates increase or one of the issuers credit ratings is reduced 
increases in interest rates or decreases in the credit worthiness of one or more of the issuers in our investment portfolio could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition or results of operations 
for the year ended march  we recorded other than temporary impairment charges associated with certain of these securities of million to current earnings 
during the fiscal year ended march   we recorded million in write downs in the carrying value of certain securities as we determined the decline in the fair value of these securities to be other than temporary 
if the fair value of any of these securities does not recover to at least the amortized cost of such security or we are unable to hold these securities until they recover and there is a further deterioration in market conditions or there are additional losses incurred  we may be required to record a further decline in the carrying value of these securities resulting in further charges 
at march   the unrealized losses on these securities  that were not written down as an other than temporary impairment charge  were approximately million 
our restructuring activities could result in management distractions  operational disruptions and other difficulties 
over the past several years  we have initiated several restructuring activities in an effort to reduce operating costs  including new restructuring initiatives announced in october and february employees whose positions were eliminated in connection with these restructuring activities may seek employment with our customers or competitors 
although each of our employees is required to sign a confidentiality agreement with us at the time of hire  we cannot guarantee that the confidential nature of our proprietary information will be maintained in the course of such future employment 
any additional restructuring efforts could divert the attention of our management away from our operations  harm our reputation and increase our expenses 
we cannot guarantee 
table of contents that we will not undertake additional restructuring activities  that any of our restructuring efforts will be successful  or that we will be able to realize the cost savings and other anticipated benefits from our previous or future restructuring plans 
in addition  if we continue to reduce our workforce  it may adversely impact our ability to respond rapidly to new growth opportunities 
our markets are subject to rapid technological change  so our success depends heavily on our ability to develop and introduce new products 
the markets for our products are characterized by rapidly changing technologies  evolving and competing industry standards  changing customer needs  frequent introductions of new products and enhancements  increased integration with other functions  long design and sales cycles  short product life cycles  and intense competition 
to develop new products for the communications or other technology markets  we must develop  gain access to and use leading technologies in a cost effective and timely manner and continue to develop technical and design expertise 
we must have our products designed into our customers future products and maintain close working relationships with key customers in order to develop new products that meet customers changing needs 
we must respond to changing industry standards  trends towards increased integration and other technological changes on a timely and cost effective basis 
our pursuit of technological advances may require substantial time and expense and may ultimately prove unsuccessful 
if we are not successful in adopting such advances  we may be unable to timely bring to market new products and our revenues will suffer 
many of our products are based on industry standards that are continually evolving 
our ability to compete in the future will depend on our ability to identify and ensure compliance with these evolving industry standards 
the emergence of new industry standards could render our products incompatible with products developed by major systems manufacturers 
as a result  we could be required to invest significant time and effort and to incur significant expense to redesign our products to ensure compliance with relevant standards 
if our products are not in compliance with prevailing industry standards or requirements  we could miss opportunities to achieve crucial design wins which in turn could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating and financial results 
the markets in which we compete are highly competitive  and we expect competition to increase in these markets in the future 
the markets in which we compete are highly competitive  and we expect that domestic and international competition will increase in these markets  due in part to deregulation  rapid technological advances  price erosion  changing customer preferences and evolving industry standards 
increased competition could result in significant price competition  reduced revenues  lower profit margins or loss of market share 
our ability to compete successfully in our markets depends on a number of factors  including our ability to partner with oem and channel partners who are successful in the market  success in designing and subcontracting the manufacture of new products that implement new technologies  product quality  interoperability  reliability  performance and certification  customer support  time to market  
table of contents price  production efficiency  design wins  expansion of production of our products for particular systems manufacturers  end user acceptance of the systems manufacturers products  market acceptance of competitors products  and general economic conditions 
our competitors may offer enhancements to existing products  or offer new products based on new technologies  industry standards or customer requirements that are available to customers on a more timely basis than comparable products from us or that have the potential to replace or provide lower cost alternatives to our products 
the introduction of enhancements or new products by our competitors could render our existing and future products obsolete or unmarketable 
we expect that certain of our competitors and other semiconductor companies may seek to develop and introduce products that integrate the functions performed by our ic products on a single chip  thus eliminating the need for our products 
each of these factors could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
in the transport communications ic markets  we compete primarily against companies such as lsi  broadcom and vitesse 
in the embedded processor communications ic market  we compete with technology companies such as freescale semiconductor  cavium and intel 
many of these companies may have substantially greater financial  marketing and distribution resources than we have 
certain of our customers or potential customers have internal ic design or manufacturing capabilities with which we compete 
we may also face competition from new entrants to our target markets  including larger technology companies that may develop or acquire differentiating technology and then apply their resources to our detriment 
any failure by us to compete successfully in these target markets would have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
our dependence on third party manufacturing and supply relationships increases the risk that we will not have an adequate supply of products to meet demand or that our cost of materials will be higher than expected 
we depend upon third parties to manufacture  assemble  package or test certain of our products 
as a result  we are subject to risks associated with these third parties  including reduced control over delivery schedules and quality  inadequate manufacturing yields and excessive costs  difficulties selecting and integrating new subcontractors  potential lack of adequate capacity during periods of excess demand  limited warranties on products supplied to us  potential increases in prices  potential instability in countries where third party manufacturers are located  and potential misappropriation of our intellectual property 
our outside foundries generally manufacture our products on a purchase order basis  and we have few long term supply arrangements with these suppliers 
we have less control over delivery schedules  manufacturing yields and costs than competitors with their own fabrication facilities 
a manufacturing disruption experienced by one or more of our outside foundries or a disruption of our relationship with an outside foundry  including discontinuance of our products by that foundry  would negatively impact the production of certain of our products for a substantial period of time 

table of contents our ic products are generally only qualified for production at a single foundry 
these suppliers can allocate  and in the past have allocated  capacity to the production of other companies products while reducing deliveries to us on short notice 
there is also the potential that they may discontinue manufacturing our products or go out of business 
because establishing relationships  designing or redesigning ics  and ramping production with new outside foundries may take over a year  there is no readily available alternative source of supply for these products 
difficulties associated with adapting our technology and product design to the proprietary process technology and design rules of outside foundries can lead to reduced yields of our ic products 
the process technology of an outside foundry is typically proprietary to the manufacturer 
since low yields may result from either design or process technology failures  yield problems may not be effectively determined or resolved until an actual product exists that can be analyzed and tested to identify process sensitivities relating to the design rules that are used 
as a result  yield problems may not be identified until well into the production process  and resolution of yield problems may require cooperation between us and our manufacturer 
this risk could be compounded by the offshore location of certain of our manufacturers  increasing the effort and time required to identify  communicate and resolve manufacturing yield problems 
manufacturing defects that we do not discover during the manufacturing or testing process may lead to costly product recalls 
these risks may lead to increased costs or delayed product delivery  which would harm our profitability and customer relationships 
if the foundries or subcontractors we use to manufacture our products discontinue the manufacturing processes needed to meet our demands  or fail to upgrade their technologies needed to manufacture our products  we may be unable to deliver products to our customers  which could materially adversely affect our operating results 
the transition to the next generation of manufacturing technologies at one or more of our outside foundries could be unsuccessful or delayed 
our requirements typically represent a very small portion of the total production of the third party foundries 
as a result  we are subject to the risk that a producer will cease production of an older or lower volume process that it uses to produce our parts 
we cannot assure you that our external foundries will continue to devote resources to the production of parts for our products or continue to advance the process design technologies on which the manufacturing of our products are based 
each of these events could increase our costs  lower our gross margin  cause us to hold more inventories or materially impact our ability to deliver our products on time 
as our volumes decrease with any third party foundry  the likelihood of unfavorable pricing increases 
some companies that supply our customers are similarly dependent on a limited number of suppliers to produce their products 
these other companies products may be designed into the same networking equipment into which our products are designed 
our order levels could be reduced materially if these companies are unable to access sufficient production capacity to produce in volumes demanded by our customers because our customers may be forced to slow down or halt production on the equipment into which our products are designed 
our operating results depend on manufacturing output and yields of our ics and printed circuit board assemblies  which may not meet expectations 
the yields on wafers we have manufactured decline whenever a substantial percentage of wafers must be rejected or a significant number of die on each wafer are nonfunctional 
such declines can be caused by many factors  including minute levels of contaminants in the manufacturing environment  design issues  defects in masks used to print circuits on a wafer  and difficulties in the fabrication process 
design iterations and process changes by our suppliers can cause a risk of defects 
many of these problems are difficult to diagnose  are time consuming and expensive to remedy  and can result in shipment delays 
we estimate yields per wafer and final packaged parts in order to estimate the value of inventory 
if yields are materially different than projected  work in process inventory may need to be revalued 
we may have to take inventory write downs as a result of decreases in manufacturing yields 
we may suffer periodic yield problems in connection with new or existing products or in connection with the commencement of production at a new manufacturing facility 

table of contents we may experience difficulties in transitioning to smaller geometry process technologies or in achieving higher levels of design integration and that may result in reduced manufacturing yields  delays in product deliveries and increased expenses 
as smaller line width geometry processes become more prevalent  we expect to integrate greater levels of functionality into our ic products and to transition our ic products to increasingly smaller geometries 
this transition will require us to redesign certain products and will require us and our foundries to migrate to new manufacturing processes for our products 
we may not be able to achieve higher levels of design integration or deliver new integrated products on a timely basis 
we periodically evaluate the benefits  on a product by product basis  of migrating to smaller geometry process technologies to reduce our costs and increase performance  and we have designed ic products to be manufactured at as little as 
micron geometry processes 
we have experienced some difficulties in shifting to smaller geometry process technologies and new manufacturing processes 
these difficulties resulted in reduced manufacturing yields  delays in product deliveries and increased expenses 
we may face similar difficulties  delays and expenses as we continue to transition our ic products to smaller geometry processes 
we are dependent on our relationships with our foundries to transition to smaller geometry processes successfully 
we cannot assure you that our foundries will be able to effectively manage the transition or that we will be able to maintain our relationships with our foundries 
if we or our foundries experience significant delays in this transition or fail to implement this transition  our business  financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 
we must develop or otherwise gain access to improved ic process technologies 
our future success will depend upon our ability to access new ic process technologies 
in the future  we may be required to transition one or more of our ic products to process technologies with smaller geometries  other materials or higher speeds in order to reduce costs or improve product performance 
we may not be able to gain access to new process technologies in a timely or affordable manner or products based on these new technologies may not achieve market acceptance 
the complexity of our products may lead to errors  defects and bugs  which could negatively impact our reputation with customers and result in liability 
products as complex as ours may contain errors  defects and bugs when first introduced or as new versions are released 
our products have in the past experienced such errors  defects and bugs 
delivery of products with production defects or reliability  quality or compatibility problems could significantly delay or hinder market acceptance of the products or result in a costly recall and could damage our reputation and adversely affect our ability to retain existing customers and to attract new customers 
errors  defects or bugs could cause problems with device functionality  resulting in interruptions  delays or cessation of sales to our customers 
we may also be required to make significant expenditures of capital and resources to resolve such problems 
we cannot assure you that problems will not be found in new products after commencement of commercial production  despite testing by us  our suppliers or our customers 
any problem could result in additional development costs  loss of  or delays in  market acceptance  diversion of technical and other resources from our other development efforts  claims by our customers or others against us  and loss of credibility with our current and prospective customers 
any such event could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 

table of contents if our internal control over financial reporting is not considered effective  our business and stock price could be adversely affected 
section of the sarbanes oxley act of requires us to evaluate the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of the end of each fiscal year  and to include a management report assessing the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting in our annual report on form k for that fiscal year 
section also requires our independent registered public accounting firm to attest to and report on the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting 
our management  including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer  does not expect that our internal control over financial reporting will prevent all errors and all fraud 
a control system  no matter how well designed and operated  can provide only reasonable  not absolute  assurance that the control system s objectives will be met 
further  the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints  and the benefits of control must be considered relative to their costs 
because of the inherent limitations in all control systems  no evaluation of internal control can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud involving a company have been  or will be  detected 
the design of any system of controls is based in part on certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events  and we cannot assure you that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions 
over time  internal control may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or deterioration in the degree of compliance with policies or procedures 
because of the inherent limitations in a cost effective control system  misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected 
our management has concluded  and our independent registered public accounting firm has attested  that our internal control over financial reporting was effective as of march  we cannot assure you that we or our independent registered public accounting firm will not identify a material weakness in our internal control in the future 
a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting would require management and our independent registered public accounting firm to assess our internal control as ineffective 
if our internal control over financial reporting is not considered effective  we may experience another restatement and or a loss of public confidence  which could have an adverse effect on our business and on the market price of our common stock 
our leadership transition may not go smoothly and could adversely impact our future operations 
we had previously announced that kambiz hooshmand will step down as our chief executive officer and will be replaced by paramesh gopi  our current chief operating officer 
a significant leadership change is inherently risky and we may be unable to manage this transition smoothly which could adversely impact our future strategy and ability to function or execute and could materially and adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
our future success depends in part on the continued service of our key senior management  design engineering  sales  marketing  and manufacturing personnel  our ability to identify  hire and retain additional  qualified personnel and successful succession planning 
our future success depends to a significant extent upon the continued service of our senior management personnel and successful succession planning 
the loss of key senior executives could have a material adverse effect on our business 
there is intense competition for qualified personnel in the semiconductor industry  in particular design  product and test engineers  and we may not be able to continue to attract and retain engineers or other qualified personnel necessary for the development of our business  or to replace engineers or other qualified personnel who may leave our employment in the future 
there may be significant costs associated with recruiting  hiring and retaining personnel 
periods of contraction in our business may inhibit our ability to attract and retain our personnel 
loss of the services of  or failure to recruit  key design engineers or other technical and management personnel could be significantly detrimental to our product development or other aspects of our business 
to manage operations effectively  we will be required to continue to improve our operational  financial and management systems and to successfully hire  train  motivate  and manage our employees 
the integration of future acquisitions would require significant additional management  technical and administrative resources 
we cannot guarantee that we would be able to manage our expanded operations effectively 

table of contents our ability to supply a sufficient number of products to meet demand could be severely hampered by a shortage of water  electricity or other supplies  or by natural disasters or other catastrophes 
the manufacture of our products requires significant amounts of water 
previous droughts have resulted in restrictions being placed on water use by manufacturers 
in the event of a future drought  reductions in water use may be mandated generally and our external foundries ability to manufacture our products could be impaired 
several of our facilities  including our principal executive offices  are located in california 
in  california experienced prolonged energy alerts and blackouts caused by disruption in energy supplies 
as a consequence  businesses and other energy consumers in california continue to experience substantially increased costs of electricity and natural gas 
we are unsure whether energy alerts and blackouts will reoccur or how severe they may become in the future 
many of our customers and suppliers are also headquartered or have substantial operations in california 
if we or any of our major customers or suppliers located in california experience a sustained disruption in energy supplies  our results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 
a portion of our test and assembly facilities are located in our san diego  california location and a significant portion of our manufacturing operations are located in asia 
these areas are subject to natural disasters such as earthquakes or floods 
we do not have earthquake or business interruption insurance for these facilities  because adequate coverage is not offered at economically justifiable rates 
a significant natural disaster or other catastrophic event could have a material adverse impact on our business  financial condition and operating results 
the effects of war  acts of terrorism or global threats  including  but not limited to  the outbreak of epidemic disease  could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
the continued threat of terrorism and heightened security and military action in response to this threat  or any future acts of terrorism  may cause further disruptions to local and global economies and create further uncertainties 
to the extent that such disruptions or uncertainties result in delays or cancellations of customer orders  or the manufacture or shipment of our products  our business  operating results and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected 
we could incur substantial fines or litigation costs associated with our storage  use and disposal of hazardous materials 
we are subject to a variety of federal  state and local governmental regulations related to the use  storage  discharge and disposal of toxic  volatile or otherwise hazardous chemicals used in our manufacturing process 
any failure to comply with present or future regulations could result in the imposition of fines  the suspension of production or a cessation of operations 
these regulations could require us to acquire costly equipment or incur other significant expenses to comply with environmental regulations or clean up prior discharges 
since  we have been named as a potentially responsible party prp along with a large number of other companies that used omega chemical corporation in whittier  california to handle and dispose of certain hazardous waste material 
we are a member of a large group of prps that has agreed to fund certain on going remediation efforts at the omega chemical site 
to date  our payment obligations with respect to these funding efforts have not been material  and we believe that our future obligations to fund these efforts will not have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or operating results 
in  we closed our wafer fabrication facility in san diego and the property was returned to the landlord 
in operating the facility at this site  we stored and used hazardous materials 
although we believe that we have been and currently are in material compliance with applicable environmental laws and regulations  we cannot guarantee that we are or will be in material compliance with these laws or regulations or that our future obligations to fund any remediation efforts  including those at the omega chemical site  will not have a material adverse effect on our business 
environmental laws and regulations could cause a disruption in our business and operations 
we are subject to various state  federal and international laws and regulations governing the environment  including those restricting the presence of certain substances in electronic products and making manufacturers of those products financially responsible for the collection  treatment  recycling and disposal of certain products 
such laws and regulations have been passed in several jurisdictions in which we operate  including various european union eu member countries 
for example  the european union has enacted the restriction of the use of 
table of contents certain hazardous substances in electrical and electronic equipment rohs and the waste electrical and electronic equipment weee directives 
rohs prohibits the use of lead and other substances  in semiconductors and other products put on the market after july  the weee directive obligates parties that place electrical and electronic equipment on the market in the eu to put a clearly identifiable mark on the equipment  register with and report to eu member countries regarding distribution of the equipment  and provide a mechanism to take back and properly dispose of the equipment 
there can be no assurance that similar programs will not be implemented in other jurisdictions resulting in additional costs  possible delays in delivering products  and even the discontinuance of existing and planned future product replacements if the cost were to become prohibitive 
any acquisitions we make could disrupt our business and harm our results of operations and financial condition 
we may make additional investments in or acquire other companies  products or technologies 
these acquisitions may involve numerous risks  including problems combining or integrating the purchased operations  technologies or products  unanticipated costs  diversion of management s attention from our core business  adverse effects on existing business relationships with suppliers and customers  risks associated with entering markets in which we have limited or no prior experience  and potential loss of key employees  particularly those of the acquired organizations 
in addition  in the event of any such investments or acquisitions  we could issue stock that would dilute our current stockholders percentage ownership  incur debt  assume liabilities  incur amortization or impairment expenses related to goodwill and other intangible assets  or incur large and immediate write offs 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to successfully integrate any businesses  products  technologies or personnel that we might acquire 
any dispositions we make could disrupt our business and harm our results of operations and financial condition 
we completed the sale of our ware storage adapter business  a significant portion of our business  to lsi corporation on april  as a result  we now expect to generate all of our sales from our remaining business  which will require us to grow our remaining business in order to achieve profitability 
economic and other factors may prevent us from growing our remaining business 
if we fail to grow our remaining business  it could have a material adverse impact on our business  financial condition and operating results 
we may in the future dispose of additional assets or businesses that represent a significant portion of our business 
the sale of our ware storage adapter business and any possible future dispositions may involve numerous risks  including problems carving out or disposing of assets  operations  technologies and products  the disposal of such assets or businesses could have an unanticipated adverse effect on the remaining business  unanticipated costs  diversion of management s attention from core ongoing operations  potential adverse effects on existing business relationships with suppliers and customers  and 
table of contents if we do not structure the disposition properly and scale expenses according to the size of the remaining business  we could continue to incur expenses that could be unsustainable given the scope of the remaining business 
we may not be able to protect our intellectual property adequately 
we rely in part on patents to protect our intellectual property 
we cannot assure you that our pending patent applications or any future applications will be approved  or that any issued patents will adequately protect the intellectual property in our products  will provide us with competitive advantages or will not be challenged by third parties  or that if challenged  any such patent will be found to be valid or enforceable 
others may independently develop similar products or processes  duplicate our products or processes or design around any patents that may be issued to us 
to protect our intellectual property  we also rely on the combination of mask work protection under the federal semiconductor chip protection act of  trademarks  copyrights  trade secret laws  employee and third party nondisclosure agreements  and licensing arrangements 
despite these efforts  we cannot assure you that others will not independently develop substantially equivalent intellectual property or otherwise gain access to our trade secrets or intellectual property  or disclose such intellectual property or trade secrets  or that we can meaningfully protect our intellectual property 
a failure by us to meaningfully protect our intellectual property could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and operating results 
we generally enter into confidentiality agreements with our employees  consultants and strategic partners 
we also try to control access to and distribution of our technologies  documentation and other proprietary information 
despite these efforts  parties may attempt to copy  disclose  obtain or use our products  services or technology without our authorization 
also  former employees may seek employment with our business partners  customers or competitors and we cannot assure you that the confidential nature of our proprietary information will be maintained in the course of such future employment 
additionally  former employees or third parties could attempt to penetrate our network to misappropriate our proprietary information or interrupt our business 
because the techniques used by computer hackers to access or sabotage networks change frequently and generally are not recognized until launched against a target  we may be unable to anticipate these techniques 
as a result  our technologies and processes may be misappropriated  particularly in foreign countries where laws may not protect our proprietary rights as fully as in the united states 
we could be harmed by litigation involving patents  proprietary rights or other claims 
litigation may be necessary to enforce our intellectual property rights  to determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others or to defend against claims of infringement or misappropriation 
the semiconductor industry is characterized by substantial litigation regarding patent and other intellectual property rights 
such litigation could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources  including the attention of our management and technical personnel  and could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we may be accused of infringing on the intellectual property rights of third parties 
we have certain indemnification obligations to customers with respect to the infringement of third party intellectual property rights by our products 
we cannot assure you that infringement claims by third parties or claims for indemnification by customers or end users resulting from infringement claims will not be asserted in the future  or that such assertions will not harm our business 
any litigation relating to the intellectual property rights of third parties would at a minimum be costly and could divert the efforts and attention of our management and technical personnel 
in the event of any adverse ruling in any such litigation  we could be required to pay substantial damages  cease the manufacturing  use and sale of infringing products  discontinue the use of certain processes or obtain a license under the intellectual property rights of the third party claiming infringement 
a license might not be available on reasonable terms or at all 
from time to time  we may be involved in litigation relating to other claims arising out of our operations in the normal course of business 
we cannot assure you that the ultimate outcome of any such matters will not have a material  adverse effect on our business  financial condition or operating results 

table of contents our stock price is volatile 
the market price of our common stock has fluctuated significantly

the rights of the holders of common stock will be subject to  and may be harmed by  the rights of the holders of any shares of preferred stock that may be issued in the future 
the issuance of preferred stock may delay  defer or prevent a change in control  as the terms of the preferred stock that might be issued could potentially prohibit our consummation of any merger  reorganization  sale of substantially all of our assets  liquidation or other extraordinary corporate transaction without the approval of the holders of the outstanding shares of preferred stock 
the issuance of preferred stock could have a dilutive effect on our stockholders 
if we issue additional shares of stock in the future  it may have a dilutive effect on our stockholders 
we have a significant number of authorized and unissued shares of our common stock available 
these shares will provide us with the flexibility to issue our common stock for proper corporate purposes  which may include making acquisitions through the use of stock  adopting additional equity incentive plans and raising equity capital

we generate revenues primarily through sales of our ic products  embedded processors and pcbas to original equipment manufacturers  such as alcatel lucent  ciena  cisco  brocade  fujitsu  hitachi  huawei  juniper  ericsson  nec  nortel  nokia siemens networks  and tellabs  who in turn supply their equipment principally to communications service providers 
in the storage market we generated revenues primarily through 
table of contents sales of our sata raid controllers to our distribution channel partners who in turn sell to enterprises  small and mid size businesses  value added resellers  systems integrators and retail consumers 
in calendar  we changed our strategic direction in such a way that certain patents while still valuable were no longer core to our strategic direction 
we reported our non focus revenues separately and began to analyze our patent portfolio in detail 
these patents related to non focus products  foundry and other items that were not relevant to our long term strategic product road maps 
as a result  we embarked on a program to monetize this intellectual property 
in july  we entered into a patent purchase agreement the agreement with qualcomm incorporated qualcomm 
pursuant to the agreement  we agreed to sell a series of our patents  patent applications and associated rights related to certain technologies for an aggregate purchase price of million 
the purchase price is being paid over three years in equal quarterly payments of million each beginning in the three months ended september  due to the nature of the payment terms  related revenue is being recorded as the payments are received beginning in the quarter ended september  under the agreement  we and our affiliates have retained a worldwide and non exclusive right to manufacture and sell existing amcc products that utilize technology covered by the patents 
the agreement includes customary representations  warranties and covenants by us 
prior to the due date of the final payment  qualcomm is permitted to withhold a portion of the total purchase price in the event we breach the representations  warranties or covenants that we made under the agreement 
we hope to achieve a sustainable long term revenue stream from our program to monetize our non core intellectual property in the next three to five years 
the demand for our products has been affected in the past  and may continue to be affected in the future  by various factors  including  but not limited to  the following the timing  rescheduling or cancellation of significant customer orders and our ability  as well as the ability of our customers  to manage inventory corrections  the qualification  availability and pricing of competing products and technologies and the resulting effects on sales and pricing of our products 
our ability to specify  develop or acquire  complete  introduce  and market new products and technologies in a cost effective and timely manner  the rate at which our present and future customers and end users adopt our products and technologies in our target markets  general economic and market conditions in the semiconductor industry and communications markets  including the current global economic recession  combinations of companies in our customer base  resulting in the combined company choosing our competitor s ic standardization other than our supported product platforms  the gain or loss of one or more key customers  or their key customers  or significant changes in the financial condition of one or more of our key customers or their key customers 
for these and other reasons  including the recently completed sale of our ware storage adapter business  our net revenue and results of operations for the fiscal year ended march  and prior periods may not necessarily be indicative of future net revenue and results of operations 
based on direct shipments  net revenues to customers that was equal to or greater than of total net revenues in any of the three years ended march  were as follows avnet distributor hon hai sub contract manufacturer less than of total net revenues for period indicated 
we expect that our largest customers will continue to account for a substantial portion of our net revenue for the foreseeable future 

table of contents net revenues by geographic region were as follows in thousands fiscal years ended march  united states of america other north america europe asia other all of our revenues have been denominated in us dollars 
sale of our ware storage adapter business 
we completed the sale of our ware storage adapter business  a significant portion of our business  to lsi corporation on april   after our fiscal year 
as a result  we now expect to generate all of our sales from our remaining business  which will require us to grow our remaining business in order to achieve profitability 
economic and other factors may prevent us from growing our remaining business 
if we fail to grow our remaining business  it could have a material adverse impact on our business  financial condition and operating results 
we may in the future dispose of additional assets or businesses that represent a significant portion of our business 
under the asset purchase agreement with lsi corporation the purchase agreement  which we entered on april   we sold substantially all of the operating assets other than patents of our ware storage adapter business 
the assets sold included customer contracts  inventory  fixed assets  certain intellectual property and other assets  as well as rights to the name ware 
the purchase price was approximately million  subject to adjustments for changes in the level of inventory and products in the channel at the closing of the sale 
we estimate the adjustments will increase the purchase price by approximately million to million 
the purchase agreement contained customary representations  warranties  covenants and indemnities  including  among others  entering into an intellectual property agreement  a transition services agreement and a master procurement agreement with lsi corporation 
goodwill impairment charge 
during the three months ended december   we assessed goodwill for impairment since we observed there were indicators of impairment 
the notable indicators were a significant downward revision to our revenue forecasts  a sustained decline in our market capitalization below book value  depressed market conditions and industry trends 
these market conditions continuously change and it is difficult to project how long this current economic downturn may last 
as a result of these market conditions  our planned product introductions were not expected to ramp as quickly as previously expected  causing our near term and longer term revenue forecasts to decrease  and it will take some time for our forecasts to return to their previous levels due to the current economic conditions 
additionally  the deterioration of market values has had an unfavorable impact on our valuations which are part of the goodwill impairment tests 
as required by statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets sfas  we verified our long lived assets  other than goodwill  were not impaired as of the time of the goodwill impairment 
upon completion of the impairment test  we determined that additional impairment analysis was required by sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas because the estimated carrying value of each of the three reporting units including our store unit exceeded its estimated fair value 
the second step of the goodwill impairment test compared the implied fair value of each reporting unit s goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill

net loss 
our net loss has been affected in the past  and may continue to be affected in the future  by various factors  including  but not limited to  the following stock based compensation expense  amortization of purchased intangibles  acquired in process research and development  litigation settlement costs  restructuring charges  combinations of companies within our customer base  purchased intangible asset impairment charges  other than temporary impairment of short term investments and marketable securities  and income tax expense benefit 
since the start of fiscal  we have invested a total of million in the research and development of new products  including higher speed  lower power and lower cost products  products that combine the functions of multiple existing products into single highly integrated products  and other products to complete our portfolio of communications products 
these products  and our customers products for which they are intended  are highly complex 
due to this complexity  it often takes several years to complete the development and qualification of these products before they enter into volume production 
accordingly  we have not yet generated significant revenues from some of the products developed during this time period 
in addition  downturns in the telecommunications market can severely impact our customers business and usually result in significantly less demand for our products than was expected when the development work commenced 
as a result of restructuring activities associated with these downturns  we have discontinued development of several products that were in process and slowed down development of others as we realized that demand for these products would not materialize as originally anticipated 
critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of net revenue and expenses in the reporting period 
we regularly evaluate our estimates and assumptions related to inventory valuation and warranty liabilities  which affect our cost of sales and gross margin  the valuation of purchased intangibles and goodwill  which has in the past  and could in the future affect our impairment charges to write down the carrying value of goodwill and other intangibles and the amount of related periodic amortization expense recorded for definite lived intangibles  the valuation of restructuring liabilities  which affects the amount and timing of restructuring charges  an evaluation of other than temporary impairment of our investments  which affects the amount and timing of write down charges  and the valuation of deferred income taxes  which affects our income tax expense benefit 
we also have other key accounting policies  such as our policies for stock based compensation and revenue recognition  including the deferral of a portion of revenues on sales to distributors 
the methods  estimates and judgments we use in applying these critical accounting policies have a significant impact on the results we report in our financial statements 
we base our estimates and assumptions on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
the actual results experienced by us may differ materially and adversely from management s estimates 
to the extent there are material differences between our estimates and the actual results  our future results of operations will be affected 
we believe the following critical accounting policies require us to make significant judgments and estimates in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 

table of contents inventory valuation and warranty liabilities our policy is to value inventories at the lower of cost or market on a part by part basis 
this policy requires us to make estimates regarding the market value of our inventories  including an assessment of excess or obsolete inventories 
we determine excess and obsolete inventories based on an estimate of the future demand for our products within a specified time horizon  generally months 
the estimates we use for future demand are also used for near term capacity planning and inventory purchasing and are consistent with our revenue forecasts 
if our demand forecast is greater than our actual demand we may be required to take additional excess inventory charges  which would decrease gross margin and net operating results 
for example  as of march   reducing our future demand estimate to six months could decrease our current inventory valuation by approximately million or increasing our future demand forecast to months could increase our current inventory valuation by approximately million 
our products typically carry a one year warranty 
we establish reserves for estimated product warranty costs at the time revenue is recognized 
although we engage in extensive product quality programs and processes  our warranty obligation is affected by product failure rates  use of materials and service delivery costs incurred in correcting any product failure 
should actual product failure rates  use of materials or service delivery costs differ from our estimates  additional warranty reserves could be required  which could reduce our gross margin 
additional changes to negotiated master purchase agreements could result in increased warranty reserves and unfavorably impact future gross margins 
goodwill and intangible asset valuation the purchase method of accounting for acquisitions requires extensive use of accounting estimates and judgments to allocate the purchase price to the fair value of the net tangible and intangible assets acquired  including in process research and development ipr d 
goodwill and intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives are not amortized  but are subject to annual impairment tests 
the amounts and useful lives assigned to other intangible assets impact future amortization  and the amount assigned to ipr d is expensed immediately 
determining the fair values and useful lives of intangible assets requires the use of estimates and the exercise of judgment 
while there are a number of different generally accepted valuation methods to estimate the value of intangible assets acquired  we primarily use the income discounted cash flows method 
this method requires significant management judgment to forecast the future operating results used in the analysis 
in addition  other significant estimates are required such as residual growth rates and discount factors 
the estimates we use to value and amortize intangible assets are consistent with the plans and estimates that we use to manage our business and are based on available historical information and industry estimates and averages 
these judgments can significantly affect our net operating results 
we are required to assess goodwill for potential impairment at least annually using the methodology prescribed by sfas sfas requires that goodwill be tested for impairment at the reporting unit level on at least an annual basis and between annual tests in certain circumstances 
application of the goodwill impairment test requires judgment  including the identification of reporting units  assigning assets and liabilities to reporting units  assigning goodwill to reporting units and determining the fair value of each reporting unit 
in fiscal  in accordance with sfas  we determined that there were three reporting units to be tested  process and transport  relating to continuing operations  and store  relating to discontinued operations 
the goodwill impairment test compares the fair value of the reporting unit with the carrying value of the reporting unit 
the implied fair value of goodwill is determined in the same manner as in a business combination 
determining the implied fair value of the goodwill is judgmental in nature and often involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions 
these estimates and assumptions could have a significant impact on whether or not an impairment charge is recognized and also the magnitude of any such charge 
estimates of fair value are primarily determined using discounted cash flows for each reporting unit and market comparisons from relevant industries for each reporting unit 
these approaches use significant estimates and assumptions  including projection and timing of future cash flows  discount rates reflecting the risk inherent in future cash flows  perpetual growth rates  determination of appropriate market comparables  and determination of whether a premium or discount should be applied to comparables 
it is possible that the plans and estimates used to value these assets may differ from actual outcomes 

table of contents during the three months ended december   we assessed goodwill for impairment since we observed there were indicators of impairment 
the notable indicators were a significant downward revision to our revenue forecasts  a sustained decline in our market capitalization below book value  depressed market conditions and industry trends 
these market conditions continuously change and it is difficult to project how long this current economic downturn may last 
as a result of these market conditions  our planned product introductions were not expected to ramp as quickly as previously expected  causing our near term and longer term revenue forecasts to decrease  and it will take some time for our forecasts to return to its previous levels due to the current economic conditions 
additionally  the deterioration of market values has had an unfavorable impact on our valuations which are part of the goodwill impairment tests 
as required by sfas  we verified our long lived assets  other than goodwill  were not impaired as of the time of the goodwill impairment 
the projected discounted cash flows for each reporting unit were based on discrete ten year financial forecasts developed by management for planning purposes 
cash flows beyond the discrete forecasts were estimated using terminal value calculations 
these forecasts represented the best estimate that our management had at the time and believed at that time to be reasonable 
however  actual results could differ from these forecasts  which may have resulted in a lower impairment of goodwill 
the compound annual sales growth rates ranged from to for the reporting units during the discrete forecast period and the future cash flows were discounted to present value using a discount rate of to and terminal growth rates of 
the discount rate was based on an analysis of the weighted average cost of capital of comparative companies 
upon completion of the impairment test for the three months ended december   we determined that additional impairment analysis was required by sfas because the estimated carrying value of each of the three reporting units exceeded its estimated fair value 
the second step of the goodwill impairment test compared the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill 
if the carrying amount of each reporting unit s goodwill exceeded the implied fair value of that goodwill  an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess 
the implied fair value of goodwill is determined in the same manner as the amount of goodwill recognized in a business combination 
that is  the fair value of each reporting unit is allocated to the individual fair values of all of the assets and liabilities of that unit including any unrecognized intangible assets as if the reporting unit had been acquired in a business combination and the fair value of the reporting unit was the purchase price paid to acquire the reporting unit 
any variance in the assumptions used to value the unrecognized intangible assets could have had a significant impact on the estimated fair value of the unrecognized intangible assets and consequently the amount of identified goodwill impairment 
as a result of the additional analyses performed  we recorded an impairment charge of million for the three months ended december   to continuing operations 
the goodwill impaired was assigned to the process and transport reporting units in the amounts of million  million  respectively 
in addition  an impairment charge of million for the store reporting unit was charged to discontinued operations 
for fiscal  the projected discounted cash flows for each reporting unit were based on discrete ten year financial forecasts developed by management for planning purposes 
cash flows beyond the discrete forecasts were estimated using terminal value calculations 
the compound annual sales growth rates ranged from to for the reporting units during the discrete forecast period and the future cash flows were discounted to their present value using a discount rate of to and terminal growth rates of 
upon completion of the annual impairment test for fiscal  we determined that there was an indicator of impairment because the estimated carrying value of one of the three reporting units exceeded its respective fair value 
as a result  we performed additional impairment analyses as required by sfas as a result of the additional analyses performed  we recorded an impairment charge of million for our store unit for the fiscal year ended march   which has since been reclassified to discontinued operations 
investments we hold a variety of securities that have varied underlying investments 
we review our investment portfolio periodically to assess for other than temporary impairment 
we assess the existence of impairment of our investments in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities  and related guidance issued by the financial accounting standards board fasb in order to determine the classification of the impairment as temporary or other than temporary 
a temporary impairment results in an 
table of contents unrealized loss being recorded in the other comprehensive income loss component of stockholders equity 
such an unrealized loss does not affect net income loss for the applicable accounting period 
an other than temporary impairment is recorded in the consolidated statements of operations and reduces net income increases net loss for the applicable accounting period 
the factors used to determine whether an impairment is temporary or other than temporary involve considerable judgment 
the current rapidly changing economic climate and volatile financial markets have created an environment in which it is difficult to make accurate estimates and assumptions on which we base our judgments 
the factors we consider in determining whether any individual impairment is temporary or other than temporary are primarily the length of the time and the extent to which the market value has been less than amortized cost  the nature of underlying assets including the degree of collateralization  the financial condition  credit rating  market liquidity conditions and near term prospects of the issuer 
in the future  should we determine we no longer have the ability or intent to hold securities in a loss position to their maturity or a recovery in value  we may be required to recognize additional losses in our earnings for unrealized loss positions that we currently consider to be temporary in nature 
if securities in a continuous loss position that are considered temporarily impaired remain in a continuous loss position in the future  then these securities could be considered other than temporarily impaired in future periods 
in the fiscal year ended march   we recorded other than temporary impairment charges of million to current earnings 
this charge was primarily driven by an overall deterioration of the financial markets during the fiscal year 
for the fiscal year ended march   we did not record an impairment charge in connection with other securities in a continuous loss position fair value less than carrying value for less than months with unrealized losses of million as we believe that such unrealized losses are temporary 
for the year ended march  we recorded other than temporary impairment charges of million to current earnings 
fair value of financial instruments in september  the fasb issued sfas no 
 fair value measurements sfas  which defines fair value  establishes guidelines for measuring fair value and expands disclosures regarding fair value measurements 
sfas does not require any new fair value measurements but rather eliminates inconsistencies in guidance found in various prior accounting pronouncements and is effective for fiscal years beginning after november  beginning april   short term investments and long term marketable securities are recorded at fair value in our condensed consolidated balance sheet and are categorized based upon the level of judgment associated with inputs used to measure their fair value 
in february  the fasb issued fasb staff position no 
fas  effective date of fasb statement no 
 which provides a one year deferral of the effective date of sfas for non financial assets and non financial liabilities  except those that are recognized or disclosed in the financial statements at fair value at least annually 
sfas defines a three level valuation hierarchy for disclosure of fair value measurements as follows level inputs are unadjusted  quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities at the measurement date 
level inputs other than quoted market prices included in level are either directly or indirectly observable for the asset or liability through correlation with market data at the measurement date and for the duration of the instrument s anticipated life 
level inputs reflect management s best estimate of what market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability at the measurement date 
consideration is given to the risk inherent in the valuation technique and the risk inherent in the inputs to the model 
valuation of instruments includes unobservable inputs to the valuation methodology that are significant to the measurement of the fair value of assets or liabilities 
we classify inputs to derive fair values for short term investments and long term marketable investments as level and instruments classified as level include highly liquid government and agency securities  money market funds and publicly traded equity securities in active markets 
instruments classified as level include corporate notes  asset backed securities and commercial paper 
we have no instruments for which the valuation inputs are classified as level 
table of contents in october  the fasb issued fasb staff position fsp  determining the fair value of a financial asset when the market for that asset is not active fsp 
fsp provides guidance for the valuation of financial assets in an inactive market  the use of internal assumptions when relevant observable data does not exist  the use of observable market information when the market is not active  and the use of market quotes when assessing the relevance of observable and unobservable data 
fsp is effective for all periods presented in accordance with sfas the adoption of fsp did not have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements or the fair values of our financial assets 
in april  the fasb issued fsp  determining fair value when the volume and level of activity for the asset or liability have significantly decreased and identifying transactions that are not orderly fsp 
fsp provides guidance in determining fair value when the volume and level of activity for the asset or liability have significantly decreased and on identifying transactions that are not orderly 
this fsp is effective for interim and annual reporting periods ending after june   and is to be applied prospectively 
early adoption is permitted for periods ending after march  the adoption of fsp is not expected to have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements or the determination of the fair value of our financial assets 
restructuring charges over the last several years we have undertaken significant restructuring initiatives  which have required us to develop formalized plans for exiting certain business activities and reducing spending levels 
we have had to record estimated expenses for employee severance  long term asset write downs  lease cancellations  facilities consolidation costs  and other restructuring costs 
given the significance  and the timing of the execution  of such activities  this process is complex and involves periodic reassessments of estimates made at the time the original decisions were made 
in calculating the charges for our excess facilities  we have to estimate the timing of exiting certain facilities 
our assumptions for exiting certain facilities may differ from actual outcomes  which could result in the need to record additional costs or reduce estimated amounts previously charged to restructuring expense 
for example  in fiscal  when we decided to reoccupy a previously exited facility  we eliminated the related liability which reduced our restructuring expense 
our policies require us to periodically evaluate the adequacy of the remaining liabilities under our restructuring initiatives 
in fiscal  we recorded a net charge of million for our restructuring activities  of which million has been reclassified to discontinued operations 
in fiscal  we recorded restructuring charges of approximately million associated with our restructuring actions to continuing operations 
in fiscal we recorded a net charge of million to continuing operations 
for a full description of our restructuring activities  refer to our discussion of restructuring charges in note to the condensed consolidated financial statements 
valuation of deferred income taxes we record valuation allowances to reduce our deferred tax assets to an amount that we believe is more likely than not to be realized 
we consider estimated future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies  including reversals of deferred tax liabilities  in assessing the need for a valuation allowance 
if we were to determine that we will not realize all or part of our deferred tax assets in the future  we would make an adjustment to the carrying value of the deferred tax asset  which would be reflected as income tax expense 
conversely  if we were to determine that we will realize a deferred tax asset  which currently has a valuation allowance  we would reverse the valuation allowance which would be reflected as an income tax benefit or as an adjustment to stockholders equity  for tax assets related to stock options  or goodwill  for tax assets related to acquired businesses 
in determining taxable income for financial statement reporting purposes  we must make certain estimates and judgments 
these estimates and judgments are applied in the calculation of certain tax liabilities and in the determination of the recoverability of deferred tax assets  which arise from temporary differences between the recognition of assets and liabilities for tax and financial statement reporting purposes 
in addition  the calculation of our tax liabilities involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax rules and the potential for future adjustment of our uncertain tax positions by the internal revenue service or other taxing jurisdiction 
if our estimates of these taxes are greater or less than actual results  an additional tax benefit or charge will result 

table of contents stock based compensation expense effective april  we adopted revised sfas no 
 share based payment sfas r  which requires all share based payments  including grants of stock options  restricted stock units and employee stock purchase rights  to be recognized in our financial statements based on their respective grant date fair values 
under this standard  the fair value of each employee stock option and employee stock purchase right is estimated on the date of grant using an option pricing model that meets certain requirements 
we currently use the black scholes option pricing model to estimate the fair value of our share based payments 
the black scholes model meets the requirements of sfas r but the fair values generated by the model may not be indicative of the actual fair values of our stock based awards as it does not consider certain factors important to stock based awards  such as continued employment  periodic vesting requirements and limited transferability 
the determination of the fair value of share based payment awards utilizing the black scholes model is affected by our stock price and a number of assumptions  including expected volatility  expected life  risk free interest rate and expected dividends 
we estimate the expected volatility of our stock options at grant date by equally weighting the historical volatility and the implied volatility of our stock over specific periods of time as the expected volatility assumption required in the black scholes model 
the expected life of the stock options is based on historical and other data including life of the option and vesting period 
the risk free interest rate assumption is the implied yield currently available on zero coupon government issues with a remaining term equal to the expected term 
the dividend yield assumption is based on our history and expectation of dividend payouts 
the fair value of our restricted stock units is based on the fair market value of our common stock on the date of grant 
forfeitures are required to be estimated at the time of grant and revised  if necessary  in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ significantly from those estimated 
we evaluate the assumptions used to value stock based awards on a quarterly basis 
if factors change and we employ different assumptions  stock based compensation expense may differ significantly from what we have recorded in the past 
if there are any modifications or cancellations of the underlying unvested securities  we may be required to accelerate  increase or cancel any remaining unearned stock based compensation expense 
we currently estimate when and if performance based options will be earned 
if the awards are not considered probable of achievement  no amount of stock based compensation is recognized 
if we consider the award to be probable  expense is recorded over the estimated service period 
to the extent that our assumptions are incorrect  the amount of stock based compensation recorded will be increased or decreased 
to the extent that we grant additional equity securities to employees or we assume unvested securities in connection with any acquisitions  our stock based compensation expense will be increased by the additional unearned compensation resulting from those additional grants or acquisitions 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue in accordance with sec staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition 
this pronouncement requires that four basic criteria be met before revenue can be recognized there is evidence that an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the fee is fixed or determinable  and collectability is reasonably assured 
we recognize revenue upon determination that all criteria for revenue recognition have been met 
in addition  we do not recognize revenue until all customers acceptance criteria have been met 
the criteria are usually met at the time of product shipment  except for shipments to distributors with rights of return 
the portion of revenue from shipments to distributors subject to rights of return is deferred until the agreed upon percentage of return or cancellation privileges lapse 
revenue from shipments to distributors without return rights is recognized upon shipment 
in addition  we record reductions to revenue for estimated allowances such as returns not pursuant to contractual rights  competitive pricing programs and rebates 
these estimates are based on our experience with product returns and the contractual terms of the competitive pricing and rebate programs 
shipping terms are generally fca free carrier shipping point 
if actual returns or pricing adjustments exceed our estimates  we would record additional reductions to revenue 
from time to time we generate revenue from the sale of our internally developed intellectual property ip 
we generally recognize revenue from the sale of ip when cash is received and all other basic criteria outlined above are met 
allowance for bad debts we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
our allowance for doubtful accounts is based on our assessment of the collectability of 
table of contents specific customer accounts  the aging of accounts receivable  our history of bad debts  and the general condition of the industry and economy 
if a major customer s credit worthiness deteriorates  or our customers actual defaults exceed our historical experience  our estimates could change and impact our reported results 
results of operations comparison of the fiscal year ended march  to the fiscal year ended march  net revenues 
net revenues for the fiscal year ended march  were million  representing an increase of from the net revenues of million for the fiscal year ended march  we classify our revenues into two categories based on the markets that the underlying products serve 
the categories are process and transport 
we use this information to analyze our performance and success in these markets 
see the following tables dollars in thousands fiscal years ended march  of net of net amount revenue amount revenue increase change process transport during the fiscal year ended march   revenues gradually recovered from the prior year s downward inventory corrections at our customers  delayed product transitions and overall softness in demand 
in addition during fiscal  we also recorded million in licensing revenues from the sale of certain non core patents and associated rights 
we expect revenues from continuing operations to increase by to in the three months ending june   compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal gross profit

the amortization of purchased intangible assets included in cost of revenues during the fiscal year ended march  was million compared to million for the fiscal year ended march  based on the amount of capitalized purchased intangibles on the balance sheet as of march   we expect amortization expense for purchased intangibles charged to cost of revenues to be million in fiscal  million in fiscal and million for fiscal future acquisitions of businesses may result in substantial additional charges  which would impact the gross profit percentage in future periods

research and development r d expenses consist primarily of salaries and related costs including stock based compensation of employees engaged in research  design and development activities  costs related to engineering design tools  subcontracting costs and facilities expenses 
the decrease in r d expenses of for the fiscal year ended march  compared to the fiscal year ended march   was primarily due to a decrease of million in third party foundry cost and million in technology access fees offset by an increase of million in personnel costs and million in development costs of a new processor core 
we believe that a continued commitment to r d is vital to our goal of maintaining a leadership position with innovative products 
in addition to our internal r d programs  our business strategy includes acquiring products  technologies or businesses from third parties 
future acquisitions of products  technologies or businesses may result in substantial additional on going r d costs

this expense relates to equity instruments already issued and will not be affected by our future stock price 
the weighted average period over which the unearned stock based compensation is expected to be recognized is approximately years 
if there are any modifications or cancellations of the underlying unvested securities  we may be required to accelerate  increase or cancel any remaining unearned stock based compensation expense 
future stock based compensation expense will increase to the extent that we grant additional equity awards 
we anticipate we will continue to grant additional employee stock options and restricted stock units in fiscal and thereafter 
the value of these grants cannot be predicted at this time because it will depend on the number of share based payments granted and the then current fair values 
the net stock based compensation relating to the discontinued operations of our ware storage adapter business was million and million for the fiscal years ended march  and  respectively 
goodwill impairment charges 
during the three months ended december   we assessed goodwill for impairment since we observed there were indicators of impairment 
based upon an analysis performed in the three months ended december   which included a discounted cash flow analysis  we recorded an impairment of goodwill of million to continuing operations in the consolidated statements of operations 
the reporting units impaired were process and transport in the amounts of million and million  respectively 
in addition  we recorded an impairment of goodwill of million to discontinued operations for the store reporting unit in the consolidated statements of operations 
the projected discounted cash flows for each reporting unit were based on discrete ten year financial forecasts developed by management for planning purposes 
cash flows beyond the discrete forecasts were estimated using terminal value calculations 
the compound annual sales growth rates ranged from to for the reporting units during the discrete forecast period and the future cash flows were discounted to present value using a discount rate of to and terminal growth rates of 
the discount rate is based on an analysis of the weighted average cost of capital of comparative companies 
upon completion of the impairment test for the three months ended december   we determined that additional impairment analysis was required under sfas because the estimated carrying value of the reporting units exceeded their estimated fair value 
the second step of the goodwill impairment test compared the implied fair value of each reporting unit s goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill 
if the carrying amount of the reporting unit s goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill  an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess 
the implied fair value of goodwill is determined in the same manner as the amount of goodwill recognized in a business combination 
that is  the fair value of the reporting unit is allocated to the individual fair values of all of the assets and liabilities of that unit including any unrecognized intangible assets as if the reporting unit had been acquired in a business combination and the fair value of the reporting unit was the purchase price paid to acquire the reporting unit 
any variance in the assumptions used to value the unrecognized intangible assets could have had a significant impact on the estimated fair value of the unrecognized intangible assets and consequently the amount of identified goodwill impairment 
these market conditions continuously change and it is difficult to project how long this current economic downturn may last 
this has caused a decline in 
table of contents our near term revenues and it will take some time to ramp back up to our previous levels 
additionally  market values have deteriorated which has had an unfavorable impact on our terminal values which are part of the goodwill impairment tests 
as a result of these market conditions  our planned product introductions were not expected to ramp as quickly as previously expected  causing our near term and longer term revenue forecasts to be lower 
these revenue forecasts represented the best estimate that our management had at the time and believed at that time to be reasonable 
however  actual results could differ from these revenue forecasts  which may have resulted in a lower impairment of goodwill 
based upon an analysis performed in fiscal  we recorded a charge for the impairment of goodwill of million  which has been reclassified to discontinued operations

the increase in the fiscal year ended march  compared to the fiscal year ended march   resulted from our efforts to realign and focus on our core competencies  eliminate redundancies and reduce operating expenses in response to the slowdown experienced during fiscal for additional information on our restructuring activities  see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
restructuring charges relating to the discontinued operations of our ware storage adapter business were million and zero for the fiscal years ended march  and  respectively 
option investigation  net 
during the first quarter of fiscal  we initiated a review of our historical stock option granting policies 
we incurred professional and legal fees as a result of our self initiated review 
although we concluded our investigation during the fourth quarter of fiscal  we continued to incur expenses for the related ongoing legal and regulatory proceedings as a result of the option investigation 
these expenses were offset by our insurance proceeds of million from our insurance provider during fiscal during fiscal  we incurred additional expenses  offset by insurance proceeds for the related ongoing legal and regulatory proceedings which were concluded during fiscal litigation settlement  net

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk market risk is the potential loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices  such as foreign currency exchange rates  interest rates and a decline in the stock market 
the current turbulence in the us and global financial markets has caused a decline in stock values across all industries 
we are exposed to market risks related to changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 
we maintain an investment portfolio of various holdings  types and maturities 
these securities are classified as available for sale and  consequently  are recorded on our consolidated balance sheets at fair value with unrealized gains or losses reported as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income or loss 
we have established guidelines relative to diversification and maturities that attempt to maintain safety and liquidity 
these guidelines are periodically reviewed and modified to take advantage of interest rate trends 
we invest our excess cash in debt instruments of the us treasury  corporate bonds  mortgage backed and asset backed securities and closed end bond funds  with credit ratings as specified in our investment policy 
we also have invested in preferred stocks  which pay quarterly fixed rate dividends 
we generally do not utilize derivatives to hedge against increases in interest rates which decrease market values  except for investments managed by one investment manager who utilizes us treasury bond futures options as a protection against the impact of increases in interest rates on the fair value of preferred stocks managed by that investment manager 
we are exposed to market risk as it relates to changes in the market value of our investments 
at march   our investment portfolio included fixed income securities classified as available for sale investments with an aggregate fair market value of million and a cost basis of million 
these securities are subject to interest rate risk  as well as credit risk and liquidity risk  and will decline in value if interest rates increase or an issuer s credit rating or financial condition is decreased 
based on an evaluation of securities that have been in a continuous loss position at march  and other qualitative factors  we have determined the decline in the fair value of certain securities to be other than temporary and we have accordingly written down such securities by approximately million during the fiscal year ended march  as of march   we have not recorded a write down adjustment in connection with our other securities in a loss position with unrealized losses of million  as we believe that such loss is not other than temporary 
we also have million in unrealized gains 

table of contents the following table presents the hypothetical changes in fair value of our short term investments held at march  in thousands fair value as of valuation of securities given an interest rate decrease of x basis points bps march  valuation of securities given an interest rate increase of x basis points bps bps bps bps bps bps bps available for sale investments the modeling technique used measures the change in fair market value arising from selected potential changes in interest rates 
market changes reflect immediate hypothetical parallel shifts in the yield curve of plus or minus basis points  basis points  and basis points 
while this modeling technique provides a measure of our exposure to market risk  the current economic turbulence could cause interest rates to shift by more than basis points 
we also invest in equity instruments of private companies for business and strategic purposes 
these investments are valued based on our historical cost  less any recognized impairments 
the estimated fair values are not necessarily representative of the amounts that we could realize in a current transaction 
we generally conduct business  including sales to foreign customers  in us dollars  and as a result  we have limited foreign currency exchange rate risk 
however  we have entered into forward currency exchange contracts to hedge our overseas monthly operating expenses when deemed appropriate 
gains and losses on foreign currency forward contracts that are designated and effective as hedges of anticipated transactions  for which a firm commitment has been attained  are deferred and included in the basis of the transaction in the same period that the underlying transaction is settled 
gains and losses on any instruments not meeting the above criteria are recognized in income or expenses in the consolidated statements of operations in the current period 
the effect of an immediate change in foreign exchange rates would not have a material impact on our financial condition or results of operations
