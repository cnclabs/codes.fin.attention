item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
executive summary our business 
we operate outpatient physical and or occupational therapy clinics that provide preventative and post operative care for a variety of orthopedic related disorders and sports related injuries  treatment for neurologically related injuries and rehabilitation of injured workers 
during  we formed a new venture  oa centers  which specializes in the outpatient  non surgical treatment of osteo arthritis  degenerative joint disease and other musculoskeletal conditions 
the first oa center opened in june in october  we acquired a interest in rmg which provides physicians and their patients with clinical services including electro diagnostic analysis edx as well as intra articular joint iajp direct and lumbar osteoarthritis lop direct programs 
edx produces real time physiologic data about nerve and muscle function 
iajp direct involves viscosupplementation injections used in conjunction with specialized outpatient rehabilitation programs 
lop direct is a unique procedure for the treatment of osteoarthritis of the spine 

table of contents effective november   we acquired a interest in an outpatient rehabilitation practice with four clinics in san antonio  tx  and effective june   we acquired a interest in a multi partner outpatient rehabilitation practice with nine clinics located in the mid atlantic region 
in both cases  the existing partners retained a interest 
effective january   we acquired a physical therapy practice located in michigan 
the results of operations of the acquired clinics have been included in our consolidated financial statements since the effective date of their acquisition 
at december   we operated clinics in states 
the average age of our clinics at december   was years 
of the clinics  we developed of the clinics and acquired in  we added clinics  including developed and acquired as detailed above  closed and sold one 
in addition to our owned clinics  we also manage physical therapy facilities for third parties  primarily physicians  with ten third party facilities under management as of december  critical accounting policies critical accounting policies are those that have a significant impact on our results of operations and financial position involving significant estimates requiring our judgment 
our critical accounting policies are revenue recognition 
revenues are recognized in the period in which services are rendered 
net patient revenues patient revenues less estimated contractual adjustments are reported at the estimated net realizable amounts from insurance companies  third party payors  patients and others for services rendered 
the company has agreements with third party payors that provide for payments to the company at contracted amounts different from its established rates 
the allowance for estimated contractual adjustments is based on terms of payor contracts and historical collection and write off experience 
contractual allowances 
contractual allowances result from the differences between the rates charged for services performed and expected reimbursements by both insurance companies and government sponsored healthcare programs for such services 
medicare regulations and the various third party payors and managed care contracts are often complex and may include multiple reimbursement mechanisms payable for the services provided in our clinics 
we estimate contractual allowances based on our interpretation of the applicable regulations  payor contracts and historical calculations 
each month the company estimates its contractual allowance for each clinic based on payor contracts and the historical collection experience of the clinic and applies an appropriate contractual allowance reserve percentage to the gross accounts receivable balances for each payor of the clinic 
based on our historical experience  calculating the contractual allowance reserve percentage at the payor level is sufficient to allow us to provide the necessary detail and accuracy with our collectibility estimates 
however  the services authorized and provided and related reimbursement are subject to interpretation that could result in payments that differ from our estimates 
payor terms are periodically revised necessitating continual review and assessment of the estimates made by management 
our billing system may not capture the exact change in our contractual allowance reserve estimate from period to period 
therefore  in order to assess the accuracy of our revenues and hence our contractual allowance reserves  our management regularly compares its cash collections to corresponding net revenues measured both in the aggregate and on a clinic by clinic basis 
in the aggregate  the historical difference between net revenues and corresponding cash collections has generally reflected a difference within approximately of net revenues 
additionally  analysis of subsequent period s contractual write offs on a payor basis reflects a difference within approximately between the actual aggregate contractual reserve percentage as compared to the estimated contractual allowance reserve percentage associated with the same period end balance 
as a result  we believe that a reasonable likely change in the contractual allowance reserve estimate would not likely be more than at december  for purposes of demonstrating the sensitivity of this estimate on the company s financial condition  a one percent increase or decrease in our aggregate contractual allowance reserve percentage would decrease or increase  respectively  net patient revenue by approximately  for the year ended december  management believes the changes in the estimate of the contractual allowance reserve for the periods ended december   and have not been material to the statement of operations 

table of contents the following table sets forth information regarding our accounts receivable as of the dates indicated in thousands december  gross accounts receivable less contractual allowances subtotal accounts receivable less allowance for doubtful accounts net patient accounts receivable the following table presents our accounts receivable aging by payor class as of the dates indicated in thousands december  december  current to current to payor days days total days days total managed care commercial plans medicare medicaid workers compensation self pay other totals workers compensation is paid by state administrators or their designated agents 
other includes primarily litigation claims and rmg receivables and  to a lesser extent  vehicular insurance claims 
reimbursement for medicare beneficiaries is based upon a fee schedule published by hhs 
for a more complete description of our third party revenue sources  see business sources of revenue in item allowance for doubtful accounts 
we determine allowances for doubtful accounts based on the specific agings and payor classifications at each clinic 
we review the accounts receivable aging and rely on prior experience with particular payors to determine an appropriate reserve for doubtful accounts 
historically  clinics that have a large number of aged accounts generally have less favorable collection experience  and thus  require a higher allowance 
accounts that are ultimately determined to be uncollectible are written off against our bad debt allowance 
the amount of our aggregate allowance for doubtful accounts is regularly reviewed for adequacy in light of current and historical experience 
accounting for income taxes 
we account for income taxes under the asset and liability method 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date 
the company recognizes the financial statement benefit of a tax position only after determining that the relevant tax authority would more likely than not sustain the position following an audit 
for tax positions meeting the more likely than not threshold  the amount to be recognized in the financial statements is the largest benefit that has a greater than percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement with the relevant tax authority 
the company does not believe that it has any significant uncertain tax positions at december   nor is this expected to change within the next twelve months due to the settlement and expiration of statutes of limitation 

table of contents the company did not have any accrued interest or penalties associated with any unrecognized tax benefits nor was any interest expense recognized during the twelve months ended december  and carrying value of long lived assets 
our property and equipment  intangible assets and goodwill collectively  our long lived assets comprise a significant portion of our total assets 
we account for our long lived assets pursuant to statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
and no 
this accounting standard requires that we periodically  and upon the occurrence of certain events  assess the recoverability of our long lived assets 
if the carrying value of our property and equipment exceeds their undiscounted cash flows  we are required to write the carrying value down to estimated fair value 
goodwill 
the fair value of goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives are tested for impairment at least annually and upon the occurrence of certain events  and are written down to fair value if considered impaired 
the company evaluates goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives for impairment on at least an annual basis in its third quarter by comparing the fair value of each reporting unit to the carrying value of the reporting unit including related goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives 
a reporting unit refers to the acquired interest of a single clinic or group of clinics 
local management typically continues to manage the acquired clinic or group of clinics 
for each clinic or group of clinics  the company maintains discrete financial information and both corporate and local management regularly review the operating results 
for each purchase of the equity interest  goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives are assigned to the respective clinic or group of clinics  if deemed appropriate 
if the carrying value of our goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives exceeds the estimated fair value  we are required to allocate the estimated fair value to our assets and liabilities  as if we had just acquired it in a business combination 
we then write down the carrying value of our goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite lives to the implied fair value 
any such write down is included as an impairment loss in our consolidated statement of net income 
judgment is required to estimate the fair value of our long lived assets 
we may use quoted market prices  prices for similar assets  present value techniques and other valuation techniques to prepare these estimates 
in addition  we may obtain independent appraisals in certain circumstances 
we may need to make estimates of future cash flows and discount rates as well as other assumptions in order to apply these valuation techniques 
irrespective of our valuation analysis  future market conditions may deteriorate 
accordingly  any value ultimately derived from our long lived assets may differ from our estimate of fair value 
in  the evaluation of goodwill yielded an impairment charge of  on a clinic purchased in the evaluation of goodwill in did not result in any goodwill amounts that were deemed permanently impaired 
during  the company wrote off  in goodwill related to closed clinics

at december   we had million in cash and cash equivalents compared to million at december   an increase of 
although the start up costs associated with opening new clinics and our planned capital expenditures are significant  we believe that our cash and cash equivalents and availability on our revolving credit facility are sufficient to fund the working capital needs of our operating subsidiaries  clinic closure costs accrued  future clinic development and investments through at least december significant acquisitions would likely require financing under existing revolving credit facility 
included in cash and cash equivalents at december  were million in a money market fund

effective august   we entered into the credit agreement with a commitment for a million revolving credit facility which was increased to million effective june  the credit agreement has a four year term maturing august   is unsecured and includes standard financial covenants 
proceeds from the credit agreement may be used to finance acquisitions  working capital  capital expenditures and for other corporate purposes 
interest expense on borrowings is based on a pricing grid tied to our overall financial leverage with the applicable spread over libor ranging from 
to 
there are fees under the credit agreement including a closing fee of

to 
depending on financial leverage and the amount of funds outstanding under the agreement 
on december  
table of contents  the outstanding balance on the revolving credit facility was million leaving million in availability and we are in compliance with all of the covenants thereunder 
historically  we have generated sufficient cash from operations to fund our development activities and to cover operational needs 
we generally develop new clinics rather than acquire them  which requires less capital 
we plan to continue developing new clinics and making additional acquisitions in selected markets 
we have from time to time purchased the minority interests of limited partners in our clinic partnerships 
we may purchase additional minority interests in the future 
generally  any acquisition or purchase of minority interests is expected to be accomplished using a combination of cash and financing 
any large acquisition would likely require financing 
we make reasonable and appropriate efforts to collect accounts receivable  including applicable deductible and co payment amounts  in a consistent manner for all payor types 
claims are submitted to payors daily  weekly or monthly in accordance with our policy or payor s requirements 
when possible  we submit our claims electronically 
the collection process is time consuming and typically involves the submission of claims to multiple payors whose payment of claims may be dependent upon the payment of another payor 
claims under litigation and vehicular incidents can take a year or longer to collect 
medicare and other payor claims relating to new clinics awaiting medicare rehab agency status approval initially may not be submitted for six months or more 
when all reasonable internal collection efforts have been exhausted  accounts are written off prior to sending them to outside collection firms 
with managed care  commercial health plans and self pay payor type receivables  the write off generally occurs after the account receivable has been outstanding for days

shares purchased are held as treasury shares and may be used for such valid corporate purposes or retired as the board considers advisable 
we did not purchase any shares of our common stock during or off balance sheet arrangements with the exception of operating leases for its executive offices and clinic facilities discussed in note to our consolidated financial statements included in item  we have no off balance sheet debt or other off balance sheet financing arrangements

r 
sfas no 
r replaces sfas no 
 business combinations  and applies to all transactions and other events in which one entity obtains control over one or more other businesses 
sfas no 
r requires an acquirer  upon initially obtaining control of another entity  to recognize the assets  liabilities and any non controlling interest in the acquiree at fair value as of the acquisition date 
contingent consideration is required to be recognized and measured at fair value on the date of acquisition rather than at a later date when the amount of that consideration may be determinable beyond a reasonable doubt 
this fair value approach replaces the cost allocation process required under sfas no 
whereby the cost of an acquisition was allocated to the individual assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair value 
sfas no 
r requires acquirers to expense acquisition related costs as incurred rather than allocating such costs to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed  as was previously the case under sfas no 
under sfas no 
r  the requirements of sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities  would have to be met in order to accrue for a restructuring plan in purchase accounting 
pre acquisition contingencies are to be recognized at fair value  unless it is a non contractual contingency that is not likely to materialize  in which case  nothing should be recognized in purchase accounting and  instead  that contingency would be subject to the probable and estimable recognition criteria of sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies 
sfas no 
r may have a significant impact on our accounting for business combinations closing on or after january  in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
 noncontrolling interests in consolidated financial statements an amendment of arb no 
sfas 
sfas establishes new accounting and reporting standards for the noncontrolling interest formerly referred to as minority interests in a subsidiary and for the deconsolidation of a subsidiary 
specifically  this statement requires the recognition of a noncontrolling interest as equity in the consolidated financial statements and separate from the parent s equity 
the amount of net income attributable to a noncontrolling interest will be included in consolidated net income on the face of the income statement 
sfas clarifies that changes in a parent s ownership interest in a subsidiary that do not result in deconsolidation are equity transactions if the parent retains its controlling financial interest 
in addition  sfas requires that a parent recognize a gain or loss in net income when a subsidiary is deconsolidated 
such gain or loss will be measured using the fair value of the noncontrolling equity investment on the deconsolidation date 
sfas also includes expanded disclosure requirements regarding the interests of the parent and its noncontrolling interest 
sfas is effective for fiscal years and interim periods within those fiscal years  beginning on or after december   with early adoption prohibited 
under previous guidance  the parent absorbed losses that would otherwise reduce the carrying amount of minority interests below zero and could subsequently recover those losses from future earnings 
upon adoption of sfas  amounts previously allocated to controlling and noncontrolling interests are not adjusted restrospectively 
after adoption  the noncontrolling interests will be charged for losses incurred even though the carrying amount of the noncontrolling interests is below zero 
in effect  after adoption  income attributable to the noncontrolling interests will include these losses rather than allocated to the net income attributable to the company 
the company will provide pro forma consolidated net income attributable to the company and pro forma earnings per share as if the previous guidance on minority interest losses had continued to apply 
the company will present noncontrolling interests currently shown as minority interest as a component of equity on the consolidated balance sheet and minority interest expense will no longer be separately reported as a reduction to net income on the consolidated income statements 
factors affecting future results clinic development as of december   we had clinics in operation  of which were opened and acquired in for those newly opened clinics  we incurred an operating loss in generally we experience losses during the initial period of a new clinic s operation 
operating margins for newly opened clinics tend to be lower than more seasoned clinics because of start up costs and lower patient visits and revenues 
generally  patient visits and revenues gradually increase in the first year of operation  as patients and referral sources 
table of contents become aware of the new clinic 
revenues typically continue to increase during the two to three years following the first anniversary of a clinic opening 
current economic conditions the current financial crisis and deteriorating economic conditions may have material adverse impacts on our business and financial condition that we currently cannot predict 
as widely reported  economic conditions in the united states and globally have been deteriorating 
financial markets in the united states  europe and asia have been experiencing a period of unprecedented turmoil and upheaval characterized by extreme volatility and declines in security prices  severely diminished liquidity and credit availability  inability to access capital markets  the bankruptcy  failure  collapse or sale of various financial institutions and an unprecedented level of intervention from the united states federal government and other governments 
unemployment has risen while business and consumer confidence have declined and there are fears of a prolonged recession 
although we cannot predict the impacts on us of the deteriorating economic conditions  they could materially adversely affect our business and financial condition 
for example patients visits may decline due to higher levels of unemployment or reduced discretionary spending  the tightening of credit or lack of credit availability to our customers could adversely affect our ability to collect our trade receivables  or our ability to access the capital markets may be restricted at a time when we would like  or need  to raise capital for our business including for acquisitions 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we do not maintain any derivative instruments  interest rate swap arrangements  hedging contracts  futures contracts or the like 
our only indebtedness as of december  was seller notes of million and outstanding balance on our credit agreement of million 
the outstanding balance under the credit agreement is subject to fluctuating interest rates 
a change in the interest rate would yield an additional  of interest expense
