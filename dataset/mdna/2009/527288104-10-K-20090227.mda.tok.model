manufacturing idaho timber business description idaho timber  which was acquired in may  is headquartered in boise  idaho and is engaged in the manufacture and or distribution of various wood products 
idaho timber s principal product lines include remanufacturing dimension lumber  remanufacturing  bundling and bar coding of home center boards for large retailers  and production of radius edge  pine decking 
idaho timber also manufactures and or distributes a number of other specialty wood products 
idaho timber has over years of operating experience in its industry 
the company s investment in idaho timber was  at december  remanufactured dimension lumber is idaho timber s largest product line 
dimension lumber is used for general construction and home improvement  remodeling and repair projects  the demand for which is normally a function of housing starts and home size 
all dimension lumber is assigned a quality grade  based on the imperfections in the wood  and higher grade lumber is sold at a higher price than lower grade lumber 
idaho timber purchases low grade dimension lumber from sawmills located in north america and europe and upgrades it into higher grade dimension lumber products 
the remanufacturing process includes ripping  trimming and planing lumber to reduce imperfections and produce a variety of lumber sizes 
these products are produced at plants located in florida  north carolina  texas  kansas  idaho and new mexico 
each plant distributes its product primarily by truck to lumber yards and contractors within a mile shipping radius from the plant site 
idaho timber s next largest product line is home center board products  which are principally sold to large home improvement retailers 
idaho timber purchases high grade boards from sawmills in the western united states  south america and new zealand primarily pine but other wood species are also used  performs minor re work on those boards to upgrade the quality  and then packages and bar codes those boards according to customer specifications 
production takes place in owned plants in idaho and montana 
idaho timber also operates a sawmill in arkansas to produce its radius edge  pine decking products 
idaho timber performs traditional sawmill processes cutting  drying and planing to manufacture these products 
idaho timber s profitability is dependent upon its ability to manage manufacturing costs and process efficiency  minimize capital expenditures through the purchase and cost effective maintenance of used  lower cost equipment  and effective management of the spread between what it pays for dimension lumber and boards and the selling prices of the remanufactured products 
selling prices for remanufactured products may rise quicker than supplier prices in strong markets creating greater spreads  however  during periods of declining product demand and reduced selling prices  supply price declines may lag behind  resulting in lower spreads 
idaho timber owns nine plants  one sawmill that principally produces decking products and one sawmill that produces split rail fencing 
these eleven facilities in the aggregate have approximately  square feet of manufacturing and office space  covering approximately acres 
two plants are principally dedicated to home center board products and the remaining plants principally produce remanufactured dimension lumber products 
all plant locations can produce and distribute specialty wood products 
idaho timber has the capacity to ship approximately million board feet per month  during actual shipments averaged approximately million board feet per month 
sales and marketing idaho timber primarily markets to local  regional and national lumber retailers for its dimension lumber products  home improvement centers for its home center board products and decking treaters for its sawmill product  and other resellers of home construction materials 
its success in attracting and retaining customers depends in large part on its ability to provide quicker delivery of specified customer products than its competitors 
for dimension lumber products  sales are primarily generated at each of the plants  with a dedicated sales force located in the same geographic region as the customers the plant serves 
board and decking products are sold and managed centrally 
sales of home center board product were heavily dependent on national home center chains which accounted for approximately of product revenues and of idaho timber s total revenue for the year ended december  one of our national home center customers discontinued purchasing pine boards through its vendor managed inventory program effective july  revenues from this customer pursuant to the program were  for the six months ended june  the customer base for the dimension lumber business is much less concentrated  no customer accounts for more than of revenue 
idaho timber s sales are somewhat concentrated in regions where its facilities are located  with the largest being florida   north carolina   and texas  
competition idaho timber sells commodity products  and operates in an industry that is currently oversupplied and very competitive 
idaho timber competes against domestic and foreign sawmills and intermediate distributors for its dimension lumber and decking products 
in some cases  idaho timber competes on a limited basis with the same sawmills that are a source of supply of low grade dimension lumber 
foreign suppliers have been active in the us market  particularly european competitors  which has added to the current oversupply condition in the industry and may continue to do so 
the home center board business has many competitors  and suppliers to large home centers are always under pressure to reduce prices 
idaho timber also competes for raw material purchases needed for its remanufactured dimension lumber and home center board products  and in the past the availability and pricing of certain raw materials has been adversely affected by export charges tariffs imposed on canadian exports  the largest source of these supplies 
a decades old trade dispute between the us and canada resurfaced with the expiration of the softwood lumber agreement in in october  the trade dispute was resolved and a new softwood lumber agreement between canada and the us became effective 
the agreement has a seven year term and may be extended for an additional two years 
currently  restrictions on canadian exports are not significantly adversely affecting idaho timber s operations  however  if tariffs continue beyond the current term of the softwood lumber agreement or further import limitations are imposed in the future  it is possible that raw material costs could increase or supplies could be constrained 
during  the export charge was at the maximum level for the entire year 
idaho timber is examining alternative sources of supply to increase its raw material purchasing flexibility 
government regulation lumber and decking are identified at idaho timber facilities with a grade stamp that shows the grade  moisture content  mill number  species and grading agency 
all lumber is graded in compliance with the national grading rule for dimension lumber  which is published by the us department of commerce 
idaho timber facilities are subject to regular inspection by agencies approved by the american lumber standards committee 
idaho timber believes that its procedure for grading lumber is highly accurate  however  idaho timber could be exposed to product liability claims if it can be demonstrated its products are inappropriately rated 
since idaho timber s sawmills do not treat its wood with chemicals  and since timber deeds purchased from private land owners do not impose a re planting obligation  idaho timber does not have any unusual environmental compliance issues

the cost of the principal raw material used in its products  polypropylene  has increased by approximately from conwed plastics has been able to raise prices to its customers during this period to offset some of the increase in raw material costs 
the increasing volatility of oil and natural gas prices along with current general economic conditions worldwide make it difficult to predict future raw material costs 
historically  declining oil and natural gas prices combined with reduced demand have usually resulted in reduced raw material costs 
telecommunications business description sti prepaid purchased of the assets of telco in march  the remaining telco assets were contributed to sti prepaid by the former owner in exchange for a interest in sti prepaid 
at december   sti prepaid s consolidated liabilities exceeded its consolidated assets  as a result  the company has a negative net investment in sti prepaid of  sti prepaid  headquartered in new york  new york  is a facilities based provider of long distance wireline and wireless telecommunications services

sti prepaid operates its prepaid mobile business as a mobile virtual network operator mvno 
mvnos are entities that do not own their own wireless network  rather they enter into agreements to resell minutes from an established facilities based wireless carrier such as sprint or verizon wireless 
however  unlike wireless resellers that simply earn commissions for selling the products of large facilities based wireless companies  mvno operators have their own brand name and directly maintain customer relationships including activities related to rate plans  billing  and general customer service 
sti prepaid s brand name for this product is sti mobile 
sti prepaid acquired three small prepaid card companies during  and continues to look for additional acquisition opportunities 
the acquisitions have provided greater distribution capacity in certain geographic locations  sales synergies and additional distribution channels  equipment  technology and or licenses

competition prepaid calling cards are marketed by a wide range of telecommunication providers from large national inter exchange carriers to small local and regional resellers 
sti prepaid s calling card products compete in markets where consumers decisions are primarily based on price and service quality 
the emergence and growth of wholesale carriers using voice over internet protocol  privatization and deregulation has contributed to a decline in international call pricing which is likely to continue

on september   premier and its subsidiary filed voluntary petitions for reorganization under chapter of title of the united states bankruptcy code before the united states bankruptcy court for the southern district of mississippi  southern division 
premier filed its petitions in order to seek the court s assistance in gaining access to hurricane katrina related insurance proceeds an aggregate of  which had been denied to premier by its pre petition secured bondholders 
premier filed an amended disclosure statement and plan of reorganization on february  which provided for the payment in full of all of premier s creditors  including payment of principal and accrued interest due to the holders of premier s senior secured notes at par the premier notes 
on july   the court entered an order confirming the plan  subject to a modification which premier filed on august   premier emerged from bankruptcy and once again became a consolidated subsidiary of the company on august  the plan was funded in part with the  senior secured credit facility provided by a subsidiary of the company 
the credit facility matures on february   bears interest at  is prepayable at any time without penalty  and contains other covenants  terms and conditions similar to those contained in the indenture governing the premier notes 
the former holders of the premier notes argued that they were entitled to liquidated damages under the indenture governing the premier notes  and as such are entitled to more than the principal amount of the notes plus accrued interest that was paid to them at emergence 
although the company does not agree with the position taken by the premier noteholders  in order to have the plan confirmed so that premier could complete reconstruction of its property and open its business without further delay  the company agreed to fund an escrow account to cover the premier noteholders claim for additional damages in the amount of  and a second escrow account for the trustee s reasonable legal fees and expenses in the amount of  entitlement to the escrowed funds has yet to be determined by the bankruptcy court  as an appeal to the plan confirmation was filed by certain of the premier noteholders

accordingly  the company has not accrued a loss for the additional damages contingency 
business description the hard rock hotel casino is located on an acre site on the mississippi gulf coast and has approximately  slot machines  table games  six live poker tables  five restaurants including a hard rock cafe and ruth s chris steakhouse  a full service spa  a  square foot pool area   square feet of retail space  an eleven story hotel with rooms and suites and a hard rock live entertainment venue with a capacity of  persons

other competition comes from gaming operations in lake charles  bossier city and shreveport  louisiana  tunica and philadelphia  mississippi  tampa and hollywood  florida and other states 
the hard rock biloxi was the last gaming operation to open in biloxi following hurricane katrina 
the hard rock biloxi has made progress establishing its customer database and instituting customer loyalty programs resulting in growth in market share of the local gaming market 
current unfavorable economic conditions are likely to have a negative impact on the local gaming market in  which could cause competition among gaming operations in biloxi to escalate 
since its competitors in the mississippi gulf coast gaming market have been in operation longer than premier they have more established gaming operations and customer databases 
many are larger and have greater financial resources than premier 
government regulation the gaming industry in mississippi is highly regulated 
premier  its ownership and management are subject to findings of suitability reviews by the mississippi gaming commission

medical product development business at december   the company owned approximately of sangart  a biopharmaceutical company principally engaged in developing an oxygen transport agent for various medical uses 
from through december   the company invested an aggregate of  in sangart  principally to help fund sangart s ongoing product development activities as a development stage company  sangart does not have any revenues from product sales 
since inception  the company has recorded sangart losses of  resulting from product development expenses and sangart s overhead costs 
in the first quarter of  the company invested an additional  in sangart upon the exercise of its remaining warrants  which increased its ownership interest to approximately 
sangart became a consolidated subsidiary of the company in  the book value of the company s investment in sangart was  at december  in  sangart commenced human clinical trials of its current product candidate  hemospan r  a solution of cell free hemoglobin administered intravenously to treat a variety of medical conditions  including use as an alternative to red blood cell transfusions 
a principal function of human blood is to transport oxygen throughout the body  the absence of which can cause organ dysfunction or death 
the basis for sangart s technology is the result of more than years of research in the understanding of how hemoglobin the oxygen carrier in red blood cells functions outside of red blood cells in a cell free environment 
hemospan offers universal compatibility with all blood types and  as compared to red blood cell transfusions  reduced risk of infectious disease transmission and a longer storage life 
hemospan is made from purified human hemoglobin that is extracted from outdated human blood obtained from accredited blood centers  which is then bound to polyethylene glycol molecules using sangart s proprietary processes 
sangart s manufacturing process is able to generate approximately four units of hemospan using a single unit of blood  which serves to expand the supply of donated blood 
sangart owns or exclusively licenses thirteen us patents and has more than thirty applications pending worldwide covering product composition  manufacturing or methods of use 
patents applicable to hemospan do not begin to expire prior to sangart has previously completed five phase i and phase ii human clinical studies designed to assess product safety and gather preliminary indications of the product s effectiveness 
in and sangart conducted two phase iii clinical trials that were designed to demonstrate hemospan s safety and effectiveness in preventing and treating low blood pressure during orthopedic hip replacement surgeries and in reducing the incidence of operative and postoperative complications 
the phase iii studies were conducted in six countries in europe and enrolled a total of patients  including patients in control groups treated with a different product 
data from the phase iii clinical trials have been analyzed internally 
no major clinically important safety concerns were identified  though in the phase iii prevention study there was a slightly higher incidence of adverse events in the hemospan treated patients than in the control group 
however  because these phase iii trials were conducted in a patient population having a relatively low incidence of medical complications  these studies were unable to demonstrate a clinical benefit of better outcomes than the control group 
sangart has decided not to pursue marketing approval to use hemospan for these purposes at this time  but plans to conduct additional clinical trials of hemospan in a different therapeutic area that may better demonstrate its clinical benefit and strengthen the likelihood of regulatory approval 
sangart is currently in the process of identifying relevant patient populations and planning additional clinical trials  which will take several years to complete at substantial cost 
until these additional phase ii and phase iii studies are successfully completed  sangart will not be able to request marketing approval and generate revenues from hemospan sales 
substantially all of the funding needed for hemospan development has come from sales of sangart s equity securities 
the additional investment the company made in  along with sangart s existing cash resources is expected to provide sangart with sufficient capital to fund activities into thereafter  significant additional funding will be needed for product development and clinical trial activities prior to regulatory approval and commercial launch  the source of such funding has not as yet been determined 
competitive environment hemospan is intended to be used as a therapeutic oxygen transport agent in clinical and trauma situations where tissues are at risk of inadequate blood flow and oxygenation 
hemospan may provide an alternative to red cell transfusion or act as a temporary oxygenation bridge until red cells become available 
currently there are no similar products approved for sale in the us or the european union  however  other companies are developing products that could potentially compete with hemospan 
any successful commercialization of hemospan will depend on an adequate supply of raw materials  principally human red blood cells and polyethylene glycol  at an acceptable quality  quantity and price 
sangart has contracted for commercial launch quantities of human red blood cells  though commitments for commercial scale quantities of polyethylene glycol have not yet been secured 
sangart leases a  square foot combination office and manufacturing facility that currently produces hemospan for its clinical trials 
sangart believes that its current manufacturing facility would have adequate capacity to support a commercial launch  but significant capital improvements and engineering designs would be required or an alternative manufacturing site would need to be acquired for commercial production 
in addition to obtaining requisite regulatory approvals and increasing manufacturing capacity for the manufacture and sale of hemospan  sangart would have to create sales  marketing and distribution capabilities prior to any commercial launch of this product  either directly or in partnership with a service provider 
government regulation as a product intended for medical use  clinical trials  marketing approval  manufacturing and distribution of hemospan is highly regulated 
an application for marketing approval may only be made after the safety and effectiveness of the product has been demonstrated  including through human clinical trial data 
in the us  the us food and drug administration regulates medical products  including the category known as biologics  which includes hemospan 
the federal food  drug and cosmetic act and the public health service act govern the testing  manufacture  safety  effectiveness  labeling  storage  record keeping  approval  advertising and promotion of hemospan 
in europe  each country has its own agency that regulates clinical trials 
however  the committee for medicinal products for human use chmp  which is administered by the european agency for the evaluation of medicinal products  is an eu wide regulatory body 
following completion of clinical trials  marketing approval can be granted either by a centralized application through chmp  or on a decentralized basis by one or more selected countries 
other operations wineries the company owns three wineries  pine ridge winery in napa valley  california  archery summit in the willamette valley of oregon and chamisal vineyards aka domaine alfred in the edna valley of california 
pine ridge was acquired in and has been conducting operations since  the company started archery summit in and chamisal vineyards was acquired during and has been conducting operations since the company s investment in winery operations has grown  principally to fund the acquisition of land for vineyard development  construct and develop archery summit  acquire chamisal vineyards and increase production capacity and storage facilities at the wineries 
it can take up to five years for a new vineyard property to reach full production and  depending upon the varietal produced  up to three years after grape harvest before the wine can be sold 
the company controls approximately acres of vineyards in napa valley  california  acres of vineyards in the willamette valley of oregon and acres of vineyards in the edna valley of california  substantially all of which are owned and producing grapes 
the company believes that its vineyards are located in some of the most highly regarded appellations and areas of the napa  willamette and edna valleys 
at december   the company s combined net investment in these wineries was  the wineries sold approximately  liter equivalent cases of wine generating revenues of  during and  liter equivalent cases of wine generating revenues of  during additionally  in and  the company acquired an aggregate of acres of land in the horse heaven hills of washington s columbia valley  of which approximately acres are under vineyard development 
at december   the company s total investment in the washington vineyard property was  these wineries primarily produce and sell wines in the very competitive ultra premium and luxury segments of the premium table wine market 
the company s wines are primarily sold to distributors  who then sell to retailers and restaurants 
as permitted under federal and local regulations  the wineries have also been placing increasing emphasis on sales direct to consumers  which they are able to do through the internet  wine clubs and at the wineries tasting rooms 
during  direct sales to consumers represented of case sales and of wine revenues 
wholesale sales of the company s wines in california excluding direct sales to consumers amounted to approximately of wholesale wine revenues 
the company s wines compete with small and large producers in the us  as well as with imported wines  and the ultimate consumer has many choices 
demand for wine in the ultra premium and luxury market segments can rise and fall with general economic conditions  and is also significantly affected by grape supply 
while the company s current vineyard holdings in the napa  willamette and edna valleys will continue to be the most significant source for its wine products in the immediate future  the company also supplements certain brands with purchased fruit to meet demand for its products and to provide the raw materials for the launch of new products 
the demand for the company s wines is also affected by the ratings given the company s wines in industry and consumer publications 
the wineries production  sales and distribution activities are subject to regulation by agencies of both federal and state governments 
state regulations that prohibited or restricted sales of wine direct to consumers by producers that are located in another state continue to be amended or overturned to permit increased direct sales to consumers in other states

the company has also invested in certain energy projects that do not employ gasification technologies  one of which is described below 
the company has expensed costs to investigate  evaluate and obtain various permits and approvals for its various energy projects of   and  during the years ended december   and  respectively 
although there are a number of large scale projects the company is currently investigating  the company is not obligated to develop any of the projects  and no assurance can be given that the company will be successful in fully developing any of these projects 
any project that the company might develop would likely require a significant equity investment  which the company presently does not intend to fund by itself  the acquisition of substantial non recourse borrowings to build the projects total development costs for these types of projects range from billion to billion  the procurement of purchase commitments for long term supplies of feedstock  long term commitments from purchasers of the output  and significant technological and engineering expertise to implement 
the investigation  evaluation and financing of these large scale projects take years to complete 
the company is currently evaluating a gasification project  which would be built in louisiana 
in april  the lake charles harbor terminal district of lake charles  louisiana sold  in tax exempt bonds that will support the development of a  petroleum coke gasification plant project by the company s wholly owned subsidiary  lake charles cogeneration llc lcc 
the lake charles cogeneration project is a new chemical manufacturing project planning to use quench gasification technology to produce energy products from low grade solid fuel sources such as petroleum coke 
the primary product to be produced by the lake charles cogeneration project will be substitute natural gas 
lcc does not currently have access to the bond proceeds  which are being held in an escrow account by the bond trustee  and it will not have access to the bond proceeds until certain conditions are satisfied 
upon the completion of pending permitting  regulatory approval  design engineering and the satisfaction of certain other conditions of the financing agreements  the bonds will be remarketed for a longer term and the proceeds will be released to lcc to use for the payment of development and construction costs for the project 
if all conditions have been met and lcc begins to draw down on the bond proceeds  any amounts drawn will be recorded as long term indebtedness of lcc and reflected on the company s consolidated balance sheet 
the company is not obligated to make equity contributions to lcc until it completes its investigation and the project is approved by the company s board of directors

goober drilling during  the company acquired a limited liability company interest in goober drilling for aggregate consideration of  excluding expenses  and agreed to lend to goober drilling  on a secured basis  up to  to finance new rig equipment purchases and construction costs and to repay existing debt 
during  the company increased its equity interest to for additional payments aggregating  in addition  the credit facility was amended to increase the borrowing capacity to  and the interest rate to libor plus  the company provided goober drilling with an additional secured credit facility of  at an interest rate of libor plus  and the company provided another secured credit facility of  at an interest rate at the greater of or libor plus

goober drilling currently operates drilling rigs in oklahoma  texas and arkansas 
goober drilling  which has been in business since  typically generates revenues through drilling contracts based on daily rates  footage charged by depth of the well or based on a turnkey contract fixed price to drill a well 
in  the majority of drilling services were performed on a day work or daily rate basis 
goober drilling supplies the drilling rig and all ancillary equipment and drilling personnel 
the contract drilling business is highly competitive 
customers award contracts to contract drillers based on factors such as price  rig availability  quality of service  proximity to the well site  experience with the specific geological formation  condition and type of equipment  reputation  safety of operations and customer relationships 
contracts for drilling services may be awarded based solely on price 
goober drilling s business volume and profitability is significantly affected by the actual and anticipated price of natural gas and levels of natural gas in storage 
the natural gas exploration and production industry is cyclical and the level of exploration and production activity has historically been very volatile 
during periods of lower levels of drilling activity  price competition for drilling services tends to increase which may result in reduced revenues and profitability  conversely  during periods of increased drilling activity drilling rigs are in demand often resulting in higher prices and contractual commitments from customers to obtain exclusive use of a particular rig for a longer term 
seasonality does not significantly impact goober drilling s business or operations 
additionally  the drilling activity of oil and natural gas exploration and production companies is strongly affected by their ability to access the capital markets 
during the second half of  at a time when oil and natural gas prices were declining significantly  there was also a substantial reduction of liquidity in the capital markets due to the deteriorating national and global economic environment 
many of goober drilling s customers have reduced their spending plans for exploration  production and development activities resulting in decreased demand for goober drilling rigs 
decreases in drilling activity and spending for any sustained period of time will cause a reduction in goober drilling s daily rates  utilization rates and profitability 
as of december   goober drilling had drilling rigs  of which are under contract for a to year term  are operating under term contracts that will expire within the next months  are under well to well contracts with specific customers  are floaters or rigs that are made available on the spot market and are not currently in use 
in addition  goober drilling is building one rig subject to a three year term contract that is anticipated to be placed in service in the second quarter of components for the new rig were purchased prior to the recent downturn in drilling activity

we operate in a variety of industries and market sectors  all of which are very competitive and susceptible to economic downturns and are adversely affected by the current recession 
a worsening of general economic or market conditions may result in lower valuations for our businesses or investments 
declines in the us housing market have reduced revenues and profitability of the manufacturing businesses and may continue to do so 
the prices and availability of key raw materials affects the profitability of our manufacturing operations  and also impacts sangart s ability to conduct its clinical trials 
pricing on sti prepaid s prepaid phone card business is highly sensitive to price declines and subject to intense competition 
we believe in some instances our competitors offer or appear to offer rates to consumers that are below their cost in order to gain market share 
this type of pricing by one or more of our competitors can adversely affect our revenues and profits 
sti prepaid relies on independent distributors to generate revenues  who may not devote sufficient efforts to promote and sell our products rather than the products of our competitors 
the hard rock biloxi is in the early stages of operations relative to its competitors and has yet to produce significant operating income 
if premier is unable to manage the risks inherent in the establishment of a new business enterprise  it would negatively impact operating results  which could result in impairment charges if the net book value of premier s property and equipment is deemed unrecoverable 
the hard rock biloxi is dependent upon patronage of persons living in the gulf coast region 
downturns in local and regional economic conditions  an increase in competition in the surrounding area and interruptions caused by hurricanes could negatively impact operating results 
increases in mortgage interest rate levels or the lack of available consumer credit could reduce consumer demand for certain of our real estate development projects 
sangart is subject to extensive government regulation  cannot generate any revenue without regulatory approval of its products and is also subject to all of the risks inherent in establishing a new business 
there are other companies developing products for the same market that sangart is targeting  and if they are successful in bringing their product to market before sangart it may significantly impair sangart s ability to compete in the same market segment 
sangart s success depends on its ability to obtain  maintain and defend patent protection for its products and technologies  preserve trade secrets and operate without infringing the intellectual property rights of others 
the patent positions of biopharmaceutical companies  such as sangart  are generally uncertain and involve complex legal and factual questions 
if sangart s intellectual property positions are challenged  invalidated  circumvented or expire  or if sangart fails to maintain its third party intellectual property licenses in good standing  its ability to successfully bring hemospan to market would be adversely affected  it could incur monetary liabilities or be required to cease using the technology or product in dispute 
goober drilling s revenues and profitability are impacted by natural gas supplies and prices and the supply of drilling rigs in the marketplace 
during periods of decreased demand for natural gas  goober drilling s rig utilization will decline and its competitors may also have excess capacity in the marketplace  which would adversely impact goober drilling s revenues and profitability 
the lack of liquidity in the capital markets has and could continue to adversely affect exploration  production and development activities of goober drilling s customers  which causes a reduction in rig utilization and profitability 
the combination of low oil and natural gas prices and the lack of liquidity in the capital markets have forced goober drilling customers to reduce drilling programs and may impair their ability to sustain their current level of operations and meet their cash obligations 
in addition to reduced rig utilization and profitability  which could result in impairment charges for certain rigs  the difficulties being experienced by goober drilling s customers could increase goober drilling s bad debt expense

declines in jefferies operating results could adversely affect the value of the company s investment 
the company has a substantial investment in acf  a company that purchases automobile loans made to sub prime and other borrowers  whose operating results are greatly affected by the economy and financial markets 
if acf s loan losses increase as its borrowers experience economic hardships  or if its ability to acquire new loans and grow its business is impaired  particularly due to the turmoil in the credit markets that acf needs to access to fund its operating activities  its revenues and profits would decline  adversely affecting the value of the company s investment 
subsequent to december   acf failed to maintain a financial covenant in one of its credit facilities and has been granted a waiver through march  acf is currently negotiating with its credit providers to amend its facility  however  if acf is unsuccessful the value of the company s investment could decline significantly 
the company has substantial investments in fortescue  inmet and clc  entities which are engaged in the mining of base metals principally iron ore and copper  the prices of which have declined during reducing the value of the company s investments

this analysis should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes which appear elsewhere in this report 
liquidity and capital resources general the company s investment portfolio  shareholders equity and results of operations can be significantly impacted by the changes in market values of certain securities  particularly during times of increased volatility in security prices 
changes in the market values of publicly traded available for sale securities are reflected in other comprehensive income loss and shareholders equity 
however  changes in the market prices of investments for which the company has elected the fair value option  and declines in the fair values of public and non public securities that the company deems to be other than temporary are reflected in the consolidated statements of operations and shareholders equity 
the company also has non controlling investments in entities that are engaged in investing and or securities transactions activities that are accounted for on the equity method of accounting classified as investments in associated companies  for which the company records its share of the entities profits or losses in its consolidated statements of operations 
these entities typically invest in public securities with changes in market values reflected in their earnings  which increases the company s exposure to volatility in the public securities markets 
during the second half of  there was enormous volatility and loss of value in public securities markets worldwide  and the market prices of the company s largest investments declined significantly 
the company s investment in the common shares of fortescue  which is accounted for as an available for sale security  declined in value from  at december  to  at december   which is reflected as an after tax loss in other comprehensive income loss and a decline in shareholders equity of  the market values of the company s investments in acf and jefferies  for which the fair value option was elected  also declined significantly with unrealized losses reflected in operations as a component of income losses related to associated companies

the additional cash payments were expensed 
during the fourth quarter of  the company received distributions totaling  from its subsidiary  empire insurance company empire  which has been undergoing a voluntary liquidation since the company had classified empire as a discontinued operation in and fully wrote off its remaining book value based on its expected future cash flows at that time 
although empire no longer writes any insurance business  its orderly liquidation over the years has resulted in reductions to its estimated claim reserves that enabled empire to pay the distributions  with the approval of the new york insurance department 
since future distributions from empire  if any  are subject to new york insurance law or the approval of the new york insurance department  income will only be recognized when received

the company and certain of its subsidiaries have substantial nols and other tax attributes 
the amount and availability of the nols and other tax attributes are subject to certain qualifications  limitations and uncertainties 
in order to reduce the possibility that certain changes in ownership could impose limitations on the use of the nols  the company s certificate of incorporation contains provisions which generally restrict the ability of a person or entity from acquiring ownership including through attribution under the tax law of five percent or more of the common shares and the ability of persons or entities now owning five percent or more of the common shares from acquiring additional common shares 
the restrictions will remain in effect until the earliest of a december   b the repeal of section of the internal revenue code or any comparable successor provision or c the beginning of a taxable year of the company to which certain tax benefits may no longer be carried forward

the components of the company s operating businesses and investments change frequently as a result of acquisitions or divestitures  the timing of which is impossible to predict but which often have a material impact on the company s consolidated statements of cash flows in any one period 
further  the timing and amounts of distributions from certain of the company s investments in partnerships accounted for under the equity method are generally outside the control of the company 
as a result  reported cash flows from operating  investing and financing activities do not generally follow any particular pattern or trend  and reported results in the most recent period should not be expected to recur in any subsequent period

these fixed rate repurchase agreements have a weighted average interest rate of approximately  mature in january and are secured by non current investments with a carrying value of  at december  debt due within one year also includes  related to the myrtle beach project  which matures in october the company has an option to extend the maturity of the loan for two successive twelve month periods  however  the right to extend the loan is contingent upon the relationship between the appraised value of the property and the aggregate loan commitment as of the initial maturity date and the debt service coverage ratio 
although the company believes it will be able to extend the maturity date of the loan  since the right to do so is not completely within the control of the company the loan has been classified as a current liability 
during  a subsidiary of the company borrowed  secured by certain of its corporate aircraft  of which  is currently outstanding 
the parent company has guaranteed this financing 
the company s senior note indentures contain covenants that restrict its ability to incur more indebtedness or issue preferred stock of subsidiaries unless  at the time of such incurrence or issuance  the company meets a specified ratio of consolidated debt to consolidated tangible net worth  limit the ability of the company and material subsidiaries to incur  in certain circumstances  liens  limit the ability of material subsidiaries to incur funded debt in certain circumstances  and contain other terms and restrictions all as defined in the senior note indentures 
the company has the ability to incur substantial additional indebtedness or make distributions to its shareholders and still remain in compliance with these restrictions 
if the company is unable to meet the specified ratio  the company would not be able to issue additional indebtedness or preferred stock  but the company s inability to meet the applicable ratio would not result in a default under its senior note indentures 
the company s bank credit agreement also contains covenants and restrictions which are generally more restrictive than the senior note indentures  however  the company has the ability to terminate the bank credit agreement if no amounts are outstanding 
certain of the debt instruments of subsidiaries of the company require that collateral be provided to the lender  principally as a result of such requirements  the assets of subsidiaries which are subject to limitations on transfer of funds to the company were approximately  at december  for more information  see note of notes to consolidated financial statements

the above amounts do not include liabilities for unrecognized tax benefits as the timing of payments  if any  is uncertain 
such amounts aggregated  at december   for more information  see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
at december   the company had recorded a liability of  on its consolidated balance sheet for its unfunded defined benefit pension plan obligations 
this amount represents the difference between the present value of amounts owed to current and former employees referred to as the projected benefit obligation and the market value of plan assets set aside in segregated trust accounts 
since the benefits in these plans have been frozen  future changes to the unfunded benefit obligation are expected to principally result from benefit payments  changes in the market value of plan assets  differences between actuarial assumptions and actual experience and interest rates 
although the company did not make any significant pension plan contributions during  the company does expect to make substantial contributions to the segregated trust accounts in the future to reduce its plan liabilities and reduce administrative and insurance costs associated with the plans 
the tax deductibility of these contributions is not a primary consideration  principally due to the availability of the company s nols to otherwise reduce taxable income 
other than the  expected contribution  the timing and amount of additional contributions are uncertain  however  the company believes it will make substantial contributions over the next few years to reduce  but not to entirely eliminate  its defined benefit pension plan liability 
the company maintained defined benefit pension plans covering certain operating units prior to  and wiltel also maintained defined pension benefit plans that were not transferred in connection with the sale of wiltel 
as of december   certain amounts for these plans are reflected separately in the table below dollars in thousands caption the company s wiltel s plans plans 
del projected benefit obligation   funded status balance sheet liability at december    deferred losses included in other comprehensive income loss   discount rate used to determine the projected benefit obligation del 
calculations of pension expense and projected benefit obligations are prepared by actuaries based on assumptions provided by management 
these assumptions are reviewed on an annual basis  including assumptions about discount rates  interest credit rates and expected long term rates of return on plan assets 
for the company s plans  a discount rate was selected to result in an estimated projected benefit obligation on a plan termination basis  using current rates for annuity settlements and lump sum payments weighted for the assumed elections of participants 
for the wiltel plans  the timing of expected future benefit payments was used in conjunction with the citigroup pension discount curve to develop a discount rate that is representative of the high quality corporate bond market 
these discount rates will be used to determine pension expense in holding all other assumptions constant  a change in these discount rates would affect aggregate pension expense by  and the aggregate benefit obligation by  the deferred losses in other comprehensive income loss primarily result from differences between the actual and assumed return on plan assets and changes in actuarial assumptions  including changes in discount rates and changes in interest credit rates 
deferred losses are amortized to expense if they exceed of the greater of the projected benefit obligation or the market value of plan assets as of the beginning of the year  such amount aggregated  at december  for all plans 
a portion of these excess deferred losses will be amortized to expense during based on an amortization period of twelve years 
the assumed long term rates of return on plan assets are based on the investment objectives of the specific plan  which are more fully discussed in note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
prior to  differences between the actual and expected rates of return on plan assets have not been material 
during  the fair value of the wiltel plan assets declined significantly due to the decline in securities markets worldwide 
this decline is the reason for the significant increase in the balance sheet liability for the wiltel plans during off balance sheet arrangements at december   the company s off balance sheet arrangements consist of guarantees and letters of credit aggregating  pursuant to an agreement that was entered into before the company sold cds holding corporation cds to homefed in  the company agreed to provide project improvement bonds for the san elijo hills project 
these bonds  which are for the benefit of the city of san marcos  california and other government agencies  are required prior to the commencement of any development at the project 
cds is responsible for paying all third party fees related to obtaining the bonds 
should the city or others draw on the bonds for any reason  cds and one of its subsidiaries would be obligated to reimburse the company for the amount drawn 
at december   the amount of outstanding bonds was  which expires at various times through subsidiaries of the company have outstanding letters of credit aggregating  at december   principally to secure various obligations 
substantially all of these letters of credit expire before as discussed above  the company has also guaranteed of the amounts outstanding under clc s senior secured credit facility and senior secured bridge credit facility 
at december    was outstanding under the senior secured credit facility and euro  was outstanding under the senior secured bridge credit facility  as a result  the company s outstanding guaranty at that date was  and euro   at exchange rates in effect on february   respectively 
critical accounting estimates the company s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based upon its consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with gaap 
the preparation of these financial statements requires the company to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts in the financial statements and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  the company evaluates all of these estimates and assumptions 
the following areas have been identified as critical accounting estimates because they have the potential to have a material impact on the company s financial statements  and because they are based on assumptions which are used in the accounting records to reflect  at a specific point in time  events whose ultimate outcome won t be known until a later date 
actual results could differ from these estimates 
income taxes at december   the company s net deferred tax asset before valuation allowances was  of which  represents the potential future tax savings from federal and state nols 
in accordance with financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for income taxes sfas  the company records a valuation allowance to reduce its deferred tax asset to the net amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
the amount of any valuation allowance recorded does not in any way adversely affect the company s ability to use its nols to offset taxable income in the future 
if in the future the company determines that it is more likely than not that the company will be able to realize its net deferred tax asset in excess of its net recorded amount  an adjustment to increase the net deferred tax asset would increase income in such period 
if in the future the company were to determine that it would not be able to realize all or part of its net recorded deferred tax asset  an adjustment to decrease the net deferred tax asset would be charged to income in such period 
sfas requires the company to consider all available evidence  both positive and negative  and to weight the evidence when determining whether a valuation allowance is required 
generally  greater weight is required to be placed on objectively verifiable evidence when making this assessment  in particular on recent historical operating results 
in prior periods  the company s long track record of generating taxable income  its cumulative taxable income for more recent past periods and its projections of future taxable income were the most heavily weighted factors considered when determining how much of the net deferred tax asset was more likely than not to be realizable 
during the company concluded that it was more likely than not that it would have future taxable income sufficient to realize a portion of the company s net deferred tax asset  accordingly   of the deferred tax valuation allowance was reversed as a credit to income tax expense 
an additional  of the valuation allowance was reversed as a credit to income tax expense in the company s estimate of future taxable income considered all available evidence  both positive and negative  about its operating businesses and investments  included an aggregation of individual projections for each material operating business and investment  estimated apportionment factors for state and local taxing jurisdictions and included all future years that the company estimated it would have available nols 
during the second half of the company recorded significant unrealized losses on many of its largest investments fortescue  inmet  jefferies  acf and cresud  recognized other than temporary impairments for a number of other investments and reported reduced profitability from substantially all of its operating businesses  all of which contributed to the recognition of a pre tax loss of  in the consolidated statement of operations and a pre tax loss in other comprehensive income loss of  for the year ended december  the worldwide economic downturn has adversely affected many of the company s operating businesses and investments  and the nature of the current economic difficulties make it impossible to reliably project how long the downturn will last 
additionally  the losses result in a cumulative loss in the company s total comprehensive income loss during the past three years 
in assessing the realizability of the net deferred tax asset at december   the company concluded that its operating losses for the more recent periods and current economic conditions worldwide should be given more weight than its projections of future taxable income during the period that it has nols available until  and be given more weight than the company s long track record of generating taxable income 
as a result  the company concluded that a valuation allowance was required against substantially all of the net deferred tax asset  and increased its valuation allowance by  with a corresponding charge to income tax expense 
pursuant to sfas  the company will continue to evaluate the realizability of its net deferred tax asset in future periods 
however  before the company would reverse any portion of its valuation allowance  it will need historical positive cumulative taxable income over a period of years to overcome the recent negative evidence 
at that time  any decrease to the valuation allowance would be based significantly upon the company s projections of future taxable income  which are inherently uncertain 
the company also records reserves for contingent tax liabilities based on the company s assessment of the probability of successfully sustaining its tax filing positions 
impairment of long lived assets in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  the company evaluates its long lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate  in management s judgment  that the carrying value of such assets may not be recoverable 
when testing for impairment  the company groups its long lived assets with other assets and liabilities at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities or asset group 
the determination of whether an asset group is recoverable is based on management s estimate of undiscounted future cash flows directly attributable to the asset group as compared to its carrying value 
if the carrying amount of the asset group is greater than the undiscounted cash flows  an impairment loss would be recognized for the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset group exceeds its estimated fair value 
the company recorded impairment losses on various long lived assets aggregating  during  there were no impairment losses recorded during or as discussed in this report  current economic conditions have adversely affected most of the company s operations and investments 
a worsening of current economic conditions or a prolonged recession could cause a decline in estimated future cash flows expected to be generated by the company s operations and investments 
if future undiscounted cash flows are estimated to be less than the carrying amounts of the asset groups used to generate those cash flows in subsequent reporting periods  particularly for those with large investments in property and equipment for example  manufacturing  gaming entertainment and certain associated company investments  impairment charges would have to be recorded 
impairment of securities investments with an impairment in value considered to be other than temporary are written down to estimated fair value 
the write downs are included in net securities gains losses in the consolidated statements of operations 
the company evaluates its investments for impairment on a quarterly basis 
the company s determination of whether a security is other than temporarily impaired incorporates both quantitative and qualitative information  gaap requires the exercise of judgment in making this assessment  rather than the application of fixed mathematical criteria 
the company considers a number of factors including  but not limited to  the length of time and the extent to which the fair value has been less than cost  the financial condition and near term prospects of the issuer  the reason for the decline in fair value  changes in fair value subsequent to the balance sheet date  the ability and intent to hold investments to maturity  and other factors specific to the individual investment 
the company s assessment involves a high degree of judgment and accordingly  actual results may differ materially from the company s estimates and judgments 
the company recorded impairment charges for securities of   and  for the years ended december   and  respectively 
business combinations at acquisition  the company allocates the cost of a business acquisition to the specific tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based upon their relative fair values 
significant judgments and estimates are often made to determine these allocated values  and may include the use of appraisals  consider market quotes for similar transactions  employ discounted cash flow techniques or consider other information the company believes relevant 
the finalization of the purchase price allocation will typically take a number of months to complete  and if final values are materially different from initially recorded amounts earlier issued financial statements may have to be restated 
any excess of the cost of a business acquisition over the fair values of the net assets and liabilities acquired is recorded as goodwill  which is not amortized to expense 
recorded goodwill of a reporting unit is required to be tested for impairment on an annual basis  and between annual testing dates if events or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its net book value 
at december   the book value of goodwill was  subsequent to the finalization of the purchase price allocation  any adjustments to the recorded values of acquired assets and liabilities would be reflected in the company s consolidated statement of operations 
once final  the company is not permitted to revise the allocation of the original purchase price  even if subsequent events or circumstances prove the company s original judgments and estimates to be incorrect 
in addition  long lived assets recorded in a business combination like property and equipment  amortizable intangibles and goodwill may be deemed to be impaired in the future resulting in the recognition of an impairment loss 
the assumptions and judgments made by the company when recording business combinations will have an impact on reported results of operations for many years into the future 
purchase price allocations for all of the company s acquisitions have been finalized 
adjustments to the initial purchase price allocations were not material 
use of fair value estimates effective january  except as described below  the company adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 
 fair value measurements sfas 
sfas defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value  establishes a hierarchy that prioritizes inputs to valuation techniques and expands disclosures about fair value measurements 
the fair value hierarchy gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities level  the next priority to inputs that don t qualify as level inputs but are nonetheless observable  either directly or indirectly  for the particular asset or liability level  and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs level 
the company elected to defer the effectiveness of sfas for one year only with respect to nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a nonrecurring basis 
the adoption of sfas did not have any impact on the company s consolidated financial statements other than expanded disclosures  however  fair value measurements for new assets or liabilities and fair value measurements for existing nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities may be materially different under sfas over of the company s investment portfolio is classified as available for sale securities  which are carried at estimated fair value in the company s consolidated balance sheet 
the estimated fair values are principally based on publicly quoted market prices level inputs  which can rise or fall in reaction to a wide variety of factors or events  and as such are subject to market related risks and uncertainties 
the company has a segregated portfolio of mortgage pass through certificates issued by us government agencies gnma and by us government sponsored enterprises fhlmc or fnma which are carried on the balance sheet at their estimated fair value of  although the markets that these types of securities trade in are generally active  market prices are not always available for the identical security 
the fair value of these investments are based on observable market data including benchmark yields  reported trades  issuer spreads  benchmark securities  bids and offers 
these estimates of fair value are considered to be level inputs  and the amounts realized from the disposition of these investments has not been materially different from their estimated fair values 
the company has a segregated portfolio of corporate bonds  which are carried on the balance sheet at their estimated fair value of  although these bonds trade in brokered markets  the market for certain bonds is sometimes inactive 
the fair values of these investments are based on reported trading prices  bid and ask prices and quotes obtained from independent market makers in the securities 
these estimates of fair values are also considered to be level inputs 
contingencies the company accrues for contingent losses when the contingent loss is probable and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated 
estimates of the likelihood that a loss will be incurred and of contingent loss amounts normally require significant judgment by management  can be highly subjective and are subject to material change with the passage of time as more information becomes available 
estimating the ultimate impact of litigation matters is inherently uncertain  in particular because the ultimate outcome will rest on events and decisions of others that may not be within the power of the company to control 
the company does not believe that any of its current litigation will have a material adverse effect on its consolidated financial position  results of operations or liquidity  however  if amounts paid at the resolution of litigation are in excess of recorded reserve amounts  the excess could be material to results of operations for that period 
as of december   the company s accrual for contingent losses was not material 
results of operations general substantially all of the company s operating businesses sell products or services that are impacted by general economic conditions in the us and to a lesser extent internationally 
poor general economic conditions have reduced the demand for products or services sold by the company s operating subsidiaries and or resulted in reduced pricing for products or services 
troubled industry sectors  like the residential real estate market  have had an adverse direct impact not only on the company s real estate and property management and services segments  but have also had an adverse indirect impact on some of the company s other operating segments  including manufacturing and gaming entertainment 
the discussions below concerning revenue and profitability by segment consider current economic conditions and the impact such conditions have had and may continue to have on each segment  however  should general economic conditions worsen and or if the country experiences a prolonged recession  the company believes that all of its businesses would be adversely impacted 
the company does not have any operating businesses that are participants in the sub prime real estate lending sector  though a tightening in consumer lending standards has had and will continue to have a direct or indirect negative impact on certain of the company s operations 
the company s investment portfolio includes mortgage backed securities of  at december   however  all of these securities are issued by us government agencies or us government sponsored enterprises 
the company has also invested in certain investment partnerships one of which is consolidated that invest in securities whose values are directly affected by the sub prime lending crisis 
the company s exposure to changes in their values is limited to the net book value of its investment in such partnerships 
at december   the aggregate book value of the company s investments in such partnerships was approximately  manufacturing idaho timber revenues and other income for idaho timber for the years ended december   and were   and  respectively  gross profits were   and  respectively  salaries and incentive compensation expenses were   and  respectively  depreciation and amortization expenses were   and  respectively  and pre tax income was   and  respectively 
idaho timber s revenues and other income include  from the settlement of an insurance claim 
idaho timber s revenues for continued to reflect the weak demand resulting from reductions in housing starts and the abundant supply of high grade lumber in the marketplace 
shipment volume in declined by as compared to  average selling prices did not significantly change in as compared to idaho timber expects that the abundance of existing homes available for sale in the market will continue to negatively impact housing starts and idaho timber s revenues during until housing starts begin to increase  annual dimension lumber shipping volume may remain flat or could decline further 
curtailment of production at primary sawmills due to their operating losses could reduce excess supply to some degree  however  spread as discussed below may not improve since price pressure for low grade lumber may increase if supplies are reduced 
idaho timber s revenues for also reflect the loss of a large home center board customer  which discontinued purchasing pine boards through its vendor managed inventory program effective july  revenues from this customer pursuant to this program were  for the six months ended june  the weak demand resulting from reductions in housing starts and the abundant supply of high grade lumber in the marketplace also impacted idaho timber s revenues for although shipment volume increased throughout much of as compared to the last quarter of  the full year shipment volume in declined by as compared to in addition  average selling prices for declined almost as compared to while raw material costs  the largest component of cost of sales approximately of cost of sales  declined for as compared to  principally due to the same market conditions that negatively impacted revenues  raw material cost per thousand board feet did not significantly change for as compared to the difference between idaho timber s selling price and raw material cost per thousand board feet spread is closely monitored  and the rate of change in pricing and cost is not necessarily the same 
the spread for declined by as compared to  and was significantly lower in the fourth quarter of as compared to the prior quarters in  and although idaho timber reduced its manufacturing costs in the fourth quarter  the smaller spread combined with low shipment volume resulted in negative gross profit for the quarter 
to the extent that shipment volume remains depressed and cost of raw material remains high relative to selling price  idaho timber could experience negative gross profit in future quarters 
raw material costs declined during as compared to principally due to the same market conditions that negatively impacted revenues 
however  raw material costs gradually increased throughout  reflecting less availability of low grade lumber due to increased shipments to asia and europe and lower canadian lumber imports 
spreads declined throughout  and were lower by approximately for the full year as compared to manufacturing conwed plastics pre tax income for conwed plastics was   and  for the years ended december   and  respectively 
its manufacturing revenues and other income were   and  and gross profits were   and  for the years ended december   and  respectively 
while conwed plastics revenues from the packaging and filtration markets increased during largely due to acquisitions made in  and in the european markets due to an acquisition in  new customers and the impact of foreign exchange  its business continued to be adversely impacted in those markets related to the housing industry 
markets that are impacted by the slowdown in the housing industry  which began in the second half of  include the carpet cushion  building and construction  erosion control and turf reinforcement markets 
in addition  revenues from the erosion control market declined in as some business was lost to competitors 
conwed plastics expects revenues to continue to be adversely impacted in those markets related to housing  and also expects that the poor domestic and international economic conditions will continue to adversely impact its other markets in the future 
the slowdown in housing starts and a slow start in road construction due to weather conditions were principally responsible for the revenue decline in most of conwed plastics markets during in addition  increased competition in the erosion control market caused a decline in revenues during revenues also declined due to the removal of netting as a component of a customer s bedding product 
conwed plastics did realize increased revenues of  from its packaging market  principally due to acquisitions in may  and in february  july and october of raw material costs increased by approximately in as compared to and by approximately in as compared to the primary raw material in conwed plastics products is a polypropylene resin  which is a byproduct of the oil refining process  whose price tends to fluctuate with the price of oil
