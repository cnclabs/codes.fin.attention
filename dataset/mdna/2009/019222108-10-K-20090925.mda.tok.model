item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
government regulation the company s products and its manufacturing activities are subject to extensive and rigorous government regulation by federal and state authorities in the united states and other countries 
in the united states  medical devices for human use are subject to comprehensive review by the united states food and drug administration the fda 
the federal food  drug  and cosmetic act fdc act  and other federal statutes and regulations  govern or influence the research  testing  manufacture  safety  labeling  storage  record keeping  approval  advertising and promotion of such products 
noncompliance with applicable requirements can result in warning letters  fines  recall or seizure of products  injunction  refusal to permit products to be imported into or exported out of the united states  refusal of the government to clear or approve marketing applications or to allow the company to enter into government supply contracts  or withdrawal of previously approved marketing applications and criminal prosecution 
the company is required to file a premarket notification in the form of a premarket approval pma with the fda before it begins marketing a new medical device that offers new technology that is currently not on the market 
the company also must file a premarket notification in the form of a k with the fda before it begins marketing a new medical device that utilizes existing technology for devices that are currently on the market 
the k submission process is also required when the company makes a change or modifies an existing device in a manner that could significantly affect the device s safety or effectiveness 
compliance with the regulatory approval process in order to market a new or modified medical device can be uncertain  lengthy and  in some cases  expensive 
there can be no assurance that necessary regulatory approvals will be obtained on a timely basis  or at all 
delays in receipt or failure to receive such approvals  the loss of previously received approvals  or failure to comply with existing or future regulatory requirements could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
the company manufactures and distributes a broad spectrum of respiratory therapy equipment  emergency medical equipment and medical gas equipment 
to date  all of the company s fda clearances have been obtained through the k clearance process 
these determinations are very fact specific and the fda has stated that  initially  the manufacturer is best qualified to make these determinations  which should be based on adequate supporting data and documentation 
the fda however  may disagree with a manufacturer s determination not to file a k and require the submission of a new k notification for the changed or modified device 
where the fda believes that the change or modification raises significant new questions of safety or effectiveness  the agency may require a manufacturer to cease distribution of the device pending clearance of a new k notification 
certain of the company s medical devices have been changed or modified subsequent to k marketing clearance of the original device by the fda 
certain of the company s medical devices  which were first marketed prior to may   and therefore  grandfathered and exempt from the k notification process  also have been subsequently changed or modified 
the company believes that these changes or modifications do not significantly affect the devices safety or effectiveness  or make a major change or modification in the devices intended uses and  accordingly  submission of new k notification to the fda is not required 
there can be no assurance  however  that the fda would agree with the company s determinations 
in addition  commercial distribution in certain foreign countries is subject to additional regulatory requirements and receipt of approvals that vary widely from country to country 
the company believes it is in compliance with regulatory requirements of the countries in which it sells its products 
the medical device reporting regulation requires that the company provide information to the fda on deaths or serious injuries alleged to have been associated with the use of its devices  as well as product malfunctions that would likely cause or contribute to death or serious injury if the malfunction were to recur 
the medical device tracking regulation requires the company to adopt a method of device tracking of certain devices  such as ventilators  which are life supporting or life sustaining devices used outside of a device user facility  some of which are permanently implantable devices 
the regulation requires that the method adopted 
table of contents by the company will ensure that the tracked device can be traced from the device manufacturer to the person for whom the device is indicated ie  the patient 
in addition  the fda prohibits a company from promoting an approved device for unapproved applications and reviews a company s labeling for accuracy 
labeling and promotional activities also are in certain instances  subject to scrutiny by the federal trade commission 
the company s medical device manufacturing facilities are registered with the fda  and have received iso certification under the medical device directive mdd european for certain products in the company s st 
louis facility is iso certified 
the company is subject to audit by the fda  iso  and european auditors for compliance with the good manufacturing practices gmp  the iso and mdd regulations for medical devices 
these regulations require the company to manufacture its products and maintain its products and documentation in a prescribed manner with respect to design  manufacturing  testing and control activities 
the company also is subject to the registration and inspection requirements of state regulatory agencies 
there can be no assurance that any required fda or other governmental approval will be granted  or  if granted  will not be withdrawn 
governmental regulation may prevent or substantially delay the marketing of the company s proposed products and cause the company to undertake costly procedures 
in addition  the extent of potentially adverse government regulation that might arise from future administrative action or legislation cannot be predicted 
any failure to obtain  and maintain  such approvals could adversely affect the company s ability to market its products or proposed products 
sales of medical devices outside the united states are subject to foreign regulatory requirements that vary widely from country to country 
medical products shipped to the european community generally require ce certification 
the letters ce are an abbreviation of conformit europ enne  french for european conformity 
whether or not fda approval has been obtained  approval of a device by a comparable regulatory authority of a foreign country generally must be obtained prior to the commencement of marketing in those countries 
the time required to obtain such approvals may be longer or shorter than that required for fda approval 
in addition  fda approval may be required under certain circumstances to export certain medical devices 
the company is also subject to numerous federal  state and local laws relating to such matters as safe working conditions  manufacturing practices  environmental protections  fire hazard control and disposal of hazardous or potentially hazardous substances 
patents  trademarks and proprietary technology the company owns and maintains patents on several products it believes is useful to the business and provides the company with an advantage over its competitors 
during fiscal the company continued to pursue patents on the construction alarm  resuscitimer  mask restraint system and the epv ventilator 
the company owns and maintains us trademarks for allied healthcare products  inc  chemetron  gomco  oxequip  lif o gen  life support products  timeter  vacutron and schuco  its principal trademarks 
registrations for these trademarks are also owned and maintained in countries where such products are sold and such registrations are considered necessary to preserve company s proprietary rights therein 
environmental and safety regulation the company is subject to federal  state and local environmental laws and regulations that impose limitations on the discharge of pollutants into the environment and establish standards for the treatment  storage and disposal of toxic and hazardous wastes 
the company is also subject to the federal occupational safety and health act and similar state statutes 
from time to time the company has been involved in environmental proceedings involving clean up of hazardous waste 
there are no such material proceedings currently pending 
costs of compliance with environmental  health and safety requirements have not been material to the company 
the company believes it is in material compliance with all applicable environmental laws and regulations 

table of contents competition the company has different competitors within each of its product lines 
many of the company s principal competitors are larger than allied and the company believes that most of these competitors have greater financial and other resources 
the company competes primarily on the basis of price  quality and service 
the company believes that it is well positioned with respect to product cost  brand recognition  product reliability  and customer service to compete effectively in each of its markets 
employees at june   the company had approximately full time employees 
approximately employees in the company s principal manufacturing facility located in st 
louis  missouri  are covered by a collective bargaining agreement that will expire on may  executive officers of the registrant this section provides information regarding the executive officers of the company who are appointed by and serve at the pleasure of the board of directors

risk factors the company s business  operations and financial condition are subject to various risks and uncertainties 
you should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described below  together with all of the other information in this annual report on form k and in the company s other filings with the sec  before making any investment decision with respect to the company s securities 
the risks and uncertainties described below may not be the only ones the company faces 
additional risks and uncertainties not presently known by the company or that the company currently deems immaterial may also affect the company s business 
if any of these known or unknown risks or uncertainties actually occur or develop  the company s business  financial condition  and results of operations could change 
the company participates in a highly competitive environment 
the medical device industry is characterized by rapid technological change  changing customer needs and frequent new product introductions 
our products may be rendered obsolete as a result of future innovations 
we face intense competition from other manufacturers 
some of our competitors may be larger than we are and may have greater financial  technical  research  marketing  sales  distribution and other resources than we do 
we believe that price competition will continue among products developed in our markets 
our competitors may develop or market technologies and products that are more effective or commercially attractive than any we are developing or marketing 
our competitors may succeed in obtaining regulatory approval and introducing or commercializing products before we do 
such developments could have a significant negative effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
even if we are able to compete successfully  we may not be able to do so in a profitable manner 
decreased availability or increased costs of raw materials could increase the company s costs of producing its products 
the company purchases raw materials  fabricated components and services from a variety of suppliers 
raw materials such as brass and plastics are considered key raw materials 
the company believes that its relationships with its suppliers are satisfactory and that alternative sources of supply are readily available 
from time to time  however  the prices and availability of these raw materials fluctuate due to global market demands  which could impair the company s ability to procure necessary materials  or increase the cost of such materials 
inflationary and other increases in costs of these raw materials have occurred in the past and may recur from time to time 
in addition  freight costs associated with shipping and receiving product and sales are impacted by fluctuations in the cost of oil and gas 
a reduction in the supply or increase in the cost of those raw materials could impact the company s ability to manufacture its products and could increase the cost of production 
changes in third party reimbursement could negatively impact the company s revenues and profitability 
the cost of a majority of medical care in the united states is funded by the us government through the medicare and medicaid programs and by private insurance programs  such as corporate health insurance plans 
although the company does not receive payments for its products directly from these programs  home respiratory care providers and durable medical equipment suppliers  who are the primary customers for several of the company s products  depend heavily on payments from medicare  medicaid and private insurers as a major source of revenues 
in addition  sales of certain of the company s products are affected by the extent of hospital and health care facility construction and renovation at any given time 
the federal government indirectly funds a significant percentage of such construction and renovation costs through medicare and medicaid reimbursements 
in recent years  governmentally imposed limits on reimbursement to hospitals and other health care providers have impacted spending for services  consumables and capital goods 
a material decrease from current reimbursement levels or a material change in the method or basis of reimbursing health care providers is likely to adversely affect future sales of the company s products 
our success depends upon the development of new products and product enhancements  which entails considerable time and expense 
we place a high priority on the development of new products to add to our product portfolio and on the development of enhancements to our existing products 
product development involves substantial expense and we cannot be certain that a completed product will generate sufficient revenue for our business to justify the 
table of contents resources that we devote to research and development related to such product 
the time and expense required to develop new products and product enhancements is difficult to predict and we cannot assure you that we will succeed in developing  introducing and marketing new products and product enhancements 
our inability to successfully develop and introduce new or enhanced products on a timely basis or at all  or to achieve market acceptance of such products  could materially impair our business 
we are dependent on adequate protection of our patent and proprietary rights 
we rely on patents  trade secrets  trademarks  copyrights  know how  license agreements and contractual provisions to establish and protect our intellectual property rights 
however  these legal means afford us only limited protection and may not adequately protect our rights or remedies to gain or keep any advantages we may have over our competitors 
we cannot assure you that others may not independently develop the same or similar technologies or otherwise obtain access to our technology and trade secrets 
our competitors  many of which have substantial resources and may make substantial investments in competing technologies  may apply for and obtain patents that will prevent  limit  or interfere with our ability to manufacture or market our products 
further  while we do not believe that any of our products or processes interfere with the rights of others  third parties may nonetheless assert patent infringement claims against us in the future 
costly litigation may be necessary to enforce patents issued to us  to protect trade secrets or know how we own  to defend us against claimed infringement of the rights of others or to determine the ownership  scope  or validity of our proprietary rights and the rights of others 
any claim of infringement against us may involve significant liabilities to third parties  could require us to seek licenses from third parties  and could prevent us from manufacturing  selling  or using our products 
the occurrence of this litigation or the effect of an adverse determination in any of this type of litigation could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
our business of the manufacturing  marketing  and sale of medical devices involves the risk of liability claims and such claims could seriously harm our business  particularly if our insurance coverage is inadequate 
our business exposes us to potential product liability claims that are inherent in the testing  production  marketing and sale of medical devices 
like other participants in the medical device market  we are from time to time involved in lawsuits  claims and proceedings alleging product liability and related claims such as negligence 
if any current or future product liability claims become substantial  our reputation could be damaged significantly  thereby harming our business 
we may be required to pay substantial damage awards as a result of any successful product liability claims 
any product liability claim against us  whether with or without merit  could result in costly litigation  and divert the time  attention  and resources of our management 
as a result of our exposure to product liability claims  we currently carry product liability insurance covering our products with policy limits per occurrence and in the aggregate that we have deemed to be sufficient 
our insurance may not cover certain product liability claims or our liability for any claims may exceed our coverage limits 
therefore  we cannot predict whether this insurance is sufficient  or if not  whether we will be able to obtain sufficient insurance to cover the risks associated with our business or whether such insurance will be available at premiums that are commercially reasonable 
in addition  these insurance policies must be renewed annually 
although we have been able to obtain liability insurance  such insurance may not be available in the future on acceptable terms  if at all 
a successful claim against us or settlement by us with respect to uninsured liabilities or in excess of our insurance coverage  or our inability to maintain insurance in the future  or any claim that results in significant costs to or adverse publicity against us  could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 

table of contents the company is subject to substantial domestic and international government regulation  including regulatory quality standards applicable to its manufacturing and quality processes 
failure by the company to comply with these standards could have an adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition or results of operations 
the fda regulates the approval  manufacturing  and sales and marketing of many of the company s products in the us significant government regulation also exists in canada  japan  europe  and other countries in which the company conducts business 
as a device manufacturer  the company is required to register with the fda and is subject to periodic inspection by the fda for compliance with the fda s quality system regulation qsr requirements  which require manufacturers of medical devices to adhere to certain regulations  including testing  quality control and documentation procedures 
in addition  the federal medical device reporting regulations require the company to provide information to the fda whenever there is evidence that reasonably suggests that a device may have caused or contributed to a death or serious injury or  if a malfunction were to occur  could cause or contribute to a death or serious injury 
compliance with applicable regulatory requirements is subject to continual review and is rigorously monitored through periodic inspections by the fda 
in the european community  the company is required to maintain certain iso certifications in order to sell its products and must undergo periodic inspections by notified bodies to obtain and maintain these certifications 
failure to comply with current governmental regulations and quality assurance guidelines could lead to temporary manufacturing shutdowns  product recalls or related field actions  product shortages or delays in product manufacturing 
efficacy or safety concerns  an increase in trends of adverse events in the marketplace  and or manufacturing quality issues with respect to the company s products could lead to product recalls or related field actions  withdrawals  and or declining sales 
our products may be subject to product recalls even after receiving fda clearance or approval  which would harm our reputation and our business 
the fda and similar governmental authorities in other countries in which our products are sold  have the authority to request and  in some cases  require the recall of our products in the event of material deficiencies or defects in design or manufacture 
a government mandated or voluntary recall by us could occur as a result of component failures  manufacturing errors or design defects 
any recall of product would divert managerial and financial resources  harm our reputation with our customers and damage our business 
the company is exposed to certain credit risks  resulting primarily from customer sales 
substantially all of the company s receivables are due from homecare providers  distributors  hospitals  and contractors 
the company s customers are located throughout the us and around the world 
the company records an estimated allowance for uncollectible amounts based primarily on the company s evaluation of the payment pattern  financial condition  cash flows  and credit history of its customers as well as current industry and economic conditions 
the company s inability to collect on its trade accounts receivable could substantially reduce the company s income and have a material adverse effect on its financial condition and results of operations 
the market price of our common stock may fluctuate widely 
the market price of our common stock could be subject to significant fluctuations in response to quarter to quarter variation in our operating results  announcements of new products or services by us or our competitors  and other events or factors 
for example  a shortfall in net sales or net income  or an increase in losses could have an immediate and significant adverse effect on the market price and volume fluctuations that have particularly affected the market prices of many micro and small capitalization companies and that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of these companies 
these fluctuations  as well as general economic and market conditions  may adversely affect the market price for our common stock 
if a natural or man made disaster strikes our manufacturing facilities  we may be unable to manufacture certain products for a substantial amount of time and our revenue could decline 
the company has one principal manufacturing operation 
in the event that this facility  located in st 
louis  missouri  were severely damaged or destroyed as a result of a natural or man made disaster  the 
table of contents company would be forced to relocate production to other facilities and or rely on third party manufacturers 
such an event could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations and financial condition 
although we have insurance for damage to our property and the interruption of our business  this insurance may not be sufficient in scope or amount to cover all of our potential losses and may not continue to be available to us on acceptable terms  or at all 
requirements associated with the evaluation of internal controls required by section of the sarbanes oxley act of have required and will require significant company resources and management attention 
the company is subject to the reporting requirements of federal securities laws  including the sarbanes oxley act of among other requirements  the sarbanes oxley act requires that the company maintain effective disclosure controls and procedures and internal control over financial reporting 
the company has  and expects to continue to  expend significant management time and resources maintaining documentation and testing internal control over financial reporting 
while management s evaluation as of june  resulted in the conclusion that the company s internal control over financial reporting was effective as of that date  the company cannot predict the outcome of testing in future periods 
if we are not able to continue to comply with the requirements of section in a timely manner  we could be subject to scrutiny by regulatory authorities  such as the sec or the nasdaq national market  and the trading price of our stock could decline 
moreover  effective internal controls are necessary for us to produce reliable financial reports and are important in helping us to prevent financial fraud 
if we cannot provide reliable financial reports or prevent fraud  our business and operating results could be harmed  investors could lose confidence in our reported financial information  and the trading price of our stock could drop significantly 
if we are unable to hire or retain key employees  it could have a negative impact on our business 
our failure to attract and retain skilled personnel could hinder the management of our business  our research and development  our sales and marketing efforts  and our manufacturing capabilities 
however  there is no assurance that we will continue to be able to hire or retain key employees 
we compete to hire new employees  and then must train them and develop their skills and competencies 
our operating results could be adversely affected by increased costs due to increased competition for employees  higher employee turnover or increased employee benefit costs 
any unplanned turnover could deplete our institutional knowledge base and erode our competitive advantage

table of contents critical accounting policies in preparing financial statements  management is required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
the company evaluates estimates and judgments on an ongoing basis  including those related to bad debts  inventory valuations  property  plant and equipment  intangible assets  income taxes  and contingencies and litigation 
estimates and judgments are based on historical experience and on various other factors that may be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates 
the following areas are considered to be the company s most significant accounting policies revenue recognition revenue is recognized for all sales  including sales to agents and distributors  at the time products are shipped and title has transferred  provided that a purchase order has been received or a contract executed  there are not uncertainties regarding customer acceptance  the sales price is fixed and determinable and collectability is reasonably assured 
sales discounts  returns and allowances are included in net sales  and the provision for doubtful accounts is included in selling  general and administrative expenses 
additionally  it is the company s practice to include revenues generated from freight billed to customers in net sales with corresponding freight expense included in cost of sales in the consolidated statement of operations 
the sales price is fixed by allied s acceptance of the buyer s firm purchase order 
the sales price is not contingent  or subject to additional discounts 
allied s standard shipment terms are fob shipping point as stated in allied s terms and conditions of sale 
the customer is responsible for obtaining insurance for and bears the risk of loss for product in transit 
additionally  sales to customers do not include the right to return merchandise without the prior consent of allied 
in those cases where returns are accepted  product must be current and restocking fees must be paid by the respective customer 
a provision has been made for estimated sales returns and allowances 
these estimates are based on historical analysis of credit memo data and returns 
allied does not provide installation services for its products 
most products shipped are ready for immediate use by the customer 
the company s in wall medical system components  central station pumps and compressors  and headwalls do require installation by the customer 
these products are typically purchased by a third party contractor who is ultimately responsible for installation services 
accordingly  the customer purchase order or contract does not require customer acceptance of the installation prior to completion of the sale transaction and revenue recognition 
allied s standard payment terms are net days from the date of shipment  and payment is specifically not subject to customer inspection of acceptance  as stated in allied s terms and conditions of sale 
the buyer becomes obligated to pay allied at the time of shipment 
allied requires credit applications from its customers and performs credit reviews to determine the creditworthiness of new customers 
allied requires letters of credit  where warranted  for international transactions 
allied also protects its legal rights under mechanics lien laws when selling to contractors 
allied does offer limited warranties on its products 
the standard warranty period is one year 
the company s cost of providing warranty service for its products for the years ended june   june   and june  was   and  respectively 
the related liability for warranty service amounted to  and  at june  and  respectively 
inventory reserve for obsolete and excess inventory inventory is recorded net of a reserve for obsolete and excess inventory which is determined based on an analysis of inventory items with no usage in the preceding year and for inventory items for which there is greater than two years usage on hand 
this analysis considers those identified inventory items to determine  in management s best estimate  if parts can be used beyond one year  if there are alternate uses or at what values such parts may be disposed for 
at june  and  inventory is recorded net of a reserve for obsolete and excess inventory of million 
income taxes the company accounts for income taxes under sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
under sfas no 
 the deferred tax provision is determined using the liability method  whereby deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized based upon temporary differences between the financial statement and 
table of contents income tax bases of assets and liabilities using presently enacted tax rates 
valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amounts expected to be realized 
accounts receivable net of allowances accounts receivable are recorded net of an allowance for doubtful accounts  which is determined based on an analysis of past due accounts including accounts placed with collection agencies  and an allowance for returns and credits  which is based on historical analysis of credit memo data and returns 
at june  and  accounts receivable is recorded net of allowances of million 
goodwill goodwill initially arises from business acquisitions and represents the value of unidentifiable intangibles in an acquired business 
goodwill is then evaluated at least annually for impairment in accordance with sfas no 
goodwill and other intangible assets 
at june  the company had goodwill of million 
as a result of impairment testing as of june  the company wrote down all of its goodwill so that at june th  the company had zero goodwill 
this impairment reflected the deteriorating market conditions the company faces and lower prospects for earnings and cash flow 
the amount of the impairment was determined in accordance with sfas goodwill and other intangibles  which compares carrying value to the estimated fair value of assets and liabilities 
the company conducts a formal impairment test of goodwill annually at june th and between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of the company below its carrying value 
the annual impairment test did not indicate an impairment of goodwill at june   or allied operates as one reporting unit and prepares its annual goodwill impairment test in that manner 
none of the company s product lines constitute a business  as that term is defined in emerging issues task force eitf issue most of its products are produced in one facility  and allied does not produce separate financial statements for any part of its business 
at june  the company had goodwill of million  resulting from the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of net assets acquired in business combinations 
the company completed its annual goodwill impairment test during the fourth quarter of the fiscal year ended june  due to a general slow down in orders as a result of the current recession  operating profits and cash flows were lower than expected during fiscal based on that trend  management revised its earnings forecast for fiscal in addition  during the stock traded below book value  in part due to the global economic downturn s impact on company performance and the turmoil in the equity markets 
in accordance with sfas  a two step process is used to test for goodwill impairment 
the first step is to determine if there is an indication of impairment by comparing the estimated fair value of the company to its carrying value including existing goodwill 
goodwill is considered impaired if the carrying value of the company exceeds the estimated fair value 
upon indication of impairment  a second step is performed to determine the amount of the impairment by comparing the implied fair value of the company s goodwill with its carrying value 
to estimate the fair value of the company for step one  the company utilized a combination of income and market approaches 
the income approach  specifically a discounted cash flow methodology  included assumptions for  among others  forecasted revenues  gross profit margins  operating profit margins  working capital cash flow  perpetual growth rates and long term discount rates  all of which requires significant judgments by management 
these assumptions take into account the current recessionary environment and its impact on the company s business 
in addition  the company utilized a discount rate appropriate to compensate for its earning risk relative the equity markets as a whole

the company has entered into a credit facility arrangement with bank of america  the successor in interest to lasalle bank national association the bank 
the credit facility was amended on september   september   august   september   and september under the terms of the credit facility  the company is required to be in compliance with certain financial covenants pertaining to stockholders equity  capital expenditures and net income 
additionally  the terms of the credit facility restrict the company from the payment of dividends on any class of its stock 
at june   the company was in violation of its fixed charge coverage ratio covenant on the credit agreement 
the company has no outstanding amounts under the credit facility 
based on its discussions with the bank and other financial institutions  the company believes it will be able to negotiate an acceptable waiver and amendment with the bank or to procure a replacement credit facility with another lender 
even if this were not possible  the company does not anticipate the technical default under the credit facility to materially impact its liquidity 
the revolving credit facility provides for a borrowing base of of eligible accounts receivable plus the lesser of of eligible inventory or million  subject to reserves as established by the bank 
the maximum borrowing under the revolving credit facility is million 
at june   million was available under the revolving credit facility 
however  as of september   the company does not have any availability under the revolving credit facility due to the financial covenant violations discussed above 
as a result of an amendment made on september   the credit facility matures on september  borrowings under the facility accrue interest at a variable rate equal to the bank s prime rate 
the credit facility calls for a commitment fee payable quarterly based on the average daily unused portion of the revolving credit facility 
this commitment fee is if the company s ratio of funded debt to ebitda is greater than or equal to the commitment fee reduces to if this ratio is less than but greater than or equal to  and the fee reduces to if this ratio is less than the revolving credit facility also provides for a commitment guaranty of up to million for letters of credit and requires a per annum fee of on outstanding letters of credit 
at june   the company had no letters of credit outstanding 
any outstanding letters of credit decrease the amount available for borrowing under the revolving credit facility 
the credit facility requires a lockbox arrangement  which provide for all receipts to be swept daily to reduce borrowings outstanding under the credit facility 
this arrangement  combined with the existence of a material adverse effect mae clause in the credit facility  cause borrowings under the revolving credit facility to be classified as a current liability  per guidance in the fasb s emerging issues task force issue  balance sheet classification of borrowings outstanding under revolving credit agreements that include both a subjective acceleration clause and a lock box arrangement 
the mae clause  which is a typical requirement in commercial credit agreements  allows the lender to require the loan to become due if it 
table of contents determines there has been a material adverse effect on the company s operations  business  properties  assets  liabilities  condition or prospects 
the classification of borrowings under the revolving credit facility as a current liability is a result only of the combination of the two aforementioned factors the lockbox arrangement and the mae clause 
the bank has not notified the company of any indication of a mae at june  at june  the company had no aggregate indebtedness  including capital lease obligations  short term debt or long term debt

the company believes that cash flows from operations and available borrowings under its credit facilities will be sufficient to finance fixed payments and planned capital expenditures of million in cash flows from operations may be negatively impacted by decreases in sales  market conditions  and adverse changes in working capital 
in the event that economic conditions were to severely worsen for a protracted period of time  we believe that we will be able to negotiate an amendment and waiver to our existing credit facility or procure a replacement credit facility  and our projected borrowing capacity under those arrangements will provide sufficient financial flexibility 
the company would have options available to ensure liquidity in addition to increased borrowing 
capital expenditures  which are budgeted at million for the fiscal year ended june   could be postponed 
at june   the company had no bank debt 
inflation has not had a material effect on the company s business or results of operations 
the company makes its foreign sales in dollars and  accordingly  sales proceeds are not affected by exchange rate fluctuations  although the effect on its customers does impact the pace of incoming orders 
seasonality and quarterly results in past fiscal years  the company has experienced moderate seasonal increases in net sales during its second and third fiscal quarters october through march which in turn have affected net income 
such seasonal variations were likely attributable to an increase in hospital equipment purchases at the beginning of each calendar year which coincides with many hospitals fiscal years and an increase in the severity of influenza during winter months 

table of contents the following table sets forth selected operating results for the eight quarters ended june  the information for each of these quarters is unaudited  but includes all normal recurring adjustments which the company considers necessary for a fair presentation thereof 
these operating results  however  are not necessarily indicative of results for any future period 
further  operating results may fluctuate as a result of the timing of orders  the company s product and customer mix  the introduction of new products by the company and its competitors  and overall trends in the health care industry and the economy 
while these patterns have an impact on the company s quarterly operations  the company is unable to predict the extent of this impact in any particular period
