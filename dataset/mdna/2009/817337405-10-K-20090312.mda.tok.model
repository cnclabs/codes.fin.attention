item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we are a diagnostic testing and genetics analysis company committed to providing products  services  diagnostic testing  applications and genetic analysis products that translate the results of genomic science into solutions for biomedical research  translational research  molecular medicine applications  and agricultural  livestock  and other areas of research 
our development and commercialization efforts in various diagnostic areas include non invasive prenatal diagnostics  oncology  infectious diseases  and other disorders 
our proprietary massarray system  comprised of hardware  software applications  consumable chips and reagents  is a high performance in speed  accuracy and cost efficiency nucleic acid analysis platform that quantitatively and precisely measures genetic target material and variations 
our platform is widely accepted as a leading high performance dna analysis platform for the fine mapping genotyping market and is gaining traction in newer developing markets  such as epigenomics and clinical microbiology 
our customers include premier clinical research laboratories  bio agriculture  bio technology and pharmaceutical companies  academic institutions  various government agencies worldwide  as well as our clia certified lab  sequenom center for molecular medicine 
to provide customer support for our expanding user base and in an effort to maximize market penetration  we have established direct sales and support personnel serving north america  europe  india  australia and asia  in addition to regional distribution partners in france  israel  russia  eastern europe  south korea  new zealand  singapore  taiwan  kuwait  saudi arabia and turkey 
we are researching  developing and pursuing the commercializion of various non invasive molecular diagnostic tests for prenatal genetic disorders and diseases  oncology  infectious diseases  and other diseases and disorders 
we have branded our diagnostic technology for prenatal diagnostics under the trademark sequredx 
our efforts in molecular diagnostics are focused on non invasive diagnostics currently using our proprietary massarray system  however  we may in the future employ other platforms with our applications as may be more suitable on a case by case basis considering optimum test performance and commercialization factors 
currently  we are primarily focused on developing and commercializing prenatal screening and diagnostic tests using our non invasive  circulating cell free fetal ccff nucleic acid based assay technology  which is non invasive to the womb  using a simple maternal blood draw  for prenatal diagnosis  in order to provide more fundamental and reliable information about the fetus early in pregnancy 
our planned screening and diagnostic tests in areas of women s health  oncology  and infectious disease are also non invasive and are expected to use simple blood draws from patients rather than invasive procedures such as surgery 
supporting our initiatives in women s health  oncology and infectious disease  in january  we entered into an agreement for the acquisition of the complete attosense portfolio of gene based molecular tests and related assets from sensigen llc 
the acquisition includes highly sensitive and specific tests for the detection and monitoring of human papillomavirus hpv the primary cause of cervical and head and neck cancers  systemic lupus erythematosus lupus  chronic kidney disease ckd  inflammatory bowel disease ibd and other tests  all of which utilize our proprietary massarray platform 
this acquisition was completed in february we plan to launch through our clia laboratory a non invasive prenatal screening ldt test for rhesus d and a carrier screening test for cystic fibrosis during the second quarter of  a non invasive prenatal screening ldt test for trisomies trisomy and potentially trisomies and in june  and a non invasive prenatal screening ldt test for gender linked disorders our fetal xy screen during the fourth quarter of concurrent with our ldt commercialization activities  we plan to conduct the development  validation  and other activities necessary to file submissions with the food and drug administration fda seeking approval for selected diagnostic tests 
we plan to file submissions with the fda for our prenatal trisomy tests and rhesus d genotyping in 
table of contents our massarray technology is accepted as a leading high performance dna analysis system for the fine mapping genotyping market 
we derive revenue primarily from sales of our massarray hardware  software and consumable products 
our standard massarray system combines the following basic components  which contributes to the high level of performance in terms of speed  accuracy and cost efficiency a maldi tof mass spectrometer  which uses an established analytical method that we have adapted for dna analysis  proprietary biochemical reagents for sample preparation  coated silicon chips known as the spectrochip  liquid handling hardware to prepare dna for analysis  and dispensing hardware to dispense analyte onto the spectrochip carrier  and bioinformatics software that records  calculates  and reports the data generated by the mass spectrometer 
our massarray system provides reliable results for a wide range of dna rna analysis applications including single nucleotide polymorphism  or snp  genotyping detection of mutations  analysis of copy number variants and other structural genome variations  quantitative gene expression analysis  quantitative methylation marker analysis  comparative sequence analysis of haploid organisms  snp discovery  and oligonucleotide quality control 
these applications are provided through proprietary application software that operates on the massarray platform and through the purchase of consumable chips and reagent kits 
while the massarray system is versatile across many applications  it is a robust and cost effective genotyping solution for fine mapping projects enabled through our iplex multiplexing assay reagents and chips which permits multiplexed snp analysis using approximately the same amount of reagents and chip surface area as is used for a single sample analysis 
our research and development efforts in genetic analysis are committed to producing new and improved components and applications for the massarray system that deliver greater system versatility and excellent data quality at a competitive price per data point 
these research and development activities and new applications also facilitate and support our diagnostics initiatives 
we have targeted customers conducting quality genotyping and performing fine mapping studies  candidate gene studies  comparative sequencing  gene expression analysis  and epigenetic analysis in the molecular medicine market 
epigenetic analysis is an important part of cancer and other research areas 
dna methylation analysis is the most frequently studied epigenetic change  and examines changes in the presence or absence of methyl groups in specific areas of the dna 
we are targeting customers for our genetic analysis technology and products across four segments biomedical research and molecular medicine  oncology and translational research  clinical research  public health and biodefense  and agriculture and livestock 
we believe the market and opportunities for growth for fine mapping genotyping are increasing as more researchers are completing their larger genomic studies such as whole genome scans 
epigenetic analysis is an emerging market that  along with gene expression analysis  is increasingly being utilized by researchers in conjunction with genotyping to attempt to fully understand genetic cause and effect 
as of december   our revenues consisted of sales of massarray hardware  software  consumables  maintenance agreements  and from services contracts through our genetic analysis contract research services business 
the impact of our product offerings and contract research services business on future revenues  margins  expenses  and cash flows remains uncertain and depends on many factors as described in item a of this report under the caption risk factors 
we expect revenues from molecular diagnostics through out licensing and commercialization of our non invasive prenatal diagnostics technology  including technology for rhesus d incompatibility using a real 
table of contents time polymerase chain reaction platform  to be minimal for the foreseeable future 
to the extent that revenues are realized from our molecular diagnostic tests  including non invasive prenatal diagnostics technology or from our prior disease gene discoveries  if at all  they may fluctuate significantly as revenues will be based upon the occurrence of certain milestones  our reliance upon and the progress made by our collaborative partners  successful product development and commercialization  and product demand  all of which are uncertain and difficult to predict 
as a result  our entitlement to  and the timing and amounts of  any revenues from molecular diagnostic products licensing and milestone payments and royalty or revenue sharing payments on future diagnostic or other product sales are uncertain and difficult to predict 
to achieve such revenues we will likely be dependent upon the efforts  resources and success of present and future collaborators and licensees who may need to invest significant dollar amounts in research and development efforts  commercialization efforts  clinical trials  and obtaining regulatory approvals over several years 
such revenues  if any  are uncertain and also depend on many factors as described in item a of this report under the caption risk factors 
we have a history of recurring losses from operations and have an accumulated deficit of million as of december  our capital requirements to sustain operations  including research and development projects  have been and will continue to be significant 
as of december   we had available cash and cash equivalents and current marketable securities totaling million and working capital of million 
on july   we closed an underwritten public offering of our common stock totaling  shares of our common stock at per share  with the underwriters exercising their option to purchase an additional  shares on july  including the additional shares  the offering resulted in aggregate net proceeds of approximately million after deducting underwriting discounts  commissions and estimated transaction expenses 
during  we closed a million registered direct offering of our common stock to several new and existing investors  as well as a million private placement of our common stock 
under the terms of the registered direct offering we issued and sold  shares of our common stock at per share  with aggregate net proceeds of approximately million after deducting placement agents fees and transaction expenses 
under the terms of the private placement we issued and sold  shares of our common stock at per share  with aggregate net proceeds of approximately million after deducting placement agents fees and estimated transaction expenses 
critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires management to make estimates and assumptions in certain circumstances that affect amounts reported in the accompanying consolidated financial statements and related notes 
certain of these accounting policies that we believe are the most critical to our investors understanding of our financial results and conditions are discussed below 
our significant accounting policies are more fully described in note to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report 
in preparing these financial statements  management uses its judgment to determine the appropriate assumptions to be used in the determination of certain estimates 
management considers many factors in selecting appropriate financial accounting policies and controls and in developing the estimates and assumptions that are used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
management must apply significant judgment in this process 
the estimation process often may yield a range of potentially reasonable estimates of the ultimate future outcomes and management must select an assessment that falls within the range of reasonable estimates 
the application of these accounting policies involves the exercise of judgment and use of estimates and assumptions as to future uncertainties and  as a result  actual results could differ from these estimates 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue in accordance with current accounting rules  which primarily include the securities and exchange commission s staff accounting bulletin  or sab  no 
 revenue recognition sab 
in 
table of contents accordance with sab  revenues are recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  the price is fixed and determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
we consider emerging issues task force no 
 accounting for revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables  eitf and for massarray system sales  the arrangement consideration is allocated among the separate units of accounting based on their relative fair values 
the separate units of accounting are typically the system and software itself and maintenance contracts sold at the time of the system sale 
revenue is deferred for fees received before earned 
revenues from sales of consumables are recognized generally upon shipment and transfer of title to the customer 
revenue from sales of massarray systems with standard payment terms of net days are recognized upon shipment and transfer of title to the customer or when all revenue recognition criteria are met 
our contracts do not contain refund or cancellation clauses 
revenues from the sale or licensing of our proprietary software are recognized upon transfer of title to the customer or the duration of the software license 
we recognize revenue on maintenance services for ongoing customer support over the maintenance period 
revenues from genetic services are recognized at the completion of key stages in the performance of the service  which is generally delivery of snp assay information 
grant revenue is recorded as the research expenses relating to the grants are incurred  provided that the amounts received are not refundable if the research is not successful 
amounts received that are refundable if the research is not successful would be recorded as deferred revenue and recognized as revenue upon the grantor s acceptance of the success of the research results 
use of estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make certain estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
significant estimates are as follows accrued acquisition and integration costs 
to the extent that exact amounts were not determinable at the time of acquisition  we estimated amounts for direct costs of the acquisition of gemini genomics and axiom biotechnologies and the related integration costs in accordance with eitf  recognition of liabilities in connection with a purchase business combination and statement of financial accounting standards no 
 business combinations sfas 
amounts incurred relating to acquisition and integration costs totaled million and as of december  and  approximately million and million remained accrued  respectively 
the amount accrued at december   represents our remaining lease payments  net of estimated sublease income of million from existing subleased space 
if we do not receive all the amounts due to us under non cancelable subleases  we will incur additional expense 
goodwill and impairment of long lived assets 
the purchase price allocation for acquisitions requires extensive use of accounting estimates and judgments to allocate the purchase price to the identifiable tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their respective fair values 
additionally  we must determine whether an acquired entity is considered to be a business or a set of net assets  because a portion of the purchase price can only be allocated to goodwill in a business combination 
goodwill and intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives are not amortized  but are subject to annual impairment tests 
the amounts and useful lives assigned to other intangible assets impact future amortization 
determining the fair values and useful lives of intangible assets requires the use of estimates and the exercise of judgment 
these judgments can significantly affect our net operating results 
we periodically re evaluate the original assumptions and rationale utilized in the establishment of the carrying value and estimated lives of our long lived assets 
the criteria used for these evaluations include management s estimate of the asset s continuing ability to generate income from operations and 
table of contents positive cash flows in future periods as well as the strategic significance of any intangible assets in our business objectives 
if assets are considered to be impaired  the impairment recognized is the amount by which the carrying value of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets 
no impairment of long lived assets was recorded in  or intangible assets totaled million  net of accumulated amortization  at december  allowance for doubtful accounts 
we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
we evaluate the collectability of our accounts receivable balance based on a combination of factors 
we regularly analyze customer accounts  review the length of time receivables are outstanding and review the historical loss rates if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate additional allowances could be required 
reserves for obsolete and slow moving inventory 
we operate in an industry characterized by rapid improvements and changes to technology and products 
the introduction of new products by us or our competitors can result in our inventory being rendered obsolete or requiring us to sell items at a discount to cost 
we estimate the recoverability of our inventory by reference to our internal estimates of future demands and product life cycles 
if we incorrectly forecast demand for our products or inadequately manage the introduction of new product lines  we could materially impact our financial statements by having excess inventory on hand 
our future estimates are subjective and could be incorrect 
during  slow moving inventory reserves of million were charged against cost of goods sold and the total reserve was million at december  income taxes 
in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  sfas  the provision for income taxes is computed using the asset and liability method  under which deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities  and for the expected future tax benefit to be derived from tax loss and credit carryforwards 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined using the enacted tax rates in effect for the years in which those tax assets are expected to be realized 
a valuation allowance is established when it is more likely than not the future realization of all or some of the deferred tax assets will not be achieved 
the evaluation of the need for a valuation allowance is performed on a jurisdiction by jurisdiction basis  and includes a review of all available positive and negative evidence 
as of december   we have maintained a valuation allowance against us and foreign deferred tax assets that we concluded have not met the more likely than not threshold required under sfas due to the adoption of sfas no 
r share based payment  we recognize excess tax benefits associated with share based compensation to stockholders equity only when realized 
when assessing whether excess tax benefits relating to share based compensation have been realized  we follow the with and without approach  excluding any indirect effects of the excess tax deductions 
under this approach  excess tax benefits related to share based compensation are not deemed to be realized until after the utilization of all other tax benefits available to us 
effective january   we adopted fasb interpretation no 
fin  accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
 fin which clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in tax positions 
fin requires that we recognize the impact of a tax position in our financial statements only if that position is more likely than not of being sustained upon examination by taxing authorities  based on the technical merits of the position 
any interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions will be reflected in income tax expense 
stock based compensation 
we account for stock based compensation in accordance with sfas no 
r  share based payment  sfas r 
under the provisions of sfas r  stock based compensation cost is estimated at the grant date based on the award s fair value as calculated by the black scholes option valuation model bsm and is recognized as expense over the requisite service period 
the bsm model requires various highly judgmental assumptions including volatility  forfeiture rates  and expected option life 
if any of these assumptions used in the bsm model 
table of contents change significantly  stock based compensation expense may differ materially in the future from that recorded in the current period

 the hierarchy of generally accepted accounting principles sfas 
sfas identifies the sources of accounting principles and the framework for selecting the principles to be used in the preparation of financial statements that are presented in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states sfas was effective november  and the adoption of this pronouncement did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in april  the fasb issued fsp fas  determination of the useful life of intangible assets fsp 
fsp amends the factors that should be considered in developing renewal or extension assumptions used to determine the useful life of a recognized intangible asset under sfas this change is intended to improve the consistency between the useful life of a recognized intangible asset under sfas and the period of expected cash flows used to measure the fair value of the asset under sfas r and us gaap 
fsp is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after december  the requirements for determining useful lives must be applied prospectively to intangible assets acquired after the effective date and the disclosure requirements must be applied prospectively to all intangible assets recognized as of  and subsequent to  the effective date 
fsp could have a material impact on the useful life determination of any intangible asset acquisitions completed in future periods

sfas r also provides guidance for recognizing and measuring the goodwill acquired in the business combination and determines what information to disclose to enable users of the financial statements to evaluate the nature and financial effects of the business combination 
sfas r will become effective for fiscal years beginning after december  the impact of adopting sfas r on our consolidated financial statements will depend on the economic terms of any future business combination transactions 
on january   we adopted the provision sfas no

sfas allows certain financial assets and liabilities to be recognized  at our election  at fair market value  with any gains or losses for the period recorded in the statement of income 
sfas includes available for sales securities in the assets eligible for this treatment 
currently  we record the gains or losses for the period in comprehensive income and in the equity section of the balance sheet 
at this time  we have not elected to account for any available for sale securities using the provisions of sfas on january  we adopted eitf issue no 
 accounting for collaborative arrangements related to the development and commercialization of intellectual property eitf 
companies may enter into arrangements with other companies to jointly develop  manufacture  distribute  and market a product 
often the activities associated with these arrangements are conducted by the collaborators without the creation of a separate legal entity that is  the arrangement is operated as a virtual joint venture 
the arrangements generally provide that the collaborators will share  based on contractually defined calculations  the profits or losses from the associated activities 
periodically  the collaborators share financial information related to product revenues generated if any and costs incurred that may trigger a sharing payment for the combined profits or losses 
the consensus requires collaborators in such an arrangement to present the result of activities for which they act as the principal on a gross basis and report any payments received from made to other collaborators based on other applicable gaap or  in the absence of other applicable gaap  based on analogy to authoritative accounting literature or a reasonable  rational  and consistently applied accounting policy election 
since our collaborative arrangements do not incorporate such revenue and cost sharing arrangements  the adoption of eitf did not have an impact on our financial statements 
in june  the fasb ratified eitf no 
 accounting for nonrefundable advance payments for goods or services received for use in future research and development activities eitf 
eitf requires that nonrefundable advance payments for goods and services that will be used or rendered in future research and development activities pursuant to executory contractual arrangements be deferred and recognized as an expense in the period that the related goods are delivered or services are performed 
we adopted eitf as of january   and its adoption did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements

massarray and other product related revenues are derived from the sale of massarray systems  consumables  sales and licensing of our proprietary software  maintenance contracts  and license fees from end users 

table of contents consumable sales increased to million in from million in the increase in compared to was a result of an increase in our installed base of massarray compact systems as well as increased demand for our iplex genotyping assay 
massarray and other product related revenue increased to million in from million in the increase of million was primarily due to an increase in massarray system hardware and software revenue to million in from million in  which was attributable to an increase in our selling price during revenue from other product sales  including massarray system maintenance contracts  license fees and royalties for the years ended december  and was million and million  respectively 
maintenance revenue increased by approximately million from the comparative period due to higher service contracts in effect over our installed base

cost of service revenues were million and million and gross margins were and for the years ended december  and  respectively 
our genetic analysis contract research service business incurred higher expenses  primarily in salaries and related personnel expenses  as operations increased in scale to accommodate a higher volume of research contracts 
gross margins on contract research service revenues are dependent on the particular market the services are being performed  the size of the projects and the pricing terms 
our overall gross margins were and for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the increase in overall gross margin in is attributable to increased consumables sales at a higher gross margin  a higher average selling price for new system sales and higher margins in contract research services due to a higher volume of activity 
we believe that gross margin in future periods will be affected by  among other things  the selling price for systems and consumables  consumable sales per massarray system sold  the mix of products and contract research services sold  the mix of systems and consumables sold  competitive conditions  costs of goods  sales volumes  discounts offered  sales through distributors  payor contracts for diagnostics tests  the volume of

at december   we had an accrued balance of million in respect of the restructuring charges representing the remaining payout of severance costs with the remaining charges incurred during during  the company incurred no charges related to this restructuring and does not anticipate to incur any further expenses related to this cost reduction plan 
amortization of acquired intangibles in connection with the acquisition of gemini genomics  plc in  we acquired approximately million of intangible assets  including clinical data collections and patent rights that were being amortized over three to five years 
no amortization was recorded in and million was recorded as amortization in as of december   these intangible assets were fully amortized 
interest income interest income was million in compared to million in the increase in compared to was due to higher cash  cash equivalents and short term investment balances as a result of our registered direct offering of our common stock with net aggregate proceeds of approximately million after deducting placement agents fees and transaction expenses in april and the private placement of our common stock with net aggregate proceeds of approximately million after deducting placement agents fees and transaction expenses in october loss on marketable securities realized loss on marketable securities was million compared to no realized loss in the realized loss was due to an other than temporary impairment on one of our investments in auction rate securities 
if the credit ratings of the security issuers deteriorate or if uncertainties in these markets continue and any decline in 
table of contents market value is determined to be other than temporary in our remaining auction rate security investments  we would be required to adjust the carrying value of the investment through additional impairment charges 
interest expense interest expense was  and  for and  respectively 
our interest expense balance remains lower due to the payoff of credit facilities and capital leases after our private placement funding in june  offset by the utilization of our asset backed loan commencing in september income tax benefit the deferred tax benefit of million for the year ended december  was primarily due to the amortization on the intangible assets  including clinical data collections and patent rights  acquired from gemini genomics 
there was no comparable benefit for the year ended december  liquidity and capital resources as of december   cash  cash equivalents and current marketable securities totaled million  compared to million at december  our cash equivalents and current marketable securities are held in us government securities with ratings of aaa and repurchase agreements collateralized by us government securities with ratings of aaa 
as of december   we have million of auction rate securities  which reflects a million adjustment to the principal value of million 
additional discussion with respect to the risks and uncertainties associated with our auction rate securities is included in the risk factors in item a of this report  in quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk in item a of this report and in the notes to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report 
we have a history of recurring losses from operations and have an accumulated deficit of million as of december  our capital requirements to sustain operations  including research and development projects  have been and will continue to be significant 
as of december  and  we had working capital of million and million  respectively 
on july   we closed an underwritten public offering of our common stock totaling  shares of our common stock at per share  with the underwriters exercising their option to purchase an additional  shares on july  including the additional shares  the offering resulted in aggregate net proceeds of approximately million after deducting underwriting discounts  commissions and estimated transaction expenses 
during  we closed a million registered direct offering of our common stock to several new and existing investors  as well as a million private placement of our common stock 
under the terms of the registered direct offering we issued and sold  shares of our common stock at per share  with aggregate net proceeds of approximately million after deducting placement agents fees and transaction expenses 
under the terms of the private placement we issued and sold  shares of our common stock at per share  with aggregate net proceeds of approximately million after deducting placement agents fees and estimated transaction expenses 
we consider the material drivers of our cash flow to be sales volumes  working capital  inventory management and operating expenses 
our principal sources of liquidity are our cash  cash equivalents and current marketable securities 
cash used in operations for the year ended december  was million compared to million for the use of cash was primarily a result of the net loss of million for the year ended december   increased by million from inventory balances due to greater on hand 
table of contents systems for anticipated systems sales  million from accounts receivable  million from other current asset and prepaid expenses  as well as million in deferred rent 
cash usages were partially offset by stock based compensation of million  non cash depreciation and amortization of million  a recognized loss on our auction rate securities of million  adjustment to our bad debt provision resulting in an expense of million  restricted stock charges of million  a loss on disposals of fixed assets of million  million from higher accounts payable and accrued expense balances due to increased operations during  change in deferred revenue of million and other changes in our operating assets and liabilities of million 
at our current and anticipated level of operating loss  we expect to continue to incur an operating cash outflow for the next several years 
investing activities  other than the net changes in our current marketable securities and restricted cash that provided million  consists of purchases for capital equipment that used million in cash during the year ended december   compared to million and million for the same periods in and  respectively 
additionally  we paid million in cash related to our acquisition of cmm that closed in november net cash provided by financing activities was million during the year ended december  financing activities during the year ended december   included net receipts of million from the issuance of common stock from our july underwritten public offering 
additionally  million was received on fundings from our asset backed loan and million from the exercise of warrants  stock options and from employee contributions under our employee stock purchase plan  offset by approximately million in payments on our asset backed loan 
the following table summarized our contractual obligations as of december  in thousands contractual obligations total less than year years after years open purchase orders long term debt obligation collaborations operating leases total contractual obligations future operating lease commitments for leases have not been reduced by future minimum sublease rentals to be received through december aggregating million 
open purchase orders are primarily for inventory items and research and development supplies 
collaborations primarily consist of agreements with institutions to conduct sponsored research and clinical study agreements 
in september  we entered into an amendment to our lease for our corporate headquarters in san diego 
the lease amendment provides for the deferral of approximately million of the monthly rent payments by reducing the monthly payments through september  and increasing the aggregate monthly payments by the deferred amount for the remaining term of the lease  from october  to september  the total obligation under the lease remains unchanged 
the contractual obligation table above reflects the deferral of these rent payments 
long term debt obligations include the associated interest payable on this borrowing 
other commitments and contingencies that may result in contractual obligations to pay are described in the notes to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report 
based on our current plans  we believe our cash  cash equivalents and current marketable securities  will be sufficient to fund our operating expenses and capital requirements through however  the actual amount of 
table of contents funds that we will need will be determined by many factors  some of which are beyond our control  and we may need funds sooner than currently anticipated 
these factors include but are not limited to the size of our future operating losses  the level of our and our distributors success in selling our massarray products and services and ldt services through scmm  the terms and conditions of sales contracts  including extended payment terms  our ability to introduce and sell new products and services and successfully reduce inventory levels of earlier products  the level of our selling  general and administrative expenses  the extent of our investment in diagnostic technology  including prenatal genetic analysis technology  molecular diagnostics and noninvasive prenatal diagnostic technology  development  commercialization  and regulatory approval  our success in  and the expenses associated with  researching  developing and commercializing diagnostic products  alone or in collaboration with our partners  and obtaining any required regulatory approval for those products  the level of our success alone or in collaboration with our partners in launching and selling any diagnostic products and services  the extent of our research and development pursuits  including our level of investment in massarray product research and development  and diagnostic assay and other technology research and development  the extent to which we enter into  maintain  and derive revenues from licensing agreements  including agreements to out license our noninvasive prenatal analysis technology  research and other collaborations  joint ventures and other business arrangements  the level of our legal expenses  including those expenses associated with intellectual property protection and those expenses and any damages payments associated with litigation  including intellectual property litigation  the extent to which we acquire  and our success in integrating  technologies or companies  our ability to liquidate any ars holdings  the level of our expenses associated with the audit of our consolidated financial statements as well as compliance with other corporate governance and regulatory developments or initiatives  and regulatory changes and technological developments in our markets 
at december   we had outstanding stand by letters of credit with financial institutions totaling million related to our building and operating leases  which will remain in place until the expiration of our newton  massachusetts building lease agreement in december item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk marketable securities the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while at the same time maximizing the income we receive from our investments without significantly increasing risk 
some of the securities that we invest in may have market risk 
this means that a change in prevailing interest rates may cause the fair value of the principal amount of the investment to fluctuate 
for example  if we hold a security that was issued with a fixed interest rate at the then prevailing rate and interest rates later rise  the fair value of the principal amount of our investment will probably decline 
to minimize this risk in the future  we revised our 
table of contents investment policy in april to maintain our portfolio of cash equivalents and marketable securities in a variety of securities  including us government securities with ratings of aaa  and repurchase agreements collateralized by us government securities with ratings of aaa 
our investment policy includes a minimum quality rating for all new investments  as well as limits the amount of credit exposure to only issuances from the us government 
if an investment we hold falls below this level  we research the reasons for the fall and determine if we should continue to hold the investment in order to minimize our exposure to market risk of the investment 
we account for our marketable securities in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities  and originally classified these securities as available for sale 
consistent with our investment policy guidelines in effect when originally purchased  the auction rate security ars investments held by us all had aaa aa credit ratings at the time of purchase 
at december   million of principal was invested in ars 
the ars held are private placement securities with various long term nominal maturities with interest rates reset through a dutch auction each month  except for one ars that resets every days 
the monthly auctions historically have provided a liquid market for these securities 
the investments in ars represent interests in collateralized debt obligations supported by insurance securitizations and other structured credits  including corporate bonds and to a lesser degree  pools of residential and commercial mortgages 
with the liquidity issues experienced in global credit and capital markets  the ars held at december  have experienced multiple failed auctions as the amount of securities submitted for sale has exceeded the amount of purchase orders 
due to changes in the underlying assumptions utilized in our discounted cash flow analyses and that our holdings of ars are not required for operational purposes through  which allows time for the securities to return to full value  we have classified all ars investments as noncurrent assets on the consolidated balance sheet at december  of million 
although the ars continue to pay interest according to their stated terms  based on changes in assumptions and input from our valuation models and an analysis of other than temporary impairment factors  a recognized loss of approximately million and million was recorded for the years ended december  and  respectively  of which million represented the reclassification of previously recorded unrealized losses in other comprehensive income during and reflects the portion of ars holdings that we have concluded have an other than temporary decline in value 
the million and million impairment charges did not have a material impact on our liquidity or financial flexibility 
any future fluctuation in fair value related to our ars investments would be recorded as a charge to operations as appropriate 
since there is a lack of observable market quotes on our investment portfolio of marketable securities in ars  we utilize valuation models including those that are based on expected cash flow streams and collateral values  including assessments of counterparty credit quality  default risk underlying the security  discount rates and overall capital market liquidity 
the valuation of our investment portfolio is subject to uncertainties that are difficult to predict 
factors that may impact our valuation include changes to credit ratings of the securities as well as to the underlying assets supporting those securities  rates of default of the underlying assets  underlying collateral value  discount rates  counterparty risk and ongoing strength and quality of market credit and liquidity 
in the event we need to access the ars investments that are in an illiquid state  we will not be able to do so without the possible loss of principal  until a future auction for these investments is successful or they are redeemed by the issuer or they mature 
the market value of these securities may decline 
foreign currency rate fluctuations we have foreign subsidiaries whose functional currencies are the great british pound  or gbp  the japanese yen  or yen  and the euro  or eur 
the subsidiaries accounts are translated from the relevant functional currency to the us dollar using the current exchange rate in effect at the balance sheet date  for balance sheet accounts  and using the average exchange rate during the period for revenues and expense accounts 
the effects of translation are recorded as a separate component of stockholders equity 
our 
table of contents subsidiaries conduct their business with customers in local currencies 
additionally  we occasionally invoice australian customers in their local currency 
exchange gains and losses arising from these transactions are recorded using the actual exchange differences on the date of the transaction 
we have not taken any action to reduce our exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates  such as options or futures contracts  with respect to transactions with our subsidiaries or transactions with our customers where the invoicing currency is not the us dollar 
the table below sets forth our currency exposure ie  those transactional exposures that give rise to the net currency gains and losses recognized in the income and expenditure account on our net monetary assets and liabilities 
these exposures consist of our monetary assets and liabilities that are not denominated in the functional currency used by us or our subsidiary having the asset or liability 
functional currency of operations as of december  net foreign monetary assets liabilities aus dollars euro in millions usd a movement of in the us dollar to australian dollar exchange rate would create an unrealized gain or loss of approximately  a movement of in the us dollar to euro exchange rate would create an unrealized gain or loss of approximately  we had no off balance sheet  or unrecognized  gains and losses in respect of financial instruments used as hedges at the beginning or end of the year ended december  we had no deferred gains or losses during the years ended december   or inflation we do not believe that inflation has had a material adverse impact on our business or operating results during the periods presented
