item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion is included to describe our financial position and results of operations for each of the three years in the period ended april  the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto contain detailed information that should be referred to in conjunction with this discussion 
overview we are a clinical stage biopharmaceutical company that manufactures and develops monoclonal antibodies for the treatment of cancer and serious viral infections 
we are advancing three separate clinical programs with our first in class compounds bavituximab and cotara 
we are currently running four clinical trials using bavituximab for the treatment of solid tumors 
three of these clinical trials are phase ii trials evaluating bavituximab in combination with commonly prescribed chemotherapeutic drugs in patients with advanced breast or lung cancer 
our fourth active bavituximab oncology clinical trial is a phase i trial evaluating bavituximab alone in patients with advanced solid tumors that no longer respond to standard cancer treatments 
we are currently running two clinical trials using cotara for the treatment of glioblastoma multiforme  a deadly form of brain cancer  cotara is currently in a dose confirmation and dosimetry clinical trial and in a phase ii clinical trial 
in addition to our clinical programs  we are performing pre clinical research on bavituximab and an equivalent fully human antibody as a potential broad spectrum treatment for viral hemorrhagic fever infections under a contract awarded through the transformational medical technologies initiative tmti of the us department of defense s defense threat reduction agency dtra 
this federal contract is expected to provide us with up to million in funding over an initial month base period  with million having been appropriated through the current federal fiscal year ending september in addition to our research and development efforts  we operate a wholly owned cgmp current good manufacturing practices contract manufacturing subsidiary  avid bioservices  inc avid 
avid provides contract manufacturing services for biotechnology and biopharmaceutical companies on a fee for service basis  from pre clinical drug supplies up through commercial scale drug manufacture 
in addition to these activities  avid provides critical services in support of peregrine s product pipeline including manufacture and scale up of pre clinical and clinical drug supplies 
going concern our consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis  which contemplates the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business 
the financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability of the recorded assets or the classification of liabilities that may be necessary should it be determined that we are unable to continue as a going concern 
at april   we had  in cash and cash equivalents 
we have expended substantial funds on the research  development and clinical trials of our product candidates  and funding the operations of avid 
as a result  we have historically experienced negative cash flows from operations since our inception and we expect the negative cash flows from operations to continue for the foreseeable future 
our net losses incurred during the past three fiscal years ended april   and amounted to   and  respectively 
unless and until we are able to generate sufficient revenues from avid s contract manufacturing services and or from the sale and or licensing of our products under development  we expect such losses to continue for the foreseeable future 
therefore  our ability to continue our clinical trials and development efforts and to continue as a going concern is highly dependent on the amount of cash and cash equivalents on hand combined with our ability to raise additional capital to support our future operations 
we will need to raise additional capital through one or more methods  including but not limited to  issuing additional equity or debt  in order to support the costs of our research and development programs 
with respect to financing our operations through the issuance of equity  on march   we entered into an at market issuance sales agreement ami agreement with wm smith co  pursuant to which we may sell shares of our common stock through wm smith co  as agent  in registered transactions from our shelf registration statement on form s  file number  for aggregate gross proceeds of up to  shares of common stock sold under this arrangement were to be sold at market prices 
as of april   we had sold  shares of common stock under the ami agreement for aggregate net proceeds of  subsequent to april   we sold and additional  shares of common stock under the ami agreement for aggregate net proceeds of  after deducting commissions of paid to wm smith co 
as of june   we had raised the aggregate gross proceeds of  permitted under the ami agreement 
with respect to financing our operations through the issuance of debt  on december   we entered into a loan and security agreement pursuant to which we had the ability to borrow up to  loan agreement 
on december   we received initial funding of  in which principal and interest are payable over a thirty month period commencing after the initial six month interest only period 
the amount payable under the loan agreement is secured by generally all assets of the company as further explained in note to the consolidated financial statements 
under the loan agreement  we had an option  which expired june   to borrow a second tranche in the amount of  upon the satisfaction of certain clinical and financial conditions as set forth in the loan agreement 
although we had satisfied the required clinical and financial conditions by june   we determined that exercising the option to borrow the second tranche  and issuing the additional warrants to the lenders  was not in the best interest of the company or our stockholders 
in addition to the above  we may also raise additional capital through additional equity offerings or licensing our products or technology platforms or entering into similar collaborative arrangements 
in order to raise capital through the issuance of equity  we plan to file a new shelf registration statement on form s to register up to million in proceeds from the sale of our common stock 
although we are not required to issue any shares of common stock under this registration statement  we plan to register the underlying shares of common stock as a potential method of raising additional capital to support our drug development efforts 
while we will continue to consider and explore these potential opportunities  there can be no assurances that we will be successful in raising sufficient capital on terms acceptable to us  or at all  or that sufficient additional revenues will be generated from avid or under potential licensing or partnering agreements to complete the research  development  and clinical testing of our product candidates 
based on our current projections and assumptions  which include projected revenues under signed contracts with existing customers of avid  combined with the projected revenues from our government contract  we believe we have sufficient cash on hand combined with amounts expected to be received from avid customers and from our government contract to meet our obligations as they become due through at least fiscal year there are a number of uncertainties associated with our financial projections  including but not limited to  termination of third party or government contracts  technical challenges  or possible reductions in funding under our government contract  which could reduce or delay our future projected cash inflows 
in addition  under the loan agreement  in the event our government contract with the defense threat reduction agency is terminated or canceled for any reason  including reasons pertaining to budget cuts by the government or reduction in government funding for the program  we would be required to set aside cash and cash equivalents in an amount equal to of the outstanding loan balance in a restricted collateral account non accessible by us 
in the event our projected cash inflows are reduced or delayed or if we default on a loan covenant that limits our access to our available cash on hand  we might not have sufficient capital to operate our business through the fiscal year unless we raise additional capital 
the uncertainties surrounding our future cash inflows have raised substantial doubt regarding our ability to continue as a going concern 
results of operations the following table compares the consolidated statements of operations for the fiscal years ended april   and this table provides an overview of the changes in the statement of operations for the comparative periods  which changes are further discussed below 
years ended april  years ended april  change change revenues contract manufacturing government contract revenue license revenue total revenues cost and expenses cost of contract manufacturing research and development selling  general and administrative total cost and expenses loss from operations other income expense interest and other income interest and other expense net loss contract manufacturing revenue year ended april  compared to the year ended april  the increase in contract manufacturing revenue of  during the year ended april  compared to the prior year was primarily due to increases in both manufacturing and process development services provided by avid to unrelated entities on a fee for service basis including an increase in the number of completed manufacturing runs and the mix of completed manufacturing runs utilizing our larger capacity bioreactors compared to the prior year 
we expect to continue to generate contract manufacturing revenue during fiscal year based on the anticipated completion of in process customer related projects and the anticipated demand for avid s services under signed contracts and outstanding proposals 
year ended april  compared to the year ended april  the increase in contract manufacturing revenue of  during the year ended april  compared to fiscal year was primarily due to an increase in services provided by avid to unrelated entities on a fee for service basis associated with an increase in process development services including an increase in the number of completed manufacturing runs compared to the year ended april  government contract revenue year ended april  compared to the year ended april  the increase in government contract revenue of  during the year ended april  compared to the prior year is related to research and development services performed under our government contract with the defense threat reduction agency dtra  a division of the department of defense 
the contract was signed on june  and therefore  there was no corresponding revenue in the prior year 
the contract was awarded through the transformational medical technologies initiative tmti of the us department of defense s defense threat reduction agency dtra 
the purpose of the contract is to test and develop bavituximab and an equivalent fully human antibody as potential broad spectrum treatments for viral hemorrhagic fever infections 
we expect to continue to generate government contract revenue associated with our contract with the dtra 
the contract has an initial month base period with up to million in funding with million having been appropriated through the current federal fiscal year ending september  the contract also includes up to three one year option periods and aggregate funding under the contract is potentially worth up to million over the entire five year period 
subject to the progress of the program and budgetary considerations  the contact can be canceled by the dtra at any time 
cost of contract manufacturing year ended april  compared to the year ended april  the increase in cost of contract manufacturing of  during the year ended april  compared to the prior year was directly related to the current year increase in contract manufacturing revenue 
in addition  the cost of contract manufacturing as a percentage of contract manufacturing revenue improved from in fiscal year to in fiscal year  which was primarily due to an increase in contract manufacturing revenue combined with improved efficiencies in costs associated with contract manufacturing services and the mix of completed manufacturing runs from the utilization of our larger capacity bioreactors 
we expect to continue to incur contract manufacturing costs during fiscal year based on the anticipated completion of customer projects under our current contract manufacturing agreements 
year ended april  compared to the year ended april  the increase in cost of contract manufacturing of  during the year ended april  compared to fiscal year was directly related to the fiscal year increase in contract manufacturing revenue 
in addition  the cost of contract manufacturing as a percentage of contract manufacturing revenue improved from in fiscal year to in fiscal year  which was primarily due to an increase in contract manufacturing revenue combined with improved efficiencies in costs associated with manufacturing runs 
research and development expenses year ended april  compared to the year ended april  the increase in research and development r d expenses of  during the year ended april  compared to the prior year was primarily due to the following changes associated with each of our following platform technologies under development r d expenses fiscal year ended april  change technology platform anti ps bavituximab tnt cotara vta and anti angiogenesis agents vea total r d expenses o anti phosphatidylserine anti ps program bavituximab the increase in anti ps program expenses of  during the year ended april  compared to the prior year is primarily due to an increase in clinical trial expenses to support the advancement of four clinical trials using bavituximab for the treatment of solid tumors and one clinical trial for the treatment of hcv patients co infected with hiv 
patient enrollment for all three of our phase ii studies using bavituximab in combination with chemotherapy advanced to the second stage of our two stage phase ii study designs during fiscal year the increase in anti ps program expenses was further supplemented with an increase in r d expenses directly associated with increased efforts to advance the development of bavituximab and a fully human antibody as potential broad spectrum treatments for viral hemorrhagic fever infections under our federal contract with the us department of defense s defense threat reduction agency dtra  which was awarded to us on june  o tumor necrosis therapy tnt cotara the increase in tnt program expenses of  during the year ended april  compared to the prior year is primarily due to increases in clinical trial and payroll expenses to support the continued advancement of our two ongoing cotara clinical trials for the treatment of brain cancer 
o vascular targeting agents vtas and anti angiogenesis agents the decrease in vta and anti angiogenesis agents program expenses of  during the year ended april  compared to the prior year is primarily due to our efforts to significantly curtail our development expenses associated with this program while focusing our efforts on seeking partners to further advance these technologies 
o vasopermeation enhancements agents veas the decrease in vea program expenses of  during the year ended april  compared to the prior year is primarily due to our efforts to significantly curtail our development expenses associated with this program while focusing our efforts on seeking partners to further advance this technology 
during fiscal year  our rights to the vea technology expired in accordance with our license agreement 
based on our current projections  which includes estimated clinical trial enrollment rates that are always uncertain  we expect research and development expenses in fiscal year to increase in comparison to fiscal year as we expect to continue the advancement of our bavituximab and cotara clinical programs and the development of bavituximab as a potential broad spectrum treatment for viral hemorrhagic fever infections under our federal contract with the dtra 
during fiscal year  we expect to direct the majority of our research and development expenses towards our anti ps and tnt technology platforms 
year ended april  compared to the year ended april  the increase in research and development r d expenses of  during the year ended april  compared to the prior year was primarily due to an increase in expenses associated with each of our following platform technologies under development r d expenses fiscal year ended april  change technology platform anti ps bavituximab tnt cotara vta and anti angiogenesis agents vea total r d expenses o anti phosphatidylserine anti ps program bavituximab the increase in anti ps program expenses of  during the year ended april  compared to fiscal year is primarily due to increases in clinical trial and manufacturing expenses to support the advancement of four clinical trials using bavituximab for the treatment of solid tumors and one clinical trial for the treatment of hcv patients co infected with hiv 
during fiscal year  we submitted two separate phase ii clinical protocols  one to treat patients with non small cell lung cancer nsclc and one to treat patients with breast cancer  both of which received initial protocol approval in january in addition  we initiated and completed patient enrollment in the first part of our two stage phase ii study and treated patients with breast cancer using our product bavituximab in combination with chemotherapy 
these expenses were further supplemented by increases in pre clinical development expenses to support the possible expansion of bavituximab to treat other viral infections 
the foregoing increases in anti ps program expenses were offset by a decrease in non cash stock based compensation expense associated with shares of common stock earned by employees during fiscal year under a stock bonus plan  which expired in fiscal year o tumor necrosis therapy tnt cotara tnt program expenses remained in line with fiscal year and increased slightly by  as we continued our efforts to support the advancement of our two ongoing cotara clinical trials for the treatment of brain cancer 
o vascular targeting agents vtas and anti angiogenesis agents the increase in vta and anti angiogenesis agents program expenses of  during the year ended april  compared to fiscal year is primarily due to increases in manufacturing expenses as we developed a manufacturing process at a  liter scale for our anti angiogenesis product 
these increases in manufacturing expense were offset by decreases in pre clinical program expenses associated with our vta program 
although vta and anti angiogenesis program expenses increased overall compared to fiscal year  we have significantly curtailed these research efforts and are currently seeking partners to further advance these technologies 
o vasopermeation enhancements agents veas vea program expenses remained in line with fiscal year and decreased slightly by  as we have initiated efforts to significantly curtail our development expenses associated with this program and are focusing our efforts on seeking partners to further advance this technology 
looking beyond the next twelve months  it is extremely difficult for us to reasonably estimate all future research and development costs associated with each of our technologies due to the number of unknowns and uncertainties associated with pre clinical and clinical trial development 
these unknown variables and uncertainties include  but are not limited to the uncertainty of future clinical trial results  the uncertainty of the ultimate number of patients to be treated in any current or future clinical trial  the uncertainty of the us food and drug administration allowing our studies to move forward from phase i clinical studies to phase ii and phase iii clinical studies  the uncertainty of the rate at which patients are enrolled into any current or future study 
any delays in clinical trials could significantly increase the cost of the study and would extend the estimated completion dates  the uncertainty of terms related to potential future partnering or licensing arrangements  the uncertainty of protocol changes and modifications in the design of our clinical trial studies  which may increase or decrease our future costs  and the uncertainty of our ability to raise additional capital to support our future research and development efforts beyond fiscal year we or our potential partners will need to do additional development and clinical testing prior to seeking any regulatory approval for commercialization of our product candidates as all of our products are in discovery  pre clinical or clinical development 
testing  manufacturing  commercialization  advertising  promotion  exporting  and marketing  among other things  of our proposed products are subject to extensive regulation by governmental authorities in the united states and other countries 
the testing and approval process requires substantial time  effort  and financial resources  and we cannot guarantee that any approval will be granted on a timely basis  if at all 
companies in the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries have suffered significant setbacks in conducting advanced human clinical trials  even after obtaining promising results in earlier trials 
furthermore  the united states food and drug administration may suspend clinical trials at any time on various grounds  including a finding that the subjects or patients are being exposed to an unacceptable health risk 
even if regulatory approval of a product is granted  such approval may entail limitations on the indicated uses for which it may be marketed 
accordingly  we or our potential partners may experience difficulties and delays in obtaining necessary governmental clearances and approvals to market our products 
selling  general and administrative expenses year ended april  compared to the year ended april  selling  general and administrative expenses consist primarily of payroll and related expenses  director fees  legal and accounting fees  stock based compensation expense  investor and public relation fees  insurance  and other expenses relating to the general management  administration  and business development activities of the company 
the slight decline in selling  general and administrative expenses of  during the year ended april  compared to the prior year is primarily due to our efforts to curtail discretionary expenses 
the decrease in discretionary expenses were offset by an increase in legal fees associated with the lawsuit described in this annual report on form k under part i  item  legal proceedings  offset by an overall decrease in other general corporate matters 
year ended april  compared to the year ended april  the increase in selling  general and administrative expenses of  during the year ended april  compared to fiscal year is primarily due to increases in payroll and related expenses  corporate legal fees  and travel and related expenses 
the increase in payroll and related expenses was primarily due to an increase in headcount to support increased operations combined with an increase in consulting fees primarily associated with the expansion of our business development activities 
the increase in corporate legal fees compared to fiscal year was primarily related to a recently settled lawsuit described in this annual report on form k under part i  item  legal proceedings 
in addition  travel and related expenses increased compared to fiscal year primarily due to increased business development efforts in the us  europe and asia and increased participation in corporate and investor relation activities 
these increased costs were offset with a decrease in non cash stock based compensation expense associated with the amortization of the fair value of options granted to employees in accordance with the adoption of sfas no 
r and non cash expenses associated with shares of common stock earned by employees during fiscal year under a stock bonus plan  which expired in fiscal year interest and other income year ended april  compared to the year ended april  the decrease in interest and other income of  during the year ended april  compared to the prior year is primarily due to an  decrease in interest income as a result of a lower average cash balance on hand combined with lower prevailing interest rates during the current year compared to the prior year 
year ended april  compared to the year ended april  the decrease in interest and other income of  during the year ended april  compared to fiscal year is due to a  decrease in other income primarily associated with the sale of a trademark name in fiscal year combined with a  decrease in interest income primarily resulting from lower prevailing interest rates 
interest and other expense year ended april  compared to the year ended april  the increase in interest and other expense of  during the year ended april  compared to the prior year is due to a  increase in interest expense associated with the loan and security agreement we entered into during december combined with a  increase in non cash interest expense resulting from the amortization of the loan and security agreement discount associated with the fair value of detachable warrants and related debt issuance costs 
critical accounting policies the methods  estimates and judgments we use in applying our most critical accounting policies have a significant impact on the results we report in our consolidated financial statements 
we evaluate our estimates and judgments on an ongoing basis 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
our experience and assumptions form the basis for our judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may vary from what we anticipate and different assumptions or estimates about the future could change our reported results 
we believe the following accounting policies are the most critical to us  in that they are important to the portrayal of our financial statements and they require our most difficult  subjective or complex judgments in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements revenue recognition we currently derive revenue from contract manufacturing services provided by avid  from licensing agreements associated with peregrine s technologies under development  and from services performed under a government contract awarded to peregrine through the transformational medical technologies initiative tmti of the us department of defense s defense threat reduction agency dtra that was signed on june  we recognize revenue pursuant to the sec s staff accounting bulletin no 
sab no 
 revenue recognition 
in accordance with sab no 
 revenue is generally realized or realizable and earned when i persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  ii delivery or passage of title has occurred or services have been rendered  iii the seller s price to the buyer is fixed or determinable  and iv collectibility is reasonably assured 
we also comply with financial accounting standards board s emerging issues task force no 
eitf  revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables 
in accordance with eitf  we recognize revenue for delivered elements only when the delivered element has stand alone value and we have objective and reliable evidence of fair value for each undelivered element 
if the fair value of any undelivered element included in a multiple element arrangement cannot be objectively determined  revenue is deferred until all elements are delivered and services have been performed  or until fair value can objectively be determined for any remaining undelivered elements 
in addition  we also follow the guidance of the emerging issues task force issue no 
eitf  reporting revenue gross as a principal versus net as an agent 
pursuant to eitf  for transactions in which we act as a principal  have discretion to choose suppliers  bear credit risk and performs a substantive part of the services  revenue is recorded at the gross amount billed to a customer and costs associated with these reimbursements are reflected as a component of cost of sales for contract manufacturing services or research and development expense for services provided under our contract with the dtra 
revenue associated with contract manufacturing services provided by avid are recognized once the service has been rendered and or upon shipment or passage of title of the product to the customer 
on occasion  we recognize revenue on a bill and hold basis 
under bill and hold arrangements  revenue is recognized in accordance with the bill and hold requirements under sab no 
once the product is complete and ready for shipment  title and risk of loss has passed to the customer  management receives a written request from the customer for bill and hold treatment  the product is segregated from other inventory  and no further performance obligations exist 
any amounts received prior to satisfying our revenue recognition criteria are recorded as deferred revenue in the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
we also record a provision for estimated contract losses  if any  in the period in which they are determined 
license revenue primarily consists of annual license fees paid under one license agreement 
annual license fees are recognized as revenue on the anniversary date of the agreement in accordance with the criteria under sab no 
we deem service to have been rendered if no continuing obligation exists 
our contract with the dtra is a cost plus fixed fee contract whereby we recognize government contract revenue in accordance with the revenue recognition criteria noted above and in accordance with accounting research bulletin no 
 chapter  government contracts 
reimbursable costs under the contract primarily include direct labor  subcontract costs  materials  equipment  travel  indirect costs  and a fixed fee for our efforts 
revenue under this cost plus fixed fee contract is generally recognized as we perform the underlying research and development activities 
however  progress billings and or payments associated with services that are billed and or received in a manner that is not consistent with the timing of when services are performed are classified as deferred government contract revenue in the accompanying consolidated financial statements and are recognized as revenue upon satisfying our revenue recognition criteria 
share based compensation expense we currently maintain four equity compensation plans which provide for the granting of options to our employees to purchase shares of our common stock at exercise prices not less than the fair market value of our common stock at the date of grant 
the granting of options are share based payments and are subject to the fair value recognition provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 
r sfas no 
r  share based payment revised  which requires the recognition of compensation expense  using a fair value based method  for costs related to all share based payments including grants of employee stock options 
the fair value of each option grant is estimated using the black scholes option valuation model and are amortized as compensation expense on a straight line basis over the requisite service periods of the awards  which is generally the vesting period typically to years 
use of a valuation model requires us to make certain estimates and assumptions with respect to selected model inputs 
expected volatility is based on daily historical volatility of our stock covering the estimated expected term 
the expected term of options reflects actual historical exercise activity and assumptions regarding future exercise activity of unexercised  outstanding options 
the risk free interest rate is based on us treasury notes with terms within the contractual life of the option at the time of grant 
in addition  sfas no 
r requires forfeitures to be estimated at the time of grant and revised  if necessary  in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates 
if factors change and we employ different assumptions in the application of sfas no 
r in future periods  the share based compensation expense that we record under sfas no 
r may differ significantly from what we have recorded in the current period 
there are a number of factors that affect the amount of share based compensation expense  including the number of employee options granted during subsequent fiscal years  the price of our common stock on the date of grant  the volatility of our stock price  the estimate of the expected life of options granted and the risk free interest rates 
our loss from operations for fiscal years ended april   and included share based compensation expenses of   and  respectively  associated with grants of employee stock options 
as of april   the total estimated unrecognized compensation cost related to non vested employee stock options was  this cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of years 
allowance for doubtful accounts we continually monitor our allowance for doubtful accounts for all receivables 
a considerable amount of judgment is required in assessing the ultimate realization of these receivables and we estimate an allowance for doubtful accounts based on these factors at that point in time 
with respect to our trade and other receivables  we determined no allowance for doubtful accounts was necessary based on our analysis as of april  amounts billed under our contract with transformational medical technologies initiative tmti of the us department of defense s defense threat reduction agency dtra include reimbursement for provisional rates covering allowable indirect overhead and general and administrative cost indirect rates 
these indirect rates are initially estimated based on financial projections and are subject to change based on actual costs incurred during each fiscal year 
in addition  these indirect rates are subject to annual audits by the defense contract audit agency dcaa for cost reimbursable type contracts 
as of april   we recorded an unbilled receivable of  pertaining to the calculated difference between estimated and actual indirect rates for fiscal year as of april   we determined it appropriate to record a corresponding allowance for doubtful account in the amount of  due to the uncertainty of its collectability given that our actual indirect rates have not been audited by the dcaa since we signed the contract on june  fair value measurements on may   we adopted the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas no 
 fair value measurements  which defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value under gaap  and expands disclosures about fair value measurements 
sfas no 
establishes a three level hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs used to measure fair value 
the hierarchy defines the three levels of inputs to measure fair value  as follows level quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities 
level observable inputs other than quoted prices included in level  such as assets or liabilities whose value are based on quoted market prices in markets where trading occurs infrequently or whose values are based on quoted prices of instruments with similar attributes in active markets 
level unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and significant to the overall fair value measurement 
the adoption of sfas no 
did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements as we currently do not have any level or level financial assets or liabilities 
the carrying amounts of our short term financial instruments  which include cash and cash equivalents  accounts receivable  accounts payable  and accrued liabilities approximate their fair values due to their short maturities 
the fair value of our note payable is estimated based on the quoted prices for the same or similar issues or on the current rates offered to us for debt of the same remaining maturities 
liquidity and capital resources at april   we had  in cash and cash equivalents 
we have expended substantial funds on the research  development and clinical trials of our product candidates  and funding the operations of avid 
as a result  we have historically experienced negative cash flows from operations since our inception and we expect to continue to experience negative cash flows from operations for the foreseeable future 
our net losses incurred during the past three fiscal years ended april   and amounted to   and  respectively 
unless and until we are able to generate sufficient revenues from avid s contract manufacturing services and or from the sale and or licensing of our products under development  we expect such losses to continue for the foreseeable future 
therefore  our ability to continue our clinical trials and development efforts is highly dependent on the amount of cash and cash equivalents on hand combined with our ability to raise additional capital to support our future operations 
as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements  there exists substantial doubt regarding our ability to continue as a going concern 
we will need to raise additional capital through one or more methods  including but not limited to  issuing additional equity or debt  in order to support the costs of our research and development programs 
with respect to financing our operations through the issuance of equity  on march   we entered into an at market issuance sales agreement ami agreement with wm smith co  pursuant to which we may sell shares of our common stock through wm smith co  as agent  in registered transactions from our shelf registration statement on form s  file number  for aggregate gross proceeds of up to  shares of common stock sold under this arrangement were to be sold at market prices 
as of april   we had sold  shares of common stock under the ami agreement for aggregate net proceeds of  subsequent to april   we sold and additional  shares of common stock under the ami agreement for aggregate net proceeds of  after deducting commissions of paid to wm smith co 
as of june   we had raised the aggregate gross proceeds of  as permitted under the ami agreement 
with respect to financing our operations through the issuance of debt  on december   we entered into a loan and security agreement pursuant to which we had the ability to borrow up to  loan agreement 
on december   we received initial funding of  in which principal and interest are payable over a thirty month period commencing after the initial six month interest only period 
the amount payable under the loan agreement is secured by generally all assets of the company as further explained in note to the consolidated financial statements 
under the loan agreement  we had an option  which expired june   to borrow a second tranche in the amount of  upon the satisfaction of certain clinical and financial conditions as set forth in the loan agreement 
although we had satisfied the required clinical and financial conditions by june   we determined that exercising the option to borrow the second tranche  and issuing the additional warrants to the lenders  was not in the best interest of the company or our stockholders 
in addition to the above  we may also raise additional capital through additional equity offerings or licensing our products or technology platforms or entering into similar collaborative arrangements 
in order to raise additional capital through the issuance of equity  we plan to file a new shelf registration statement on form s to register up to million in proceeds from the sale of our common stock 
although we are not required to issue any shares of common stock under this registration statement  we plan to register the underlying shares of common stock as a potential method of raising additional capital to support our drug development efforts 
while we will continue to consider and explore these potential opportunities  there can be no assurances that we will be successful in raising sufficient capital on terms acceptable to us  or at all  or that sufficient additional revenues will be generated from avid or under potential licensing or partnering agreements to complete the research  development  and clinical testing of our product candidates 
based on our current projections and assumptions  which include projected revenues under signed contracts with existing customers of avid  combined with the projected revenues from our government contract  we believe we have sufficient cash on hand combined with amounts expected to be received from avid customers and from our government contract to meet our obligations as they become due through at least fiscal year there are a number of uncertainties associated with our financial projections  including but not limited to  termination of third party or government contracts  technical challenges  or possible reductions in funding under our government contract  which could reduce or delay our future projected cash inflows 
in addition  under the loan agreement  in the event our government contract with the defense threat reduction agency is terminated or canceled for any reason  including reasons pertaining to budget cuts by the government or reduction in government funding for the program  we would be required to set aside cash and cash equivalents in an amount equal to of the outstanding loan balance in a restricted collateral account non accessible by us 
in the event our projected cash inflows are reduced or delayed or if we default on a loan covenant that limits our access to our available cash on hand  we might not have sufficient capital to operate our business through the fiscal year unless we raise additional capital 
the uncertainties surrounding our future cash inflows have raised substantial doubt regarding our ability to continue as a going concern 
significant components of the changes in cash flows from operating  investing  and financing activities for the year ended april  compared to the prior year are as follows cash used in operating activities 
cash used in operating activities is primarily driven by changes in our net loss 
however  cash used in operating activities generally differs from our reported net loss as a result of non cash operating expenses or differences in the timing of cash flows as reflected in the changes in operating assets and liabilities 
during the year ended april   cash used in operating activities decreased  to  compared to  for the year ended april  this decrease in cash used in operating activities was primarily due to a decrease of  in net loss reported during fiscal year after taking into consideration non cash operating expenses 
this amount was supplemented by a net change in operating assets and payment or reduction of liabilities in the aggregate amount of  the decrease in our fiscal year net loss was primarily due to current period increases in contract manufacturing revenue and government contract revenue offset by an increase in the cost of contract manufacturing

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk changes in united states interest rates would affect the interest earned on our cash and cash equivalents and interest expense on our outstanding notes payable  however  they would not have an affect on our capital leases  which have fixed interest rates and terms 
based on our overall cash and cash equivalents interest rate exposure at april   a near term change in interest rates  based on historical movements  would not have a material adverse effect on our financial position or results of operations 
at april   we had an outstanding notes payable balance of  under a loan and security agreement  which bear interest at a monthly variable rate equal to the then current thirty day libor rate set at a floor of plus  which may expose us to market risk due to changes in interest rates 
however  based on current libor interest rates  which are currently under the minimum floor set at under our loan and security agreement and based on historical movements in libor rates  we believe a near term change in interest rates would not have a material adverse effect on our financial position or results of operations
