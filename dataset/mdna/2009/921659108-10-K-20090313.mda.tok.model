item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations you should read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations together with selected consolidated financial data and our consolidated financial statements and related notes appearing at the end of this annual report on form k 
some of the information contained in this discussion and analysis or set forth elsewhere in this annual report on form k include historical information and other information with respect to our plans and strategy for our business and contain forward looking statements that involve risk  uncertainties and assumptions 
our actual results may differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of certain factors  including but not limited to those set forth under the risk factors section of this report and elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
overview we are a biopharmaceutical company focused on the development and commercialization of clinical stage product candidates for central nervous system disorders  with exclusive worldwide commercial rights to two product candidates in clinical development 
our lead product candidate  iloperidone  is a compound for the treatment of schizophrenia 
on november   the united states food and drug administration fda accepted our new drug application nda for iloperidone in schizophrenia 
in july  we announced that the fda had determined that our nda was not approvable and indicated  among other things  that we would have to conduct additional studies and submit that data before the fda would approve iloperidone for commercial sale for the treatment of schizophrenia 
in september  we met with the fda to discuss the fda s determination 
the fda asked us to provide a complete response to the not approvable letter  which we submitted on november  the fda accepted the complete response for review and has set a new target action date of may  there are no guarantees that the fda will provide its response by may   nor can there be any assurances that any such response will be favorable 
pending the fda s reply to our complete response  we have suspended all non essential iloperidone related activities 
our second product candidate  tasimelteon is a compound for the treatment of sleep and mood disorders 
in november  we announced positive top line results from our phase iii trial of tasimelteon in transient insomnia 
in june  the company announced positive top line results from the phase iii trial of tasimelteon in chronic primary insomnia 
tasimelteon is also ready for phase ii trials for the treatment of depression 
we will have to conduct additional phase iii trials for tasimelteon in chronic sleep disorders prior to our filing of an nda for tasimelteon 
assuming successful outcomes of our clinical trials and approval by the fda  we expect to commercialize iloperidone with our own sales force and or commercial partners in the united states  and to seek partners for commercialization of the compound outside of the united states 
given the range of potential indications for tasimelteon  we intend to pursue one or more partnerships for the development and commercialization of tasimelteon worldwide 
we are a development stage enterprise and have accumulated net losses of approximately million since the inception of our operations through december  we have no product revenues to date and have no approved products for sale 
since we began our operations in march  we have devoted substantially all of our resources to the in licensing and clinical development of our product candidates 
our future operating results will depend largely on our ability to successfully develop and commercialize our lead product candidate  iloperidone  and on the progress of other product candidates currently in our research and development pipeline 
the results of our operations will vary significantly from year to year and quarter to quarter and depend on a number of factors  including risks related to our business  risks related to our industry  and other risks which are detailed in item a of part i of this report  entitled risk factors 
we completed our initial public offering in april the offering totaled  shares of common stock at a public offering price of  resulting in net proceeds to the company of approximately million  after deducting underwriters discounts and commissions as well as offering expenses 
upon completion of the initial public offering  all shares of the company s series a preferred stock and series b preferred stock were converted into an aggregate of  shares of common stock 

table of contents in january we completed our follow on offering  consisting of  shares of common stock at a public offering price of per share  resulting in net proceeds to the company of approximately million after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and offering expenses 
our activities will necessitate significant uses of working capital for the foreseeable future 
our capital requirements will depend on many factors  including the success of our research and development efforts  the satisfaction of certain regulatory requirements  payments received under contractual agreements with other parties  if any  and the status of competitive products 
however  given the receipt of the not approvable letter from the fda with respect to the nda for iloperidone  and that any additional studies required by the fda prior to its approval of iloperidone would require significant capital in excess of our currently available resources  we are now operating under a reduced spending plan 
on december   we committed to a plan of termination that resulted in a work force reduction of employees  including two officers  in order to reduce operating costs 
as of december   the company employed full time employees 
this represents approximately a decrease from the employees the company had on august  we believe that  if we continue to operate under our reduced spending plan  our existing cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities will be sufficient to fund operations at least through the second quarter in budgeting for our activities  we have relied on a number of assumptions  including assumptions that we will not conduct any additional clinical trials for either of the oral or injectable formulations of iloperidone  that we will not engage in any further commercial activities related to iloperidone  that we will not engage in further in licensing activities  that we will not receive any proceeds from potential partnerships  that we will not conduct additional trials for tasimelteon  that we will be able to retain our key personnel  that we will continue to seek fda approval of iloperidone  that we will continue to evaluate clinical and pre clinical compounds for potential development  and that we will not incur any significant contingent liabilities 
we may need to raise additional funds if one or more of our assumptions proves to be incorrect or if we choose to resume our commercialization efforts with respect to iloperidone  expand our product development efforts  conduct additional clinical trials for one or more of our product candidates or seek to acquire additional product candidates  and we may decide to raise additional funds even before they are needed if the conditions for raising capital are favorable 
in our capital raising efforts  we may seek to sell additional equity or debt securities or obtain a bank credit facility 
the sale of additional equity or debt securities  if convertible  could result in dilution to our stockholders 
the incurrence of indebtedness would result in increased fixed obligations and could also result in covenants that would restrict our operations 
however  we may not be able to raise additional funds on acceptable terms  or at all 
given the current global economic climate  we may have more difficulty raising funds than we would during a period of economic stability 
if we are unable to secure sufficient capital to fund our research and development activities  we may not be able to continue operations  or we may have to enter into collaboration agreements that could require us to share commercial rights to our products to a greater extent or at earlier stages in the drug development process than is currently intended 
these collaborations  if consummated prior to proof of efficacy or safety of a given product candidate  could impair our ability to realize value from that product candidate 
iloperidone 
iloperidone is our product candidate under development to treat schizophrenia 
we submitted an nda for iloperidone for the treatment of schizophrenia to the fda on september  and on november   the fda accepted our nda 
the application included data from clinical trials and more than  patients treated with iloperidone and also contained pharmacogenetic data aimed to further improve the benefit risk profile of iloperidone in the treatment of patients with schizophrenia 
in july  we announced that the fda had determined that our nda was not approvable and indicated  among other things  that we would have to conduct additional studies and submit that data before the fda would approve iloperidone for commercial sale for the treatment of schizophrenia 
performance and completion of these additional studies will require years of testing and  even if positive results are achieved  may not result in the fda s approval of iloperidone 
in september  we met with the fda to discuss the fda s determination 
the fda asked us to provide a complete response to the not approvable letter  which we submitted on november  the fda accepted the complete response for review and has set a new target action date of may  there are no guarantees that the fda will provide its response by may   nor can there 
table of contents be any assurances that any such response will be favorable 
pending the fda s reply to our complete response  we have suspended all non essential iloperidone related activities 
from inception to december  we incurred approximately million in research and development costs directly attributable to our development of iloperidone  including a million milestone license fee paid to novartis in upon the acceptance of our nda 
we are also developing a week injectable formulation for iloperidone  for which we already have early phase ii data from a study previously conducted by novartis 
we have completed essential manufacturing activities and intend to conduct additional clinical trials if and when  we receive following fda approval of the oral dose formulation for iloperidone 
if the fda approves the oral formulation of iloperidone  we intend to resume the development of the injectable formulation and we believe we will need to conduct additional trials with this formulation to be able to file for fda approval 
tasimelteon 
tasimelteon is our product candidate under development to treat sleep and mood disorders 
tasimelteon is a melatonin receptor agonist that works by adjusting the human body clock of circadian rhythm 
tasimelteon has successfully completed a phase iii trial for the treatment of transient insomnia in november in june  we announced positive top line results from the phase iii trial of tasimelteon in chronic primary insomnia 
the trial was a randomized  double blind  and placebo controlled study with patients 
the trial measured time to fall asleep and sleep maintenance  as well as next day performance 
we will have to conduct additional trials prior to our filing of an nda for tasimelteon to treat sleep disorders 
tasimelteon is also ready for phase ii trials for the treatment of depression 
from inception to december   we incurred approximately million in direct research and development costs directly attributable to our development of tasimelteon  including a million milestone license fee paid to bms in upon the initiation of our phase iii program 
vsf on november   we received written notice from novartis that our license agreement with respect to vsf had terminated in accordance with its terms as a result of our failure to satisfy a specific development milestone within the time period specified in the license agreement 
as a result  we no longer have any rights with respect to vsf and novartis has a non exclusive worldwide license to all information and intellectual property generated by us or on our behalf related to our development of vsf we are currently evaluating any options that we may have with respect to vsf  which may include the possibility of entering into a new license agreement or other arrangement with novartis to allow us to resume our development of vsf  however  there can be no assurance that we will be able to enter into such an agreement or arrangement on acceptable terms  or at all 
from inception to december   we incurred approximately million in research and development costs directly attributable to our development of vsf  including a milestone license fee of million paid to novartis upon the initiation of our first phase ii clinical trial in march of revenues 
we generated some revenue during the period from march  inception to december  and during the year ended december  under research and development contracts that were derived principally from consulting agreements we entered into during our start up phase to defray research costs 
we completed our obligations during those periods under these agreements and no longer seek such arrangements 
we have not generated any other operating revenue since our inception 
any revenue that we may receive in the near future is expected to consist primarily of license fees  milestone payments and research and development reimbursement payments to be received from potential partners 
if our development efforts result in clinical success  regulatory approval and successful commercialization of our products  we could generate revenue from sales of our products and from receipt of royalties on sales of licensed products 
research and development expenses 
our research and development expenses consist primarily of fees paid to third party professional service providers in connection with the services they provide for our clinical trials  costs of contract manufacturing services  costs of materials used in clinical trials and research and development  costs for regulatory consultants and filings  depreciation of capital resources used to develop our 
table of contents products  all related facilities costs  and salaries  benefits and stock based compensation expenses related to our research and development personnel 
we expense research and development costs as incurred  including payments made to date under our license agreements 
we believe that significant investment in product development is a competitive necessity and plan to continue these investments in order to realize the potential of our product candidates and pharmacogenetics and pharmacogenomics expertise 
from inception through december   we incurred research and development expenses in the aggregate of approximately million  including stock based compensation expenses of approximately million 
we expect our research and development expenses to increase as we continue to develop our product candidates 
we also expect to incur licensing costs in the future that could be substantial  as we continue our efforts to develop our product candidates and to evaluate potential in license product candidates 
the following table summarizes our product development initiatives for the years ended december  to december  and the period from march  inception to december  and for the period from march  inception to december  included in the following table are the research and development expenses recognized in connection with our product candidates in clinical development 
included in other product candidates are the costs directly related to research initiatives for all other product candidates

we record direct costs  including personnel costs and related benefits and stock based compensation  on a project by project basis 
we record indirect costs that support a number of our research and development activities in the aggregate 
in  there were no active development programs in process for our product candidates listed in the table 
in  all facility related costs were allocated to general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and other related costs for personnel  including stock based compensation  serving executive  finance  accounting  information technology  marketing and human resource functions 
other costs include facility costs not otherwise included in research and development expenses and fees for legal  accounting and other professional services 
we expect our general and administrative expenses to decrease in as we operate under a reduced spending plan pending a response from the fda to our complete response to the not approvable letter related to iloperidone 
from inception through december   we incurred general and 
table of contents administrative expenses in the aggregate of approximately million  including stock based compensation expenses of approximately million 
interest and other income  net 
interest income consists of interest earned on our cash and cash equivalents  marketable securities and restricted cash 
interest expense consists of interest incurred on equipment debt 
critical accounting policies the preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our financial statements  as well as the reported revenues and expenses during the reported periods 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
our significant accounting policies are described in the notes to our audited consolidated financial statements for the year ended december  included in this annual report on form k 
however  we believe that the following accounting policies are important to understanding and evaluating our reported financial results  and we have accordingly included them in this discussion 
accrued expenses 
as part of the process of preparing financial statements we are required to estimate accrued expenses 
the estimation of accrued expenses involves identifying services that have been performed on our behalf  and then estimating the level of service performed and the associated cost incurred for such services as of each balance sheet date in the financial statements 
accrued expenses include professional service fees  such as lawyers and accountants  contract service fees  such as those under contracts with clinical monitors  data management organizations and investigators in conjunction with clinical trials  fees to contract manufacturers in conjunction with the production of clinical materials  and fees for marketing and other commercialization activities 
pursuant to our assessment of the services that have been performed on clinical trials and other contracts  we recognize these expenses as the services are provided 
our assessments include  but are not limited to an evaluation by the project manager of the work that has been completed during the period  measurement of progress prepared internally and or provided by the third party service provider  analyses of data that justify the progress  and management s judgment 
in the event that we do not identify certain costs that have begun to be incurred or we under or over estimate the level of services performed or the costs of such services  our reported expenses for such period would be too low or too high 
stock based compensation 
we adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 
r  share based payment  sfas r on january  using the modified prospective transition method of implementation and adopted the accelerated attribution method 
prior to january  we followed apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees apb  and related interpretations  in accounting for our stock based compensation plans  rather than the alternative fair value accounting method provided for under sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation 
we currently use the black scholes merton option pricing model to determine the fair value of stock options 
the determination of the fair value of stock options on the date of grant using an option pricing model is affected by our stock price as well as assumptions regarding a number of complex and subjective variables 
these variables include the expected stock price volatility over the expected term of the awards  actual and projected employee stock option exercise behaviors  risk free interest rate and expected dividends 
expected volatility rates are based on historical volatility of the common stock of comparable entities and other factors due to the lack of historic information of the company s publicly traded common stock 
the expected term of options granted is based on the transition approach provided by staff accounting bulletin sab no 
as the options meet the plain vanilla criteria required by this method 
the risk free interest rates are based on the us treasury yield for a period consistent with the expected term of the option in effect at the time of the grant 
we have not paid dividends to our stockholders since the inception and do not plan to pay dividends in the foreseeable future 
the stock based compensation expense for a period is also 
table of contents affected by expected forfeiture rate for the respective option grants 
if our estimates of the fair value of these equity instruments or expected forfeitures are too high or too low  it would have the effect of overstating or understating expenses 
total stock based compensation expense  related to all of the company s stock based awards  recognized under sfas r for the years ended december    and recognized for the period from march  inception to december   was comprised of the following period from march  inception to year ended december  december  research and development general and administrative total stock based compensation expense recent accounting pronouncements in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
r  a revision of sfas no 
 business combinations 
the revision is intended to simplify existing guidance and converge rulemaking under us generally accepted accounting principles with international accounting standards 
this statement applies prospectively to business combinations where the acquisition date is on or after the beginning of the first annual reporting period beginning on or after december  early adoption is prohibited 
the implementation of this standard will not have a material impact on our consolidated financial position and results of operations 
in june  the fasb issued fsp eitf  determining whether instruments granted in share based payment transactions are participating securities fsp eitf 
fsp eitf clarified that all outstanding unvested share based payment awards that contain rights to nonforfeitable dividends participate in undistributed earnings with common shareholders 
awards of this nature are considered participating securities and the two class method of computing basic and diluted earnings per share must be applied 
fsp eitf is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  the implementation of this standard will not have a material impact on our consolidated financial position and results of operations 
in november  the fasb ratified eitf issue no 
 equity method investment accounting considerations eitf 
eitf addresses a number of matters associated with the impact of sfas no 
r and sfas no 
on the accounting for equity method investments including initial recognition and measurement and subsequent measurement issues 
eitf is effective  on a prospective basis  for fiscal years beginning after december  and interim periods within those fiscal years 
the implementation of this standard will not have a material impact on our consolidated financial position and results of operations 
results of operations we have a limited history of operations 
we anticipate that our results of operations will fluctuate for the foreseeable future due to several factors  including any possible payments made or received pursuant to licensing or collaboration agreements  progress of our research and development efforts  and the timing and outcome of clinical trials and related possible regulatory approvals 
our limited operating history makes predictions of future operations difficult or impossible 
since our inception  we have incurred significant losses 
as of december   we had a deficit accumulated during the development stage of approximately million 
we anticipate incurring additional losses for the foreseeable future  and these losses may be incurred at increasing rates

 fair value measurements sfas 
sfas defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value in accordance with gaap  and expands disclosures about fair value measurements 
in february  the fasb agreed to delay the effective date of sfas for all nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities  except those that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis  to fiscal years beginning after november  the company has adopted the provisions of sfas as of january   for financial instruments 
although the adoption of sfas did not materially impact its financial condition  results of operations  or cash flow  the company is now required to provide additional disclosures as part of its financial statements

sfas establishes a three tier fair value hierarchy  which prioritizes the inputs used in measuring fair value 
these tiers include level defined as observable inputs such as quoted prices in active markets level defined as inputs other than quoted prices in active markets that are either directly or indirectly observable level defined as unobservable inputs in which little or no market data exists  therefore requiring an entity to develop its own assumptions

based on our current operating plans  we believe that our existing cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities will be sufficient to meet our anticipated operating needs through the second quarter of  and after that time we will require additional capital 
in budgeting for our activities  we have relied on a number of assumptions  including assumptions that we will not conduct any additional clinical trials for either the oral or injectable formulations of iloperidone  that we will not engage in any further commercial activities related to iloperidone  that we will not engage in further in licensing activities  that we will not receive any proceeds from potential partnerships  that we will not conduct additional trials for tasimelteon  that we will be able to retain our key personnel  that we will continue to seek fda approval of iloperidone  that we will continue to evaluate clinical and pre clinical compounds for potential development  and that we will not incur any significant contingent liabilities

however  we may not be able to raise additional funds on acceptable terms  or at all 
if we are unable to secure sufficient capital to fund our research and development activities  we may not be able to continue operations  or we may have to enter into collaboration agreements that could require us to share commercial rights to our products to a greater extent or at earlier stages in the drug development process than is currently intended 
these collaborations  if consummated prior to proof of efficacy or safety of a given product candidate  could impair our ability to realize value from that product candidate

item a 
qualitative and quantitative disclosures about market risk foreign exchange we currently incur a portion of our operating expenses in currencies other than us dollars  the reporting currency for our consolidated financial statements  and we have determined that such operating expenses have not been significant to date 
as a result  we have not been impacted materially by changes in exchange rates and do not expect to be impacted materially for the foreseeable future 
however  if operating expenses incurred outside of the united states increase  our results of operations could be adversely impacted by changes in exchange rates 
we do not currently hedge foreign currency fluctuations and do not intend to do so for the foreseeable future 
interest rates our exposure to market risk is currently confined to our cash and cash equivalents  marketable securities and restricted cash 
we currently do not hedge interest rate exposure 
we have not used derivative financial instruments for speculation or trading purposes 
because of the short term maturities of our cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities  we do not believe that an increase in market rates would have any significant impact on the realized value of our investments 

table of contents effects of inflation our most liquid assets are cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities 
because of their liquidity  these assets are not directly affected by inflation 
we also believe that we have intangible assets in the value of our intellectual property 
in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  we have not capitalized the value of this intellectual property on our balance sheet 
due to the nature of this intellectual property  we believe that these intangible assets are not affected by inflation 
because we intend to retain and continue to use our equipment  furniture and fixtures and leasehold improvements  we believe that the incremental inflation related to replacement costs of such items will not materially affect our operations 
however  the rate of inflation affects our expenses  such as those for employee compensation and contract services  which could increase our level of expenses and the rate at which we use our resources 
marketable securities we deposit our cash with financial institutions that we consider to be of high credit quality and purchase marketable securities which are generally investment grade  liquid  short term fixed income securities and money market instruments denominated in us dollars 
we are monitoring one corporate note affected by the current credit crisis 
the note is expected to mature in may and we expect minimal loses  if any 
off balance sheet arrangements we have no off balance sheet arrangements  as defined in item a of the securities and exchange commission s regulation s k
