item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
under the percentage of completion method of accounting  we record revenue as work on the contract progresses 
the cumulative amount of revenues recorded on a contract at a specified point in time is that percentage of total estimated revenues that costs incurred to date bear to estimated total costs 
accordingly  contract revenues and total cost estimates are reviewed and revised as the work progresses 
adjustments are reflected in contract revenues in the period when such estimates are revised 
estimates are based on management s reasonable assumptions and experience  but are only estimates 
variation of actual results from assumptions on an unusually large project or on a number of average size projects could be material 
we are also required to immediately recognize the full amount of the estimated loss on a contract when estimates indicate such a loss 
such adjustments and accrued losses could result in reduced profitability  which would negatively impact our cash flow from operations 
the loss of one or a few customers could have an adverse effect on us 
a few clients have in the past and may in the future account for a significant portion of our revenue in any one year or over a period of several consecutive years 
although we have long standing relationships with many of our significant clients  our clients may unilaterally reduce or discontinue their contracts with us at any time 
our loss of business from a significant client could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  and results of operations 
certain provisions of our corporate governance documents could make an acquisition of us  or a substantial interest in us  more difficult 
the following provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws  as currently in effect  as well as delaware law  could discourage potential proposals to acquire us  delay or prevent a change in control of us or limit the price that investors may be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock o our certificate of incorporation permits our board of directors to issue blank check preferred stock and to adopt amendments to our bylaws  o our bylaws contain restrictions regarding the right of our stockholders to nominate directors and to submit proposals to be considered at stockholder meetings  o our certificate of incorporation and bylaws restrict the right of our stockholders to call a special meeting of stockholders and to act by written consent  and o we are subject to provisions of delaware law  which prohibit us from engaging in any of a broad range of business transactions with an interested stockholder for a period of three years following the date such stockholder becomes classified as an interested stockholder

as of december   our backlog was billion  and as of december   our backlog was billion 
backlog decreases as we perform work on existing contracts and increases with awards of new contracts 
the decrease in the united states electrical and mechanical construction and facilities services segments backlog is primarily attributable to the cancellation of certain contracts and a decrease in contracts awarded for work in the hospitality  commercial and healthcare markets  although the decrease was partially offset by increased awards of industrial  transportation  institutional and water wastewater projects  as well as the addition of backlog from companies acquired in backlog is not a term recognized under united states generally accepted accounting principles  however  it is a common measurement used in our industry 
backlog includes unrecognized revenues to be realized from uncompleted construction contracts plus unrecognized revenues expected to be realized over the remaining term of facilities services contracts 
however  if the remaining term of a facilities services contract exceeds months  the unrecognized revenues attributable to such contract included in backlog are limited to only the next months of revenues

our consolidated cash and cash equivalents balance decreased by approximately million from million at december  to million at december  the million in net cash provided by operating activities for  which increased million when compared to million in net cash provided by operating activities in  was primarily due to an increase in working capital as a result of an increase in net over billings related to an increase in revenues

these purchase orders are not reflected in emcor s consolidated balance sheets and should not impact future cash flows  as amounts will be recovered through customer billings 
represents primarily insurance related liabilities  a pension plan liability and liabilities for unrecognized income tax benefits  classified as other long term liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets 
cash payments for insurance related liabilities may be payable beyond three years  but it is not practical to estimate these payments 
we provide funding to our pension plans based on at least the minimum funding required by applicable regulations 
in determining the minimum required funding  we utilize current actuarial assumptions and exchange rates to forecast estimates of amounts that may be payable for up to five years in the future 
in our judgment  minimum funding estimates beyond a five year time horizon cannot be reliably estimated  and therefore  have not been included in the table 
we classify these borrowings as short term on our consolidated balance sheets because of our intent and ability to repay the amounts on a short term basis 
as of december   there were no borrowings outstanding under the revolving credit facility 
our revolving credit agreement the revolving credit facility provides for a credit facility of million 
the revolving credit facility expires on october  it permits us to increase our borrowings to million if additional lenders are identified and or existing lenders are willing to increase their current commitments 
we may allocate up to million of the borrowing capacity under the revolving credit facility to letters of credit 
the revolving credit facility is guaranteed by certain of our direct and indirect subsidiaries  is secured by substantially all of our assets and most of the assets of our subsidiaries  and provides for borrowings in the form of revolving loans and letters of credit 
the revolving credit facility contains various covenants requiring  among other things  maintenance of certain financial ratios and certain restrictions with respect to payment of dividends  common stock repurchases  investments  acquisitions  indebtedness and capital expenditures 
a commitment fee is payable on the average daily unused amount of the revolving credit facility

letter of credit fees issued under this facility range from to of the respective face amounts of the letters of credit issued and are charged based on the type of letter of credit issued and certain financial tests 
as of december  and  we had approximately million and million of letters of credit outstanding  respectively 
there were no borrowings under the revolving credit facility as of december  and on september   we entered into a million term loan agreement term loan 
the proceeds were used to pay a portion of the consideration for the acquisition of ohmstede and costs and expenses incident thereto 
the term loan contains financial covenants  representations and warranties and events of default 
the term loan covenants require  among other things  maintenance of certain financial ratios and certain restrictions with respect to payment of dividends  common stock repurchases  investments  acquisitions  indebtedness and capital expenditures 
we are required to make principal payments on the term loan in installments on the last day of march  june  september and december of each year  commencing march in the amount of million  together with interest on the then outstanding principal amount 
a final payment comprised of all remaining principal and interest is due on october  the term loan is secured by substantially all of our assets and most of the assets of our us subsidiaries

we have made total prepayments of million since we entered into the term loan  million of which were made during the year ended december   as well as mandatory repayments of million  to reduce the balance of the term loan to million at december  based on the million borrowings outstanding on the term loan  if overall interest rates were to increase by  the net of tax interest expense would increase approximately million in the next twelve months 
conversely  if overall interest rates were to decrease by  interest expense  net of income taxes  would decrease by approximately million in the next twelve months 
on january   we entered into an interest rate swap  effective january   which hedges our interest rate risk associated with the million principal amount of the term loan 
this swap has monthly settlement dates over the term of the contract 
the interest rate swap has been designated as an effective cash flow hedge  whereby changes in the cash flows from the swap perfectly offset the changes in the cash flows associated with the floating rate of interest on the million of principal associated with the term loan 
our canadian subsidiary  comstock canada ltd  had a credit agreement with a bank providing for an overdraft facility of up to cdn 
million that was terminated in november the facility was secured by a standby letter of credit and provided for interest at the bank s prime rate 
one of our subsidiaries has guaranteed million of borrowings of a venture in which we have a interest  the other venture partner  baltimore gas and electric a subsidiary of constellation energy  has a interest 
the venture designs  constructs  owns  operates  leases and maintains facilities to produce chilled water for sale to customers for use in air conditioning commercial properties 
these guarantees are not expected to have a material effect on our financial position or results of operations 
we and baltimore gas and electric are jointly and severally liable  in the event of default  for the venture s million in borrowings 
the terms of our construction contracts frequently require that we obtain from surety companies surety companies and provide to our customers payment and performance bonds surety bonds as a condition to the award of such contracts 
the surety bonds secure our payment and performance obligations under such contracts  and we have agreed to indemnify the surety companies for amounts  if any  paid by them in respect of surety bonds issued on our behalf 
in addition  at the request of labor unions representing certain of our employees  surety bonds are sometimes provided to secure obligations for wages and benefits payable to or for such employees 
public sector contracts require surety bonds more frequently than private sector contracts  and accordingly  our bonding requirements typically increase as the amount of public sector work increases 
as of december   based on our percentage of completion of our projects covered by surety bonds  our aggregate estimated exposure  had there been defaults on all our existing contractual obligations  would have been approximately billion 
the surety bonds are issued by surety companies in return for premiums  which vary depending on the size and type of bond 
in recent years there has been a reduction in the aggregate surety bond issuance capacity of surety companies due to industry consolidations and significant losses of surety companies as a result of providing surety bonds to construction companies as well as companies in other industries 
consequently  the availability of surety bonds has become more limited and the terms upon which surety bonds are available have become more restrictive 
we continually monitor our available limits of surety bonds and discuss with our current and other surety bond providers the amount of surety bonds that may be available to us based on our financial strength and the absence of any default by us on any surety bond we have previously obtained 
however  if we experience changes in our bonding relationships or if there are further changes in the surety industry  we may seek to satisfy certain customer requests for surety bonds by posting other forms of collateral in lieu of surety bonds such as letters of credit or guarantees by emcor group  inc  by seeking to convince customers to forego the requirement of a surety bond  by increasing our activities in business segments that rarely require surety bonds such as the facilities services segment and or by refraining from bidding for certain projects that require surety bonds 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to effectuate alternatives to providing surety bonds to our customers or to obtain  on favorable terms  sufficient additional work that does not require surety bonds to replace projects requiring surety bonds that we may decline to pursue 
accordingly  if we were to experience a reduction in the availability of surety bonds  we could experience a material adverse effect on our financial position  results of operations and or cash flows 
we do not have any other material financial guarantees or off balance sheet arrangements other than those disclosed herein 
our primary source of liquidity has been  and is expected to continue to be  cash generated by operating activities 
we also maintain the revolving credit facility that may be utilized  among other things  to meet short term liquidity needs in the event cash generated by operating activities is insufficient or to enable us to seize opportunities to participate in joint ventures or to make acquisitions that may require access to cash on short notice or for any other reason 
however  negative macroeconomic trends may have an adverse effect on liquidity 
in addition to managing borrowings  our focus on the facilities services market is intended to provide an additional buffer against economic downturns inasmuch as a part of our facilities services business is characterized by annual and multi year contracts that provide a more predictable stream of cash flow than the construction business 
short term liquidity is also impacted by the type and length of construction contracts in place 
during past economic downturns  there were typically fewer small discretionary projects from the private sector  and companies like us aggressively bid more large long term infrastructure and public sector contracts 
performance of long duration contracts typically requires working capital until initial billing milestones are achieved 
while we strive to maintain a net over billed position with our customers  there can be no assurance that a net over billed position can be maintained  however  we have been successful during the and periods of strong demand for non residential construction services in substantially increasing our net over billed position 
our net over billings  defined as the balance sheet accounts billings in excess of costs and estimated earnings on uncompleted contracts less cost and estimated earnings in excess of billings on uncompleted contracts  were million and million as of december  and  respectively 
long term liquidity requirements can be expected to be met through cash generated from operating activities and our revolving credit facility 
based upon our current credit ratings and financial position  we can reasonably expect to be able to incur long term debt to fund acquisitions 
over the long term  our primary revenue risk factor continues to be the level of demand for non residential construction services  which is in turn influenced by macroeconomic trends including interest rates and governmental economic policy 
in addition  our ability to perform work is critical to meeting long term liquidity requirements 
we believe that current cash balances and borrowing capacity available under the revolving credit facility or other forms of financing available through borrowings  combined with cash expected to be generated from operations  will be sufficient to provide short term and foreseeable long term liquidity and meet expected capital expenditure requirements 
however  we are a party to lawsuits and other proceedings in which other parties seek to recover from us amounts ranging from a few thousand dollars to over million 
if we were required to pay damages in one or more such proceedings  such payments could have a material adverse effect on our financial position  results of operations and or cash flows 
certain insurance matters as of december   we utilized approximately million of letters of credit issued pursuant to our revolving credit facility as collateral for insurance obligations
