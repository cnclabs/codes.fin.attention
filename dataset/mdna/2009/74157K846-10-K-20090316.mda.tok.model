index to financial statements fiscal fourth quarter results we had total revenue of million  representing a million year over year decrease  primarily due to a decrease in new homes advertising revenue 
apartments  representing approximately of fourth quarter advertising revenue  grew revenue on a year over year basis  driven by increased customer count and apartment community listings 
income from continuing operations increased million to million  or per diluted common share  primarily due to the release of million in deferred tax asset valuation allowance 
net income increased million to million  or per diluted common share  primarily due to the release of the deferred tax asset valuation allowance  partially offset by a million charge for litigation related losses 
summary consolidated results in  revenue was million  down as compared to million in in  costs and expenses were million  down compared to million in in  income from continuing operations was million  up from a loss of million in net income was million in  including gain on sale of businesses  net of tax  of million  compared to million in  including gain on sale of businesses  net of tax  of million 
business trends and outlook during  we intend to continue to grow our customer count and market share in our largest business  apartment guide  and pursue enhancements to our product portfolio and selective market and market segment expansion 
we anticipate increasing our investment in search engine optimization and marketing 
we also intend to aggressively grow our rentals 
com business by focusing on driving revenue growth and improving site engineering and performance  while increasing traffic  primarily through search engine optimization 
the residential real estate sales industry continues to suffer through an unprecedented collapse in demand and access to credit markets 
as a result  we anticipate increasing pressure on our new homes and distributech businesses during  with full year levels of percentage decline in revenue exceeding those experienced during the fourth quarter of we remain focused on managing costs for these businesses in accordance with anticipated levels of revenue and managing our client relationships to best position us for opportunities as macroeconomic conditions improve 
during  we ceased publication of two new home guide professional editions 
in early  we announced that we were suspending additional print publications  while focusing on internet offerings in related markets  as we continue to reduce our cost structure for this business to offset expected revenue losses 
we anticipate that distributech will continue to be impacted by lower revenue from customers that publish free publications  particularly those within the resale home and automobile sales sectors  and are scaling back or ceasing operations or providing an internet only product 
we intend to continue to reduce our cost structure for this business to offset  in part  expected revenue losses 
our overall goal is to create a more efficient distribution network by streamlining the expense structure  including through real estate consolidation and process automation  and optimizing the distribution footprint by eliminating less effective locations 
transition plan we have relocated our corporate headquarters from new york to norcross  georgia 
we continued to utilize certain of our new york based functions through the first half of and to incur their associated costs 

table of contents 
index to financial statements critical accounting policies and estimates management s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with gaap 
the preparation of these financial statements requires the use of estimates  judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts 
the significant accounting policies  outlined in note  summary of significant accounting policies  to the consolidated financial statements are integral to an understanding of management s discussion and analysis 
the accounting policies and estimates that we believe are the most critical to an understanding of the results of operations and financial condition are those that require complex management judgment regarding matters that are highly uncertain at the time policies were applied and estimates were made 
these accounting policies and estimates are discussed below 
we base some of our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances 
additionally  gaap allows or requires many assets and liabilities to be accounted for at fair value  which is defined to be the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date 
gaap also requires that certain assets be assessed for impairment based on fair value 
in cases where active markets do not exist  as discussed below  modeling or other techniques may be required to estimate fair value 
different estimates reasonably could have been used in the current period that would have had a material effect on these financial statements  and changes in these estimates are likely to occur from period to period in the future 
we have discussed the development and selection of these critical accounting policies and estimates with the audit committee of the board of directors  and the audit committee has reviewed our disclosures relating to them in this management s discussion and analysis 
goodwill impairment testing 
goodwill is deemed to have an indefinite life and is not amortized but is subject to an impairment test  at least annually 
goodwill represents the excess of the cost of an acquired entity over the net of the amounts assigned to assets acquired and liabilities assumed in business combinations 
the value of goodwill is ultimately derived from an entity s ability to generate net earnings after the acquisition 
a decline in net earnings could be indicative of a decline in the fair value of goodwill and result in impairment 
for that reason  we test  at a reporting unit level  goodwill for impairment and have established october as the annual impairment testing date 
a reporting unit is an operating segment or one level below an operating segment for which discrete financial information is available and reviewed regularly by management 
our assets and liabilities are assigned to reporting units to the extent that they are employed in or are considered a liability related to the operations of the reporting units and are considered in determining the fair value of the reporting units 
we presently have only one reporting unit 
the goodwill impairment test is conducted by calculating the fair value of the reporting unit  which begins with management s expectations of cash flows in the next five years plus an expected residual value 
a discount factor  approximating our weighted average cost of capital for and for  is then applied to the forecasted cash flows to determine the present value 
the resulting fair value is compared to the carrying value of the reporting unit 
as long as the present value is greater  there is no impairment to goodwill 
in the annual assessment for  there was no indicated impairment to goodwill 
while we believe all assumptions utilized in our assessment of goodwill for impairment are reasonable and appropriate  changes in actual earnings  the growth rate of future earnings  the effective tax rate for and and our weighted average cost of capital could all cause different results for the calculation of the present value of future cash flows 
in management s estimation  most sensitive of these assumptions is cash flows from future earnings 
based on the assessment for impairment  a decline in the amount of forecasted cash flows from future earnings would not result in an indicated goodwill impairment 
long lived assets 
we review our long lived assets for impairment whenever events and circumstances indicate assets might be impaired 
those events and circumstances include  but are not limited to  a significant change in the extent to which an asset is utilized eg  when a decision is made to dispose of an asset and certain other 
table of contents 
index to financial statements criteria are met  a significant decrease in the market price of an asset and a significant adverse change in the business climate that could affect the value of an asset  and operating or cash flow losses associated with the use of an asset 
when such a review is conducted  we use an estimate of undiscounted cash flows  which are derived from our historical experience and long term business plans  over the remaining lives of the assets to measure recoverability 
if the estimated cash flows are less than the carrying value of an asset  the loss is measured as the amount by which the carrying value of the asset exceeds fair value 
valuation allowances for deferred tax assets 
deferred tax assets and liabilities arise from temporary differences ie  amounts that are recognized as income or deducted as expenses at different times for gaap and tax purposes 
deferred tax assets also arise from benefits recorded from nols ie  amounts representing losses for tax purposes that may be utilized in future years to offset taxable income 
a net deferred tax asset must be reduced by a valuation allowance if  based on the weight of available evidence  it is more likely than not a likelihood of more than that some portion or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized 
the valuation allowance must be sufficient to reduce the net deferred tax asset to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
changes in the valuation allowance are recorded as increases or decreases in income tax expense 
future realization of the tax benefit of an existing deductible temporary difference or carryforward ultimately depends on the existence of sufficient taxable income of the appropriate character eg  ordinary income or capital gain within the carryback or carryforward period available under the tax law 
there are four possible sources of taxable income that may be available under the tax law to realize a tax benefit for deductible temporary differences and carryforwards future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences  future taxable income exclusive of reversing temporary differences and carryforwards  taxable income in prior carryback year s if carryback is permitted under the tax law  and tax planning strategies that would  if necessary  be implemented to  for example accelerate taxable amounts to utilize expiring carryforwards  or change the character of taxable or deductible amounts from ordinary income or loss to capital gain or loss 
evidence available about each of those possible sources of taxable income will vary for different tax jurisdictions and  possibly  from year to year 
to the extent evidence about one or more sources of taxable income is sufficient to support a conclusion that a valuation allowance is not necessary  other sources need not be considered 
consideration of each source is required  however  to determine the amount of the valuation allowance that is recognized for deferred tax assets 
after consideration of the available evidence  a valuation allowance  if warranted  is established to reduce the deferred tax asset to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
in july  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued interpretation no 
fin  accounting for uncertainty in income taxes  effective for fiscal years beginning after december  this interpretation clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprise s financial statements in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
fin prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return 
fin requires that  in order to be recognized  tax benefits must be more likely than not to be sustained upon examination by taxing authorities 
the amount recognized is measured as the largest amount of benefit that is greater than likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement 
in evaluating the ability to realize deferred tax assets  including nols  and any need for a valuation allowance  it is necessary to first consider the recognition threshold for uncertain tax positions and reduce the deferred tax assets by any required fin reserve 
as of december   we had aggregate federal nols of approximately million  which are available to reduce future taxable income  and the substantial majority expire between and in addition  we have significant state and local nols in various jurisdictions in which we and or our subsidiaries file income tax returns 
these state and local nols expire over various periods based on applicable state and local regulations 

table of contents 
index to financial statements the federal  state and local nols are the single largest component of our net deferred tax asset 
additionally  since amortization of tax deductible goodwill and trademarks ceased for gaap purposes on january   we expect that deferred tax liabilities will arise each quarter because the taxable temporary differences related to the amortization of these assets are not expected to reverse prior to the expiration period of our deductible temporary differences unless the related assets are sold or an impairment of the assets is recorded 
consequently  we may record a valuation allowance in excess of our net deferred tax assets to the extent the difference between the book and tax basis of indefinite lived intangible assets is not expected to reverse during the nol period 
based on the weight of objectively verifiable available positive and negative evidence  at december   we recorded a partial reversal of our valuation allowance against our net deferred tax asset of million because we believe it is more likely than not that this portion of the deferred tax asset will be realized 
we will need to generate approximately million in pre tax income for financial reporting purposes to realize this asset 
elements of positive evidence included remaining lives of the nols  historical income when results are normalized to remove the impact of discontinued operations and to reflect the completion of the company s relocation from new york to norcross  and forecasted income  utilizing the same forecast as for goodwill impairment testing in future periods 
elements of negative evidence included historical losses and uncertainty as to the timing and exact amount of future earnings as a result of current economic conditions  the us residential real estate industry  as well as the uncertainty of the effectiveness of the steps we have taken  and will take  to mitigate the adverse impact on our businesses 
our assessment in is different than it was in  primarily due to the completion of the relocation of the company from new york to norcross  resulting in a significantly reduced cost structure  and almost a full year of operations of the consumer guides business supporting the entire primedia cost structure  while maintaining profitability without the impact of divested entities 
stock based compensation 
effective january   we adopted the provisions of  and account for stock based compensation in accordance with  sfas no 
r 
under the fair value recognition provisions of sfas no 
r  stock based compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized as expense over the requisite service period  which is the vesting period 

table of contents 
index to financial statements the most commonly granted form of stock based compensation has been stock options 
the fair value of stock options is determined using an option pricing model that takes into account certain assumptions  including the exercise price  which is the stock price at the grant date  the expected life of the grant  the volatility of the underlying stock  the expected dividends on the stock and the risk free interest rate over the expected life of the grant 
the fair value of a stock option estimated at the grant date is not subsequently adjusted for changes in the price of the underlying stock or its volatility  the life of the grant  dividends on the stock or the risk free interest rate 
generally  changes in the assumptions will have the following impact on the fair value of stock option awards assumption impact on fair value exercise price increased price lower fair value decreased price higher fair value expected life of grant increased life higher fair value decreased life lower fair value volatility of underlying stock increased volatility higher fair value decreased volatility lower fair value expected dividends higher dividends lower fair value lower dividends higher fair value risk free interest rate higher rate lower fair value lower rate higher fair value allowance for doubtful accounts 
the allowance for doubtful accounts represents our estimate of losses in our accounts receivable resulting from our customers failure to make required payments 
we continually monitor collections from customers and the age of outstanding balances 
each of our business units provides for estimated credit losses based on historical analysis of the propensity of their customer base to make required payments 
we aggressively pursue collection efforts on overdue accounts and  upon collection of any amounts previously written off  reverse the write off 
if future payments by our customers were to differ from our estimates  we may need to increase or decrease our allowance for doubtful accounts 
provision for restructuring costs 
reserves for restructuring costs are estimated costs resulting from our plans and actions to integrate the company and consolidate certain back office functions 
examples include employee related termination costs and the cost of the termination of real estate leases  net of anticipated sublease income  if applicable  and the related write off of leasehold improvements 
if the future payments of these costs or amounts of sublease income were to differ from our estimates  we may need to increase or decrease our reserves 
divestiture reserves 
reserves for estimated obligations relating to divestitures may arise as a result of the sale of certain titles or business units 
these reserves are established for such items that we remain liable for after the sale is completed and are recorded at the time of the divestiture as part of the gain or loss on the sale of the divested asset or business 
examples include stay bonuses for key personnel  severance  taxes and working capital adjustments 
if the future payments for such items differ from its estimates  there could be a change in the determination of the gain or loss on sale

com and rentals 
com  representing approximately of advertising revenue during the year ended december   increased compared to the same period in the increase in revenue was primarily due to a increase in apartment guide communities served  partially offset by a decrease in revenue per community 
the increase in apartment communities served and the decrease in revenue per community were both a result of special customer incentives and promotional offerings designed to attract additional apartment communities 
apartment guide also benefited from the opening of the greenville  south carolina apartment guide in march  which contributed approximately million in revenue in approximately of the revenue from apartment guide was derived from markets that had high occupancy rates  which we consider to be or higher 
this compares to in as of december   occupancy rates in apartment guide markets ranged from to  with an average of in  compared to in  and with the majority of markets experiencing occupancy levels between and 
as occupancy rates increase beyond  apartment communities tend to reduce their advertising spend because they require fewer prospective tenants 
as occupancy rates fall below  apartment communities tend to cut back on spending  including advertising 
for these reasons  occupancy rates in excess of or below ordinarily result in a decrease in our advertising income 
new homes the new homes businesses  representing approximately of advertising revenue during the year ended december   decreased compared to the same period in the decrease in revenue was primarily due to a decrease in new home communities served and a decrease in revenue per community served 
these resulted from a decline in standard advertising spending of and a decline in premium advertising spending of by new home builders  driven by continued weakness in the new home sales sector

interest expense decreased  primarily due to lower average debt levels  as during the third quarter of  we repaid all million in principal of our term loan  redeemed all million in principal of our senior notes due  redeemed million in principal of our senior notes and redeemed all million in principal of our senior floating rate notes due this decrease was partially offset by higher interest rates 
in connection with these debt redemptions  we recorded a loss in other income loss  net of approximately million  including the write off of deferred financing costs of approximately million

our asset sales  debt redemptions and investment in organic growth have facilitated our objective to become a better strategically focused company  while strengthening our balance sheet and improving liquidity 
in september  we borrowed million against our revolving credit facility and did not repay it by year end 
at december   the remaining availability under the revolving credit facility is approximately million  which also reflects letters of credit outstanding and an effective reduction in available borrowing capacity related to the bankruptcy filing of lehman brothers holdings inc  the parent company of lehman brothers inc lehman  a participating lender in the million facility 
lehman s commitment under the revolving credit facility is million 
our ability to borrow under our revolving credit facility could be further impaired if any other participating lender in the facility were unwilling or unable to honor its contractual obligation to lend to us 
as is more fully described under financing arrangements below  we have required debt repayments  including capital leases  of million during the next months  which does not include the million balance outstanding under our revolving credit facility

we have no significant required debt repayments until

index to financial statements working capital consolidated working capital  which includes current maturities of long term debt  was million at december   compared to million at december  the increase in working capital was primarily due to an increase in our current deferred tax assets resulting from the partial release of our deferred tax asset valuation allowance as well as the current deferred tax asset resulting from our nol that we expect to carryback in order to offset taxable income 
the deferred tax assets are classified as current because we expect to realize the benefit within the next twelve months 
cash flow compared to net cash provided by operating activities was million in  compared to net cash used in operating activities of million in this increase in cash flow from operating activities was primarily due to less cash paid for interest and taxes of million and million  respectively  offset by less cash flows provided by operating activities of businesses that were discontinued and sold in and the first half of for purposes of calculating cash provided by or used in operating activities  discontinued operations are included until sold or shut down  therefore  these discontinued operations did not contribute to operating activities for the full year in which the sale occurred

cash flow compared to net cash used in operating activities was million in  compared to net cash generated from operating activities of million in this decrease was primarily due to the settlement during of numerous accrued expenses and other liabilities existing at december   including payroll  commissions and related employee benefits  retail display costs and allowances  rent and lease liabilities  circulation costs and deferred purchase price obligations  as well as cash paid for taxes 
the decreases in these liabilities were largely due to the divestitures completed in cash used in operating activities was partially offset by a decrease in cash paid for interest due to a lower average balance of debt outstanding during for purposes of calculating cash provided by or used in operating activities  discontinued operations are included until sold or shut down  therefore  these discontinued operations did not contribute to operating activities for the full year in which the sale occurred

why we use the term free cash flow free cash flow is defined as net cash provided by operating activities adjusted for additions to property  equipment and other  net  exclusive of acquisitions  and capital lease payments 
we believe that the use of free cash flow enables our chief operating decision maker  our president and ceo  to make decisions based on our cash resources 
we also believe that free cash flow provides useful information to investors as it is considered to be an indicator of our liquidity  including our ability to reduce debt and make strategic investments 
free cash flow is not intended to represent cash flows from operating activities as determined in conformity with gaap 
free cash flow  as presented  may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies since not all companies necessarily calculate free cash flow in an identical manner  and therefore  it is not necessarily an accurate measure of comparison between companies 
the following table presents our free cash flow years ended december  dollars in thousands net cash provided by used in operating activities additions to property and equipment capital lease payments free cash flow our free cash flow improved in  primarily due to the lower cash paid for income taxes  primarily related to divestitures  lower debt service  due to a lower average balance of debt outstanding  and by lower additions to property and equipment 
this was partially offset by the fact that  for purposes of calculating cash provided by or used in operating activities  discontinued operations are included until sold or shut down  therefore  these discontinued operations did not contribute to operating activities for the full year in which the sale occurred

the loan under the term loan b facility is subject to scheduled repayment in quarterly installments of approximately million each payable on march  june  september and december of each year commencing on march  and ending on june   followed by a final repayment of million on the term loan b maturity date 
additionally  through august   we are required to manage our interest rate risk arising from the term loan b facility through the utilization of derivative financial instruments in a notional amount equal to at least of the term loan b facility principal outstanding

we did not incur any early termination penalties in connection with the redemption of the senior notes beyond the redemption premium 
interest rate swaps as of december   we were party to five interest rates swaps with an aggregate notional amount of million 
all of the interest rate swaps were in designated hedging relationships to hedge the variability of future cash flows due to changes in the benchmark interest rate associated with our term loan b facility

amounts represent the present value of expected future net payments related to workplace learning lease obligations 
see contingencies and other discussion below for further detail 
the contractual obligations table above does not reflect any of our million in unrecognized tax benefits at december   which resulted in a recorded liability of million that has been accrued in accordance with fin because we are unable to determine when  or if  payment of these amounts will be made 
we had million in borrowings outstanding at december  under our revolving facility 
the interest rate is variable in nature and resets quarterly 
it was at december  the revolving facility does not have a scheduled repayment date  and both the amount outstanding and the related interest payments have been excluded from this table 
see discussion above on bank credit facilities 
we have other commitments in the form of letters of credit of million aggregate face value  which expire on or before december  a change in the rating of our debt instruments by outside rating agencies does not negatively impact our ability to use our available lines of credit or the borrowing rate under our bank credit facilities

covenant compliance under the most restrictive covenants contained in the new bank credit facilities agreement  the maximum allowable total leverage ratio  as defined in the agreement  is to under our bank credit facilities agreement  we are allowed to designate certain businesses as unrestricted subsidiaries to the extent that the value of those businesses does not exceed the permitted amounts  as defined in these agreements 
we have designated certain of our businesses as unrestricted the unrestricted group  which represent primarily internet businesses  trademark and content licensing and service companies  new launches including traditional start ups  other properties under evaluation for turnaround or shutdown  and foreign subsidiaries 
indebtedness under the bank credit facilities agreement is guaranteed by each of our domestic subsidiaries in the restricted group in accordance with the provisions and limitations of our bank credit facilities agreement 
the guarantees are full  unconditional  and joint and several 
the unrestricted group does not guarantee the bank credit facilities 
for purposes of determining compliance with certain financial covenants under our bank credit facility  the unrestricted group s results positive or negative are not reflected in the consolidated ebitda of the restricted group which  as defined in the bank credit facilities agreement  excludes losses of the unrestricted group  non cash charges and restructuring charges and is adjusted primarily for the trailing four quarters results of acquisitions and divestitures and estimated savings for acquired businesses 
the calculation of our leverage ratio  as required under the bank credit facilities agreement for covenant purposes  is defined as our consolidated debt divided by the ebitda of the restricted group 
as of december   this leverage ratio was approximately to  compared to to at december  contingencies and other we are involved in lawsuits and claims  both actual and potential  including some that we have asserted against others  in which substantial monetary damages are sought 
see note  commitments and contingencies  to the consolidated financial statements in item of this report for a description of certain of these lawsuits  including a description of the settlement of a lawsuit related to the divestiture of our crafts group in as discussed in note  although the result of any future litigation of such lawsuits and claims is inherently unpredictable  management believes that  in the aggregate  the outcome of all such lawsuits and claims will not have a material effect on our consolidated financial position or liquidity  however  any such outcome could be material to the results of operations of any particular period in which costs  if any  are recognized 
as of and for the year ended december   none of our officers or directors have been granted loans by us  nor have we guaranteed any obligations of such persons

we received a third party guaranty of up to million against those lease obligations to reimburse us for lease payments made the guaranty 
in the first half of  we made payments on behalf of workplace learning pursuant to our secondary liability 
during the second quarter of  we recorded a liability for the fair value of the lease payments  net of sublease income  related to our secondary liability on the lease payments 
at that time  we also

index to financial statements recorded a receivable of million for the amount due from the third party guarantor for the lease payments 
as a result of recording the receivable and liability during the second quarter of  we recorded a charge of approximately million to discontinued operations 
in the second half of  we commenced a lawsuit to collect on the guaranty 
during the fourth quarter of  we determined that it was not probable that the third party would remit payment  as required under the guaranty  and we fully reserved for the million receivable with a charge to discontinued operations as of december  we continue to exercise all available legal remedies against the third party guarantor and to fulfill our secondary obligation regarding the workplace learning lease 
on october   the assignee of the building lease and a related entity filed petitions for reorganization under chapter of the us bankruptcy code in the united states bankruptcy court for the eastern district of texas 
that proceeding is at an early stage  and the ultimate outcome of the proceeding  including the full effect on the company s secondary liability as assignor of the building lease  and the company s recovery  if any  on claims that the company may have against the assignee  is uncertain

stock repurchase plan on december   our board of directors authorized a program to repurchase up to million of our common stock over the next months

impact of inflation and other costs our largest exposure to inflation relates to the cost of paper 
the cost of paper increased in compared to  rising in the second quarter by and again by in the fourth quarter 
we presently anticipate slight decreases in paper prices in seasonality our operations are minimally seasonal in nature 
the majority of our sales comprise contracts with a duration of months or longer 
we experience modest seasonality in our single unit real estate listing as that business declines in the winter months

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk we are exposed to the impact of changes in interest rates  primarily through our term loan b facility  which is variable rate debt that had an outstanding balance of million at december  as part of our management of interest rate risk  we have designated derivative financial instruments in hedging relationships against the variability in cash flows due to changes in the benchmark interest rate on our term loan b facility 
the table below shows the change in interest expense we estimate would occur over the next months from and basis point increases and decreases in interest rates based upon our current term loan b facility balance and derivative financial instrument positions at december  such potential increases or decreases are based on certain simplifying assumptions  including a constant level of debt and an immediate  across the board increase or decrease in the level of interest rates with no other subsequent changes for one year 
changes in interest expense december  interest rate change in basis points dollars in thousands credit risk our hedging transactions using derivative financial instruments also involve certain additional risks  such as counterparty credit risk 
the counterparties to our derivative financial instruments are major financial institutions and securities dealers  which we believe are well capitalized with investment grade credit ratings and with which we may have other financial relationships 
while we do not anticipate nonperformance by any counterparty  we are exposed to potential credit losses in the event the counterparty fails to perform 
our exposure to credit risk in the event of default by a counterparty is the difference between the value of the contract and the current market price at the time of the default 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to adequately protect against the foregoing risks and will ultimately realize an economic benefit that exceeds the related expenses incurred in connection with engaging in such hedging strategies
