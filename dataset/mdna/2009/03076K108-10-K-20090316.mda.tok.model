item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview the company s ameris bancorp s performance in was impacted by a number of significant items 
credit costs net charge offs and provisions for loan losses were at record high levels for the bank in as residential real estate values continued to fall 
our florida markets were especially vulnerable to declining values and activity and accounted for more than of s provision for loan losses 
in addition to a general slow down in real estate activity  our industry dealt with tighter liquidity than had been seen in prior years 
the lower levels of available liquidity in the marketplace led to unusually high borrowing costs that kept interest expense at elevated levels through most of balance sheet growth was limited in compared to recent years 
the combination of fewer loan opportunities and the company s efforts to reduce its exposure in certain loan concentrations caused the growth in loans to be held to approximately 
the majority of the company s deposit growth was limited to time deposits although some markets enjoyed success selling a high yield checking account 
the company has focused a significant amount of resources towards improving its deposit mix and funding a significant majority of its future growth with low cost or transaction based deposit accounts 
the importance of strong capital and liquidity was highlighted in the last half of the year as a growing number of larger regional banks and investment banks suffered and were in some cases  merged with other institutions 
ameris had managed strong liquidity and capital levels proactively for several years before the crisis began 
in the fourth quarter of  the company took steps to further bolster its capital and liquidity positions 
on the capital front  the company elected to participate in the cpp and issued million of preferred shares to the treasury 
this transaction with the treasury is discussed in detail elsewhere in this annual report 
for liquidity  the company adopted an aggressive stance on local deposits and had several fourth quarter campaigns that raised approximately million in incremental  local market deposits 
for the year ended december   ameris reported a net loss available to common stockholders of million or per diluted share  compared to net income of million  or per diluted share in net interest income decreased during the year ended december  by to million compared to million for year ended december  the company s net interest margin decreased from in to in the decline was primarily related to borrowing costs that remained somewhat elevated as asset yields fell commensurately with national indices that reached historic lows 
non interest income grew during the year to million from million during the majority of this increase related to increases in service charges on deposit accounts which increased to million in compared to million in this increase in service charges related to increases in the number of account holders subject to charges as well as minor increases in various fee schedules 
total operating expenses grew in to million  compared to million in salaries and benefits during were million  an increase of as compared to million in these increases are mostly the result of expansion efforts in larger markets where the company opened nine offices during occupancy and equipment expense increased during to million  an increase of as compared to this increase also relates to expansion efforts in larger markets  the costs of which were offset to some degree by savings from branch closings during provisions for loan losses in were significantly higher than levels incurred in as the economic conditions of our local economies were affected by slowing real estate activity and lower real estate values 
for the year ended december   the company recorded million in provision for loan losses compared to million in  an increase of million 
net charge offs were also higher in at million or of average loans  compared to million or of average loans in 
table of contents critical accounting policies ameris has established certain accounting and financial reporting policies to govern the application of accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america in the preparation of our financial statements 
our significant accounting policies are described in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
certain accounting policies involve significant judgments and assumptions by management which have a material impact on the carrying value of certain assets and liabilities  management considers these accounting policies to be critical accounting policies 
the judgments and assumptions used by management are based on historical experience and other factors which are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
because of the nature of the judgments and assumptions made by management  actual results could differ from the judgments and estimates adopted by management which could have a material impact on the carrying values of assets and liabilities and the results of ameris operations 
we believe the following accounting policies applied by ameris represent critical accounting policies 
allowance for loan losses we believe the allowance for loan losses is a critical accounting policy that requires the most significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
the allowance for loan losses represents management s estimate of probable loan losses inherent in the company s loan portfolio 
calculation of the allowance for loan losses represents a critical accounting estimate due to the significant judgment  assumptions and estimates related to the amount and timing of estimated losses  consideration of subjective environmental factors and the amount and timing of cash flows related to impaired loans 
management believes that the allowance for loan losses is adequate 
while management uses available information to recognize losses on loans  future additions to the allowance for loan losses may be necessary based on changes in economic conditions 
in addition  various regulatory agencies  as an integral part of their examination processes  periodically review the company s allowance for loan losses 
such agencies may require the company to recognize additions to the allowance for loan losses based on their judgments about information available to them at the time of their examination 
considering current information and events regarding a borrower s ability to repay its obligations  management considers a loan to be impaired when the ultimate collectability of all amounts due  according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement  is in doubt 
when a loan is considered to be impaired  the amount of impairment is measured based on the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan s effective interest rate or if the loan is collateral dependent  the fair value of the collateral is used to determine the amount of impairment 
impairment losses are included in the allowance for loan losses through a charge to the provision for losses on loans 
subsequent recoveries are credited to the allowance for loan losses 
cash receipts for accruing loans are applied to principal and interest under the contractual terms of the loan agreement 
cash receipts on impaired loans for which the accrual of interest has been discontinued are applied first to principal and then to interest income 

table of contents certain economic and interest rate factors could have a material impact on the determination of the allowance for loan losses 
an increase in interest rates by the federal reserve would favorably impact our net interest margin 
an improving economy could result in the expansion of businesses and creation of jobs which would positively affect ameris loan growth and improve our gross revenue stream 
conversely  certain factors could result from an expanding economy which could increase our credit costs and adversely impact our net earnings 
a significant rapid rise in interest rates could create higher borrowing costs and shrinking corporate profits which could have a material impact on a borrower s ability to pay 
we will continue to concentrate on maintaining a high quality loan portfolio through strict administration of our loan policy 
another factor that we have considered in the determination of the allowance for loan losses is loan concentrations to individual borrowers or industries 
we had two credit relationships that exceed our in house credit limit of million 
total exposure to these two credits is million 
a substantial portion of our loan portfolio is in the commercial real estate and residential real estate sectors 
those loans are secured by real estate in ameris primary market areas 
a substantial portion of other real estate owned is located in those same markets 
therefore  the ultimate collectability of a substantial portion of our loan portfolio and the recovery of a substantial portion of the carrying amount of other real estate owned are susceptible to changes to market conditions in ameris primary market area 
income taxes sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  requires the asset and liability approach for financial accounting and reporting for deferred income taxes 
we use the asset and liability method of accounting for deferred income taxes and provide deferred income taxes for all significant income tax temporary differences 
see note to the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional details 
as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process involves estimating our actual current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items  such as depreciation and the provision for loan losses  for tax and financial reporting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities that are included in our consolidated balance sheet 
we must also assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income  and to the extent we believe that recovery is not likely  we must establish a valuation allowance 
significant management judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes  our deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against our net deferred tax assets 
to the extent we establish a valuation allowance or adjust this allowance in a period  we must include an expense within the tax provisions in the statement of income 
we have recorded on our consolidated balance sheet net deferred tax assets of million  which includes amounts relating to loss carryforwards 
we believe there will be sufficient taxable income in the future to allow us to utilize these loss carryforwards in the tax jurisdictions where they exist 

table of contents long lived assets  including intangibles in our financial statements  we have recorded million of goodwill and other intangible assets  which represents the amount by which the price we paid for acquired businesses exceeds the fair value of tangible assets acquired plus the liabilities assumed 
we evaluate long lived assets  such as property and equipment  specifically identifiable intangibles and goodwill  when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of such assets might not be recoverable 
factors that could trigger impairment include significant underperformance relative to historical or projected future operating results  significant changes in the manner of our use of the acquired assets and significant negative industry or economic trends 
the determination of whether impairment has occurred is based on an estimate of undiscounted cash flows attributable to the assets as compared to the carrying value of the assets 
if impairment has occurred  the amount of the impairment loss recognized would be determined by estimating the fair value of the assets and recording a loss if the fair value was less than the book value 
during  the company determined there was the potential for impairment due to significant declines in the company s market value 
as a result  the company engaged an independent party who reviewed business strategies as well as current and forecasted levels of earnings and capital 
the study indicated that the company s goodwill was not impaired and as a result  no adjustments were made to the carrying value of goodwill 
in determining the existence of impairment factors  our assessment is based on market conditions  operational performance and legal factors of our company 
our review of factors present and the resulting appropriate carrying value of our goodwill  intangibles and other long lived assets are subject to judgments and estimates that management is required to make 
future events could cause us to conclude that impairment indicators exist and that our goodwill  intangibles and other long lived assets might be impaired 
in accordance with accounting rules promulgated by the financial accounting standards board fasb  no goodwill was expensed in  or net income loss and earnings per share in  we reported a net loss available to common stockholders of million  or per diluted share  compared to net income of million  or per diluted share in and million  or per diluted share  in our return on average assets was  and in  and  respectively

table of contents results of operations net interest income net interest income represents the amount by which interest income on interest bearing assets exceeds interest expense incurred on interest bearing liabilities 
net interest income is the largest component of our income and is affected by the interest rate environment and the volume and composition of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
our interest earning assets include loans  investment securities  interest bearing deposits in banks and federal funds sold 
our interest bearing liabilities include deposits  other short term borrowings  fhlb advances and subordinated debentures

during  yields on average deposit borrowings fell to from in although the fall in deposit yields was significant  its level relative to falling interest income was not sufficient to preserve normal levels of net interest margin 
as the year came to a close  yields on deposit borrowings began to react positively to government intervention aimed at increasing liquidity levels

during  total advertising and marketing costs were million  compared to million in the company s advertising efforts were successful in significantly increasing deposit levels and liquidity ratios during compared with total operating expenses grew in to million compared to million in several factors impacted operating expenses in  the largest factor being the company s south carolina initiative  which accounted for approximately million in incremental costs during equipment and occupancy expenses increased approximately to million as additional offices in south carolina and florida were opened in advertising related expenses in increased approximately  to million as the company expanded its marketing efforts in existing markets and promoted its products in new and existing markets 
marketing costs are not expected to moderate or fall in as the company has planned events surrounding openings in several new markets across its footprint and increased marketing around mortgage and treasury services 
expenses associated with data processing and communications costs decreased during in  the company re negotiated certain portions of its communications contracts with its provider that allowed for improved network capacity at more attractive levels 
income taxes federal income tax expense is influenced by the amount of taxable income  the amount of tax exempt income and the amount of non deductible expenses 
for the year ended december   the company reported an income tax benefit of million 
this compares to income tax expenses of million and million for the years ended and  respectively 
the company s effective tax rate was  and for the years ended december   and loans management believes that our loan portfolio is adequately diversified 
the loan portfolio contains no foreign or energy related loans or significant concentrations in any one industry 
as of december   approximately of our loan portfolio was secured by real estate 
the amount of loans outstanding at the indicated dates is shown in the following table according to type of loans 
december  dollars in thousands commercial  financial agricultural real estate construction development real estate commercial farmland real estate residential consumer installment loans other less reserve for possible loan losses loans  net 
table of contents total loans as of december  are shown in the following table according to their contractual maturity 
contractual maturity in one year or less over one year through five years over five years total dollars in thousands commercial  financial agricultural real estate construction development real estate commercial farmland real estate residential consumer installment loans other the following table summarizes loans at december  with maturity dates after one year which have predetermined interest rates and have floating or adjustable interest rates 
dollars in thousands predetermined interest rates floating or adjustable interest rates allowance and provision for loan losses the allowance for loan losses represents a reserve for inherent losses in the loan portfolio 
the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses is evaluated periodically based on a review of all significant loans  with a particular emphasis on non accruing  past due and other loans that management believes might be potentially impaired or warrant additional attention 
we segregate our loan portfolio by type of loan and utilize this segregation in evaluating exposure to risks within the portfolio 
in addition  based on internal reviews and external reviews performed by independent auditors and regulatory authorities  we further segregate our loan portfolio by loan grades based on an assessment of risk for a particular loan or group of loans 
certain reviewed loans are assigned specific allowances when a review of relevant data determines that a general allocation is not sufficient or when the review affords management the opportunity to fine tune the amount of exposure in a given credit 
in establishing allowances  management considers historical loan loss experience but adjusts this data with a significant emphasis on data such as current loan quality trends  current economic conditions and other factors in the markets where the bank operates 
factors considered include among others  current valuations of real estate in our markets  unemployment rates  the effect of weather conditions on agricultural related entities and other significant local economic events  such as major plant closings 
we have developed a methodology for determining the adequacy of the loan loss reserve which is monitored by the company s senior credit officer 
procedures provide for the assignment of a risk rating for every loan included in our total loan portfolio  with the exception of credit card receivables and overdraft protection loans which are treated as pools for risk rating purposes 
the risk rating schedule provides eight ratings of which four ratings are classified as pass ratings and four ratings are classified as criticized ratings 
each risk rating is assigned a percent factor to be applied to the loan balance to determine the adequate amount of reserve 
many of the larger loans require an annual review by an independent loan officer and are often reviewed by independent third parties 
as a result of these loan reviews  certain loans may be assigned specific reserve allocations 
other loans that surface as problem loans may also be assigned specific reserves 
past due loans are assigned risk ratings based on the number of days past due 
the calculation of the allowance for loan losses  including underlying data and assumptions  is reviewed regularly by the company s chief financial officer as well as the director of internal audit 
during periodic reviews of the company s methodology  the company determined that additional reserves were potentially necessary to compensate for an increasingly negative economic outlook that prompted a few loan relationships to move to non performing status very quickly 
the company established an unallocated  economic related reserve in the amount of million that represents only that portion of the allowance for loan losses not allocated to specific loans 
while the company is confident in the reserve methodology and its application relative to loan grades assigned to individual credits  management believed it was appropriate and prudent to establish the unallocated  economic oriented reserve component through a charge to the provision for loan losses 

table of contents the following table sets forth the breakdown of the allowance for loan losses by loan category for the periods indicated 
management believes the allowance can be allocated only on an approximate basis 
the allocation of the allowance to each category is not necessarily indicative of future losses and does not restrict the use of the allowance to absorb losses in any other category

table of contents nonperforming loans a loan is placed on non accrual status when  in management s judgment  the collection of the interest income appears doubtful 
interest receivable that has been accrued in prior years and is subsequently determined to have doubtful collectability is charged to the allowance for possible loan losses 
interest on loans that are classified as non accrual is recognized when received 
past due loans are loans whose principal or interest is past due days or more 
in some cases  where borrowers are experiencing financial difficulties  loans may be restructured to provide terms significantly different from the original contractual terms 
december  dollars in thousands loans accounted for on a non accrual basis installment loans and term loans contractually past due ninety days or more as to interest or principal payments and still accruing during  loans tied to the housing industry  acquisition  development and construction loans came under severe strain as housing prices fell sharply and sales activity slowed 
certain markets  where housing prices had risen sharply in recent years  suffered greater corrections than others 
the company s exposure to certain housing related loans primarily in northern florida resulted in deteriorating credit quality and caused most of the increase in non accrual loans seen above 
liquidity and rate sensitivity liquidity management involves the matching of the cash flow requirements of customers  who may be either depositors desiring to withdraw funds or borrowers needing assurance that sufficient funds will be available to meet their credit needs  and the ability of our company to meet those needs 
we seek to meet liquidity requirements primarily through management of short term investments principally interest bearing deposits in banks and monthly amortizing loans 
another source of liquidity is the repayment of maturing single payment loans 
in addition  our company maintains relationships with correspondent banks including the fhlb and frb  which could provide funds on short notice  if needed 
a principal objective of our asset liability management strategy is to minimize its exposure to changes in interest rates by matching the maturity and repricing horizons of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
this strategy is overseen in part through the direction of our asset and liability committee the alco committee which establishes policies and monitors results to control interest rate sensitivity 

table of contents as part of our interest rate risk management policy  the alco committee examines the extent to which its assets and liabilities are interest rate sensitive and monitors its interest rate sensitivity gap 
an asset or liability is considered to be interest rate sensitive if it will reprice or mature within the time period analyzed  usually one year or less 
the interest rate sensitivity gap is the difference between the interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities scheduled to mature or reprice within such time period 
a gap is considered positive when the amount of interest rate sensitive assets exceeds the amount of interest rate sensitive liabilities 
a gap is considered negative when the amount of interest rate sensitive liabilities exceeds the interest rate sensitive assets 
during a period of rising interest rates  a negative gap would tend to adversely affect net interest income  while a positive gap would tend to result in an increase in net interest income 
during a period of falling interest rates  a negative gap would tend to result in an increase in net interest income  while a positive gap would tend to adversely affect net interest income 
if our assets and liabilities were equally flexible and moved concurrently  the impact of any increase or decrease in interest rates on net interest income would be minimal 
a simple interest rate gap analysis by itself may not be an accurate indicator of how net interest income will be affected by changes in interest rates 
accordingly  the alco committee also evaluates how the repayment of particular assets and liabilities is impacted by changes in interest rates 
income associated with interest earning assets and costs associated with interest bearing liabilities may not be affected uniformly by changes in interest rates 
in addition  the magnitude and duration of changes in interest rates may have a significant impact on net interest income 
for example  although certain assets and liabilities may have similar maturities or periods of repricing  they may not react identically to changes in market interest rates 
interest rates on certain types of assets and liabilities fluctuate in advance of changes in general market interest rates  while interest rates on other types may lag behind changes in general market rates 
in addition  certain assets  such as adjustable rate mortgage loans  have features generally referred to as interest rate caps which limit changes in interest rates on a short term basis and over the life of the asset 
in the event of a change in interest rates  prepayment and early withdrawal levels also could deviate significantly from those assumed in calculating the interest rate gap 
the ability of many borrowers to service their debts also may decrease in the event of an interest rate increase 
we manage the mix of asset and liability maturities in an effort to control the effects of changes in the general level of interest rates on net interest income 
except for its effect on the general level of interest rates  inflation does not have a material impact on the portfolio due to the rate variability and short term maturities of its earning assets 
in particular  approximately of the loan portfolio is comprised of loans which mature or reprice within one year or less 
mortgage loans  primarily with five to fifteen year maturities  are also made on a variable rate basis with rates being adjusted every one to five years 
additionally  of the investment portfolio has a contractual maturity within one year or less although a higher percentage has the possibility of a call 
the following table sets forth the distribution of the repricing of our earning assets and interest bearing liabilities as of december   the interest rate sensitivity gap ie  interest rate sensitive assets divided by interest rate sensitivity liabilities  the cumulative interest rate sensitivity gap ratio ie  interest rate sensitive assets divided by interest rate sensitive liabilities and the cumulative sensitivity gap ratio 
the table also sets forth the time periods in which earning assets and liabilities will mature or may reprice in accordance with their contractual terms 
however  the table does not necessarily indicate the impact of general interest rate movements on the net interest margin since the repricing of various categories of assets and liabilities is subject to competitive pressures and the needs of our customers 
in addition  various assets and liabilities indicated as repricing within the same period may in fact reprice at different times within such period and at different rates

the investment portfolio consists of securities  including equity securities with readily determinable fair values  which are classified as available for sale and recorded at fair value with unrealized gains and losses excluded from earnings and reported in accumulated other comprehensive income  net of the related deferred tax effect 
the amortization of premiums and accretion of discounts are recognized in interest income using methods approximating the interest method over the life of the securities 
realized gains and losses  determined on the basis of the cost of specific securities sold  are included in earnings on the settlement date 
declines in the fair value of securities below their cost that are deemed to be other than temporary are reflected in earnings as realized losses 
the company s methodology for determining whether other than temporary impairment losses exist include management considering the length of time and the extent to which the fair value has been less than cost  the financial condition and near term prospects of the issuer and the intent and ability of the company to retain its investment in the issuer for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in fair value 
management evaluates securities for other than temporary impairment at least on a quarterly basis  and more frequently when economic or market concerns warrant such evaluation 
substantially all of the unrealized losses on debt securities are related to changes in interest rates and do not affect the expected cash flows of the issuer or underlying collateral 
all unrealized losses are considered temporary because each security carries an acceptable investment grade and the company has the intent and ability to hold to maturity

the issuance and sale of these securities was a private placement exempt from registration pursuant to section of the securities act of  as amended 
cumulative dividends on the preferred shares will accrue on the liquidation preference at a rate of per annum for the first five years and at a rate of per annum thereafter  but such dividends will be paid only if  as and when declared by the company s board of directors 
the preferred shares have no maturity date and rank senior to the common stock and pari passu with the company s other authorized preferred stock  of which no shares are currently designated or outstanding with respect to the payment of dividends and distributions and amounts payable upon liquidation  dissolution and winding up of the company 
subject to the approval of the board of governors of the federal reserve system  the preferred shares are redeemable at the option of the company at of their liquidation preference  provided that the preferred shares may be redeemed prior to the first dividend payment date falling after the third anniversary of the closing date february  only if i the company has raised aggregate gross proceeds in one or more qualified equity offerings as defined in the letter agreement dated november  between the company and the treasury  including the securities purchase agreement standard terms incorporated by reference therein collectively  the purchase agreement in excess of million and ii the aggregate redemption price does not exceed the aggregate net proceeds from such qualified equity offerings

capital regulations the capital resources of our company are monitored on a periodic basis by state and federal regulatory authorities 
during  we increased our capital by million or 
the increase is attributed to the issuance of the preferred shares under the cpp 
other capital related transactions  such as common stock issuances through the exercise of stock options and restricted stock  changes in unrealized losses on investment securities and repurchase of treasury shares combined to account for only a small change in the capital of the company 
in accordance with risk capital guidelines issued by the federal reserve  we are required to maintain a minimum standard of total capital to risk weighted assets of

table of contents inflation the consolidated financial statements and related consolidated financial data presented herein have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and practices within the banking industry which require the measurement of financial position and operating results in terms of historical dollars without considering the changes in the relative purchasing power of money over time due to inflation 
unlike most industrial companies  virtually all the assets and liabilities of a financial institution are monetary in nature 
as a result  interest rates have a more significant impact on a financial institution s performance than the effects of general levels of inflation

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed only to u 
s 
dollar interest rate changes and  accordingly  we manage exposure by considering the possible changes in the net interest margin 
we do not have any trading instruments nor do we classify any portion of the investment portfolio as held for trading 
we do not engage in any hedging activities or enter into any derivative instruments with a higher degree of risk than mortgage backed securities  which are commonly  pass through securities 
finally  we have no exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risk  commodity price risk and other market risks 
interest rates play a major part in the net interest income of a financial institution 
the sensitivity to rate changes is known as interest rate risk 
the repricing of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities can influence the changes in net interest income 
as part of our asset liability management program  the timing of repriced assets and liabilities is referred to as gap management 
our policy is to maintain a gap ratio in the one year time horizon of 
to 
as indicated by the gap analysis included in this annual report  we are somewhat asset sensitive in relation to changes in market interest rates 
being asset sensitive would result in net interest income increasing in a rising rate environment and decreasing in a declining rate environment 
we use simulation analysis to monitor changes in net interest income due to changes in market interest rates 
the simulation of rising  declining and flat interest rate scenarios allow management to monitor and adjust interest rate sensitivity to minimize the impact of market interest rate swings 
the analysis of the impact on net interest income over a twelve month period is subjected to a gradual basis points increase or basis points decrease in market rates on net interest income and is monitored on a quarterly basis 
our most recent simulation model projects net interest income would increase if rates rise basis points gradually over the next year 
a down basis points scenario is irrelevant at this time due to current market rates being at or near zero since the last fomc reduction of the fed target rate on december
