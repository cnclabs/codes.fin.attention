index to financial statements in  we will continue to expand the sterling franchise and increase shareholder value through our strategy of focusing on all the constituencies within the small to medium sized business segment  more specifically companies with annual revenues of million or less 
this includes business owners  their employees  their family members  and people who live and work around our locations 
we pride ourselves on building long term relationships with our customers  knowing their business  and helping them achieve their goals 
on february   we completed the acquisition of ten branches located in the dallas and fort worth  texas areas from first horizon national corp 
first horizon 
in addition to these ten bank branches  we also acquired land for possible future sterling banking centers in lewisville  arlington and fort worth  texas 
this transaction allows us to achieve a critical presence in dallas  texas and an entry into the growing fort worth  texas market 
critical accounting policies an understanding of our accounting policies is important to an understanding of our reported results 
accounting policies are described in detail in note to the consolidated financial statements in this annual report of form k 
certain of our accounting policies are considered to be critical because they involve subjective judgment  estimation by management or are particularly complex in their nature 
fair value of financial instruments 
effective january   we determined the fair market values of our financial instruments based on the fair value hierarchy established in statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
sfas fair value measurements which requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value 
in accordance with financial accounting standards board staff position fsp no 
sfas  effective date of fasb statement no 
 the company delayed the application of sfas for non financial assets and non financial liabilities  until january  sfas describes three levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair value 
level inputs include quoted market prices  where available 
if such quoted market prices are not available level inputs are used 
these inputs are based upon internally developed models that primarily use observable market based parameters 
level inputs are unobservable inputs which are typically based on an entity s own assumptions  as there is little  if any  related market activity 
our assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement in its entirety requires judgment  and considers factors specific to the asset or liability 
allowance for credit losses 
the allowance for credit losses is a valuation allowance for probable losses incurred on loans and binding commitments 
losses are charged to the allowance when the loss actually occurs or when a determination is made that a probable loss has occurred 
recoveries are credited to the allowance at the time of recovery 
throughout the year  management estimates the probable level of losses to determine whether the allowance for credit losses is adequate to absorb losses inherent in the existing portfolio 
based on these estimates  an amount is charged to the provision for credit losses and credited to the allowance for credit losses in order to adjust the allowance to a level determined to be adequate to absorb losses 
management s judgment as to the level of probable losses on existing loans involves the consideration of current economic conditions and their estimated effects on specific borrowers  an evaluation of the existing relationships among loans  potential credit losses and the present level of the allowance  results of examinations of the loan portfolio by regulatory agencies  and management s internal review of the loan portfolio 
in determining the collectibility of certain loans  management also considers the fair value of any underlying collateral 
the amount ultimately realized may differ from the carrying value of these assets because of economic  operating or other conditions beyond our control 
please refer to the subsequent discussion of allowance for credit losses below as well as in note to the consolidated financial statements for additional insight into management s approach and methodology in estimating the allowance for credit losses 
goodwill and other intangibles 
goodwill and intangible assets that have indefinite useful lives are subject to an annual evaluation of whether any impairment has occurred 
if any such impairment is determined to have 
table of contents 
index to financial statements occurred  a write down would be recorded 
intangible assets consist primarily of core deposits and customer relationships 
intangible assets with definite useful lives are amortized on an accelerated basis over the years expected to be benefited  which we believe is approximately years 
based on our annual goodwill impairment test  management does not believe any of our goodwill is impaired as of december  while we believe no impairment existed at december  under accounting standards applicable at that date  different conditions or assumptions  or changes in cash flows or profitability  if significantly negative or unfavorable  could have a material adverse effect on the outcome of our impairment evaluation and financial condition or future results of operations 
derivatives 
we may designate a derivative as either an accounting hedge of the fair value of a recognized fixed rate asset or an unrecognized firm commitment fair value hedge or an accounting hedge of a forecasted transaction or of the variability of future cash flows of a floating rate asset or liability cash flow hedge 
all derivatives are recorded as other assets or other liabilities on the balance sheet at their respective fair values 
to the extent a hedge is considered effective  changes in the fair value of a derivative that is designated and qualifies as a cash flow hedge are recorded in other comprehensive income  net of income taxes 
for all hedge relationships  ineffectiveness resulting from differences between the changes in fair value or cash flows of the hedged item and changes in fair value of the derivative are recognized as other income in the results of operations 
stock based compensation 
the company s stock based compensation policy applies to all forms of stock based compensation including stock options  restricted stock units  shares acquired under the employee stock purchase plan and performance based phantom units 
all stock based compensation is accounted for under the fair value method as required by generally accepted accounting principles in the united states 
the expense associated with stock based compensation is recognized over the vesting period of each individual arrangement 
the fair value of each stock option award is estimated on the date of grant using a black scholes merton option valuation model 
the fair value of restricted stock and phantom stock units is based on the fair value at the date of grant using the current market price on the grant date 
the fair value of each performance based share unit is estimated based on expected performance goals being attained 
compensation expense associated with the employee stock purchase plan is determined using a black scholes merton option pricing formula 
please refer to note to the consolidated financial statements for further information 
disclosures of stock based compensation are also included in note to the consolidated financial statements

index to financial statements net interest income 
net interest income represents the amount by which interest income on interest earning assets  including loans and securities  exceeds interest paid on interest bearing liabilities  including deposits and borrowings 
net interest income is our principal source of earnings 
interest rate fluctuations  as well as changes in the amount and type of earning assets and liabilities  combine to affect net interest income 
the federal reserve board significantly influences market interest rates  including rates offered for loans and deposits by many financial institutions 
generally  when the federal open market committee fomc of the federal reserve board changes the target overnight interest rate charged by banks  the market responds with a similar change in the prime lending rate 
our loan portfolio is impacted significantly by changes in short term interest rates

taxable equivalent adjustments are the result of increasing income from nontaxable loans and securities by an amount equal to the taxes that would be paid if the income were fully taxable based on a federal tax rate  thus making tax exempt yields comparable to taxable asset yields 
the net interest margin is equal to net interest income divided by average total interest earning assets

the preferred trust securities of each trust represent preferred beneficial interests in the assets of the respective trusts and are subject to mandatory redemption upon payments of the junior subordinated debentures held by the trust 
the common securities of each trust are wholly owned by sterling bancshares 
each trust s ability to pay amounts due on the trust preferred securities is solely dependent upon sterling bancshares making payment on the related junior subordinated debentures 
sterling bancshares obligations under the junior subordinated debentures and other relevant trust agreements  in aggregate  constitute a full and unconditional guarantee by sterling bancshares of each respective trust s obligations under the trust securities issued by each respective trust 
each issuance of trust preferred securities outstanding is mandatorily redeemable years after issuance and is callable beginning five years after issuance if certain conditions are met including the receipt of appropriate regulatory approvals 
the trust preferred securities may be prepaid earlier upon the occurrence and continuation of certain events including a change in their tax status or regulatory capital treatment

our nonperforming and past due loans are substantially collateralized by assets  with any excess of loan balances over collateral values specifically allocated in the allowance for loan losses 
on an ongoing basis  we receive updated appraisals on loans secured by real estate  particularly those categorized as nonperforming loans and potential problem loans 
in those instances where updated appraisals reflect reduced collateral values  an evaluation of the borrower s overall financial condition is made to determine the need  if any  for possible write downs or appropriate additions to the allowance for loan losses 
a loan is impaired when  based on current information and events  it is probable that a creditor will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement 
potential problem loans are those loans that are not classified as nonperforming or impaired but where information known by management indicates that the borrower may be unable to comply with the present terms 
management identifies these loans through its ongoing loan review process 
as of december   potential problem loans increased million to million at december  from million at december

total exposure to semgroup at december  totaled million  representing approximately of our total nonperforming loans 
in addition  a limited number of loans secured by owner occupied commercial real estate moved to a nonperforming status during these loans are expected to have minimal losses due to the low loan to value of each of these real estate secured credits 
accruing loans days past due or more were million and million at december  and  respectively 
the balance at december  consists primarily of two loans where the loans are well secured and in the process of collection 
interest foregone on nonaccrual loans was approximately million  million and million  respectively  during  and allowance for credit losses 
the allowance for credit losses and the related provision for credit losses are determined based on the historical credit loss experience  changes in the loan portfolio  including size  mix and risk of the individual loans  and current economic conditions 
we monitor economic conditions in our local market areas and the probable impact on borrowers  on past due amounts  on related collateral values  on the number and size of the nonperforming loans and on the resulting amount of charge offs for the period 
the provision for credit losses for was million as compared to million for this increase in provision was due  in part  to the semgroup borrowing relationship totaling million which resulted in additional provision of approximately million in additionally  we recorded approximately million in provision for credit losses related to hurricane ike 
approximately million of outstanding loans have been identified that have collateral located in the identified hurricane evacuation zones near the coast which were the most severely affected areas 
this provision represents our best estimate at this time of possible losses that may occur in these areas 
net charge offs were million or of average loans for compared to million or of average loans during the increase in net charge offs during was due in part to certain auto dealer loans that were identified and several other older nonperforming loans which we sold as part of a clean up effort

index to financial statements the allowance for credit losses is a valuation allowance consisting of the allowance for loan losses and the allowance for unfunded lending commitments 
it is established through charges to earnings in the form of a provision for credit losses 
based on an evaluation of the loan portfolio  management presents a quarterly review of the allowance for credit losses to the bank s board of directors  indicating any changes in the allowance since the last review and any recommendations as to adjustments in the allowance 
in making our evaluation  we consider the industry diversification of the commercial loan portfolio and the effect of changes in the local real estate market on collateral values 
we also consider the results of recent regulatory examinations  our history of credit experience and our ongoing internal credit reviews 
the allowance for loan losses at december  was million and represented of total loans 
the allowance for loan losses at december  was of nonperforming loans  down from at december  the allowance for unfunded lending commitments was million at december  and thousand at december  we continually monitor economic conditions in our local market areas and the probable impact on borrowers  past due amounts  related collateral values  the number and size of nonperforming loans and on the resulting amount of charge offs for the period 
we have several systems and procedures in place to assist in managing the overall quality of the loan portfolio 
in addition to established underwriting guidelines and approval processes  we monitor delinquency levels for any negative or adverse trends 
we also perform reviews of the loan portfolios on a regular basis to identify troubled loans and to assess their overall probability of collection 
ongoing portfolio reviews are conducted by our internal loan review department under an established loan review program 
we are targeting a loan review penetration of at least annually of the total commercial and real estate loan portfolios 
through the loan review process  we maintain an internally classified loan list  which  along with the delinquency list of loans  helps us assess the overall quality of the loan portfolios and the adequacy of the allowance for credit losses 
loans on this listing are classified as substandard  doubtful or loss based on probability of repayment  collateral valuation and related collectibility 
all doubtful and loss loans are considered impaired 
substandard loans are defined as impaired when based on current information and events  it is probable that we will be unable to collect all amounts due  both interest and principal  according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement 
the allowance for loan losses related to impaired loans is determined based on the difference between the carrying value of the impaired loan and its fair value 
the fair value is determined based on the present value of expected cash flows discounted at the loan s effective interest rate or  as a practical expedient  the loan s observable market price or the fair value of the collateral if the loan is collateral dependent 
loans classified as substandard have clear and defined weaknesses such as highly leveraged positions  unfavorable financial ratios  uncertain repayment sources or poor financial condition  which may jeopardize the loan s recoverability 
loans classified as doubtful have characteristics similar to substandard loans but with an increased risk that a loss may occur or that at least a portion of the loan may require a charge off if liquidated at present 
although loans classified as substandard do not duplicate loans classified as doubtful  both substandard and doubtful loans include some loans that are delinquent at least days or on nonaccrual status 
loans classified as loss are those loans that are in the process of being charged off 
at december   substandard loans totaled million  of which million were loans designated as nonaccrual  and doubtful and loss loans totaled million and thousand  respectively  all of which were designated as nonaccrual 

table of contents 
index to financial statements in addition to the internally classified loan list and delinquency list of loans  we maintain a separate watch list which further aids in monitoring the loan portfolios 
watch list loans show warning elements  deficiencies that require attention in the short run  or where pertinent ratios of the loan account have weakened to a point where more frequent monitoring is warranted 
these loans do not have all the characteristics of a classified loan substandard or doubtful but do show weakened elements as compared with those of a satisfactory credit 
we review these loans in assessing the adequacy of the allowance for credit losses 
as of december  and  watch list loans totaled million and million  respectively 
management assigns loan grades by individual loan and allocations are made within each loan grade 
loans are assigned a grade according to payment history  collateral values  and financial condition of the borrower 
the bank maintains an adequate allowance for credit losses through its watch list classifications  allocating an increasing amount as the severity of a problem loan increases 
the bank maintains an unallocated allowance for satisfactory non classified credits based  in part  on the average of the last three years actual net charge offs

the overall interest rate risk position and strategies for the management of interest rate risk are reviewed by senior management  the asset liability management committee and our board of directors on an ongoing basis 
we measure interest rate risk using a variety of methodologies including  but not limited to  dynamic simulation analysis and static balance sheet rate shocks 
dynamic simulation analysis is the primary tool used to measure interest rate risk and allows us to model the effects of non parallel movements in multiple yield curves  changes in borrower and depositor behaviors  changes in loan and deposit pricing  and changes in loan and deposit portfolio compositions and growth rates over a month horizon 

table of contents 
index to financial statements we utilize static balance sheet rate shocks to estimate the potential impact on net interest income of changes in interest rates under various rate scenarios 
this analysis estimates a percentage of change in these metrics from the stable rate base scenario versus alternative scenarios of rising and falling market interest rates by instantaneously shocking a static balance sheet 
the following table summarizes the simulated change over a month horizon as of december  and changes in interest rates basis points increase decrease in net interest income december  base december  base each rate scenario reflects unique prepayment and repricing assumptions 
because of uncertainties related to customer behaviors  loan and deposit pricing levels  competitor behaviors  and socio economic factors that could affect the shape of the yield curve  this analysis is not intended to and does not provide a precise forecast of the affect actual changes in market rates will have on us 
the interest rate sensitivity analysis includes assumptions that i the composition of our interest sensitive assets and liabilities existing at year end will remain constant over the measurement period  and ii changes in market rates are parallel and instantaneous across the yield curve regardless of duration or repricing characteristics of specific assets or liabilities 
further  this analysis does not contemplate any actions that we might undertake in response to changes in market factors 
accordingly  this analysis is not intended to and does not provide a precise forecast of the effect actual changes in market rates will have on us

liquidity the objectives of our liquidity management is to maintain our ability to meet day to day deposit withdrawals and other payment obligations  to raise funds to support asset growth  to maintain reserve requirements and otherwise operate on an ongoing basis 
we strive to manage a liquidity position sufficient to meet operating requirements while maintaining an appropriate balance between assets and liabilities to meet the expectations of our shareholders 
in recent years  our liquidity needs have primarily been met by growth in deposits including brokered certificates of deposit 
in addition to deposits  we have access to funds from correspondent banks and from the federal home loan bank  supplemented by amortizing securities and loan portfolios 
sterling bancshares must provide for its own liquidity and fund its own obligations 
the primary source of sterling bancshares revenues is from dividends declared by the bank 
there are statutory and regulatory provisions that could limit the ability of the bank to pay dividends to sterling bancshares
