overview of the company the company is a provider of high technology  digital based printing solutions to the commercial print segment of the graphics communications industry 
the company designs  manufactures and distributes proprietary and non proprietary solutions aimed at serving the needs of a wide range of print service providers worldwide 
our proprietary digital imaging and advanced technology consumables offer superior business solutions for commercial printing focusing on the growing need for short run  high quality color applications 
we are helping to lead the industry s transformation from analog print production methods to digital imaging technology 
we are a leader in the development of advanced printing systems using digital imaging equipment  workflow and consumables based solutions that economically benefit the user through streamlined operations and chemistry free  environmentally responsible solutions 
we are also a leading sales and service channel across a broadly served market in the small to mid sized commercial  quick and in plant printing segments 
presstek s business model is a capital equipment and consumables model 
in this model  approximately two thirds of our revenue is recurring revenue 
our model is designed so that each placement of either a di press or a ctp system generally results in recurring aftermarket revenue for consumables and service 
through our various operations  we provide advanced digital print solutions through the development and manufacture of digital laser imaging equipment and advanced technology chemistry free printing plates  which we call consumables  for commercial and in plant print providers targeting the growing market for high quality  fast turnaround short run color printing  are a leading sales and services company delivering presstek digital solutions and solutions from other manufacturing partners through our direct sales and service force and through distribution partners worldwide  manufacture semiconductor solid state laser diodes for presstek imaging applications and for use in external applications  and manufacture and distribute printing plates for conventional print applications 
we have developed di solution  a proprietary system by which digital images are transferred onto printing plates for direct imaging on press applications 
our advanced di technology is integrated into a direct imaging press to produce a waterless  easy to use  high quality printing press that is fully automated and provides our users with competitive advantages over alternative print technologies 
we believe that our process results in a di press which  in combination with our proprietary printing plates and streamlined workflow  produces a superior print solution 
by combining advanced digital technology with the reliability and economic advantages of offset printing  we believe our customers are better able to grow their businesses  generate higher profits and better serve the needs of their customers 
similar digital imaging technologies are used in our ctp systems 
our presstek segment also designs and manufactures ctp systems that incorporate our technology to image our chemistry free printing plates 
our chemistry free digital imaging systems enable customers to produce high quality  full color lithographic printed materials more quickly and cost effectively than conventional methods that employ more complicated workflows and toxic chemical processing 
this results in reduced printing cycle time and lowers the effective cost of production for commercial printers 
our solutions make it more cost effective for printers to meet the increasing demand for shorter print runs  higher quality color and faster turn around times 
we have executed a major transformation in the way we go to market 
in the past  we had been reliant on oem partners to deliver our business solutions to customers 
today  more than of our sales are through our own distribution channels 
in addition to marketing  selling and servicing our proprietary digital products  we also market  sell and service traditional or analog products for the commercial print market 
this analog equipment is manufactured by third party strategic partners and the analog consumables are manufactured by either us or our strategic partners 
the addition of these non proprietary products and our ability to directly sell and service them was made possible by the ab dick acquisition and precision acquisition  which we completed in our operations are currently organized into two segments i presstek and ii lasertel 
segment operating results are based on the current organizational structure as reviewed by our management to evaluate the results of each business 
a description of the types of products and services provided by each business segment follows 
presstek is primarily engaged in the development  manufacture  sale and servicing of our business solutions using patented digital imaging systems and patented printing plate technologies 
we also provide traditional  analog systems and related equipment and supplies for the graphic arts and printing industries 
lasertel manufactures and develops high powered laser diodes and related laser products for presstek and for sale to external customers 
on september   the board of directors approved a plan to market the lasertel subsidiary for sale  as such the company has presented the results of operations of this subsidiary within discontinued operations 
we generate revenue through four main sources i the sale of our equipment and related workflow software  including di presses and ctp devices  ii the sale of high powered laser diodes for the graphic arts  defense and industrial sectors  iii the sale of our proprietary and non proprietary consumables and supplies  and iv the servicing of offset printing systems and analog and ctp systems and related equipment 
strategy our business strategy is centered on maximizing the sale of consumable products  such as printing plates  and therefore our business efforts focus on the sale of consumable burning engines such as our di presses and ctp devices  as well as the servicing of customers using our business solutions 
our strategy centers on increasing the number of our di and ctp units  which increases the demand for our consumables 
to complement our direct sales efforts  in certain territories  we maintain relationships with key press manufacturers such as ryobi  heidelberg  and kba  who market printing presses and or press solutions that use our proprietary consumables 
another method of growing the market for consumables is to develop consumables that can be imaged by non presstek devices 
in addition to expanding the base of our di and ctp units  an element of our focus is to reach beyond our proprietary systems and penetrate the installed base of ctp devices in all market segments with our chemistry free and process free offerings 
the first step in executing this strategy was the launch of our aurora chemistry free printing plate designed to be used with ctp units manufactured by thermal ctp market leaders  such as screen and kodak 
we continue to work with other ctp manufacturers to qualify our consumables on their systems 
we believe this shift in strategy fundamentally enhances our ability to expand and control our business 
since  management has been taking steps to improve the company s cost structure and strengthen its balance sheet in order to enable presstek to increase profitability on improved revenue growth when economic conditions in the united states and elsewhere recover 
our improved level of profitability and balance sheet improvements to date are  in large part  the result of our business improvement plan the bip as described in more detail below  as well as our review and strengthening of inventory and accounts receivable 
highlights in fiscal  deteriorating worldwide economic conditions caused significant volatility in many markets which adversely impacted our business 
overall commercial print industry volume is down as companies have cut back on general advertising and promotional materials  and uncertainty regarding the economy and tightening credit markets have led to delays in capital purchase decisions 
as a result of this volatility  as well as continuing erosion due to technological changes in our traditional product business  revenues in fiscal of million were down million  or  compared to the prior year 
the bip plan resulted in significant reductions in costs  improved operating efficiencies  greater cash flow  and helped reduce debt levels 
the cost benefits from this plan  as discussed below  have been very important in returning the company to profitability in fiscal despite the challenging economic headwinds 
additional cost reduction actions  however  were implemented during the latter part of fiscal as the company aggressively addressed current and expected future economic conditions 
management objectives our vision is to provide high quality  fully integrated digital solutions and services that enable us to form an all encompassing relationship with our customers 
our business strategy is to offer innovative digital imaging and plate technologies that address the opportunities of today and tomorrow in the graphic arts and commercial printing markets across the globe 
this strategy includes several imperatives focus on the growth of our consumables product line  emphasize attractive market segments such as larger print providers  focus on growing existing segments such as print shops with less than employees  enable customers to better compete by offering a more diverse range of products  continue to expand solutions that meet the growth in demand for short run  fast turnaround high quality color printing  and provide environmentally responsible solutions through our application of technology 
business improvement plan in the fourth quarter of fiscal  we announced the bip 
the plan involves virtually every aspect of the business and includes pricing actions  improved manufacturing efficiencies  increased utilization of field service resources  right sizing of operating expenses  and cash flow improvements driven by working capital reductions and the sale of selected real estate assets 
the bip plan  as well as additional cost actions implemented during the fourth quarter of fiscal  accounted for a majority of the million of restructuring charges recorded during fiscal since the second quarter of fiscal  headcount has been reduced by  leased facilities have been consolidated  operating expenses  excluding special charges  have been reduced from million in the second quarter of fiscal to million in the fourth quarter of fiscal  a decline of  working capital has decreased from million at june  to million at january   short term debt decreased by million  and in the third quarter of fiscal the company completed the sale of real estate located in tucson  az for million  of which the net proceeds were used to pay down debt 
the sale of this property included a leaseback of a portion of the facility for the lasertel operations 
internal review beginning in the third quarter of fiscal  we commenced a self initiated internal review of certain practices and procedures surrounding inventory  accounts receivable and commercial receivable terms 
we conducted a worldwide review of accounts receivable  conducted a worldwide physical inventory to assess the existence and valuation of inventory  and reviewed revenue practices surrounding the commercial terms granted in certain transactions  resulting in an enhanced revenue recognition policy 
the culmination of these actions resulted in increased professional fees during the latter part of fiscal and a negative impact to revenue in the fourth quarter of fiscal and the first quarter of fiscal largely due to the disruption in our european operations related to the business reviews  as well as tightened commercial receivable terms

in the event that we are unable to have a new revolving line of credit in place by november  we expect to be able to pay off our existing revolver and term loan through a combination of the million in cash at january   million in cash received in january from our settlement with continental casualty company  net cash generated from operations  and if needed  cash received from other sources 
other sources could include cash received from the sale of our lasertel business  financing from new asset based lending agreements  and the sale leaseback of currently owned property 
we believe that existing funds  cash flows from operations  and cash available from other sources as discussed above will be sufficient to satisfy cash requirements through at least the next months 
however  any inability to obtain adequate financing from debt and equity sources could force us to self fund capital expenditures and strategic initiatives  forgo certain opportunities  or possibly discontinue certain of our operations 
similarly  we cannot be assured that such financing  as needed  would be available on acceptable terms 
contractual obligations our contractual obligations at january  consist of the following in thousands payments due by period total less than one year one to three years three to five years five or more years senior secured credit facilities purchase commitments royalty obligation operating leases total contractual obligations in fiscal  we entered into an agreement with fuji  whereby minimum royalty payments to fuji are required based on specified sales volumes of our a format size four color sheet fed press 
the agreement provides for total royalty payments to be no less than million and not greater than million over the life of the agreement 
as of january   the company had paid fuji million related to this agreement 
from time to time we have engaged in sales of equipment that is leased by or intended to be leased by a third party purchaser to another party 
in certain situations  we may retain recourse obligations to a financing institution involved in providing financing to the ultimate lessee in the event the lessee of the equipment defaults on its lease obligations 
in certain such instances  we may refurbish and remarket the equipment on behalf of the financing company  should the ultimate lessee default on payment of the lease 
in certain circumstances  should the resale price of such equipment fall below certain predetermined levels  we would  under these arrangements  reimburse the financing company for any such shortfall in sale price a shortfall payment 
the maximum contingent obligation under these shortfall payment arrangements is estimated to be million at january  effect of inflation inflation has not had a material impact on our financial conditions or results of operations  although this risk is discussed under item of this form k 
net operating loss carryforwards at january   we had net operating loss carryforwards for tax purposes totaling million  of which million resulted from stock option compensation deductions for us federal tax purposes and million resulted from operating losses 
to the extent that net operating losses resulting from stock option compensation deductions result in reduction of current taxes payable  the benefit will be credited directly to additional paid in capital 
the company s ability to utilize its net operating loss and credit carryforwards may be limited in the future if the company experiences an ownership change  as defined by the internal revenue code 
an ownership change occurs when the ownership percentage of or greater of stockholders changes by more than over a three year period 
critical accounting policies and estimates general our management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles as adopted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements 
estimates and assumptions also affect the amount of reported revenue and expenses during the period 
management believes the most judgmental estimates include those related to product returns  warranty obligations  allowances for doubtful accounts  slow moving and obsolete inventories  income taxes  the valuation of goodwill  intangible assets  long lived assets and deferred tax assets  stock based compensation and litigation 
we base our estimates and assumptions on historical experience and various other appropriate factors  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities and the amounts of revenue and expenses that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
for a complete discussion of our accounting policies  see note to our consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere herein 
revenue recognition the company recognizes revenue principally from the sale of products equipment  consumables  laser diodes and services equipment maintenance contracts  installation  training  support  and spare parts 
revenue is recognized when persuasive evidence of a sales arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  the price to the customer is fixed or determinable and collection is reasonably assured 
in accordance with staff accounting bulletin sab no 
revenue recognition sab and emerging issues task force eitf issue revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables eitf  when a sales arrangement contains multiple elements  such as equipment and services  revenue is allocated to each element using the residual method 
product revenue end users under the company s standard terms and conditions of sale of equipment  title and risk of loss are transferred to end user customers upon completion of installation and revenue is recognized at that time  unless customer acceptance is uncertain or significant deliverables remain 
sales of other products  including printing plates  are generally recognized at the time of shipment 
oems product revenue and any related royalties for products sold to original equipment manufacturers oem are recognized at the time of shipment as installation is not required and title and risk of loss generally pass at shipment 
oem contracts do not generally include price protection or product return rights  however  the company may elect  in certain circumstances  to accept returns of product 
distributors revenue for product sold to distributors  whereby the distributor is responsible for installation  is recognized at shipment  unless other revenue recognition criteria have not been met 
revenue for product sold to distributors under contracts which involve company installation of equipment is recognized upon installation  unless end user customer acceptance is uncertain  significant deliverables remain  or other revenue recognition criteria have not been met 
except in cases of contract termination which may include limited product return rights  distributor contracts do not generally include price protection or product return rights  however  the company may elect  in certain circumstances  to accept returns of product 
service and parts revenue revenue for installation services  including time and material billings  are recognized as services are rendered 
revenue associated with maintenance or extended service agreements is recognized ratably over the contract period 
revenue associated with training and support services is recognized as services are rendered 
certain fees and other reimbursements are recognized as revenue when the related services have been performed or the revenue is otherwise earned 
leases the company may offer customer financing to assist customers in the acquisition of presstek products 
at the time a financing transaction is consummated  which qualifies as a sales type lease  the company records equipment revenue equal to the net present value of future lease payments 
any remaining balance is recognized as finance income using the effective interest method over the term of the lease 
leases not qualifying as sales type leases are accounted for as operating leases 
the company recognizes revenue from operating leases on an accrual basis as the rental payments become due 
multiple element arrangements in accordance with sab and eitf  when a sales arrangement contains multiple elements  such as equipment  consumables or services  revenue is allocated to each element using the residual method 
rights of return a general right of return or cancellation does not exist once product is delivered to the customer  however  the company may elect  in certain circumstances  to accept returns of product 
product revenues are recorded net of estimated returns  which are adjusted periodically  based upon historical rates of return 
shipping and handling the company accounts for shipping and handling fees passed on to customers as revenue 
shipping and handling costs are reported as components of cost of revenue product and cost of revenue service and parts 
allowance for doubtful accounts the company s accounts receivable are customer obligations due under normal trade terms  carried at face value less an allowance for doubtful accounts 
the company evaluates its allowance for doubtful accounts on an ongoing basis and adjusts for potential credit losses when it determines that receivables are at risk for collection based upon the length of time receivables are outstanding  past transaction history and various other criteria 
receivables are written off against reserves in the period they are determined to be uncollectible 
inventory valuation inventories are valued at the lower of cost or net realizable value  with cost determined using the first in  first out method 
we assess the recoverability of inventory to determine whether adjustments for impairment are required 
inventory that is in excess of future requirements is written down to its estimated market value based upon forecasted demand for its products 
if actual demand is less favorable than what has been forecasted by management  additional inventory write downs may be required 
goodwill and intangible assets in accordance with the provisions of sfas  goodwill is tested at least annually  on the first business day of the third quarter  for impairment  or more frequently  if indicators of potential impairment arise 
the company s impairment review is based on a fair value test 
the company uses its judgment in assessing whether assets may have become impaired between annual impairment tests 
indicators such as unexpected adverse business conditions  economic factors  unanticipated technological change or competitive activities  loss of key personnel and acts by governments and courts may signal that an asset has been impaired 
should the fair value of goodwill  as determined by the company at any measurement date  fall below its carrying value  a charge for impairment of goodwill will be recorded in the period 
the company conducts ongoing assessments of the valuation of goodwill and determined no goodwill impairment existed during the year ended january  the company will continue to assess the valuation of goodwill throughout depending on market and economic conditions  goodwill impairment could be identified in which would result in a non cash impairment charge 
intangible assets with estimated lives and other long lived assets are reviewed for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset or asset group may not be recoverable in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets sfas 
recoverability of intangible assets with estimated lives and other long lived assets is measured by comparison of the carrying amount of an asset or asset group to future net undiscounted pretax cash flows expected to be generated by the asset or asset group 
if these comparisons indicate that an asset is not recoverable  the company will recognize an impairment loss for the amount by which the carrying value of the asset or asset group exceeds the related estimated fair value 
estimated fair value is based on either discounted future pretax operating cash flows or appraised values  depending on the nature of the asset 
the company determines the discount rate for this analysis based on the expected internal rate of return of the related business and does not allocate interest charges to the asset or asset group being measured 
considerable judgment is required to estimate discounted future operating cash flows 
patents represent the cost of preparing and filing applications to patent the company s proprietary technologies  in addition to certain patent and license rights obtained in the company s acquisitions or other related transactions 
such costs are amortized over a period ranging from five to seven years  beginning on the date the patents or rights are issued or acquired 
from time to time  the company enters into agreements with third parties under which the party will design and prototype a product incorporating presstek products and technology 
the capitalized costs associated with rights or intellectual property under these agreements will be amortized over the estimated sales life cycle and future cash flows of the product 
the company does not amortize capitalized costs related to either patents or purchased intellectual property until the respective asset has been placed into service 
the company amortizes license agreements and loan origination fees over the term of the respective agreement 
the amortizable lives of the company s other intangible assets are as follows trade names years customer relationships years software licenses years non compete covenants years stock based compensation on january   we adopted sfas no 
r  share based payment sfas r  using the modified prospective transition method 
we recognize the fair value of stock compensation in our consolidated financial statements over the requisite service period  generally on a straight line basis for time vested awards 
under the fair value recognition provisions of sfas r  stock based compensation cost is measured at the grant date based on the value of the award and is recognized as expense over the service period 
further  we have elected under sfas r to recognize the fair value of awards with pro rata vesting on a straight line basis 
previously  we had followed accounting principles board apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and related interpretations  which resulted in the accounting for employee share options at their intrinsic value in the consolidated financial statements 
under sfas r  our stock based compensation is affected by our stock price as well as valuation assumptions  including the volatility of our stock price  expected term of the option  risk free interest rate and expected dividends 
we utilize the black scholes valuation model for estimating the fair value on the date of grant of employee stock options 
we estimate volatility primarily using the historical volatility of presstek common stock over the expected term 
any changes in these assumptions may materially affect the estimated fair value of the stock based award 
accounting for income taxes the process of accounting for income taxes involves calculating our current tax obligation or refund and assessing the nature and measurements of temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences and our net operating loss nol and credit carryforwards  result in deferred tax assets and liabilities 
in each period  we assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from existing deferred tax liabilities or future taxable income in each jurisdiction 
to the extent we believe that we would not meet the test that recovery is more likely than not  we would establish a valuation allowance 
to the extent that we establish a valuation allowance or change this allowance in a period  we would adjust our tax provision or tax benefit in the consolidated statement of operations 
we use our judgment to determine our provision or benefit for income taxes  including estimates associated with uncertain tax positions and any valuation allowance recorded against our deferred tax assets based on the weight of all positive and negative factors  including cumulative trends in profitability 
we have accumulated us federal and state income tax nol carryforwards  research and experimentation tax credit carryforwards and alternative minimum tax credit carryforwards 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal  we reversed the valuation allowance on a deferred tax asset on our balance sheet primarily representing nols from our us operations 
previously  we had recorded a valuation allowance against deferred tax assets on our balance sheet until it was more likely than not that the tax assets related to either our us or international operations would be realized 
we assess our ability to utilize our nol and tax credit carryforwards in future periods and record any resulting adjustments that may require deferred income tax expense 
in addition  we reduce the deferred income tax asset for the benefits of nol and tax credit carryforwards utilized currently 
the future impact on net income may therefore be positive or negative  depending on the net result of such adjustments and charges 
based upon a review of historical operating performance through  and our expectation that we will generate profits in the us and our international operations in the foreseeable future  we continue to believe it is more likely than not that the us and international deferred tax assets  net of valuation allowance  will be fully realized 
recently issued accounting standards in  the company will adopt the remaining provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 fair value measurements  sfas for non financial assets 
the adoption of these provisions will not have an impact on the company s statements of operations or statement of financial position 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
r  business combinations 
this statement replaces sfas  business combinations  but retains the fundamental requirements of the statement that the acquisition method of accounting be used for all business combinations and for an acquirer to be identified for each business combination 
the statement seeks to improve financial reporting by establishing principles and requirements for how the acquirer a recognizes and measures in its financial statements the identifiable assets acquired  the liabilities assumed  and any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree  b recognizes and measures the goodwill acquired in the business combination or a gain from a bargain purchase option and c determines what information to disclose 
this statement is effective prospectively to business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after the beginning of the first annual reporting period beginning on or after december  the company will apply the provisions of sfas r to any acquisition after january  in december  the fasb issued sfas  noncontrolling interests in consolidated financial statements an amendment of arb this statement amends accounting research bulletin arb  consolidated financial statements  to establish accounting and reporting standards for the noncontrolling interest in a subsidiary and for the deconsolidation of a subsidiary 
the statement clarifies that a noncontrolling interest in a subsidiary is an ownership interest in the consolidated entity that should be reported as equity in the consolidated financial statements 
this statement is effective for fiscal years and interim periods within those fiscal years  beginning on or after december  the adoption of sfas will not impact the company s consolidated financial position and results of operations because the company does not have any noncontrolling interests 
in march  the financial accounting standards boards fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 disclosures about derivative instruments and hedging activities  sfas  which requires enhanced disclosures related to derivative instruments and hedging activities 
this statement is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years and interim periods beginning after november   and the disclosure requirements will be applicable for the company s consolidated financial statements 
off balance sheet arrangements we do not participate in transactions that generate relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships  such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities spes  which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purpose 
as of january   we were not involved in any unconsolidated spe transactions 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to a variety of market risks  including changes in interest rates primarily as a result of our borrowing activities  commodity price risk  and to a lesser extent  our investing activities and foreign currency fluctuations 
our borrowings are in variable rate instruments  with interest rates tied to either the prime rate or the libor 
a basis point change in these rates would have an impact of approximately million on our annual interest expense  assuming consistent levels of floating rate debt with those held at the end of fiscal commodity price movements create a market risk by affecting the price we must pay for certain raw materials 
the company purchases aluminum for use in manufacturing consumables products and is embedded in certain components we purchase from major suppliers 
from time to time  we enter into agreements with certain suppliers to manage price risks within a specified range of prices  however  our suppliers generally pass on significant commodity price changes to us in the form of revised prices on future purchases 
the company has not used commodity forward or option contracts to manage this market risk 
the company operates foreign subsidiaries in canada and europe and is exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk inherent in our sales commitments  anticipated sales  anticipated purchases and assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the us dollar 
presstek routinely evaluates whether the foreign exchange risk associated with its foreign currency exposures acts as a natural foreign currency hedge for other offsetting amounts denominated in the same currency 
the company has not hedged the net assets or net income of its foreign subsidiaries 
in addition  certain key customers and strategic partners are not located in the united states 
as a result  these parties may be subject to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates 
if their home country currency were to decrease in value relative to the us dollar  their ability to purchase and market our products could be adversely affected and our products may become less competitive to them 
this may have an adverse impact on our business 
likewise  certain major suppliers are not located in the united states and thus  such suppliers are subject to foreign exchange rate risks in transactions with us 
decreases in the value of their home country currency  versus that of the us dollar  could cause fluctuations in supply pricing which could have an adverse effect on our business
