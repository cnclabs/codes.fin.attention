the million decrease in reserves for unpaid losses and lae recognized in was attributable to million favorable development on claims incurred in the accident year  million favorable development on claims incurred in the accident year and million favorable development on claims incurred in the and prior accident years 
our ahis operating unit and personal lines operating unit accounted for million and million  respectively  of the decrease in reserves recognized in  partially offset by a million increase in reserves in our tga operating unit 
the decrease in reserves for our ahis operating unit was primarily the result of favorable claims development in the accident year with respect to the commercial automobile physical damage and commercial property lines of business  offset somewhat by unfavorable development in accident year with respect to commercial package liability coverage 
the decrease in reserves for our personal lines operating unit was primarily the result of favorable claims development in accident year the increase in reserves for our tga operating unit was primarily the result of unfavorable claims development in accident years and attributable to a small number of larger than normal commercial automobile liability claims  partially offset by favorable claims development on the general liability line of business in accident years through the million decrease in reserves for unpaid losses and lae recognized in was attributable to million favorable development on claims incurred in the accident year  million favorable development on claims incurred in the accident year and million favorable development on claims incurred in the and prior accident years 
our tga operating unit and ahis operating unit accounted for million and million  respectively  of the decrease in reserves for unpaid losses and lae recognized in loss experience data accumulated since our acquisition of the tga operating unit in january   were lower than the outside actuary s estimate initially used to establish loss reserves 
in late  our ahis operating unit experienced a small number of large  late reported general liability losses from earlier accident years 
as a result of this unexpected claim development  we increased our loss reserve estimates for this business at the end of however  subsequent experience suggested that the impact of these types of claims would be less significant in more recent accident years than originally anticipated due in part to coverage restrictions previously implemented 
the million decrease in reserves for unpaid losses and lae recognized in was primarily attributable to favorable loss development in our personal segment for accident years through at the time these loss reserves were initially established  new management was in the process of implementing operational changes designed to improve operating results 
however  the effectiveness of these operational changes could not be accurately predicted at that time 
as additional data emerged  it became increasingly clear that the actual results from these operational enhancements were developing more favorably than originally projected

ratings many insurance buyers  agents and brokers use the ratings assigned by am best and other rating agencies to assist them in assessing the financial strength and overall quality of the companies from which they are considering purchasing insurance 
am best has pooled its ratings of our three insurance company subsidiaries and assigned a financial strength rating of a excellent and an issuer credit rating of a to each of our individual insurance company subsidiaries and to the pool formed by our insurance company subsidiaries 
an a rating is the fourth highest of rating categories used by am best 
in evaluating an insurer s financial and operating performance  am best reviews the company s profitability  indebtedness and liquidity  as well as its book of business  the adequacy and soundness of its reinsurance  the quality and estimated market value of its assets  the adequacy of its loss reserves  the adequacy of its surplus  its capital structure  the experience and competence of its management and its market presence 
am best s ratings reflect its opinion of an insurer s financial strength  operating performance and ability to meet its obligations to policyholders and are not an evaluation directed at investors or recommendations to buy  sell or hold an insurer s stock 
competition the property casualty insurance market  our primary source of revenue  is highly competitive and  except for regulatory considerations  has very few barriers to entry 
according to am best  there were  property casualty insurance companies and  property casualty insurance groups operating in north america as of july  our ahis operating unit competes with a variety of large national standard commercial lines carriers such as the hartford  zurich north america  travelers and liberty mutual  as well as numerous smaller regional companies 
the primary competition for our tga operating unit s excess and surplus lines products includes such carriers as atlantic casualty insurance company  colony insurance company  burlington insurance company  penn america insurance group and  to a lesser extent  a number of national standard lines carriers such as zurich north america and the hartford 
our aerospace operating unit considers its primary competitors to be houston casualty corp  britt paulk  global aerospace  phoenix aviation  w 
brown company  aig and london aviation underwriters 
the primary competition for our heath xs operating unit includes such carriers as axis insurance company  colony insurance company  general star insurance company and lexington insurance company 
although our personal lines operating unit competes with large national insurers such as allstate  state farm and progressive  as a participant in the non standard personal automobile marketplace its competition is most directly associated with numerous regional and mono line insurance companies and managing general agencies 
our competitors include entities which have  or are affiliated with entities which have  greater financial and other resources than we have 
generally  we compete on price  customer service  coverages offered  claims handling  financial stability  agent commission and support  customer recognition and geographic coverage 
we compete with companies who use independent agents  captive agent networks  direct marketing channels or a combination thereof 
insurance regulation our insurance operations are regulated by the texas department of insurance  the arizona department of insurance and the oklahoma insurance department  as well as the applicable insurance department of each state in which we issue policies 
ahic  hic and hsic are required to file quarterly and annual statements of their financial condition prepared in accordance with statutory accounting practices with the texas department of insurance  the arizona department of insurance and the oklahoma insurance department  respectively  and the applicable insurance department of each state in which they write business 
the financial conditions of ahic  hic and hsic  including the adequacy of surplus  loss reserves and investments  are subject to review by the insurance department of their respective states of domicile 
periodic financial and market conduct examinations 
the texas department of insurance  the arizona department of insurance and the oklahoma insurance department have broad authority to enforce insurance laws and regulations through examinations  administrative orders  civil and criminal enforcement proceedings  and suspension or revocation of an insurer s certificate of authority or an agent s license 
the state insurance departments that have jurisdiction over our insurance company subsidiaries may conduct on site visits and examinations of the insurance companies affairs  especially as to their financial condition  ability to fulfill their obligations to policyholders  market conduct  claims practices and compliance with other laws and applicable regulations 
typically  these examinations are conducted every three to five years 
in addition  if circumstances dictate  regulators are authorized to conduct special or target examinations of insurance companies to address particular concerns or issues 
the results of these examinations can give rise to regulatory orders requiring remedial  injunctive or other corrective action on the part of the company that is the subject of the examination  assessment of fines or other penalties against that company 
in extreme cases  including actual or pending insolvency  the insurance department may take over  or appoint a receiver to take over  the management or operations of an insurer or an agent s business or assets 
guaranty funds 
all insurance companies are subject to assessments for state administered funds which cover the claims and expenses of insolvent or impaired insurers 
the size of the assessment is determined each year by the total claims on the fund that year 
each insurer is assessed a pro rata share based on its direct premiums written in that state 
payments to the fund may be recovered by the insurer through deductions from its premium taxes over a specified period of years 
transactions between insurance companies and their affiliates 
hallmark is also regulated as an insurance holding company by the texas department of insurance  the arizona department of insurance and the oklahoma insurance department 
financial transactions between hallmark or any of its affiliates and ahic  hic or hsic are subject to regulation 
transactions between our insurance company subsidiaries and their affiliates generally must be disclosed to state regulators  and prior regulatory approval generally is required before any material or extraordinary transaction may be consummated or any management agreement  services agreement  expense sharing arrangement or other contract providing for the rendering of services on a regular  systematic basis is implemented 
state regulators may refuse to approve or may delay approval of such a transaction  which may impact our ability to innovate or operate efficiently 
dividends 
dividends and distributions to hallmark by ahic  hic or hsic are restricted by the insurance regulations of the respective state in which each insurance company subsidiary is domiciled 
as a property casualty insurance company domiciled in the state of texas  ahic is limited in the payment of dividends to the amount of surplus profits arising from its business 
in estimating such profits  ahic must exclude all unexpired risks  all unpaid losses and all other debts due and payable or to become due and payable by ahic 
in addition  ahic must obtain the approval of the texas department of insurance before the payment of extraordinary dividends  which are defined as dividends or distributions of cash or other property the fair market value of which combined with the fair market value of each other dividend or distribution made in the preceding months exceeds the greater of statutory net income as of the prior december st or of statutory policyholders surplus as of the prior december st 
hic  domiciled in arizona  may pay dividends out of that part of its available surplus funds which is derived from realized net profits on its business 
without prior written approval from the arizona department of insurance  hic may not pay extraordinary dividends  which are defined as dividends or distributions of cash or other property the fair market value of which combined with the fair market value of each other dividend or distribution made in the preceding months exceeds the lesser of of statutory policyholders surplus as of the prior december st or net investment income as of the prior december st 
hsic  domiciled in oklahoma  may only pay dividends out of that part of its available surplus funds which is derived from realized net profits on its business 
without prior written approval from the oklahoma insurance department  hsic may not pay extraordinary dividends  which are defined as dividends or distributions of cash or other property the fair market value of which combined with the fair market value of each other dividend or distribution made in the preceding months exceeds the greater of of statutory policyholders surplus as of the prior december st or statutory net income as of the prior december st  not including realized capital gains 
risk based capital requirements 
the national association of insurance commissioners requires property casualty insurers to file a risk based capital calculation according to a specified formula 
the purpose of the formula is twofold to assess the adequacy of an insurer s statutory capital and surplus based upon a variety of factors such as potential risks related to investment portfolio  ceded reinsurance and product mix  and to assist state regulators under the rbc for insurers model act by providing thresholds at which a state commissioner is authorized and expected to take regulatory action 
as of december   the adjusted capital under the risk based capital calculation of each of our insurance company subsidiaries substantially exceeded the minimum requirements 
required licensing 
american hallmark insurance services  tga insurance managers  american hallmark general agency  inc  hallmark claims services  inc  and aerospace insurance managers are each subject to and in compliance with the licensing requirements of the department of insurance in each state in which they produce business 
these licenses govern  among other things  the types of insurance coverages  agency and claims services and products that we may offer consumers in these states 
such licenses typically are issued only after we file an appropriate application and satisfy prescribed criteria 
generally  each state requires one officer to maintain an agent license 
claims adjusters employed by us are also subject to the licensing requirements of each state in which they conduct business 
each employed claim adjuster either holds or has applied for the required licenses 
our premium finance subsidiaries are subject to licensing  financial reporting and certain financial requirements imposed by the texas department of insurance  as well as regulations promulgated by the texas office of consumer credit commissioner 
regulation of insurance rates and approval of policy forms 
the insurance laws of most states in which our subsidiaries operate require insurance companies to file insurance rate schedules and insurance policy forms for review and approval 
state insurance regulators have broad discretion in judging whether our rates are adequate  not excessive and not unfairly discriminatory and whether our policy forms comply with law 
the speed at which we can change our rates depends  in part  on the method by which the applicable state s rating laws are administered 
generally  state insurance regulators have the authority to disapprove our rates or request changes in our rates 
restrictions on cancellation  non renewal or withdrawal 
many states have laws and regulations that limit an insurance company s ability to exit a market 
for example  certain states limit an automobile insurance company s ability to cancel or not renew policies 
some states prohibit an insurance company from withdrawing from one or more lines of business in the state  except pursuant to a plan approved by the state insurance department 
in some states  this applies to significant reductions in the amount of insurance written  not just to a complete withdrawal 
state insurance departments may disapprove a plan that may lead to market disruption 
investment restrictions 
we are subject to state laws and regulations that require diversification of our investment portfolios and that limit the amount of investments in certain categories 
failure to comply with these laws and regulations would cause non conforming investments to be treated as non admitted assets for purposes of measuring statutory surplus and  in some instances  would require divestiture 
trade practices 
the manner in which we conduct the business of insurance is regulated by state statutes in an effort to prohibit practices that constitute unfair methods of competition or unfair or deceptive acts or practices 
prohibited practices include disseminating false information or advertising  defamation  boycotting  coercion and intimidation  false statements or entries  unfair discrimination  rebating  improper tie ins with lenders and the extension of credit  failure to maintain proper records  failure to maintain proper complaint handling procedures  and making false statements in connection with insurance applications for the purpose of obtaining a fee  commission or other benefit 
unfair claims practices 
generally  insurance companies  adjusting companies and individual claims adjusters are prohibited by state statutes from engaging in unfair claims practices on a flagrant basis or with such frequency to indicate a general business practice 
examples of unfair claims practices include misrepresenting pertinent facts or insurance policy provisions relating to coverages at issue  failing to acknowledge and act reasonably promptly upon communications with respect to claims arising under insurance policies  failing to adopt and implement reasonable standards for the prompt investigation and settlement of claims arising under insurance policies  failing to affirm or deny coverage of claims within a reasonable time after proof of loss statements have been completed  attempting to settle a claim for less than the amount to which a reasonable person would have believed such person was entitled  attempting to settle claims on the basis of an application that was altered without notice to  or knowledge and consent of  the insured  compelling insureds to institute suits to recover amounts due under policies by offering substantially less than the amounts ultimately recovered in suits brought by them  refusing to pay claims without conducting a reasonable investigation  making claim payments to an insured without indicating the coverage under which each payment is being made  delaying the investigation or payment of claims by requiring an insured  claimant or the physician of either to submit a preliminary claim report and then requiring the subsequent submission of formal proof of loss forms  both of which submissions contain substantially the same information  failing  in the case of claim denials or offers of compromise or settlement  to promptly provide a reasonable and accurate explanation of the basis for such actions  and not attempting in good faith to effectuate prompt  fair and equitable settlements of claims in which liability has become reasonably clear

critical accounting estimates and judgments the significant accounting policies requiring our estimates and judgments are discussed below 
such estimates and judgments are based on historical experience  changes in laws and regulations  observance of industry trends and information received from third parties 
while the estimates and judgments associated with the application of these accounting policies may be affected by different assumptions or conditions  we believe the estimates and judgments associated with the reported consolidated financial statement amounts are appropriate in the circumstances 
for additional discussion of our accounting policies  see note to the audited consolidated financial statements included in this report 
valuation of investments 
we complete a detailed analysis each quarter to assess whether any decline in the fair value of any investment below cost is deemed other than temporary 
all securities with an unrealized loss are reviewed 
we recognize an other than temporary impairment loss when an investment s value declines below cost  adjusted for accretion  amortization and previous other than temporary impairments and it is determined that the decline is other than temporary 
some of the factors considered in evaluating whether a decline in fair value is other than temporary include our ability and intent to retain the investment for a period of time sufficient to allow for an anticipated recovery in value  the recoverability of principal and interest for fixed maturity securities  or cost for equity securities  the length of time and extent to which the fair value has been less than amortized cost for fixed maturity securities  or cost for equity securities  and the financial condition and near term and long term prospects for the issuer  including the relevant industry conditions and trends  and implications of rating agency actions and offering prices 
when it is determined that an invested asset is other than temporarily impaired  the invested asset is written down to fair value  and the amount of the impairment is included in earnings as a realized investment loss 
the fair value then becomes the new cost basis of the investment  and any subsequent recoveries in fair value  other than amounts accreted to the expected recovery amount  are recognized at disposition 
we recognize a realized loss when impairment is deemed to be other than temporary even if a decision to sell an investment has not been made 
when we decide to sell a temporarily impaired available for sale investment and we do not expect the fair value of the investment to fully recover prior to the expected time of sale  the investment is deemed to be other than temporarily impaired in the period in which the decision to sell is made 
risks and uncertainties are inherent in our other than temporary decline in value assessment methodology 
risks and uncertainties include  but are not limited to  incorrect or overly optimistic assumptions about financial condition or liquidity  incorrect or overly optimistic assumptions about future prospects  unfavorable changes in economic or social conditions and unfavorable changes in interest rates or credit ratings 
deferred policy acquisition costs 
policy acquisition costs mainly commission  underwriting and marketing expenses that vary with and are primarily related to the production of new and renewal business are deferred and charged to operations over periods in which the related premiums are earned 
ceding commissions from reinsurers  which include expense allowances  are deferred and recognized over the period premiums are earned for the underlying policies reinsured 
the method followed in computing deferred policy acquisition costs limits the amount of such deferred costs to their estimated realizable value 
a premium deficiency exists if the sum of expected claim costs and claim adjustment expenses  unamortized acquisition costs  and maintenance costs exceeds related unearned premiums and expected investment income on those unearned premiums  as computed on a product line basis 
we routinely evaluate the realizability of deferred policy acquisition costs 
at december  and  there was no premium deficiency related to deferred policy acquisition costs 
goodwill 
our consolidated balance sheet as of december  includes goodwill of acquired businesses of million 
this amount has been recorded as a result of prior business acquisitions accounted for under the purchase method of accounting 
under statement of financial accounting standards no 
goodwill and other intangible assets sfas goodwill is tested for impairment annually 
we completed our last annual test for impairment during the fourth quarter of and determined that there was no indication of impairment 
a significant amount of judgment is required in performing goodwill impairment tests 
such tests include estimating the fair value of our reporting units 
as required by sfas  we compare the estimated fair value of each reporting unit with its carrying amount  including goodwill 
under sfas  fair value refers to the amount for which the entire reporting unit may be bought or sold 
methods for estimating reporting unit values include market quotations  asset and liability fair values and other valuation techniques  such as discounted cash flows and multiples of earnings or revenues 
with the exception of market quotations  all of these methods involve significant estimates and assumptions 
deferred tax assets 
we file a consolidated federal income tax return 
deferred federal income taxes reflect the future tax consequences of differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their financial reporting amounts at each year end 
deferred taxes are recognized using the liability method  whereby tax rates are applied to cumulative temporary differences based on when and how they are expected to affect the tax return 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are adjusted for tax rate changes 
a valuation allowance is provided against our deferred tax assets to the extent that we do not believe it is more likely than not that future taxable income will be adequate to realize these future tax benefits 
reserves for unpaid losses and lae 
reserves for unpaid losses and lae are established for claims which have already been incurred by the policyholder but which we have not yet paid 
unpaid losses and lae represent the estimated ultimate net cost of all reported and unreported losses incurred through each balance sheet date 
the reserves for unpaid losses and lae are estimated using individual case basis valuations and statistical analyses 
these reserves are revised periodically and are subject to the effects of trends in loss severity and frequency 
see  item business analysis of losses and lae and analysis of loss and lae reserve development 
although considerable variability is inherent in such estimates  we believe that our reserves for unpaid losses and lae are adequate 
due to the inherent uncertainty in estimating unpaid losses and lae  the actual ultimate amounts may differ from the recorded amounts 
a small percentage change could result in a material effect on reported earnings 
for example  a change in december  reserves for unpaid losses and lae would have produced a million change to pretax earnings 
the estimates are continually reviewed and adjusted as experience develops or new information becomes known 
such adjustments are included in current operations 
an actuarial range of ultimate unpaid losses and lae is developed independent of management s best estimate and is only used to assess the reasonableness of that estimate 
there is no exclusive method for determining this range  and judgment enters into the process 
the primary actuarial technique utilized is a loss development analysis in which ultimate losses are projected based upon historical development patterns 
the primary assumption underlying this loss development analysis is that the historical development patterns will be a reasonable predictor of the future development of losses for accident years which are less mature 
an alternate actuarial technique  known as the bornhuetter ferguson method  combines an analysis of loss development patterns with an initial estimate of expected losses or loss ratios 
this approach is most useful for recent accident years 
in addition to assuming the stability of loss development patterns  this technique is heavily dependent on the accuracy of the initial estimate of expected losses or loss ratios 
consequently  the bornhuetter ferguson method is primarily used to confirm the results derived from the loss development analysis 
the range of unpaid losses and lae estimated by our actuary as of december  was million to million 
our best estimate of unpaid losses and lae as of december  is million 
our carried reserve for unpaid losses and lae as of december  is comprised of million in case reserves and million in incurred but not reported reserves 
in setting this estimate of unpaid losses and lae  we have assumed  among other things  that current trends in loss frequency and severity will continue and that the actuarial analysis was empirically valid 
in the absence of any specific factors indicating actual experience at either extreme of the actuarial range  we have established a best estimate of unpaid losses and lae which is approximately million higher than the midpoint of the actuarial range 
we expected our best estimate to move within the actuarial range from year to year due to changes in our operations and changes within the marketplace 
due to the inherent uncertainty in reserve estimates  there can be no assurance that the actual losses ultimately experienced will fall within the actuarial range 
however  because of the breadth of the actuarial range  we believe that it is reasonably likely that actual losses will fall within such range 
our reserve requirements are also interrelated with product pricing and profitability 
we must price our products at a level sufficient to fund our policyholder benefits and still remain profitable 
because claim expenses represent the single largest category of our expenses  inaccuracies in the assumptions used to estimate the amount of such benefits can result in our failing to price our products appropriately and to generate sufficient premiums to fund our operations 
recognition of profit sharing commissions 
profit sharing commission is calculated and recognized when the loss ratio  as determined by a qualified actuary  deviates from contractual targets 
we receive a provisional commission as policies are produced as an advance against the later determination of the profit sharing commission actually earned 
the profit sharing commission is an estimate that varies with the estimated loss ratio and is sensitive to changes in that estimate 
the following table details the profit sharing commission revenue sensitivity of the standard commercial segment to the actual ultimate loss ratio for each effective quota share treaty at above and below the current estimate  which we believe is a reasonably likely range of variance in thousands 
treaty effective dates provisional loss ratio estimated ultimate loss ratio booked to at december  effect of actual above estimated loss ratio at december  effect of actual below estimated loss ratio at december  the following table details the profit sharing commission revenue sensitivity of the specialty commercial segment for each effective quota share treaty at above and below the current estimate  which we believe is a reasonably likely range of variance in thousands
