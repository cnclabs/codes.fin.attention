item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations we are a specialty pharmaceutical company 
our corporate objective is to combine our formulation experience and knowledge with our proprietary and patented controlled delivery technology cdt platforms to develop novel pharmaceutical  otc  and nutritional products 
our cdt platforms are based on multiple issued and pending patents and other intellectual property for the programmed release or enhanced performance of active pharmaceutical ingredients and nutritional products 
our strategy includes a significant commitment to research and development activities in connection with our drug delivery platforms 
our results of operations going forward depend on our ability to commercialize our products and technology and generate royalties  licensing fees  development fees  milestone and similar payments 
we expect our operating losses and negative cash flow to continue as we advance preclinical research an actual use study and related work to support applications for regulatory approvals and commercialization of our product candidates 
we will need to raise additional capital to fund operations  continue research and development projects  and commercialize our products 
the issuance of a large number of additional equity securities could cause substantial dilution to existing stockholders and could cause a decrease in the market price for shares of our common stock  which could impair our ability to raise capital in the future through the issuance of equity securities 
we may not be able to secure additional financing on favorable terms  or at all 
if we are unable to obtain necessary additional financing  our business will be adversely affected and we may be required to reduce the scope of our development activities or discontinue operations 
during september  we relocated our offices to bothell  washington and received the remaining million of the million payment for termination of our lease in bellevue  washington 
we have taken other steps to reduce expenses  including reductions in personnel and marketing  and the termination of a lease for additional space in bellevue  washington 
we are actively managing our liquidity and capital resources by deferring significant expenses on development activities pending additional financing or partnership opportunities critical accounting policies and estimates our financial statements are presented in accordance with accounting principles that are generally accepted in the united states 
all professional accounting standards effective as of december   have been taken into consideration in preparing the financial statements 
the preparation of the financial statements requires estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues  expenses and related disclosures 
some of those estimates are subjective and complex  and  therefore  actual results could differ from those estimates 
an accounting policy is deemed to be critical if it requires an accounting estimate to be made based on assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the estimate is made and if different estimates that reasonably could have been used  or changes in the accounting estimates that are reasonably likely to occur periodically  could materially impact the financial statements 
we believe the following critical accounting policies reflect our more significant estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of our financial statements 
revenue recognition we generate revenue from collaborative agreements  licensing fees  and from the assignment of developed and patented technology 
we must exercise judgment and use estimates to determine the amount of revenue to recognize each period 
revenue under collaborative arrangements may take the form of up front payments  payments for milestones  reimbursement of research and development costs  and licensing payments 
we recognize license revenue from intellectual technology agreements 
the payments received under these research collaboration agreements are contractually not refundable even if the research effort is not successful 
performance under our collaborative agreements is measured by scientific progress  as mutually agreed upon by us and our collaborators 
up front payments 
up front payments from our research collaborations include payments for technology transfer and access rights 
non refundable  up front payments received in connection with collaborative research and development agreements are deferred and recognized as licensing fees on a straight line basis over the relevant periods specified in the agreement  generally the research term 
when the research term is not specified in the agreement and instead the agreement specifies the completion or attainment of a particular development goal  we make an estimate of the time required to achieve that goal considering our experience with similar projects  level of effort and the development stage of the project 
we review the basis of our revenue recognition and adjust it as necessary based on the status of the project against the estimated timeline as additional information becomes available 
license fees 
non refundable license fees where we have completed all future obligations are recognized as revenue in the period when persuasive evidence of an agreement exists  delivery has occurred  collectability is reasonably assured and the price is fixed and determinable 
royalty income 
royalties from licensees are based on reported sales of licensed products and revenue is calculated based on contract terms when reported sales are reliably measurable and collectability is reasonably assured 
research and development income 
revenues from milestone payments are recognized when the milestone has been achieved  as long as the achievement of the milestone was not reasonably assured at the inception of the arrangement  there was substantial effort involved in achieving the milestone  the amount of the milestone payment is reasonable in relation with the level of effort associated with the achievement of the milestone  and the payment is non refundable 
each milestone event must have substance  and must represent the achievement of specific defined goals 
reimbursements of research and development expenses we incur in connection with collaborative agreements are recognized as revenue at the time these amounts are determined to be measurable  reliable  and collectable 
our judgment in determining the collectability of amounts due impacts the timing of revenue recognition 
credit worthiness and collectability are assessed  and when a party is not deemed credit worthy  revenue is recognized when payment is received 
we also assess whether fees are fixed or determinable prior to recognizing revenue 
we must make interpretations of our customer contracts and use estimates and judgments in determining if the fees associated with a license arrangement are fixed or determinable 
in applying these criteria to revenue transactions  we must exercise judgment and use estimates to determine the amount of up front payments  license fees  research and development income  and royalty income revenue to be recognized each period 
deferred taxes valuation allowance we make estimates and use our judgment in determining the provision for income taxes  deferred tax assets and liabilities  and any valuation allowance recorded against net deferred tax assets 
we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
while we may consider any potential future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance  in the event we were to determine that we would be able to realize our deferred tax assets in the future in excess of our net recorded amount  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would increase income in the period in which we made such determination 
at december   we had recorded full valuation totaling approximately million against our net deferred tax assets 

table of contents results of operations fiscal compared to fiscal revenues total revenues for the year ended december   were  a decrease of  compared to million for the same period in this decrease is primarily due to the higher level of research and development fees and licensing revenues in relating to a license agreement terminated in march royalty revenue from our cdt based product sales of dietary supplement markets decreased  or  to  for the year ended december   compared to million for the same period in as a result of royalties generated through our alliance with perrigo 
royalty payments from perrigo are based solely on perrigo s net profits of cdt based products which involve uncertainties and are difficult to predict 
revenues from nutraceutix declined in as our license terminated on december  and nutraceutix had limited rights to continue sales of certain inventory during in the first quarter of  we received approximately  in research and development milestone payments  and recognized previously deferred licensing fee income of approximately  associated with our agreement with wyeth consumer healthcare 
the december agreement with wyeth provided for an upfront fee of  which was recorded as deferred revenue and was being amortized over the development period until the contract was terminated in march  at which time the remaining balance was recorded to income 
marketing and selling expenses marketing and selling expenses decreased  or  to  for the year ended december   compared to  for the same period in  primarily due to a decrease of  in advertising  tradeshow activities and related travel 
in addition  payroll and related expenses decreased  in due to the reduction in staff early in the year and non cash share based compensation expense resulting from the lower fair value of stock options granted 
research and development expenses research and development expenses decreased  or million  to million for the year ended december   compared to million for the same period in the decrease of million was primarily due to our decision to defer development activities on certain projects pending additional funding 
in addition  non cash  share based compensation expense decreased  related to annual employee stock option grants due to the lower fair value of the stock options 
these decreases were offset by an increase in outside consulting expense of  related to regulatory activities associated with our ibuprofen and pseudoephedrine projects 
general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses decreased  or  to million for the year ended december   compared to million for the same period in this decrease is primarily due to a decrease in non cash  share based compensation expense of  related to employee stock option grants due to the lower fair value of the stock options and a lower bonus expense of  these decreases were offset by an increase in personnel expense of  for severance costs and annual increases in employee compensation 
lease termination in may  we entered into a lease termination and surrender agreement  under which we agreed to terminate the lease for our corporate facility for million 
under the terms of the agreement  we received million upon execution of the agreement and the remaining million in september  when we vacated the premises 
we incurred costs of  related to relocation to our new facility and the lease buyout which were recognized in operating expense in september other income expense  net other income decreased  or  to  for the year ended december   compared to  for the same period in this decrease was primarily due to a decrease in interest income due to lower cash balances and interest rates 

table of contents net loss net loss decreased  or million  to million for the year ended december   compared to million for the same period in this decrease was primarily due to the gain of million from the lease termination and surrender agreement associated with our corporate facility 
liquidity and capital resources we had approximately million in cash and cash equivalents  and  in restricted cash as of december  we are investing our cash and cash equivalents in government backed securities 
we have limited capital resources and operations to date have been funded primarily with the proceeds from public and private equity and debt financings  and collaborative research agreements 
based on our current operating plan  we anticipate that our existing cash and cash equivalents  together with expected royalties from third parties  will be sufficient to fund our operations until late we are pursing new partnerships as well as collaborations  and exploring other financing options that would enable us to provide additional funding for our operations 
however  we cannot be assured that financing will be available 
our business will require substantial additional investment that we have not yet secured 
our plan is to raise capital and or to pursue partnering opportunities 
our current operating plan reflects reductions in personnel  marketing and other operating expenses implemented in we are actively managing our liquidity by limiting clinical and development expenses to our lead products and supporting our existing alliances and collaborations 
we have deferred all significant expenditures on new projects pending additional financing or partnership support 
without additional funding we do not expect to be able to complete development of our current projects we plan to continue efforts to enter into collaboration and licensing agreements for our product candidates and seek other sources of capital to provide additional funding for our operations 
we cannot be assured that financing will be available on favorable terms or at all 
our failure to raise capital  including financial support from partnerships or other collaborations  in will materially adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations  and could force us to reduce or cease operations 
these conditions raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern 
consequently  the audit report prepared by our independent registered public accounting firm relating to our financial statements for the year ended december  included a going concern explanatory paragraph 
in november  the securities and exchange commission declared effective our registration statement that we filed using a shelf registration process which expired on december  under this registration statement  we offered from time to time  one or more offerings of common stock and or warrants to purchase common stock under this shelf registration up to an aggregate public offering price of million 
registered direct offerings were completed on december   and april   for approximately million and million respectively 
on november   we filed a new shelf registration statement in the amount of million 
at the time the new shelf registration was filed  million remained available for issuance under the november filing 
on november   the securities and exchange commission declared our registration statement effective 
under this registration statement  we may offer from time to time  one or more offerings of common stock and or warrants to purchase common stock under this shelf registration up to an aggregate public offering price of million 
if additional capital is raised through the sale of equity or convertible debt securities  the issuance of such securities will result in dilution to our existing stockholders 
cash flows from operating activities net cash used in operating activities for the year ended december   was approximately million compared to million for the year end december  expenditures for the year ended december   decreased approximately million 
in addition  during the year ended december   operating revenues decreased approximately million due to lower royalty income and no research and development revenue 
in addition  we received a cash payment of million related to our facility lease buyout  which was recognized as a reduction to operating expense in september cash flows from investing activities cash flows used by investing activities of  represents restricted cash of  plus payments made for patent rights during the year ended december  the restricted cash is collateral for the outstanding letter of credit issued as collateral for our new facility lease 
cash flows provided by investing activities of  during the year ended december   primarily represented the application of maturing short term investments to fund operating activities  off set by purchases of patent rights and equipment 
cash flows from financing activities cash flows used in financing activities of  represent the cash received of  from the exercise of stock options and warrants offset by payments made on our term loan during the year ended december  in the year ended december   cash flows from financing activities primarily represented the proceeds from the sale of common stock  a term loan to purchase a piece of equipment to be used in our research and development activities  and the exercise of stock options and warrants 
as of december   we had million of working capital compared to million as of december  we have accumulated net losses of approximately million from our inception through december  we have funded our operations primarily through the issuance of equity securities  including million and million in net proceeds from our registered direct offerings in december and april  respectively  and million from our private placement in february new accounting pronouncements in january  the financial accounting standards board fasb ratified a consensus opinion reached by the emerging issues task force eitf on eitf issue  determining whether an instrument or embedded feature is indexed to an entity s own stock  to provide guidance for determining whether an equity linked financial instrument or embedded feature is considered indexed to an entity s own stock 
the consensus establishes a two step approach as a framework for determining whether an instrument or embedded feature is indexed to an entity s own stock 
the approach includes evaluating the instrument s contingent exercise provisions  if any  and the instrument s settlement provisions 
entities that issue financial instruments such as warrants or options on their own shares  convertible debt  convertible preferred stock  forward contracts on their own shares  or market based employee stock option valuation instruments will be affected by eitf issue we intend to adopt eitf issue effective january   and apply its provisions to its outstanding instruments as of that date  as well as to instruments issued subsequent to that date 
we do not believe there will be a material impact to its financial statements upon adoption on january  in february  the fasb issued fasb staff position no 
sfas  effective date of fasb statement no 
 which provides a one year deferral of the effective date of fas no 
for non financial assets and non financial liabilities  except those that are recognized or disclosed in the financial statements at fair value at least annually 
effective june   we adopted the provisions of sfas no 
with respect to our financial assets and liabilities recorded at fair value 
we do not believe there will be a material impact on our financial statements upon adoption
