except as otherwise specified  references to the company  we  us  and our  refer to fifth street finance corp 
overview we are a specialty finance company that lends to and invests in small and mid sized companies in connection with investments by private equity sponsors 
our investment objective is to maximize our portfolio s total return by generating current income from our debt investments and capital appreciation from our equity investments 
we were formed as a delaware limited partnership fifth street mezzanine partners iii  lp on february  effective as of january   fifth street mezzanine partners iii  lp merged with and into fifth street finance corp 
at the time of the merger  all outstanding partnership interests in fifth street mezzanine partners iii  lp were exchanged for  shares of common stock in fifth street finance corp 
our consolidated financial statements prior to january  reflect our operations as a delaware limited partnership fifth street mezzanine partners iii  lp prior to our merger with and into a corporation fifth street finance corp on june   we completed an initial public offering of  shares of our common stock at the offering price of per share 
our shares are currently listed on the new york stock exchange under the symbol fsc 
on july   we completed a follow on public offering of  shares of our common stock  which included the underwriters exercise of their over allotment option  at the offering price of per share 
on september   we completed a follow on public offering of  shares of our common stock  which included the underwriters exercise of their over allotment option  at the offering price of per share 
current market conditions since mid  the financial services sector has been negatively impacted by significant write offs related to sub prime mortgages and the re pricing of credit risk 
global debt and equity markets have suffered substantial stress  volatility  illiquidity and disruption  with sub prime mortgage related issues being the most significant contributing factor 
these forces reached unprecedented levels by the fall of  resulting in the insolvency or acquisition of  or government assistance to  several major domestic and international financial institutions 
these events have significantly diminished overall confidence in the debt and equity markets and caused increasing economic uncertainty 
this reduced confidence and uncertainty could further exacerbate the overall market disruptions and risks to businesses in need of capital 
in particular  the disruptions in the financial markets have increased the spread between the yields realized on risk free and higher risk securities  resulting in illiquidity in parts of the financial markets 
this widening of spreads makes it more difficult for lower middle market companies to access capital as traditional senior lenders become more selective  equity sponsors delay transactions for better earnings visibility  and sellers are hesitant to accept lower purchase multiples 
as a result  we are seeing a smaller number of attractive transactions in the lower end of the middle market 
despite these factors  our deal pipeline is robust  with high quality transactions backed by private equity sponsors in the lower middle market 
as always  we remain cautious in selecting new investment opportunities  and will only deploy capital in deals which are consistent with our disciplined philosophy of pursuing superior risk adjusted returns 
in this regard  we had million of cash and cash equivalents on hand at september  to fund investments 
as evidenced by recent activities see recent developments  we expect to grow the business in part by increasing the average investment size when and where appropriate 
at the same time  we expect to focus more on first lien transactions 
we also expect to invest in more floating rate facilities  with rate floors  to protect against interest rate decreases 
although we currently have sufficient capital available to fund investments  a prolonged period of market disruptions may cause us to reduce the volume of loans we originate and or fund  which could have an adverse effect on our business  financial condition  and results of operations 
furthermore  because our common stock has generally traded at a price below our current net asset value per share over the last several months and we are not generally able under the act to sell our common stock at a price below net asset value per share  we may be limited in our ability to raise equity capital 
see item business regulation common stock for a discussion of the approval we received from our stockholders to issue shares of our common stock below net asset value per share 
critical accounting policies fasb accounting standards codification the issuance of fasb accounting standards codification tm the codification on july  effective for interim or annual reporting periods ending after september   changes the way that us generally accepted accounting principles gaap are referenced 
beginning on that date  the codification officially became the single source of authoritative nongovernmental gaap  however  sec registrants must also consider rules  regulations  and interpretive guidance issued by the sec or its staff 
the switch affects the way companies refer to us gaap in financial statements and in their accounting policies 
all existing standards that were used to create the codification were superseded by the codification 
instead  references to standards will consist solely of the number used in the codification s structural organization 
for example  it is no longer proper to refer to fasb statement no 
 fair value measurement  which is now asc topic fair value measurements and disclosures asc 
consistent with the effective date of the codification  financial statements for periods ending after september   refers to the codification structure  not pre codification historical gaap 
basis of presentation effective january   fifth street mezzanine partners iii  lp the partnership  a delaware limited partnership organized on february   merged with and into fifth street finance corp 
the merger involved the exchange of shares between companies under common control 
in accordance with the guidance on exchanges of shares between entities under common control  our results of operations and cash flows for the fiscal year ended september  are presented as if the merger had occurred as of october  accordingly  no adjustments were made to the carrying value of assets and liabilities or the cost basis of investments as a result of the merger 
prior to january   references to the company are to the partnership 
since january   references to the company  fsc  we or our are to fifth street finance corp  unless the context otherwise requires 
the company s financial results for the fiscal year ended september  refer to the partnership 
the preparation of financial statements in accordance with gaap requires management to make certain estimates and assumptions affecting amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements 
we have identified investment valuation and revenue recognition as our most critical accounting estimates 
we continuously evaluate our estimates  including those related to the matters described below 
these estimates are based on the information that is currently available to us and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results could differ materially from those estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
a discussion of our critical accounting policies follows 
investment valuation we are required to report our investments that are not publicly traded or for which current market values are not readily available at fair value 
the fair value is deemed to be the value at which an enterprise could be sold in a transaction between two willing parties other than through a forced or liquidation sale 
under asc  which we adopted effective october   we perform detailed valuations of our debt and equity investments on an individual basis  using market based  income based  and bond yield approaches as appropriate 
under the market approach  we estimate the enterprise value of the portfolio companies in which we invest 
there is no one methodology to estimate enterprise value and  in fact  for any one portfolio company  enterprise value is best expressed as a range of fair values  from which we derive a single estimate of enterprise value 
to estimate the enterprise value of a portfolio company  we analyze various factors  including the portfolio company s historical and projected financial results 
typically  private companies are valued based on multiples of ebitda earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization  cash flows  net income  revenues  or in limited cases  book value 
we generally require portfolio companies to provide annual audited and quarterly and monthly unaudited financial statements  as well as annual projections for the upcoming fiscal year 
under the income approach  we generally prepare and analyze discounted cash flow models based on our projections of the future free cash flows of the business 
under the bond yield approach  we use bond yield models to determine the present value of the future cash flow streams of our debt investments 
we review various sources of transactional data  including private mergers and acquisitions involving debt investments with similar characteristics  and assess the information in the valuation process 
we also may  when conditions warrant  utilize an expected recovery model  whereby we use alternate procedures to determine value when the customary approaches are deemed to be not as relevant or reliable 
our board of directors undertakes a multi step valuation process each quarter in connection with determining the fair value of our investments our quarterly valuation process begins with each portfolio company or investment being initially valued by the deal team within our investment adviser responsible for the portfolio investment  preliminary valuations are then reviewed and discussed with the principals of our investment adviser  separately  an independent valuation firm engaged by the board of directors prepares preliminary valuations on a selected basis and submits a report to us  the deal team compares and contrasts its preliminary valuations to the report of the independent valuation firm and resolves any differences  the deal team prepares a final valuation report for the valuation committee of our board of directors  the valuation committee of our board of directors reviews the preliminary valuations  and the deal team responds and supplements the preliminary valuations to reflect any comments provided by the valuation committee  the valuation committee of our board of directors makes a recommendation to the board of directors  and the board of directors discusses valuations and determines the fair value of each investment in our portfolio in good faith 
the fair value of all of our investments at september   and september   was determined by our board of directors 
our board of directors is solely responsible for the valuation of our portfolio investments at fair value as determined in good faith pursuant to our valuation policy and our consistently applied valuation process 
our board of directors has engaged an independent valuation firm to provide us with valuation assistance 
upon completion of its process each quarter  the independent valuation firm provides us with a written report regarding the preliminary valuations of selected portfolio securities as of the close of such quarter 
we will continue to engage an independent valuation firm to provide us with assistance regarding our determination of the fair value of selected portfolio securities each quarter  however  our board of directors is ultimately and solely responsible for determining the fair value of our investments in good faith 
an independent valuation firm  murray  devine co  inc  provided us with assistance in our determination of the fair value of of our portfolio for the quarter ended december   of our portfolio for the quarter ended march   of our portfolio for the quarter ended june   of our portfolio for the quarter ended september   of our portfolio for the quarter ended december   of our portfolio for the quarter ended march  or of our portfolio excluding our investment in izi medical products  inc  which closed on march  and therefore was not part of the independent valuation process  of our portfolio for the quarter ended june   and of our portfolio for the quarter ended september  our million credit facility with bank of montreal was terminated effective september  the facility required independent valuations for at least of the portfolio on a quarterly basis 
with the termination of this facility  this valuation test is no longer required 
however  we still intend to have a portion of the portfolio valued by an independent third party on an quarterly basis  with a substantial portion being valued on an annual basis 
as of september  and september   approximately and  respectively  of our total assets represented investments in portfolio companies valued at fair value 
effective october   we adopted asc in accordance with that standard  we changed our presentation for all periods presented to net unearned fees against the associated debt investments 
prior to the adoption of asc on october   we reported unearned fees as a single line item on our consolidated balance sheets and consolidated schedules of investments 
this change in presentation had no impact on the overall net cost or fair value of our investment portfolio and had no impact on our financial position or results of operations 
the following table summarizes the effect of the adoption of asc on the presentation of our investment portfolio in the consolidated financial statements 
fair value as fair value as reported reported in the in the september  september  consolidated financial financial statements change in presentation statements as as filed in the of unearned fee income filed in the september  to conform with september  form k asc form k affiliate investments non control non affiliate investments unearned fee income total investments net of unearned fee income revenue recognition interest and dividend income interest income  adjusted for amortization of premium and accretion of original issue discount  is recorded on the accrual basis to the extent that such amounts are expected to be collected 
we stop accruing interest on investments when it is determined that interest is no longer collectible 
distributions from portfolio companies are recorded as dividend income when the distribution is received 
fee income we receive a variety of fees in the ordinary course of our business  including origination fees 
we account for our fee income in accordance with asc topic multiple element arrangements asc which addresses certain aspects of a company s accounting for arrangements containing multiple revenue generating activities 
in some arrangements  the different revenue generating activities deliverables are sufficiently separable and there exists sufficient evidence of their fair values to separately account for some or all of the deliverables ie  there are separate units of accounting 
asc states that the total consideration received for the arrangement be allocated to each unit based upon each unit s relative fair value 
in other arrangements  some or all of the deliverables are not independently functional  or there is not sufficient evidence of their fair values to account for them separately 
the timing of revenue recognition for a given unit of accounting depends on the nature of the deliverable s in that accounting unit and the corresponding revenue recognition model and whether the general conditions for revenue recognition have been met 
fee income for which fair value cannot be reasonably ascertained is recognized using the interest method in accordance with asc nonrefundable fees and other costs 
as of september   we are also entitled to receive approximately million in aggregate exit fees across portfolio investments upon the future exit of those investments 
exit fees are fees which are earned and payable upon the exit of a debt security and  similar to a prepayment penalty  are not accrued or otherwise included in net investment income until received 
such fees will be paid to us when a portfolio company exits our loan  for example in a refinancing  or when the loan matures 
the receipt of such fees as well the timing of our receipt of such fees is contingent upon a successful exit event for each of the investments 
payment in kind pik interest our loans typically contain a contractual pik interest provision 
the pik interest  which represents contractually deferred interest added to the loan balance that is generally due at the end of the loan term  is generally recorded on the accrual basis to the extent such amounts are expected to be collected 
we generally cease accruing pik interest if there is insufficient value to support the accrual or if we do not expect the portfolio company to be able to pay all principal and interest due 
our decision to cease accruing pik interest involves subjective judgments and determinations based on available information about a particular portfolio company  including whether the portfolio company is current with respect to its payment of principal and interest on its loans and debt securities  monthly and quarterly financial statements and financial projections for the portfolio company  our assessment of the portfolio company s business development success  including product development  profitability and the portfolio company s overall adherence to its business plan  information obtained by us in connection with periodic formal update interviews with the portfolio company s management and  if appropriate  the private equity sponsor  and information about the general economic and market conditions in which the portfolio company operates 
based on this and other information  we determine whether to cease accruing pik interest on a loan or debt security 
our determination to cease accruing pik interest on a loan or debt security is generally made well before our full write down of such loan or debt security 
for a discussion of risks we are subject to as a result of our use of pik interest in connection with our investments  see item a 
risk factors risks relating to our business and structure we may have difficulty paying our required distributions if we recognize income before or without receiving cash representing such income  we may in the future choose to pay dividends in our own stock  in which case you may be required to pay tax in excess of the cash you receive and our incentive fee may induce our investment adviser to make speculative investments 
in addition  if it is subsequently determined that we will not be able to collect any previously accrued pik interest  the fair value of our loans or debt securities would decline by the amount of such previously accrued  but uncollectible  pik interest 
to maintain our status as a ric  pik income must be paid out to our stockholders in the form of dividends even though we have not yet collected the cash and may never collect the cash relating to the pik interest 
accumulated pik interest was approximately million and represented of the fair value of our portfolio of investments as of september  and approximately million or as of september  the net increase in loan balances as a result of contracted pik arrangements are separately identified in our consolidated statements of cash flows 
portfolio composition our investments principally consist of loans  purchased equity investments and equity grants in privately held companies 
our loans are typically secured by either a first or second lien on the assets of the portfolio company  generally have terms of up to six years but an expected average life of between three and four years and typically bear interest at fixed rates and to a lesser extent  at floating rates 
we are currently focusing our new debt origination efforts on first lien loans

as a result of current economic conditions and their impact on certain of our portfolio companies  we have agreed to modify the payment terms of our investments in nine of our portfolio companies as of september  such modified terms include increased payment in kind interest provisions and reduced cash interest rates 
these modifications  and any future modifications to our loan agreements as a result of the current economic conditions or otherwise  may limit the amount of interest income that we recognize from the modified investments  which may  in turn  limit our ability to make distributions to our stockholders 
see note to the consolidated schedule of investments as of september  in our financial statements included herein 
loans and debt securities on non accrual status as of september   we had stopped accruing pik interest and original issue discount on five investments  including two investments that had not paid their scheduled monthly cash interest payments or were otherwise on non accrual status

although we expect to fund the growth of our investment portfolio through the net proceeds from future equity offerings  including our dividend reinvestment plan  and issuances of senior securities or future borrowings  to the extent permitted by the act  we cannot assure you that our plans to raise capital will be successful 
in this regard  because our common stock has traded at a price below our current net asset value per share over the last several months and we are limited in our ability to sell our common stock at a price below net asset value per share  we may be limited in our ability to raise equity capital 
our stockholders approved a proposal at a special meeting of stockholders held on june  that authorizes us to sell shares of our common stock below the then current net asset value per share in one or more offerings for a period ending on the earlier of june  or the date of our next annual meeting of stockholders 
we would need stockholder approval of a similar proposal to issue shares below net asset value per share at any time after our next annual meeting of stockholders  which we anticipate will be held in march see item a 
risk factors risks relating to our business and structure regulations governing our operation as a business development company and ric will affect our ability to  and the way in which we  raise additional capital and borrow for investment purposes  which may have a negative effect on our growth and because we intend to distribute between and of our income to our stockholders in connection with our election to be treated as a ric  we will continue to need additional capital to finance our growth 
if additional funds are unavailable or not available on favorable terms  our ability to grow will be impaired for a discussion of the provisions of the act that limit our ability to sell our common stock at a price below net asset value per share 
in addition  we intend to distribute between and of our taxable income to our stockholders in order to satisfy the requirements applicable to rics under subchapter m of the code 
see regulated investment company status and dividends below 
consequently  we may not have the funds or the ability to fund new investments  to make additional investments in our portfolio companies  to fund our unfunded commitments to portfolio companies or to repay borrowings under our credit facility 
in addition  the illiquidity of our portfolio investments may make it difficult for us to sell these investments when desired and  if we are required to sell these investments  we may realize significantly less than their recorded value 
also  as a business development company  we generally are required to meet a coverage ratio of total assets  less liabilities and indebtedness not represented by senior securities  to total senior securities  which include all of our borrowings and any outstanding preferred stock  of at least 
this requirement limits the amount that we may borrow 
as of september   we were in compliance with this requirement 
to fund growth in our investment portfolio in the future  we anticipate needing to raise additional capital from various sources  including the equity markets and the securitization or other debt related markets  which may or may not be available on favorable terms  if at all 
finally  in light of the conditions in the financial markets and the us economy overall  we are considering other measures to help ensure adequate liquidity  including the formation of and application to license an sbic subsidiary 
on may   we received a letter from the investment division of the sba  that invited us to continue moving forward with the licensing of an sbic subsidiary 
although our application to license this entity as an sbic with the sba is subject to the sba approval  we remain cautiously optimistic that we will complete the licensing process 
our sbic subsidiary will have an investment objective similar to ours and will make similar types of investments in accordance with sbic regulations 
to the extent that we receive an sbic license  our sbic subsidiary will be allowed to issue sba guaranteed debentures  subject to the required capitalization of the sbic subsidiary 
sba guaranteed debentures carry long term fixed rates that are generally lower than rates on comparable bank and other debt 
under the regulations applicable to sbics  an sbic may have outstanding debentures guaranteed by the sba generally in an amount up to twice its regulatory capital  which generally equates to the amount of its equity capital 
the sbic regulations currently limit the amount that our sbic subsidiary may borrow to a maximum of million 
this means that our sbic subsidiary may access the full million maximum available if it has million in regulatory capital 
however  we are not required to capitalize this subsidiary with million and may determine to capitalize it with a lesser amount 
in addition  if we are able to obtain financing under the sbic program  our sbic subsidiary will be subject to regulation and oversight by the sba  including requirements with respect to maintaining certain minimum financial ratios and other covenants 
on july   we received a letter from the sba indicating that our sbic subsidiary s application had been approved for further processing and our sbic subsidiary is eligible to make pre licensing investments 
during the year ended september   our sbic subsidiary funded one pre licensing investment 
in connection with the filing of our sba license application  we will apply for exemptive relief from the sec to permit us to exclude the debt of our sbic subsidiary guaranteed by the sba from our consolidated asset coverage ratio  which will enable us to fund more investments with debt capital 
there can be no assurance that we will be granted an sbic license or that  if granted  it will be granted in a timely manner  that if we are granted an sbic license we will be able to capitalize the subsidiary to million to access the full million maximum borrowing amount available  or that we will receive the exemptive relief from the sec 
we cannot provide any assurance that these measures will provide sufficient sources of liquidity to support our operations and growth given the unprecedented instability in the financial markets and the weak us economy

as long as we qualify as a ric  we will not be taxed on our investment company taxable income or realized net capital gains  to the extent that such taxable income or gains are distributed  or deemed to be distributed  to stockholders on a timely basis 
taxable income generally differs from net income for financial reporting purposes due to temporary and permanent differences in the recognition of income and expenses  and generally excludes net unrealized appreciation or depreciation until realized 
dividends declared and paid by us in a year may differ from taxable income for that year as such dividends may include the distribution of current year taxable income or the distribution of prior year taxable income carried forward into and distributed in the current year 
distributions also may include returns of capital 
to maintain ric tax treatment  we must  among other things  distribute  with respect to each taxable year  at least of our investment company taxable income ie  our net ordinary income and our realized net short term capital gains in excess of realized net long term capital losses  if any

to the extent our taxable earnings for a fiscal taxable year fall below the total amount of our dividends for that fiscal year  a portion of those dividend distributions may be deemed a return of capital to our stockholders 
we may not be able to achieve operating results that will allow us to make distributions at a specific level or to increase the amount of these distributions from time to time 
in addition  we may be limited in our ability to make distributions due to the asset coverage test for borrowings applicable to us as a business development company under the act and due to provisions in our credit facility

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are subject to financial market risks  including changes in interest rates 
changes in interest rates may affect both our cost of funding and our interest income from portfolio investments  cash and cash equivalents and idle funds investments 
our risk management systems and procedures are designed to identify and analyze our risk  to set appropriate policies and limits and to continually monitor these risks and limits by means of reliable administrative and information systems and other policies and programs 
our investment income will be affected by changes in various interest rates  including libor and prime rates  to the extent any of our debt investments include floating interest rates 
the significant majority of our debt investments are made with fixed interest rates for the term of the investment 
however  as of september   approximately of our debt investment portfolio at fair value and of our debt investment portfolio at cost bore interest at floating rates 
as of september   we had not entered into any interest rate hedging arrangements 
at september   based on our applicable levels of floating rate debt investments  a change in interest rates would not have a material effect on our level of interest income from debt investments 
our investments are carried at fair value as determined in good faith by our board of directors in accordance with the act see investment valuation under critical accounting policies 
our valuation methodology utilizes discount rates in part in valuing our investments  and changes in those discount rates may have an impact on the valuation of our investments 
assuming no changes in our investment and capital structure  a hypothetical increase or decrease in discount rates of basis points would increase or decrease our net assets resulting from operations by approximately million
