item management discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations you should read the following summary together with the more detailed business information and consolidated financial statements and related notes that appear elsewhere in this form k and annual report and in the documents that we incorporate by reference into this form k 
this document may contain certain forward looking information within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of this information involves risks and uncertainties 
our actual results may differ materially from the results discussed in the forward looking statements 
overview we manufacture and sell a comprehensive line of safety garments and accessories for the global industrial protective clothing markets 
our products are sold by our in house sales force and independent sales representatives to a network of over  north american safety and mill supply distributors and end users and distributors internationally 
these distributors in turn supply end user industrial customers such as integrated oil  utilities  chemical petrochemical  automobile  steel  glass  construction  smelting  janitorial  pharmaceutical and high technology electronics manufacturers  as well as international hospitals and laboratories 
in addition  we supply federal  state and local governmental agencies and departments domestically and internationally such as municipal fire and police departments  airport crash rescue units  the military  the department of homeland security and the centers for disease control and state and privately owned utilities and integrated oil companies 
our net sales attributable to customers outside the united states were million  million and million in fiscal  fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
our north american sales of tyvek declined approximately for the four years ended january  the company has partially replaced these sales with increased sales of hi visibility clothing domestically and increased international sales of our products particularly our fire protective apparel 
we are experiencing competitive pricing pressure in the marketplace for tyvek protective clothing  coupled with a decline in this segment in the usa in q as a result of the weak us economy which remains weak 
this loss in volume was absorbed yet we had a moderate increase on our ultimate margins  as a result of cost cutting  aggressive purchasing and price increases 
there was a strike of brazilian customs workers from mid march to mid may  this delayed many orders due to delays of imported raw materials 
april sales were significantly lower than normal 
may sales included this additional backlog from april 
since the acquisition was effective as of may  the revenue and profits included in the quarter ending july  were higher than would otherwise have occurred 
management estimates the benefit to may revenue and net income as approximately  and  respectively  or earnings per share 
our cost of goods sold was impacted in q and q by the cost of material purchased in fy which lacked rebates 
this material was charged to our cost of goods sold under strict fifo accounting at the end of q and the beginning of q  after which we have had a smooth flow of material costs 
we expect that distributors will not continue to stock inventory at historical levels as economic conditions in the united states continue to remain weak 
however  a large percentage of our net sales are driven in part by government funding and health related events 
our net sales attributable to chemical suits decreased in the year ended january  compared to the year ended january  these flat sales decreases were due primarily to a lull in government spending utilizing homeland defense funds and delays by state and local governmental purchasers in spending their bio terrorism funds 
these governmental sales are driven primarily by grants from the federal government under the fire act of and the bio terrorism preparedness and response act of as administered by the department of homeland security 
we have operated manufacturing facilities in mexico since and in china since beginning in  we moved the labor intensive sewing operation for our limited use disposable protective clothing lines to these facilities 
our facilities and capabilities in china and mexico allow access to a less expensive labor pool than is available in the united states and permit us to purchase certain raw materials at a lower cost than they are available domestically 
as we have 
index increasingly moved production of our products to our facilities in mexico and china  we have seen improvements in the profit margins for these products 
we have completed the moving of production of our reusable woven garments and gloves to these facilities and completed this process by the second quarter of fiscal as a result  we have seen cost improvements for these particular product lines as well 
in fy  the company decided to restructure its manufacturing operations in mexico  by closing its previous facilities in celaya and opening new facilities in jerez 
the company s actual costs to close  move and start up has aggregated approximately  pretax 
this restructuring has allowed for lower occupancy and labor costs and a more efficient production configuration  for this year fy we anticipate r d expenses will increase again in fy  to  as we aggressively pursue new products for the international market and seek ce certifications for existing products so that they may be sold internationally 
lakeland s r d activity increased significantly in the th quarter as several development activities were identified as having potential significant sales revenue generation in fy provided they can be commercialized by the end of the nd quarter in addition to short term development activities described previously  lakeland has also initiated longer term r d projects of a more strategic nature 
while these activities are not expected to account for a significant portion of r d expenses in fy  they are additional expenses and should they be successful  will require more significant funding in subsequent years 
critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our audited consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of our financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  net sales and expenses  and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
we base estimates on our past experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances and we periodically evaluate these estimates 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition 
we derive our sales primarily from our limited use disposable protective clothing and secondarily from our sales of heat protective apparel  high end chemical protective suits  fire fighting and  gloves and arm guards  and reusable woven garments 
sales are recognized when goods are shipped to our customers at which time title and the risk of loss passes 
sales are reduced for sales returns and allowances 
payment terms are generally net days for united states sales and net days for international sales 
inventories 
inventories include freight in  materials  labor and overhead costs and are stated at the lower of cost on a first in  first out basis or market 
provision is made for slow moving  obsolete or unusable inventory 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
we establish an allowance for doubtful accounts to provide for accounts receivable that may not be collectible 
in establishing the allowance for doubtful accounts  we analyze the collectability of individual large or past due accounts customer by customer 
we establish reserves for accounts that we determine to be doubtful of collection 
income taxes and valuation reserves 
we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate as part of preparing our consolidated financial statements 
this involves estimating the actual current tax in addition to assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatments for tax and financial accounting purposes 
these differences  together with net operating loss carry forwards and tax credits  are recorded as deferred tax assets or liabilities on our balance sheet 
a judgment must then be made of the likelihood that any deferred tax assets will be realized from future taxable income 
a valuation allowance may be required to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
in the event we determine that we may not be able to realize all or part of our deferred tax asset in the future  or that new estimates indicate that a previously recorded valuation allowance is no longer required  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset is charged or credited to net income in the period of such determination 
valuation of goodwill and other intangible assets 
on february   we adopted statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  which provides that goodwill and other intangible assets are no longer amortized  but are assessed for impairment annually and upon occurrence of an event that indicates impairment may have occurred 
goodwill impairment is evaluated utilizing a two step process as required by sfas no 
factors that we consider important that could identify a potential impairment include significant 
index underperformance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results  significant changes in the overall business strategy  and significant negative industry or economic trends 
when we determine that the carrying value of intangibles and goodwill may not be recoverable based upon one or more of these indicators of impairment  we measure any potential impairment based on a projected discounted cash flow method 
estimating future cash flows requires our management to make projections that can differ materially from actual results 
in august we purchased mifflin valley  a manufacturing facility in pennsylvania 
this purchase resulted in the recording of  in goodwill as of january  in may  we purchased qualytextil  s 
a in brazil 
see note for a further discussion of resulting goodwill 
self insured liabilities 
we have a self insurance program for certain employee health benefits 
the cost of such benefits is recognized as expense based on claims filed in each reporting period and an estimate of claims incurred but not reported during such period 
our estimate of claims incurred but not reported is based upon historical trends 
if more claims are made than were estimated or if the costs of actual claims increases beyond what was anticipated  reserves recorded may not be sufficient and additional accruals may be required in future periods 
we maintain separate insurance to cover the excess liability over set single claim amounts and aggregate annual claim amounts 
results of operations the following table set forth our historical results of operations for the years ended january   and as a percentage of our net sales 
year ended january  net sales cost of goods sold gross profit operating expenses operating profit interest expense  net income tax expense net income significant balance sheet fluctuation january  as compared to january  balance sheet accounts 
the decrease in cash and cash equivalents of 
million is primarily the result of normal fluctuations in cash management 
the increase in borrowings of million under the revolving credit agreement is principally due to the borrowing in may to fund the acquisition of qualytextil  sa in brazil  as well as an increase in inventories of million as we took advantage of discounts in purchasing of raw materials from our major supplier 
we have built raw material reserves due to an anticipated increase in the cost of these raw materials 
plant property and equipment increased mainly as a result of the brazil acquisition 
year ended january  compared to the year ended january  for the year ended january  for the three months ended january  net sales gross profit operating expenses operating profit income before tax net income net sales 
net sales increased million  or  to million for the year ended january  compared to million for the year ended january  the net increase was comprised mainly of million in sales generated by our qualytextil  sa facility which was included in fy for the nine months following the acquisition  sales

million in europe  million in increased reflective sales in the us  
million increased sales of chemical protection clothing in the us

these growth areas were offset by decreases in sales of million in us disposables  
million in us gloves  million in us wovens  and 
million in canada 
gross profit 
gross profit increased million or to million for the year ended january  from million for the year ended january  gross profit as a percentage of net sales increased to for the year ended january  from for the year ended january   primarily due to the inclusion of qualytextil  sa sales in which operated at a margin for the nine months in fy in which brazil operations were included and in the prior year  a sales rebate program to meet competitive conditions resulting in a reduction in sales and higher tyvek fabric costs 
such higher tyvek costs resulted from tyvek purchased earlier with no rebate  charged to costs of goods sold for the months of april  may and into early june resulting in higher costs 
start up expenses included in gross profit related to the new foreign subsidiaries of approximately 
million which were partially offset by ongoing cost reduction programs in component and service purchasing  shifting production from the us to china and mexico  completion of the plant restructuring in mexico  rework expenses on a chemical suit contract  and reduced volumes in lower margins in the us fire gear and gloves 
operating expenses 
operating expenses increased million  or to million for the year ended january  from million for the year ended january  as a percentage of net sales  operating expenses increased to for the year ended january  from for the year ended january  the million increase in operating expenses in the year ended january  compared to the year ended january  was principally due to decreases or increases in o million operating costs in the acquired brazilian operations not in previous year 
o million in additional freight out costs excluding brazil  resulting from higher rates prevailing in most of fy  due to higher fuel surcharges 
o million in additional sales salaries  commissions and administrative salaries resulting from expanded sales staff 
o million in additional costs resulting from the proxy contest earlier in fy o million in additional international travel expenses and sales meetings  that tracked international sales growth 
o million in additional advertising and printing costs 
o million in additional equity compensation resulting from additional grants charged to expense over the vesting period of the company s restricted stock program 
o million in additional currency fluctuation costs o million in additional computer expenses o million in other taxes mainly property taxes on the canada warehouse opened in december o million in reduced medical insurance costs resulting from favorable experience o million reduction in professional fees and consulting expenses mainly resulting from an expenditure in the previous fiscal year in india to set up the proper production processes 
operating profit 
operating profit increased by million  or to million  from million for the prior year 
operating income as a percentage of net sales increased to for the year ended january  from for the year ending january  primarily due to the brazil acquisition  partially offset by increased operating expenses and lower volumes as discussed above 
interest expense 
interest expense increased by 
million for the year ended january  compared to the year ended january  because of increased borrowings due to the qualytextil acquisition partially offset by interest rate decreases 
other income net

income tax expense decreased 
million  or  to million for the year ended january  from million for the year

net income 
net income increased million or  to million for the year ended january  from million for the year ended january  the increase in net income was the result of the brazil acquisition  partially offset by an increase in expenses related to the new foreign facilities in india  chile  japan and a decrease in profit by the domestic operations

net sales decreased million  or  to million for the year ended january  compared to million for the year ended january  the net decrease was comprised of decreased sales in tyvek disposable garments of million in the us and million in canada primarily due to competitive market conditions  competitors rebate programs  lower government spending in the company s chemical protective garments by  and less revenue from india of  as a result of its shutdown for retooling during this fiscal year  counter balanced by growth in sales in chile and united kingdom subsidiaries of million and by increased external sales from china of million 
the company re opened its indian facility in march  so the resumption of glove sales should take full effect in the second quarter of fiscal sales of wovens and gloves increased by million compared to the same period last year 
the increase in woven sales was due to the company s new anti static product  and to the increase in fire gear sales which was due to all new nfpa standards and underwriter s laboratory ul certifications regarding the construction of fire gear  which negatively impacted the entire industry in the first two quarters 
the  decline in glove sales was due to the loss of two customers  one of whom went out of business 
wovens sales benefited from the introduction of a new line of aseptic anti static garments 
gross profit 
gross profit decreased million or to million for the year ended january  from million for the year ended january  gross profit as a percentage of net sales decreased to for the year ended january  from for the year ended january   primarily due to a sales rebate program to meet competitive conditions resulting in a  reduction in sales and higher tyvek fabric costs 
such higher tyvek costs resulted from tyvek purchased earlier with no rebate  charged to costs of goods sold for the months of april  may and into early june resulting in higher costs of approximately  the supply of this higher cost raw material has now been exhausted  so gross margin improvement is anticipated relative to the lower cost of materials for new sales as compared to sales in the prior periods 
start up expenses included in gross profits costs related to the new foreign subsidiaries of approximately  were partially offset by ongoing cost reduction programs in component and service purchasing  shifting production from the us to china and mexico  and a completion of the plant restructuring in mexico  rework expenses on a chemical suit contract  and reduced volumes in lower margin fire gear and gloves 
operating expenses 
operating expenses decreased million  or to million for the year ended january  from million for the year ended january  as a percent of net sales  operating expenses increased to for the year ended january  from for the year ended january  the million decrease in operating expenses in the year ended january  compared to the year ended january  was principally due to decreases or increases in o million miscellaneous net expense decreases 
o million net reduction of sga costs from new entities in india  chile and japan 

index o million of net reduction in insurance and employee benefits mainly resulting from a more positive experience in our self insured medical plan 
o million net reduction in sales salaries and commissions  mainly in disposables  chemicals and canada and related payroll taxes 
several senior level sales personnel were added to support lagging sales in disposables  support new product introductions and coordinate international sales efforts  offset by lower commissions due to lower volume 
o million in share based compensation 
o million increase in r d spending as several projects were proven conceptually necessitating further investigation and development 
as a result  fy r d expenses were largely related to product testing and certification while fy r d was primarily raw material evaluation 
o million in higher professional and consulting fees  largely resulting from engineering consultants setting up the indian production facility 
operating profit 
operating profit decreased by million  or to million  from million for the prior year 
operating income as a percent of net sales decreased to for the year ended january  from for the year ending january  primarily due to increased operating expenses and lower volumes as discussed above

net income 
net income decreased million or  to million for the year ended january  from million for the year ended january  the decrease in net income was the result of an increase in expenses related to the new foreign facilities in india  chile  japan and a decrease in profit by the domestic operations 
liquidity and capital resources management measures our liquidity on the basis of our ability to meet short term and long term operational funding needs and fund additional investments  including acquisitions 
significant factors affecting the management of liquidity are cash flows from operating activities  capital expenditures  and access to bank lines of credit and our ability to attract long term capital under satisfactory terms 
internal cash generation  together with currently available cash and investment and an ability to access credit lines if needed are expected to be sufficient to fund operations  capital expenditures  and any increase in working capital that we would need to accommodate a higher level of business activity 
we are actively seeking to expand by acquisitions as well as through organic growth of our business 
while a significant acquisition may require additional borrowings  equity financing or both  we believe that we would be able to obtain financing on acceptable terms based  among other things  on our earnings performance and current financial position 
cash flows as of january  we had cash and cash equivalents of million and working capital of million  a decrease of 
million and an increase million  respectively  from january  our primary sources of funds for conducting our business activities have been from cash flow provided by operations and borrowings under our credit facilities described below 
we require liquidity and working capital primarily to fund increases in inventories and accounts receivable associated with our net sales and  to a lesser extent  for capital expenditures 
net cash provided by operating activities of million for the year ended january  was due primarily to net income of million  offset by an increase in inventories of million 
net cash used in operations for the year ended january  of million was primarily due to net income of million and an increase in inventories of million 

index net cash used in investing activities of million and million in the years ended january  and  respectively  was due to the acquisition of qualytextil in and purchases of real estate  property and equipment  the construction of new facilities in canada in fy and the acquisitions of the india facility 
net cash used in and provided by financing activities in the years ended january  and was primarily attributable to an increased borrowing under our credit facilities primarily to fund the qualytextil acquisition in fy  and primarily by borrowings to fund increased inventory levels in fy  respectively 
credit facilities we currently have one credit facility a five year  million revolving credit facility  of which we had borrowings outstanding as of january  amounting to million our million revolving credit facility expires on july  borrowings under this revolving credit facility bear interest at the london interbank offering rate libor plus basis points and were at january  as of january   we had million of borrowing availability under this revolving credit facility 
of the amount outstanding  million is covered by an interest rate swap executed in september the interest on this amount was at january  our credit facility requires that we comply with specified financial covenants relating to interest coverage  debt coverage  minimum consolidated net worth  and earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization 
these restrictive covenants could affect our financial and operational flexibility or impede our ability to operate or expand our business 
default under our credit facilities would allow the lenders to declare all amounts outstanding to be immediately due and payable 
our lenders have a security interest in substantially all of our assets to secure the debt under our credit facilities 
as of january   we were in compliance with all covenants contained in our credit facilities 
we believe that our current cash position of million  our cash flow from operations along with borrowing availability under our million revolving credit facility will be sufficient to meet our currently anticipated operating  capital expenditures and debt service requirements for at least the next months 
capital expenditures our capital expenditures principally relate to purchases of manufacturing equipment  computer equipment  and leasehold improvement  as well as payments related to the expansion of our facilities in brazil 
in fy we added machinery and equipment in our newly rented weifang  china facility 
our facilities in china are not encumbered by commercial bank mortgages and thus chinese commercial mortgage loans may be available with respect to these real estate assets if we need additional liquidity 
we expect our capital expenditures to be approximately million to purchase our capital equipment primarily computer equipment and apparel manufacturing equipment contractual obligations we had no off balance sheet arrangements at january  as shown below  at january   our contractual cash obligations totaled approximately million  including lease renewals entered into subsequent to january  payments due by period total less than year years years after years canada facility loan operating leases other liabilities revolving credit facility total 
index seasonality our operations have historically been seasonal  with higher sales generally occurring in february  march  april and may when scheduled maintenance occurs on nuclear  coal  oil and gas fired utilities  chemical  petrochemical and smelting facilities  and other heavy industrial manufacturing plants  primarily due to moderate spring temperatures 
sales decline during the warmer summer and vacation months  and generally increase from labor day through february with slight declines during holidays 
as a result of this seasonality in our sales  we have historically experienced a corresponding seasonality in our working capital  specifically inventories  with peak inventories occurring between december and may coinciding with lead times required to accommodate the spring maintenance schedules 
we believe that by sustaining higher levels of inventory  we gain a competitive advantage in the marketplace 
certain of our large customers seek sole sourcing to avoid sourcing their requirements from multiple vendors whose prices  delivery times and quality standards differ 
in recent years  due to increased demand by first responders for our chemical suits and fire gear  our historical seasonal pattern has shifted 
governmental disbursements are dependent upon budgetary processes and grant administration processes that do not follow our traditional seasonal sales patterns 
due to the size and timing of these governmental orders  our net sales  results of operations  working capital requirements and cash flows can vary between different reporting periods 
as a result  we expect to experience increased variability in net sales  net income  working capital requirements and cash flows on a quarterly basis 
with our acquisition of the brazilian facility and exclusive supply agreement with west farmers in australia  this seasonality may decrease as the south american mercosur markets  chile  australia  new zealand and south africa markets experience their high seasons during our slow summer months and their low season during our winter months

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk foreign currency risk we are exposed to changes in foreign currency exchange rates as a result of our purchases and sales in other countries 
to manage the volatility relating to foreign currency exchange rates  we seek to limit  to the extent possible  our non us dollar denominated purchases and sales 
in connection with our operations in china  we purchase a significant amount of products from outside of the united states 
however  our purchases in china are primarily made in chinese yuan  the value of which had been largely pegged to the us dollar for the last decade 
however  the chinese yuan has recently been decoupled from the us dollar and allowed to float by the chinese government  and therefore  we will be exposed to additional foreign exchange rate risk on our chinese raw material and component purchases 
our primary risk from foreign currency exchange rate changes is presently related to non us dollar denominated sales in brazil  canada europe and  to a smaller extent  in other south american countries 
our sales to customers in brazil are denominated in brazilian reals  in canada in canadian dollars and in europe in euros and british pounds 
if the value of the us dollar increases relative to the canadian dollar  the real  the pound or the euro  then our net sales could decrease as our products would be more expensive to these international customers because of changes in rate of exchange 
our sales in china are denominated in the chinese yuan  however  our sales there were not affected this last year due to a steady exchange rate between the chinese rmb and the usd 
at this time  we do not manage the foreign currency risk through the use of derivative instruments 
a decrease in the value of the us dollar relative to foreign currencies would increase the landed costs of our products into the us  but would make our selling price for international sales more attractive with respect to foreign currencies 
as non us dollar denominated international purchases and sales grow  exposure to volatility in exchange rates could have a material adverse impact on our financial results 

index interest rate risk we are exposed to interest rate risk with respect to our credit facilities  which have variable interest rates based upon the london interbank offered rate  but of which million is subject to an interest rate swap with the benchmark fixed at 
at january   we had million in borrowings outstanding under this credit facility 
if the interest rate applicable to this variable rate debt rose in the year ended january   our interest expense would have increased by a negligible effect
