recent developments during september  we completed the merger of fwnb  which operated two branches in fort worth  one branch in arlington and a loan production office in austin  into southside bank 
this resulted in the termination of the fwnb charter and the integration of fwnb into our branch network

our expectation is that our presence in all of the market areas we serve will continue to grow in the future 
in addition  we continue to explore new markets in which we believe we can expand successfully 
the principal economic activities in our market areas include retail  distribution  manufacturing  medical services  education and oil and gas industries 
additionally  the industry base includes conventions and tourism  as well as retirement relocation 
these economic activities support a growing regional system of medical service  retail and education centers

the banking industry in texas the banking industry is affected by general economic conditions such as interest rates  inflation  recession  unemployment and other factors beyond our control 
during the last ten to years the texas economy has continued to diversify  decreasing the overall impact of fluctuations in oil and gas prices  however  the oil and gas industry is still a significant component of the texas economy 
during  our market areas began to experience the effects of the housing led slowdown that were impacting other regions of the united states 
beginning in the fourth quarter  as oil prices declined significantly and consumers all across the united states were impacted even more severely by the economic slowdown  our market areas began to experience a greater slowdown in economic activity 
we cannot predict whether current economic conditions will improve  remain the same or decline 
competition the activities we are engaged in are highly competitive 
financial institutions such as savings and loan associations  credit unions  consumer finance companies  insurance companies  brokerage companies and other financial institutions with varying degrees of regulatory restrictions compete vigorously for a share of the financial services market 
during  the number of financial institutions in our market areas increased  a trend that we expect will continue 
brokerage and insurance companies continue to become more competitive in the financial services arena and pose an ever increasing challenge to banks 
legislative changes also greatly affect the level of competition we face 
federal legislation allows credit unions to use their expanded membership capabilities  combined with tax free status  to compete more fiercely for traditional bank business 
the tax free status granted to credit unions provides them a significant competitive advantage 
many of the largest banks operating in texas  including some of the largest banks in the country  have offices in our market areas 
many of these institutions have capital resources  broader geographic markets  and legal lending limits substantially in excess of those available to us 
we face competition from institutions that offer products and services we do not or cannot currently offer 
some institutions we compete with offer interest rate levels on loan and deposit products that we are unwilling to offer due to interest rate risk and overall profitability concerns 
we expect the level of competition to increase 
employees at february   we employed approximately full time equivalent persons 
none of the employees are represented by any unions or similar groups  and we have not experienced any type of strike or labor dispute

supervision and regulation general banking is a complex  highly regulated industry 
as bank holding companies under federal law  southside bancshares  inc and its wholly owned subsidiary  southside delaware financial corporation  collectively  the holding companies are subject to regulation  supervision and examination by the board of governors of the federal reserve system federal reserve 
as a texas chartered state bank  southside bank is subject to regulation  supervision and examination by the texas department of banking tdb  as its chartering authority  and by the federal deposit insurance corporation fdic  as its primary federal regulator and deposit insurer 
this system of regulation and supervision applicable to us establishes a comprehensive framework for our operations and is intended primarily for the protection of the fdic s deposit insurance fund dif and the public rather than our shareholders and creditors 
the earnings of southside bank and  therefore  the earnings of the holding companies  are affected by general economic conditions  changes in federal and state laws and regulations and actions of various regulatory authorities  including those referenced above 
proposals to change the laws and regulations applicable to us are frequently introduced at both the federal and state levels 
current proposals include an extensive restructuring of the regulatory framework within which we operate 
the likelihood and timing of any such change and the impact any such change may have on us are impossible to determine with any certainty 
set forth below is a brief description of the significant federal and state laws and regulations to which we are currently subject 
these descriptions do not purport to be complete and are qualified in their entirety by reference to the particular statutory or regulatory provision 
holding company regulation as bank holding companies under the bank holding company act of bhca  as amended  the holding companies are registered with and subject to regulation  supervision and examination by the federal reserve 
the holding companies are required to file annual and other reports with  and furnish information to  the federal reserve  which makes periodic inspections of the holding companies 
permitted activities 
under the bhca  a bank holding company is generally permitted to engage in  or acquire direct or indirect control of more than percent of the voting shares of any company engaged in the following activities banking or managing or controlling banks  furnishing services to or performing services for our subsidiaries  and any activity that the federal reserve determines to be so closely related to banking as to be a proper incident to the business of banking  including o factoring accounts receivable  o making  acquiring  brokering or servicing loans and usual related activities  o leasing personal or real property  o operating a nonbank depository institution  such as a savings association  o trust company functions  o financial and investment advisory activities  o conducting discount securities brokerage activities  o underwriting and dealing in government obligations and money market instruments  o providing specified management consulting and counseling activities  o performing selected data processing services and support services  o acting as agent or broker in selling credit life insurance and other types of insurance in connection with credit transactions  and o performing selected insurance underwriting activities 
the federal reserve has the authority to order a bank holding company or its subsidiaries to terminate any of these activities or to terminate its ownership or control of any subsidiary when it has reasonable cause to believe that the bank holding company s continued ownership  activity or control constitutes a serious risk to the financial safety  soundness or stability of it or any of its bank subsidiaries 
bank holding companies meeting certain eligibility requirements may elect to become a financial holding company 
a financial holding company and companies under its control may engage in activities that are financial in nature  as defined by the gramm leach bliley act glba and federal reserve interpretations  and therefore may engage in a broader range of activities than those permitted for bank holding companies and their subsidiaries 
financial activities specifically include insurance brokerage and underwriting  securities underwriting and dealing  merchant banking  investment advisory and lending activities 
financial holding companies and their subsidiaries also may engage in additional activities that are determined by the federal reserve  in consultation with the treasury department  to be financial in nature or incidental to a financial activity or are determined by the federal reserve unilaterally to be complimentary to financial activities 
the holding companies have not sought financial holding company status 
however  there can be no assurance that they will not make such an election in the future 
if the holding companies were to elect financial holding company status  the bank and any other insured depository institution the holding companies control would have to be well capitalized  well managed  and have at least a satisfactory rating under the community reinvestment act discussed below 
capital adequacy 
each of the federal banking agencies  including the federal reserve and the fdic  has issued substantially similar risk based and leverage capital guidelines applicable to the banking organizations they supervise 
the agencies risk based guidelines define a three tier capital framework 
tier capital includes common shareholders equity  trust preferred securities  minority interests and qualifying preferred stock  less goodwill and other adjustments 
tier capital consists of preferred stock not qualifying as tier capital  mandatorily convertible debt  limited amounts of subordinated debt  other qualifying term debt  a limited amount of the allowance for credit losses and other adjustments 
tier capital includes subordinated debt that is unsecured  fully paid  has an original maturity of at least two years  is not redeemable before maturity without prior approval by the federal reserve and includes a lock in clause precluding payment of either interest or principal if the payment would cause the issuing bank s risk based capital ratio to fall or remain below the requirement minimum 
the sum of tier and tier capital less investments in unconsolidated subsidiaries represents qualifying total capital 
risk based capital ratios are calculated by dividing  as appropriate  total capital and tier capital by risk weighted assets 
assets and off balance sheet exposures are assigned to one of four categories of risk weights  based primarily on relative credit risk 
under these risk based capital requirements  the holding companies and southside bank are each generally required to maintain a minimum ratio of total capital to risk weighted assets of at least and a minimum ratio of tier capital to risk weighted assets of at least 
to the extent we engage in trading activities  we are required to adjust our risk based capital ratios to take into consideration market risks that may result from movements in market prices of covered trading positions in trading accounts  or from foreign exchange or commodity positions  whether or not in trading accounts  including changes in interest rates  equity prices  foreign exchange rates or commodity prices 
any capital required to be maintained under these provisions may consist of tier capital 
each of the federal bank regulatory agencies  including the federal reserve and the fdic  also have established minimum leverage capital requirements for the banking organizations they supervise 
these requirements provide that banking organizations that meet certain criteria  including excellent asset quality  high liquidity  low interest rate exposure and good earnings  and that have received the highest regulatory rating must maintain a ratio of tier capital to total adjusted average assets of at least 
institutions not meeting these criteria  as well as institutions with supervisory  financial or operational weaknesses  are expected to maintain a minimum tier capital to total adjusted average assets ratio equal to to basis points above that stated minimum 
holding companies experiencing internal growth or making acquisitions are expected to maintain strong capital positions substantially above the minimum supervisory levels without significant reliance on intangible assets 
the federal reserve also continues to consider a tangible tier capital leverage ratio deducting all intangibles and other indicators of capital strength in evaluating proposals for expansion or new activity 
in  the basel committee on banking supervision published a new set of risk based capital standards basel ii in order to update the original international capital standards that had been put in place in basel i 
basel ii adopts a three pillar framework comprised of minimum capital requirements  supervisory assessment of capital adequacy and market discipline 
basel ii provides several options for determining capital requirements for credit and operational risk 
in december  the agencies adopted a final rule implementing basel ii s advanced approach 
the final rule became effective on april  compliance with the final rule is mandatory only for core banks us banking organizations with over billion in banking assets or on balance sheet foreign exposures of at least billion 
other us banking organizations that meet applicable qualification requirements may elect  but are not required  to comply with the final rule 
the final rule also allows a banking organization s primary federal regulator to determine that application of the rule would not be appropriate in light of the organization s asset size  level of complexity  risk profile or scope of operations 
in july  in order to address the potential competitive inequalities resulting from the now bifurcated risk based capital system in the united states  the agencies agreed to issue a proposed rule that would provide non core banks with the option to adopt an approach consistent with basel ii s standardized approach 
this proposed new rule will replace the agencies earlier proposed amendments to existing basel i risk based capital rules referred to as the basel i a approach 
at this time  us banking organizations not subject to the final rule are required to continue to use the existing basel i risk based capital rules 
the holding companies are not required  and have not elected  to comply with the final rule 
the ratios of tier capital  total capital to risk adjusted assets  and leverage capital of the company and the bank as of december   are shown in the following table 
capital adequacy ratios regulatory minimums regulatory minimums to be well capitalized southside bancshares  inc southside bank risk based capital ratios tier capital total risk based capital tier leverage ratio common shareholders equity excluding unrealized gains or losses on debt securities available for sale  unrealized gains on equity securities available for sale and unrealized gains or losses on cash flow hedges  net of deferred income taxes  plus certain mandatorily redeemable capital securities  less nonqualifying intangible assets net of applicable deferred income taxes  and certain nonfinancial equity investments  computed as a ratio of risk weighted assets  as defined in the risk based capital guidelines 
the sum of tier capital  a qualifying portion of the allowance for credit losses  qualifying subordinated debt and qualifying unrealized gains on available for sale equity securities  computed as a ratio of risk weighted assets  as defined in the risk based capital guidelines 
tier capital computed as a percentage of fourth quarter average assets less nonqualifying intangibles and certain nonfinancial equity investments 
source of strength 
federal reserve policy requires a bank holding company to act as a source of financial strength and to take measures to preserve and protect bank subsidiaries in situations where additional investments in a troubled bank may not otherwise be warranted 
as a result  a bank holding company may be required to contribute additional capital to its subsidiaries in the form of capital notes or other instruments which qualify as capital under regulatory rules 
any such loans from the holding company to its subsidiary banks likely will be unsecured and subordinated to the bank s depositors and perhaps to other creditors of the bank 
see also bank regulation prompt corrective action 
dividends 
the principal source of our liquidity at the parent company level is dividends from southside bank 
southside bank is subject to federal and state restrictions on its ability to pay dividends to southside delaware financial corporation  the direct parent of southside bank  which in turn may affect the ability of southside delaware to pay dividends to the company 
we must pay essentially all of our operating expenses from funds we receive from southside bank 
therefore  shareholders may receive dividends from us only to the extent that funds are available after payment of our operating expenses 
consistent with its source of strength policy  the federal reserve discourages bank holding companies from paying dividends except out of operating earnings and prefers that dividends be paid only if  after the payment  the prospective rate of earnings retention appears consistent with the bank holding company s capital needs  asset quality and overall financial condition 
change in control 
under the change in bank control act cbca  persons who intend to acquire direct or indirect control of a depository institution  must give days prior notice to the appropriate federal banking agency 
with respect to the holding companies  control would exist where an acquiring party directly or indirectly owns  controls or has the power to vote at least of our voting securities 
under the federal reserve s cbca regulations  a rebuttable presumption of control would arise with respect to an acquisition where  after the transaction  the acquiring party owns  controls or has the power to vote at least but less than of our voting securities 
acquisitions 
the bhca provides that a bank holding company must obtain the prior approval of the federal reserve i for the acquisition of more than five percent of the voting stock in any bank or bank holding company  ii for the acquisition of substantially all the assets of any bank or bank holding company or iii in order to merge or consolidate with another bank holding company 
regulatory examination 
federal and state banking agencies require the holding companies and southside bank to prepare annual reports on financial condition and to conduct an annual audit of financial affairs in compliance with minimum standards and procedures 
southside bank  and in some cases the holding companies and any nonbank affiliates  must undergo regular on site examinations by the appropriate banking agency 
the cost of examinations may be assessed against the examined organization as the agency deems necessary or appropriate 
the fdic has developed a method for insured depository institutions to provide supplemental disclosure of the estimated fair market value of assets and liabilities  to the extent feasible and practicable  in any balance sheet  financial statement  report of condition or any other report 
enforcement authority 
the federal reserve has broad enforcement powers over bank holding companies and their nonbank subsidiaries and has authority to prohibit activities that represent unsafe or unsound banking practices or constitute knowing or reckless violations of laws or regulations 
these powers may be exercised through the issuance of cease and desist orders  civil money penalties or other actions 
civil money penalties can be as high as  for each day the activity continues 
bank regulation southside bank is a texas chartered commercial bank  the deposits of which are insured up to the applicable limits by the dif of the fdic 
it is not a member of the federal reserve system 
the bank is subject to extensive regulation  examination and supervision by the tdb  as its chartering authority  and by the fdic  as its primary federal regulator and deposit insurer 
the federal and state laws applicable to banks regulate  among other things  the scope of their business and investments  lending and deposit taking activities  borrowings  maintenance of retained earnings and reserve accounts  distribution of earnings and payment of dividends 
permitted activities and investments 
under the federal deposit insurance act fdia  the activities and investments of state nonmember banks are generally limited to those permissible for national banks  notwithstanding state law 
with fdic approval  a state nonmember bank may engage in activities not permissible for a national bank if the fdic determines that the activity does not pose a significant risk to the dif and that the bank meets its minimum capital requirements 
similarly  under texas law  a state bank may engage in those activities permissible for national banks domiciled in texas 
the tdb may permit a texas state bank to engage in additional activities so long as the performance of the activity by the bank would not adversely affect the safety and soundness of the bank 
brokered deposits 
southside bank also may be restricted in its ability to accept brokered deposits  depending on its capital classification 
only well capitalized banks are permitted to accept brokered deposits 
the fdic may  on a case by case basis  permit banks that are adequately capitalized to accept brokered deposits if the fdic determines that acceptance of such deposits would not constitute an unsafe or unsound banking practice with respect to the bank 
loans to one borrower 
under texas law  without the approval of the tdb and subject to certain limited exceptions  the maximum aggregate amount of loans that southside bank is permitted to make to any one borrower is of tier capital 
insider loans 
under regulation o of the federal reserve  as made applicable to state nonmember banks by section j of the fdia  southside bank is subject to quantitative restrictions on extensions of credit to its executive officers and directors  the executive officers and directors of the holding companies  any owner of or more of its stock or the stock of southside bancshares  inc  and certain entities affiliated with any such persons 
any such extensions of credit must i be made on substantially the same terms  including interest rates and collateral  as those prevailing at the time for comparable transactions with third parties and ii not involve more than the normal risk of repayment or present other unfavorable features 
additional restrictions are imposed on extensions of credit to executive officers 
deposit insurance 
the deposits of southside bank are insured by the dif of the fdic  up to the applicable limits established by law and are subject to the deposit insurance premium assessments of the dif 
the fdic uses a risk based premium assessment system  which was amended by the federal deposit insurance reform act of the reform act 
under this system  assessment rates for insured depository institutions vary according to the institution s level of risk 
to arrive at an assessment rate  the fdic assigns an institution to one of four risk categories with the first category having two subcategories based on the institution s most recent supervisory and capital evaluations designed to measure risk 
assessment rates in ranged from of deposits for institutions in the highest category to of deposits for institutions in the lowest category  but could be higher under certain conditions 
the fdic is authorized to raise the assessment rates as necessary to maintain the required reserve ratio of 
under the current system  premiums are assessed quarterly 
the reform act also provided for a one time premium assessment credit for eligible depository institutions  including those institutions in existence and paying deposit insurance premiums at december   and is applied automatically to reduce the institution s quarterly premium assessment to the maximum extent allowed  until the credit is exhausted 
in addition  all fdic insured institutions are required to pay a pro rata portion of the interest due on bonds issued by the financing corporation fico to fund the closing and disposal of failed thrift institutions by the resolution trust corporation 
fico assessments are set quarterly  and in ranged from basis points in the first quarter to basis points in the fourth quarter 
these assessments will continue until the fico bonds mature in through effective november  and until december   the fdic expanded deposit insurance limits for certain accounts under the fdic s temporary liquidity guarantee program 
provided an institution has not opted out of the temporary liquidity guarantee program  the fdic will fully guarantee funds deposited in noninterest bearing transaction accounts  including i interest on lawyer trust accounts or iolta accounts  and ii negotiable order of withdrawal or now accounts with rates no higher than percent if the institution has committed to maintain the interest rate at or below that rate 
in conjunction with the increased deposit insurance coverage  insurance assessments also increase 
southside bank has not opted out of the temporary liquidity guarantee program 
capital adequacy 
see holding company regulation capital adequacy 
prompt corrective action 
the federal deposit insurance improvement act of fdicia  among other things  identifies five capital categories for insured depository institutions well capitalized  adequately capitalized  undercapitalized  significantly undercapitalized and critically undercapitalized 
fdicia requires the federal banking agencies  including the fdic  to implement systems for prompt corrective action for insured depository institutions that do not meet minimum capital requirements within these categories 
the fdicia imposes progressively more restrictive restraints on operations  management and capital distributions  as the classification of a bank or thrift deteriorates 
failure to meet the capital guidelines also could subject a depository institution to capital raising requirements 
an undercapitalized bank must develop a capital restoration plan and its parent holding company must guarantee the bank s compliance with the plan 
the liability of the parent holding company under any such guarantee is limited to the lesser of of the bank s assets at the time it became undercapitalized or the amount needed to comply with the plan 
furthermore  in the event of the bankruptcy of the parent holding company  such guarantee would take priority over the parent s general unsecured creditors 
the bank currently meets the criteria for well capitalized 
within the prompt corrective action regulations  the federal banking agencies also have established procedures for downgrading an institution to a lower capital category based on supervisory factors other than capital 
specifically  a federal banking agency may  after notice and an opportunity for a hearing  reclassify a well capitalized institution as adequately capitalized and may require an adequately capitalized institution or an undercapitalized institution to comply with supervisory actions as if it were in the next lower category if the institution is operating in an unsafe or unsound condition or engaging in an unsafe or unsound practice 
the fdic may not  however  reclassify a significantly undercapitalized institution as critically undercapitalized 
in addition to the prompt corrective action directives  failure to meet capital guidelines may subject a banking organization to a variety of other enforcement remedies  including additional substantial restrictions on its operations and activities  termination of deposit insurance by the fdic and  under certain conditions  the appointment of a conservator or receiver 
standards for safety and soundness 
the fdia also requires the federal banking regulatory agencies to prescribe  by regulation or guideline  operational and managerial standards for all insured depository institutions relating to i internal controls  information systems and internal audit systems  ii loan documentation  iii credit underwriting  iv interest rate risk exposure  and v asset growth 
the agencies also must prescribe standards for asset quality  earnings  and stock valuation  as well as standards for compensation  fees and benefits 
the federal banking agencies have adopted regulations and interagency guidelines prescribing standards for safety and soundness guidelines to implement these required standards 
the guidelines set forth the safety and soundness standards that the federal banking agencies use to identify and address problems at insured depository institutions before capital becomes impaired 
under the regulations  if the fdic determines that the bank fails to meet any standards prescribed by the guidelines  it may require the bank to submit an acceptable plan to achieve compliance  consistent with deadlines for the submission and review of such safety and soundness compliance plans 
dividends 
all dividends paid by southside bank are paid to the company  as sole indirect shareholder of southside bank  through southside delaware 
the ability of southside bank  as a texas state bank  to pay dividends is restricted under federal and state law and regulations 
as an initial matter  the fdicia and the regulations of the fdic generally prohibit an insured depository institution from making a capital distribution including payment of dividend if  thereafter  the institution would not be at least adequately capitalized 
under texas law  southside bank generally may not pay a dividend reducing its capital and surplus without the prior approval of the texas banking commissioner 
all dividends must be paid out of net profits then on hand  after deducting expenses  including losses and provisions for loan losses 
southside bank s general dividend policy is to pay dividends at levels consistent with maintaining liquidity and preserving applicable capital ratios and servicing obligations 
southside bank s dividend policies are subject to the discretion of its board of directors and will depend upon such factors as future earnings  financial conditions  cash needs  capital adequacy  compliance with applicable statutory and regulatory requirements and general business conditions 
the exact amount of future dividends paid by southside bank will be a function of its general profitability which cannot be accurately estimated or assured  applicable tax rates in effect from year to year and the discretion of its board of directors 
transactions with affiliates 
southside bank is subject to sections a and b of the federal reserve act fra and the federal reserve s regulation w  as made applicable to state nonmember banks by section j of the fdia 
sections a and b of the fra restrict a bank s ability to engage in certain transactions with its affiliates 
an affiliate of a bank is any company or entity that controls  is controlled by or is under common control with the bank 
in a holding company context  the parent bank holding company and any companies controlled by such parent holding company are generally affiliates of the bank 
specifically  section a places limits on the amount of covered transactions  which include loans or extensions of credit to  and investments in or certain other transactions with  affiliates 
it also limits the amount of any advances to third parties that are collateralized by the securities or obligations of affiliates 
the aggregate of all covered transactions is limited to percent of the bank s capital and surplus for any one affiliate and percent for all affiliates 
additionally  within the foregoing limitations  each covered transaction must meet specified collateral requirements ranging from to percent of the loan amount  depending on the type of collateral 
further  banks are prohibited from purchasing low quality assets from an affiliate 
section b  among other things  prohibits a bank from engaging in certain transactions with affiliates unless the transactions are on terms substantially the same  or at least as favorable to the bank  as those prevailing at the time for comparable transactions with nonaffiliated companies 
anti tying regulations 
under the bhca and federal reserve s regulations  a bank is prohibited from engaging in certain tying or reciprocity arrangements with its customers 
in general  a bank may not extend credit  lease  sell property  or furnish any services or fix or vary the consideration for these products or services on the condition that either i the customer obtain or provide some additional credit  property  or services from or to the bank  the bank holding company or subsidiaries thereof or ii the customer not obtain credit  property  or service from a competitor  except to the extent reasonable conditions are imposed to assure the soundness of the credit extended 
a bank may  however  offer combined balance products and may otherwise offer more favorable terms if a customer obtains two or more traditional bank products 
community reinvestment act 
under the community reinvestment act cra  southside bank has a continuing and affirmative obligation  consistent with safe and sound banking practices  to help meet the needs of our entire community  including low and moderate income neighborhoods 
the cra does not establish specific lending requirements or programs for banks nor does it limit a bank s discretion to develop the types of products and services that it believes are best suited to its particular community 
on a periodic basis  the fdic is charged with preparing a written evaluation of our record of meeting the credit needs of the entire community and assigning a rating outstanding  satisfactory  needs to improve or substantial noncompliance 
banks are rated based on their actual performance in meeting community credit needs 
the fdic will take that rating into account in its evaluation of any application made by the bank for  among other things  approval of the acquisition or establishment of a branch or other deposit facility  an office relocation  a merger or the acquisition of shares of capital stock of another financial institution 
a bank s cra rating may be used as the basis to deny or condition an application 
in addition  as discussed above  a bank holding company may not become a financial holding company unless each of its subsidiary banks has a cra rating of at least satisfactory 
southside bank was last examined for compliance with the cra on march  and received a rating of outstanding 
branch banking 
pursuant to the texas finance code  all banks located in texas are authorized to branch statewide 
accordingly  a bank located anywhere in texas has the ability  subject to regulatory approval  to establish branch facilities near any of our facilities and within our market area 
if other banks were to establish branch facilities near our facilities  it is uncertain whether these branch facilities would have a material adverse effect on our business 
the reigle neal interstate banking and branching efficiency act of provides for nationwide interstate banking and branching  subject to certain age and deposit concentration limits that may be imposed under applicable state laws 
texas law permits interstate branching in two manners  with certain exceptions 
first  a bank with its main office outside of texas may establish a branch in the state of texas by merging with a bank located in texas that is at least five years old  so long as the resulting institution and its affiliates would not hold more than of the total deposits in the state after the acquisition 
in addition  a bank with its main office outside of texas generally may establish a branch in the state of texas on a de novo basis if the bank s main office is located in a state that would permit texas banks to establish a branch on a de novo basis in that state 
the fdic has adopted regulations under the reigle neal act to prohibit an out of state bank from using the interstate branching authority primarily for the purpose of deposit production 
these regulations include guidelines to insure that interstate branches operated by an out of state bank in a host state are reasonably helping to meet the credit needs of the communities served by the out of state bank 
consumer regulation

in addition  southside bank also may be subject to certain state laws and regulations designed to protect consumers 
commercial real estate lending 
lending operations that involve concentration of commercial real estate loans are subject to enhanced scrutiny by federal banking regulators 
the regulators have issued guidance with respect to the risks posed by commercial real estate lending concentrations 
real estate loans generally include land development  construction loans  loans secured by multi family property and nonfarm nonresidential real property where the primary source of repayment is derived from rental income associated with the property 
the guidance prescribes the following guidelines for examiners to help identify institutions that are potentially exposed to concentration risk and may warrant greater supervisory scrutiny total reported loans for construction  land development and other land represent percent or more of the institutions total capital  or total commercial real estate loans represent percent or more of the institution s total capital and the outstanding balance of the institution s commercial real estate loan portfolio has increased by percent or more during the prior months 
anti money laundering 
southside bank is subject to the regulations of the financial crimes enforcement network fincen  which implement the bank secrecy act  as amended by the uniting and strengthening america by providing appropriate tools required to intercept and obstruct terrorism act of  or the usa patriot act 
the usa patriot act gives the federal government the power to address terrorist threats through enhanced domestic security measures  expanded surveillance powers  increased information sharing  and broadened anti money laundering requirements 
title iii of the usa patriot act includes measures intended to encourage information sharing among banks  regulatory agencies and law enforcement bodies 
further  certain provisions of title iii impose affirmative obligations on a broad range of financial institutions  including state chartered banks like southside bank 
the usa patriot act and the related fincen regulations impose the following requirements with respect to financial institutions establishment of anti money laundering programs  including adoption of written procedures  designation of a compliance officer and auditing of the program  establishment of a program specifying procedures for obtaining information from customers seeking to open new accounts  including verifying the identity of customers within a reasonable period of time  establishment of enhanced due diligence policies  procedures and controls designed to detect and report money laundering  prohibitions on correspondent accounts for foreign shell banks and compliance with recordkeeping obligations with respect to correspondent accounts of foreign banks  and requirements that bank regulators consider bank holding company or bank compliance in connection with merger or acquisition transactions 
bank regulators routinely examine institutions for compliance with these obligations and have been active in imposing cease and desist orders and money penalty sanctions against institutions found to be violating these obligations 
the federal bureau of investigation can send bank regulatory agencies lists of the names of persons suspected of involvement in terrorist activities 
southside bank can be requested to search its records for any relationships or transactions with persons on those lists and required to report any identified relationships or transactions 
ofac 
the office of foreign assets control ofac is responsible for helping to insure that us entities do not engage in transactions with certain prohibited parties  as defined by various executive orders and acts of congress 
ofac has sent  and will continue to send  bank regulatory agencies lists of names of persons and organizations suspected of aiding  harboring or engaging in terrorist acts  known as specially designated nationals and blocked persons 
if we find a name on any transaction  account or wire transfer that is on an ofac list  we must freeze such account  file a suspicious activity report and notify the appropriate authorities 
privacy and data security 
under federal law  financial institutions are generally prohibited from disclosing consumer information to non affiliated third parties unless the consumer has been given the opportunity to object and has not objected to such disclosure 
financial institutions are further required to disclose their privacy policies to consumers annually 
to the extent state laws are more protective of consumer privacy  financial institutions must comply with state law privacy provisions 
in addition  federal and state banking agencies have prescribed standards for maintaining the security and confidentiality of consumer information 
southside bank is subject to such standards  as well as standards for notifying consumers in the event of a security breach 
under federal law  southside bank must disclose its privacy policy to consumers  permit consumers to opt out of having non public customer information disclosed to third parties  and allow customers to opt out of receiving marketing solicitations based on information about the customer received from another subsidiary 
states may adopt more extensive privacy protections 
southside bank is similarly required to have an information security program to safeguard the confidentiality and security of customer information and to ensure proper disposal 
customers must be notified when unauthorized disclosure involves sensitive customer information that may be misused 
regulatory examination 
see holding company regulation 
enforcement authority 
southside bank and its institution affiliated parties  including management  employees  agents  independent contractors and consultants  such as attorneys and accountants and others who participate in the conduct of the institution s affairs  are subject to potential civil and criminal penalties for violations of law  regulations or written orders of a government agency 
these practices can include failure to timely file required reports  filing false or misleading information or submitting inaccurate reports 
civil penalties may be as high as  a day for such violations  and criminal penalties for some financial institution crimes may include imprisonment for years 
regulators have flexibility to commence enforcement actions against institutions and institution affiliated parties  including termination of deposit insurance 
when issued by a banking agency  cease and desist orders may  among other things  require affirmative action to correct any harm resulting from a violation or practice  including restitution  reimbursement  indemnifications or guarantees against loss 
a financial institution may also be ordered to restrict its growth  dispose of certain assets  rescind agreements or contracts  or take other actions determined to be appropriate by the ordering agency 
governmental monetary policies 
the commercial banking business is affected not only by general economic conditions but also by the monetary policies of the federal reserve 
changes in the discount rate on member bank borrowings  control of borrowings  open market operations  the imposition of and changes in reserve requirements against member banks  deposits and assets of foreign branches  the imposition of and changes in reserve requirements against certain borrowings by banks and their affiliates and the placing of limits on interest rates which member banks may pay on time and savings deposits are some of the instruments of monetary policy available to the federal reserve 
those monetary policies influence to a significant extent the overall growth of all bank loans  investments and deposits and the interest rates charged on loans or paid on time and savings deposits 
the nature of future monetary policies and the effect of such policies on southside bank s future business and earnings  therefore  cannot be predicted accurately 
capital purchase program 
under title i of the emergency economic stabilization act eesa enacted in october  the us treasury department treasury has established the troubled asset relief program tarp  which includes the capital purchase program cpp 
under the cpp  the treasury will  upon application by a bank holding company and approval by the federal reserve board and the primary federal regulator of the subsidiary bank or banks  purchase senior preferred stock from the company 
because of our sound financial condition and the conditions that are or may be imposed on use of the cpp funds or on the institutions that received cpp funds  we have chosen not to apply for such funds 
item a 
risk factors an investment in our common stock is subject to risks inherent to our business 
the material risks and uncertainties that management believes affect us are described below 
before making an investment decision  you should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described below together with all of the other information included or incorporated by reference in this report 
the risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones facing us 
additional risks and uncertainties that management is not aware of or focused on or that management currently deems immaterial may also impair our business operations 
this report is qualified in its entirety by these risk factors 
if any of the following risks actually occur  our financial condition and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 
if this were to happen  the value of our common stock could decline significantly  and you could lose all or part of your investment 
risks related to our business we are subject to the current economic environment which poses significant challenges for us and could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 
we are operating in a challenging and uncertain economic environment 
financial institutions continue to be affected by declines in the real estate market and constrained financial markets 
we retain direct exposure to the residential and commercial real estate markets  and we could be affected by these events 
continued declines in real estate values  home sales volumes and financial stress on borrowers as a result of the uncertain economic environment  including job losses  could have an adverse effect on our borrowers or their customers  which could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 
in addition  the national economic recession and any deterioration in local economic conditions in our markets could drive losses beyond those which are provided for in our allowance for loan losses and result in the following consequences increase in loan delinquencies  increases in nonperforming assets and foreclosures  decreases in demand for our products and services  which could adversely affect our liquidity position  decreases in the value of the collateral securing our loans  especially real estate  which could reduce customers borrowing power  and decrease in the credit quality of our non us government and non us agency investment securities  especially our trust preferred  corporate and municipal securities  could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 
we are faced with current levels of market volatility that are unprecedented and could adversely impact our results of operations and access to capital 
the capital and credit markets have been experiencing volatility and disruption for more than one year 
in recent months  volatility in  and disruption of  these markets have reached unprecedented levels 
in some cases  the markets have produced downward pressure on stock prices and credit capacity without regard to an issuer s underlying financial strength 
if current levels of market disruption and volatility continue or worsen  there can be no assurance that we will not experience adverse effects  which may be material  on our ability to access capital and on our results of operations and financial condition  including our liquidity position 
there can be no assurance that recently enacted or future legislation will stabilize the us financial system  and we cannot predict the effect such legislation may have on us 
the eesa was the result of a proposal by the treasury in response to the financial crises affecting the banking system and financial markets and threats to investment banks and other financial institutions 
pursuant to the eesa  the treasury has the authority to spend up to billion to purchase equity in financial institutions  purchase mortgages  mortgage backed securities and certain other financial instruments from financial institutions for the purpose of stabilizing and providing liquidity to the us financial markets 
on october   the treasury announced the cpp  a program under the eesa pursuant to which it would purchase senior preferred stock and warrants to purchase common stock from participating financial institutions 
on november   the fdic adopted a final rule with respect to its temporary liquidity guarantee program pursuant to which the fdic will guarantee certain newly issued unsecured debt of banks and certain holding companies and also guarantee  on an unlimited basis  noninterest bearing bank transaction accounts 
on february   treasury secretary geithner announced a new stimulus plan  the financial stability plan  which is intended  among other things  to create a public private investment fund used to purchase distressed assets  create a consumer and business lending initiative  provide further capital assistance to financial institutions  stem foreclosures and restructure mortgages 
each of these programs  as well as others adopted under the eesa  was implemented to help stabilize and provide liquidity to the financial system 
there can be no assurance  however  as to the actual impact that the eesa  the fdic programs  the financial stability plan or any other governmental program will have on the financial markets 
we cannot predict the effect of the eesa  the fdic  the financial stability plan or other governmental programs  but the failure of these programs to stabilize the financial markets and a continuation or worsening of current financial market conditions likely will materially and adversely affect our business  financial condition  results of operations  access to credit and the trading price of our common stock 
the eesa may impact the fair value determinations of our invested assets and may lead to regulatory limitations  impositions and restrictions upon us 
several provisions of the eesa could affect us 
purchase prices under the eesa could impact market place fair values of similar securities  thereby impacting our fair value determinations 
also  the mandatory plan adopted to recoup the net losses of the eesa within the next five years may target financial institutions such as us and may lead to regulatory limitations  impositions and future assessments 
all of these factors may have an adverse material impact on our results of operations  equity  business and insurer financial strength and debt ratings 
we are subject to interest rate risk 
our earnings and cash flows are largely dependent upon our net interest income 
net interest income is the difference between interest income earned on interest earning assets such as loans and securities and interest expense paid on interest bearing liabilities such as deposits and borrowed funds 
interest rates are highly sensitive to many factors that are beyond our control  including general economic conditions and policies of various governmental and regulatory agencies and  in particular  the board of governors of the federal reserve system 
changes in monetary policy  changes in interest rates  changes in the yield curve  changes in market risk spreads  and a prolonged inverted yield curve could influence not only the interest we receive on loans and securities and the amount of interest we pay on deposits and borrowings  but such changes could also affect our ability to originate loans and obtain deposits  net interest rate spreads and net interest rate margins  our ability to enter into instruments to hedge against interest rate risk  the fair value of our financial assets and liabilities  and the average duration of our loan and mortgage backed securities portfolio 
if the interest rates paid on deposits and other borrowings increase at a faster rate than the interest rates received on loans and other investments  our net interest income  and therefore earnings  could be adversely affected 
earnings could also be adversely affected if the interest rates received on loans and other investments fall more quickly than the interest rates paid on deposits and other borrowings 
any substantial  unexpected or prolonged change in market interest rates could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
see the section captioned net interest income in item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations for further discussion related to our management of interest rate risk 
we are subject to credit quality risks and our credit policies may not be sufficient to avoid losses 
we are subject to the risk of losses resulting from the failure of borrowers  guarantors and related parties to pay interest and principal amounts on their loans 
although we maintain credit policies and credit underwriting and monitoring and collection procedures  these policies and procedures may not prevent losses  particularly during periods in which the local  regional or national economy suffers a general decline 
if borrowers fail to repay their loans  our financial condition and results of operations would be adversely affected 
our interest rate risk  liquidity  market value of securities and profitability are subject to risks associated with the successful implementation of our leverage strategy 
we implemented a leverage strategy in for the purpose of enhancing overall profitability by maximizing the use of our capital 
the effectiveness of our leverage strategy  and therefore our profitability  may be adversely affected by a number of factors  including reduced net interest margin and spread  adverse market value changes to the investment and mortgage backed and related securities  incorrect modeling results due to the unpredictable nature of mortgage backed securities prepayments  the length of interest rate cycles and the slope of the interest rate yield curve 
in addition  we may not be able to obtain wholesale funding to profitably and properly fund the leverage program 
if our leverage strategy is flawed or poorly implemented  we may incur significant losses 
see the section captioned leverage strategy in item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
we have a high concentration of loans secured by real estate and a continued downturn in the real estate market  for any reason  could result in losses and materially and adversely affect our business  financial condition  results of operations and future prospects 
a significant portion of our loan portfolio is dependent on real estate 
in addition to the financial strength and cash flow characteristics of the borrower in each case  often loans are secured with real estate collateral 
at december   approximately of our loans have real estate as a primary or secondary component of collateral 
the real estate in each case provides an alternate source of repayment in the event of default by the borrower and may deteriorate in value during the time the credit is extended 
beginning in the third quarter of and continuing throughout and into  there were well publicized developments in the credit markets  beginning with a decline in the sub prime mortgage lending market  which later extended to the markets for collateralized mortgage obligations  mortgage backed securities and the lending markets generally 
this decline has resulted in restrictions in the resale markets for non conforming loans and has had an adverse effect on retail mortgage lending operations in many markets 
a continued decline in the credit markets generally could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations if we are unable to extend credit or sell loans in the secondary market 
an adverse change in the economy affecting values of real estate generally or in our primary markets specifically could significantly impair the value of collateral and our ability to sell the collateral upon foreclosure 
furthermore  it is likely that  in a declining real estate market  we would be required to further increase our allowance for loan losses 
if we are required to liquidate the collateral securing a loan to satisfy the debt during a period of reduced real estate values or to increase our allowance for loan losses  our profitability and financial condition could be adversely impacted 
we have a high concentration of loans directly related to the medical community in our market area  primarily in smith and gregg counties 
a negative change adversely impacting the medical community  for any reason  could result in losses and materially and adversely affect our business  financial condition  results of operations and future prospects 
a significant portion of our loan portfolio is dependent on the medical community 
the primary source of repayment for loans in the medical community is cash flow from continuing operations 
however  changes in the amount the government pays the medical community through the various government health insurance programs could adversely impact the medical community  which in turn could result in higher default rates by borrowers in the medical industry 
increased regulation of the medical community could also negatively impact profitability and cash flow in the medical community 
it is likely that  should there be any significant adverse impact to the medical community  our profitability and financial condition would also be adversely impacted 
our allowance for probable loan losses may be insufficient 
we maintain an allowance for probable loan losses  which is a reserve established through a provision for probable loan losses charged to expense 
this allowance represents management s best estimate of probable losses that may exist within the existing portfolio of loans 
the allowance  in the judgment of management  is necessary to reserve for estimated loan losses and risks inherent in the loan portfolio 
the level of the allowance reflects management s continuing evaluation of industry concentrations  specific credit risks  loan loss experience  current loan portfolio quality  present economic  political and regulatory conditions  and unidentified losses inherent in the current loan portfolio 
the determination of the appropriate level of the allowance for probable loan losses inherently involves a high degree of subjectivity and requires us to make significant estimates and assumptions regarding current credit risks and future trends  all of which may undergo material changes 
changes in economic conditions affecting borrowers  new information regarding existing loans  identification of additional problem loans and other factors  both within and outside our control  may require an increase in the allowance for probable loan losses 
in addition  bank regulatory agencies periodically review our allowance for loan losses and may require an increase in the provision for probable loan losses or the recognition of further loan charge offs  based on judgments different than those of management 
in addition  if charge offs in future periods exceed the allowance for probable loan losses  we will need additional provisions to increase the allowance for probable loan losses 
any increases in the allowance for probable loan losses will result in a decrease in net income and  possibly  capital  and may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
see the section captioned loan loss experience and allowance for loan losses in item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations for further discussion related to our process for determining the appropriate level of the allowance for probable loan losses 
we are subject to environmental liability risk associated with lending activities 
a significant portion of our loan portfolio is secured by real property 
during the ordinary course of business  we may foreclose on and take title to properties securing certain loans 
there is a risk that hazardous or toxic substances could be found on these properties 
if hazardous or toxic substances are found  we may be liable for remediation costs  as well as for personal injury and property damage 
environmental laws may require us to incur substantial expenses and may materially reduce the affected property s value or limit our ability to use or sell the affected property 
in addition  future laws or more stringent interpretations or enforcement policies with respect to existing laws may increase our exposure to environmental liability 
although we have policies and procedures to perform an environmental review before initiating any foreclosure action on nonresidential real property  these reviews may not be sufficient to detect all potential environmental hazards 
the remediation costs and any other financial liabilities associated with an environmental hazard could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
our profitability depends significantly on economic conditions in the state of texas 
our success depends primarily on the general economic conditions of the state of texas and the specific local markets in which we operate 
unlike larger national or other regional banks that are more geographically diversified  we provide banking and financial services to customers primarily in the texas areas of tyler  longview  lindale  whitehouse  chandler  gresham  athens  palestine  jacksonville  hawkins  bullard  forney  seven points  gun barrel city  fort worth  austin and arlington 
the local economic conditions in these areas have a significant impact on the demand for our products and services  as well as the ability of our customers to repay loans  the value of the collateral securing loans and the stability of our deposit funding sources 
a significant decline in general economic conditions  caused by inflation  recession  acts of terrorism  outbreak of hostilities or other international or domestic occurrences  unemployment  changes in securities markets or other factors could impact these local economic conditions and  in turn  have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
we operate in a highly competitive industry and market area 
we face substantial competition in all areas of our operations from a variety of different competitors  many of which are larger and may have more financial resources 
such competitors primarily include national  regional  and community banks within the various markets we operate 
additionally  various out of state banks have entered or have announced plans to enter the market areas in which we currently operate 
we also face competition from many other types of financial institutions  including  without limitation  savings and loans  credit unions  finance companies  brokerage firms  insurance companies  factoring companies and other financial intermediaries 
the financial services industry could become even more competitive as a result of legislative  regulatory and technological changes  continued consolidation and recent trends in the credit and mortgage lending markets 
banks  securities firms and insurance companies can merge under the umbrella of a financial holding company  which can offer virtually any type of financial service  including banking  securities underwriting  insurance both agency and underwriting and merchant banking 
also  technology has lowered barriers to entry and made it possible for nonbanks to offer products and services traditionally provided by banks  such as automatic transfer and automatic payment systems 
many of our competitors have fewer regulatory constraints and may have lower cost structures 
additionally  due to their size  many competitors may be able to achieve economies of scale and  as a result  may offer a broader range of products and services as well as better pricing for those products and services than we can 
our ability to compete successfully depends on a number of factors  including  among other things the ability to develop  maintain and build upon long term customer relationships based on top quality service  high ethical standards and safe  sound assets  the ability to expand our market position  the scope  relevance and pricing of products and services offered to meet customer needs and demands  the rate at which we introduce new products and services relative to our competitors  customer satisfaction with our level of service  and industry and general economic trends 
failure to perform in any of these areas could significantly weaken our competitive position  which could adversely affect our growth and profitability  which  in turn  could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
we are subject to extensive government regulation and supervision 
southside bancshares  inc  primarily through southside bank  and certain nonbank subsidiaries  is subject to extensive federal and state regulation and supervision 
banking regulations are primarily intended to protect depositors funds  federal deposit insurance funds and the banking system as a whole  not shareholders 
these regulations affect our lending practices  capital structure  investment practices and dividend policy and growth  among other things 
congress and federal and state regulatory agencies continually review banking laws  regulations and policies for possible changes 
changes to statutes  regulations or regulatory policies  including changes in interpretation or implementation of statutes  regulations or policies  could affect us in substantial and unpredictable ways 
such changes could subject us to additional costs  limit the types of financial services and products we may offer and or increase the ability of nonbanks to offer competing financial services and products  among other things 
failure to comply with laws  regulations or policies could result in sanctions by regulatory agencies  civil money penalties and or reputation damage  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
while our policies and procedures are designed to prevent any such violations  there can be no assurance that such violations will not occur 
see the section captioned supervision and regulation in item business and note shareholders equity to our consolidated financial statements included in this report 
our controls and procedures may fail or be circumvented 
management regularly reviews and updates our internal controls  disclosure controls and procedures  and corporate governance policies and procedures 
any system of controls  however well designed and operated  is based in part on certain assumptions and can provide only reasonable  not absolute  assurances that the objectives of the system are met 
any failure or circumvention of our controls and procedures or failure to comply with regulations related to controls and procedures could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
new lines of business or new products and services may subject us to additional risks 
from time to time  we may implement new delivery systems  such as internet banking  or offer new products and services within existing lines of business 
in august  through a subsidiary of southside bank  we entered into a joint venture engaged in the purchase of portfolios of automobile loans nationwide 
although we have retained a management team with expertise in this industry  we cannot provide any assurance as to our ability to profitably operate this line of business 
there are substantial risks and uncertainties associated with these efforts  particularly in instances where the markets are not fully developed 
in developing and marketing new delivery systems and or new products and services  we may invest significant time and resources 
initial timetables for the introduction and development of new lines of business and or new products or services may not be achieved and price and profitability targets may not prove feasible 
external factors  such as compliance with regulations  competitive alternatives  and shifting market preferences  may also impact the successful implementation of a new line of business or a new product or service 
furthermore  any new line of business and or new product or service could have a significant impact on the effectiveness of our system of internal controls 
failure to successfully manage these risks in the development and implementation of new lines of business or new products or services could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
we rely on dividends from our subsidiaries for most of our revenue 
southside bancshares  inc is a separate and distinct legal entity from our subsidiaries 
we receive substantially all of our revenue from dividends from our subsidiaries 
these dividends are the principal source of funds to pay dividends on our common stock and interest and principal on our debt 
various federal and or state laws and regulations limit the amount of dividends that southside bank  and certain nonbank subsidiaries may pay to southside bancshares  inc also  southside bancshares  inc 
s right to participate in a distribution of assets upon a subsidiary s liquidation or reorganization is subject to the prior claims of the subsidiary s creditors 
in the event southside bank is unable to pay dividends to southside bancshares  inc  southside bancshares  inc 
may not be able to service debt  pay obligations or pay dividends on common stock 
the inability to receive dividends from southside bank could have a material adverse effect on southside bancshares  inc s business  financial condition and results of operations 
see the section captioned supervision and regulation in item business and note shareholders equity to our consolidated financial statements included in this report 
we may not be able to access capital on favorable terms  including cost of funds 
the availability and cost of funds may increase as a result of general economic condition  increased interest rates and competitive pressures and we may be unable to obtain funds on terms that are favorable to us 
we chose not to participate in the cpp  and in the future if we need to obtain additional funds  we may not be able to obtain them on terms as favorable to us as the cpp would have been 
if we are unable to obtain funds  we could be restricted in our ability to extend credit  and may not be able to obtain sufficient funds to support growth through branching or acquisition initiatives 
the holders of our junior subordinated debentures have rights that are senior to those of our shareholders 
on september   we issued million of floating rate junior subordinated debentures in connection with a million trust preferred securities issuance by our subsidiary  southside statutory trust iii 
these junior subordinated debentures mature in september on august and   we issued million and million  respectively  of five year fixed rate converting to floating rate thereafter  junior subordinated debentures in connection with million and million  respectively  trust preferred securities issuances by our subsidiaries southside statutory trust iv and v  respectively 
trust iv matures october and trust v matures september as part of the acquisition of fwbs on october   we assumed a million of floating rate junior subordinated debentures issued to magnolia trust company i in connection with million of trust preferred securities issued in that matures in we conditionally guarantee payments of the principal and interest on the trust preferred securities 
our junior subordinated debentures are senior to our shares of common stock 
as a result  we must make payments on the junior subordinated debentures and the related trust preferred securities before any dividends can be paid on our common stock and  in the event of bankruptcy  dissolution or liquidation  the holders of the debentures must be satisfied before any distributions can be made to the holders of common stock 
we have the right to defer distributions on our junior subordinated debentures and the related trust preferred securities for up to five years  during which time no dividends may be paid to holders of common stock 
acquisitions and potential acquisitions may disrupt our business and dilute shareholder value 
during  we completed the acquisition of fwbs 
this was our first acquisition 
aside from this acquisition  we occasionally investigate potential merger or acquisition partners that appear to be culturally similar  have experienced management and possess either significant or attractive market presence or have potential for improved profitability through financial management  economies of scale or expanded services 
acquiring other banks  businesses or branches involves various risks commonly associated with acquisitions  including  among other things potential exposure to unknown or contingent liabilities of the target company  exposure to potential asset quality issues of the target company  difficulty and expense of integrating the operations and personnel of the target company  potential disruption to our business  potential diversion of our management s time and attention  the possible loss of key employees and customers of the target company  difficulty in estimating the value of the target company  and potential changes in banking or tax laws or regulations that may affect the target company 
we occasionally evaluate merger and acquisition opportunities and conduct due diligence activities related to possible transactions with other financial institutions and financial services companies 
as a result  merger or acquisition discussions and  in some cases  negotiations may take place and future mergers or acquisitions involving cash  debt or equity securities may occur at any time 
acquisitions typically involve the payment of a premium over book and market values  and  therefore  some dilution of our tangible book value and net income per common share may occur in connection with any future transaction 
furthermore  failure to realize the expected revenue increases  cost savings  increases in geographic or product presence  and or other projected benefits and synergies from an acquisition could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
failure to integrate fwbs s operations  personnel  policies and procedures into southside s could have a material and adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
we may not be able to attract and retain skilled people 
our success depends  in large part  on our ability to attract and retain key people 
competition for the best people in most activities we engage in can be intense  and we may not be able to hire people or to retain them 
the unexpected loss of services of one or more of our key personnel could have a material adverse impact on our business because of their skills  knowledge of our market  relationships in the communities we serve  years of industry experience and the difficulty of promptly finding qualified replacement personnel 
although we have employment agreements with certain of our executive officers  there is no guarantee that these officers will remain employed with the company 
our information systems may experience an interruption or breach in security 
we rely heavily on communications and information systems to conduct our business 
any failure  interruption or breach in security of these systems could result in failures or disruptions in our customer relationship management  general ledger  deposit  loan and other systems 
while we have policies and procedures designed to prevent or limit the effect of the failure  interruption or security breach of our information systems  there can be no assurance that we can prevent any such failures  interruptions or security breaches or  if they do occur  that they will be adequately addressed 
the occurrence of any failures  interruptions or security breaches of our information systems could damage our reputation  result in a loss of customer business  subject us to additional regulatory scrutiny  or expose us to civil litigation and possible financial liability  any of which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
we continually encounter technological change 
the financial services industry is continually undergoing rapid technological change with frequent introductions of new technology driven products and services 
the effective use of technology increases efficiency and enables financial institutions to better serve customers and to reduce costs 
our future success depends  in part  upon our ability to address the needs of our customers by using technology to provide products and services that will satisfy customer demands  as well as to create additional efficiencies in our operations 
many of our competitors have substantially greater resources to invest in technological improvements 
we may not be able to effectively implement new technology driven products and services or be successful in marketing these products and services to our customers and even if we implement such products and services  we may incur substantial costs in doing so 
failure to successfully keep pace with technological change affecting the financial services industry could have a material adverse impact on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we are subject to claims and litigation pertaining to fiduciary responsibility 
from time to time  customers make claims and take legal action pertaining to our performance of our fiduciary responsibilities 
whether customer claims and legal action related to our performance of our fiduciary responsibilities are founded or unfounded  defending claims is costly and diverts management s attention  and if such claims and legal actions are not resolved in a manner favorable to us  they may result in significant financial liability and or adversely affect our market perception and products and services as well as impact customer demand for those products and services 
any financial liability or reputation damage could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
severe weather  natural disasters  acts of war or terrorism and other external events could significantly impact our business 
severe weather  natural disasters  acts of war or terrorism and other adverse external events could have a significant impact on our ability to conduct business 
such events could affect the stability of our deposit base  impair the ability of borrowers to repay outstanding loans  impair the value of collateral securing loans  cause significant property damage  result in loss of revenue and or cause us to incur additional expenses 
for example  because of our location and the location of the market areas we serve  severe weather is more likely than in other areas of the country 
although management has established disaster recovery policies and procedures  there can be no assurance of the effectiveness of such policies and procedures  and the occurrence of any such event could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
current market developments may adversely affect our industry  business and results of operations 
dramatic declines in the housing market during the prior year  with falling home prices and increasing foreclosures and unemployment  have resulted in significant write downs of asset values by financial institutions  including government sponsored entities and major commercial and investment banks 
these write downs  initially of mortgage backed securities but spreading to credit default swaps and other derivative securities have caused many financial institutions to seek additional capital  to merge with larger and stronger institutions and  in some cases  to fail 
reflecting concern about the stability of the financial markets generally and the strength of counterparties  many lenders and institutional investors have reduced  and in some cases  ceased to provide funding to borrowers including other financial institutions 
the resulting lack of available credit  lack of confidence in the financial sector  increased volatility in the financial markets and reduced business activity could materially and adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
funding to provide liquidity may not be available to us on favorable terms or at all 
liquidity is the ability to meet cash flow needs on a timely basis at a reasonable cost 
the liquidity of the bank is used to make loans and leases to repay deposit liabilities as they become due or are demanded by customers 
liquidity policies and limits are established by the board of directors 
management and our investment committee regularly monitor the overall liquidity position of the bank and the company to ensure that various alternative strategies exist to cover unanticipated events that could affect liquidity 
management and our investment committee also establish policies and monitor guidelines to diversify the bank s funding sources to avoid concentrations in any one market source 
funding sources include federal funds purchased  securities sold under repurchase agreements  non core deposits  and short and long term debt 
the bank is also a member of the federal home loan bank system  which provides funding through advances to members that are collateralized with mortgage related assets 
we maintain a portfolio of securities that can be used as a secondary source of liquidity 
there are other sources of liquidity available to us should they be needed 
these sources include sales or securitizations of loans  our ability to acquire additional national market  non core deposits  additional collateralized borrowings such as federal home loan bank advances  the issuance and sale of debt securities  and the issuance and sale of preferred or common securities in public or private transactions 
the bank also can borrow from the federal reserve s discount window 
we have historically had access to a number of alternative sources of liquidity  but given the recent and dramatic downturn in the credit and liquidity markets  there is no assurance that we will be able to obtain such liquidity on terms that are favorable to us  or at all 
for example  the cost of out of market deposits may exceed the cost of deposits of similar maturity in our local market area  making them unattractive sources of funding  financial institutions may be unwilling to extend credit to banks because of concerns about the banking industry and the economy generally  there may not be a market for the issuance of additional trust preferred securities  and  given recent downturns in the economy  there may not be a viable market for raising equity capital 
if we were unable to access any of these funding sources when needed  we might be unable to meet customers needs  which could adversely impact our financial condition  results of operations  cash flows and liquidity  and level of regulatory qualifying capital 
current levels of market volatility are unprecedented  which may have an adverse effect on our ability to access capital 
the capital and credit markets have been experiencing volatility and disruption for more than months 
in recent weeks  the volatility and disruption has reached unprecedented levels 
in some cases  the markets have produced downward pressure on stock prices and credit availability for certain issuers without regard to those issuers underlying financial strength 
if current levels of market disruption and volatility continue or worsen  there can be no assurance that the company will not experience an adverse effect  which may be material  on the company s ability to access capital and on its business  financial condition and results of operations 
risks associated with our common stock our stock price can be volatile 
stock price volatility may make it more difficult for you to resell your common stock when you want and at prices you find attractive 
our stock price can fluctuate significantly in response to a variety of factors including  among other things actual or anticipated variations in quarterly results of operations  recommendations by securities analysts  operating and stock price performance of other companies that investors deem comparable to us  news reports relating to trends  concerns and other issues in the financial services industry  perceptions in the marketplace regarding us and or our competitors  new technology used  or services offered  by competitors  significant acquisitions or business combinations  strategic partnerships  joint ventures or capital commitments by or involving us or our competitors  failure to integrate acquisitions or realize anticipated benefits from acquisitions  changes in government regulations  and geopolitical conditions such as acts or threats of terrorism or military conflicts 
general market fluctuations  industry factors and general economic and political conditions and events  such as economic slowdowns or recessions  interest rate changes or credit loss trends  could also cause our stock price to decrease regardless of operating results 
the trading volume in our common stock is less than that of other larger financial services companies 
although our common stock is listed for trading on the nasdaq global select market  the trading volume is low  and you are not assured liquidity with respect to transactions in our common stock 
a public trading market having the desired characteristics of depth  liquidity and orderliness depends on the presence in the marketplace of willing buyers and sellers of our common stock at any given time 
this presence depends on the individual decisions of investors and general economic and market conditions over which we have no control 
given the lower trading volume of our common stock  significant sales of our common stock  or the expectation of these sales  could cause our stock price to fall 
an investment in our common stock is not an insured deposit 
our common stock is not a bank deposit and  therefore  is not insured against loss by the fdic  any other deposit insurance fund or by any other public or private entity 
investment in our common stock is inherently risky for the reasons described in this risk factors section and elsewhere in this report and is subject to the same market forces that affect the price of common stock in any company 
as a result  if you acquire our common stock  you may lose some or all of your investment 
provisions of our articles of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws  as well as state and federal banking regulations  could delay or prevent a takeover of us by a third party 
our articles of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws could delay  defer or prevent a third party from acquiring us  despite the possible benefit to our shareholders  or otherwise adversely affect the price of our common stock 
these provisions include  among others  requiring advance notice for raising business matters or nominating directors at shareholders meetings and staggered board elections 
any individual  acting alone or with other individuals  who are seeking to acquire  directly or indirectly  or more of our outstanding common stock must comply with the change in bank control act  which requires prior notice to the federal reserve for any acquisition 
additionally  any entity that wants to acquire or more of our outstanding common stock  or otherwise control us  may need to obtain the prior approval of the federal reserve under the bhca of  as amended 
as a result  prospective investors in our common stock need to be aware of and comply with those requirements  to the extent applicable 
we may issue additional securities  which could dilute your ownership percentage 
in certain situations  our board of directors has the authority  without any vote of our shareholders  to issue shares of our authorized but unissued stock 
in the future  we may issue additional securities  through public or private offerings  to raise additional capital or finance acquisitions 
any such issuance would dilute the ownership of current holders of our common stock 
risks associated with the banking industry the earnings of financial services companies are significantly affected by general business and economic conditions 
our operations and profitability are impacted by general business and economic conditions in the united states and abroad 
these conditions include short term and long term interest rates  inflation  money supply  political issues  legislative and regulatory changes  fluctuations in both debt and equity capital markets  broad trends in industry and finance  and the strength of the us economy and the local economies in which we operate  all of which are beyond our control 
a deterioration in economic conditions could result in an increase in loan delinquencies and nonperforming assets  decreases in loan collateral values and a decrease in demand for our products and services  among other things  any of which could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations 
financial services companies depend on the accuracy and completeness of information about customers and counterparties 
in deciding whether to extend credit or enter into other transactions  we may rely on information furnished by or on behalf of customers and counterparties  including financial statements  credit reports and other financial information 
we may also rely on representations of those customers  counterparties or other third parties  such as independent auditors  as to the accuracy and completeness of that information 
reliance on inaccurate or misleading financial statements  credit reports or other financial information could have a material adverse impact on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
consumers may decide not to use banks to complete their financial transactions 
technology and other changes are allowing parties to complete financial transactions that historically have involved banks through alternative methods 
for example  consumers can now maintain funds that would have historically been held as bank deposits in brokerage accounts or mutual funds 
consumers can also complete transactions such as paying bills and or transferring funds directly without the assistance of banks 
the process of eliminating banks as intermediaries could result in the loss of fee income  as well as the loss of customer deposits and the related income generated from those deposits 
the loss of these revenue streams and the lower cost deposits as a source of funds could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
the soundness of other financial institutions could adversely affect us 
financial services institutions are interrelated as a result of trading  clearing  counterparty or other relationships 
we have exposure to many different industries and counterparties  and we routinely execute transactions with counterparties in the financial services industry  including brokers and dealers  commercial banks  investment banks  mutual and hedge funds  and other institutional clients 
many of these transactions expose us to credit risk in the event of default of our counterparty or client 
in addition  our credit risk may be exacerbated when the collateral held by us cannot be realized or is liquidated at prices not sufficient to recover the full amount of the loan or derivative exposure due us 
there is no assurance that any such losses would not materially and adversely affect our results of operations or earnings
