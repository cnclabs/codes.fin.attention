item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
forward looking statements the following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations contains forward looking statements within the meaning of section a of the securities act of and section e of the securities exchange act of forward looking statements are based on our management s beliefs and assumptions and on information currently available to our management 
all statements other than statements of historical facts are forward looking statements for purposes of these provisions  including those relating to future events or our future financial performance 
in some cases  you can identify forward looking statements by terminology such as may  might  will  should  expect  plan  anticipate  project  believe  estimate  predict  potential  intend or continue  the negative of terms like these or other comparable terminology  and other words or terms of similar meaning in connection with any discussion of future operating or financial performance 
these statements are only predictions 
all forward looking statements included in this document are based on information available to us on the date hereof  and we assume no obligation to update any such forward looking statements 
any or all of our forward looking statements in this document may turn out to be wrong 
actual events or results may differ materially 
our forward looking statements can be affected by inaccurate assumptions we might make or by known or unknown risks  uncertainties and other factors 
we discuss many of these risks  uncertainties and other factors in this annual report on form k in greater detail under the heading item a risk factors 
we caution investors that our business and financial performance are subject to substantial risks and uncertainties 
overview we are a clinical stage biotechnology company focused on the development and commercialization of monoclonal antibody based therapies for the treatment of cancer and autoimmune disease 
we initiated a pivotal trial of our lead product candidate  sgn  during the first quarter of for patients with relapsed or refractory hodgkin lymphoma under a spa with the fda 
sgn is empowered by our proprietary adc technology comprising highly potent synthetic drugs and stable linkers for attaching the drugs to monoclonal antibodies 
in addition  we have three other product candidates in ongoing clinical trials dacetuzumab  lintuzumab and sgn dacetuzumab is being developed under a worldwide collaboration with genentech 
we have collaborations for our adc technology with a number of leading biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies  including genentech  bayer  curagen  progenics  daiichi sankyo and medimmune  a subsidiary of astrazeneca  as well as an adc co development agreement with agensys  a subsidiary of astellas pharma 
we do not currently have any commercial products for sale 
while certain of our product candidates are advancing into later stages of development  such as sgn  significant further research and development  financial resources and personnel will be required to develop commercially viable products and obtain regulatory approvals 
as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of million 
over the next several years  we expect that we will incur substantial expenses  primarily the result of activities related to the potential regulatory approval and commercialization of sgn  including preparation for commercial manufacturing 
we will also continue to invest in research  development and manufacturing and move towards potential commercialization of our other product candidates 
our commitment of resources to the approval and commercialization activities for sgn and the research and continued development and potential commercialization of our other product candidates will require substantial additional funds and resources and our operating expenses will also likely increase as a result of such activities 
in addition  we may incur significant milestone payment obligations as our product candidates progress through clinical trials towards potential commercialization 
we expect that a substantial portion of our revenues for the next several years will be the result of amortization of payments already received and expected to be received from genentech under our dacetuzumab collaboration agreement 
until such time as we have commercialized a product candidate  our revenues will also depend on the achievement of development and clinical milestones under our existing 
table of contents collaboration and license agreements  particularly our dacetuzumab collaboration with genentech  as well as entering into new collaboration and license agreements 
our results of operations may vary substantially from year to year and from quarter to quarter and  as a result  we believe that period to period comparisons of our operating results may not be meaningful and you should not rely on them as indicative of our future performance 
critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles requires us to make estimates  assumptions and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements 
revenue recognition 
many of our agreements contain multiple revenue elements including upfront payments  license fees  milestone payments  royalties  maintenance fees and payments received for the delivery of supplies or services provided 
each agreement may contain some or all of these elements 
the assessment of multiple element arrangements requires judgment in order to determine the appropriate point in time  or period of time  that revenue should be recognized 
revenue recognition is predicated upon persuasive evidence of an agreement existing  delivery of materials occurring or services being rendered  fees being fixed or determinable and collectibility being reasonably assured 
when contracts require us to perform activities that represent substantive continuing obligations and fair value cannot be determined  revenue is recognized over the service period using either a time based or an activity based proportional performance model as appropriate in the circumstance 
where activities represent the culmination of a separate earnings process and verifiable evidence of the fair value of each element can be established  revenue is recognized as the activities are completed 
when verifiable evidence of fair value cannot be established for each undelivered element  revenue is deferred until all elements have been delivered or until verifiable evidence of the fair value for any undelivered element can be determined 
nonrefundable upfront license payments  option and maintenance fees and milestone payments our collaborative agreements may include nonrefundable upfront license payments  option and maintenance fees  and payments triggered by the achievement of development milestones by the other party or by us 
when we have substantive continuing performance obligations under an arrangement  revenue is recognized over the performance period of the obligations using either a time based or proportional performance based approach 
when we cannot estimate the total amount of performance obligations that are to be provided under the arrangement  a time based method is used 
under the time based method  revenue is recognized over the arrangement s estimated performance period based on the elapsed time compared to the total estimated performance period 
when we are able to estimate the total amount of performance obligations under the arrangement  revenue is recognized using a proportional performance model 
under this approach  revenue recognition is based on costs incurred to date compared to total expected costs to be incurred over the performance period as this is considered to be representative of the delivery of service under the arrangement 
changes in estimates of total expected performance costs or service obligation time period are accounted for prospectively as a change in estimate 
under both methods  revenue recognized at any point in time is limited to the amount of non contingent payments received or due 
when we have no substantive continuing performance obligations under an arrangement  we recognize milestone payments as revenue upon achievement of the milestone event 
otherwise  milestone payments are recognized using the applicable time based or performance based approach for that agreement 
research and development services we may also perform research and development activities on behalf of collaborative partners that are paid for by the collaborator 
when no other obligation to provide services is required by us  revenue from research 
table of contents and development services is generally recognized as the service is provided 
however  if the arrangement provides for other ongoing services by us or contains multiple delivery elements for which verifiable and objective evidence of fair value cannot be established for each element  payments for such services are recognized as revenue over the service period 
royalties revenues from royalties on third party sales of licensed technologies are generally recognized in accordance with the contract terms when the royalties can be reliably determined and collectibility is reasonably assured 
to date  we have not received significant royalty revenues 
we generally invoice our collaborators on a monthly or quarterly basis  or upon the completion of the effort  based on the terms of each agreement 
amounts due  but not billed to a collaborator  if any  are included in accounts receivable in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets 
deferred revenue arises from payments received in advance of the culmination of the earnings process and is recognized as revenue in future periods when the applicable revenue recognition criteria have been met 
deferred revenue expected to be recognized within the next twelve months is classified as a current liability 
investments 
our investments are diversified among high credit quality debt securities in accordance with our investment policy 
we classify our investments as available for sale  which are reported at fair market value with the related unrealized gains and losses included in accumulated other comprehensive income or loss in stockholders equity 
realized gains and losses and declines in value of investments judged to be other than temporary are included in investment income 
to date  we have not deemed it necessary to record any charges related to other than temporary declines in the estimated fair values of our marketable debt securities 
the fair value of our investments is subject to volatility 
declines in the fair value of our investments judged to be other than temporary could adversely affect our future operating results 
as described below under liquidity and capital resources we use a probability weighted cash flow analysis to value our investment in auction rate securities  or ars 
accrued expenses 
as part of the process of preparing financial statements  we are required to estimate accrued expenses 
this process involves identifying services that have been performed on our behalf and estimating the level of services performed and the associated costs incurred for such services where we have not yet been invoiced or otherwise notified of actual cost 
we record these estimates in our consolidated financial statements as of each balance sheet date 
examples of estimated accrued expenses include fees due to contract research organizations and other costs in conjunction with clinical trials  fees due in conjunction with manufacturing clinical grade materials and professional service fees 
in accruing service fees  we estimate the time period over which services will be provided and the level of effort in each period 
if the actual timing of the provision of services or the level of effort varies from the estimate  we will adjust the accrual accordingly 
in the event that we do not identify costs that have been incurred or we under or overestimate the level of services performed or the costs of such services  our actual expenses could differ from such estimates 
the date on which some services commence  the level of services performed on or before a given date and the cost of such services are often subjective determinations 
we make judgments based upon the facts and circumstances known to us at the time and in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 
research and development 
research and development expenses consist of salaries  benefits and other headcount related costs of our research and development staff  preclinical activities  clinical trials  lab supplies  manufacturing costs for product candidates used in research and clinical trials  contract and outside service fees and facilities and overhead expenses 
research and development activities are expensed as incurred 
in licensing fees  including milestones and maintenance fees  and other costs to acquire technologies that are utilized in research and development and that are not expected to have alternative future use are expensed when incurred 

table of contents we account for our clinical trial costs by estimating the total cost to treat a patient in each clinical trial and recognize this cost  based on a variety of factors  beginning with the preparation for the clinical trial  continuing through patient accrual into the clinical trial and completion of the clinical trial 
this estimated cost includes payments for clinical trial site and patient related costs  including laboratory costs related to the conduct of the trial  and other costs 
costs associated with activities performed under research and development co development collaborations  net of reimbursement paid to and received from  are reflected in research and development expense 
non refundable advance payments for goods or services that will be used or rendered for future research and development activities are capitalized and recognized as expense as the related goods are delivered or the related services are performed 
share based compensation 
we expense the fair value of share based payment transactions in our consolidated financial statements in accordance with sfas r  which we adopted in using the modified prospective application method 
we use the black scholes option pricing model to estimate the fair value of options on the date of grant which requires certain estimates to be made by management  including the expected forfeiture rate and expected term of the options 
management also makes decisions regarding the method of calculating the expected stock price volatility and the risk free interest rate used in the model 
fluctuations in the market that affect these estimates could have an impact on the resulting compensation cost 
for additional information see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form k 
income taxes 
we have net deferred tax assets which are fully offset by a valuation allowance due to our determination that it is more likely than not that the deferred assets will not be realized 
we believe that a full valuation allowance is appropriate as we expect to incur operating losses for at least the next several years as we continue to pursue the development of our product candidates 
in the event we were to determine that we would be able to realize our net deferred tax assets in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would be made  a portion of which would increase income or decrease losses in the period in which such a determination was made 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to revenue recognition  investments  accrued expenses  research and development  share based compensation and income taxes 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form our basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from those estimates under different assumptions and conditions 

table of contents results of operations years ended december   and revenues total revenues in increased by to million from  and increased by in to million from our revenues reflect amounts earned under our dacetuzumab collaboration agreement with genentech entered into in january  and the earned portion of technology access fees and milestone payments received under our adc collaborations  including funded research and material supply fees 
revenues are summarized by collaborator as follows collaboration and license agreement revenue by collaborator in thousands annual percentage change genentech medimmune bayer curagen progenics daiichi sankyo na na other collaborations total revenues earned under our dacetuzumab and our adc collaborations with genentech represented of our total revenues in  of our total revenues in and of our total revenues in our adc collaborations with medimmune  bayer  curagen  daiichi sankyo and progenics comprised substantially all of the rest of our revenues 
our revenues are impacted by progress dependent milestones  annual maintenance fees and reimbursement and support fees as our collaborators advance their adc product candidates through the development process and  in the case of our dacetuzumab collaboration with genentech  the level of development activities that we perform 
we anticipate that revenues in will increase compared to primarily as a result of amounts expected to be earned under our dacetuzumab collaboration with genentech 
however  revenue may vary substantially from year to year and quarter to quarter depending on the progress made by our collaborators with their adc product candidates  the level of support we provide to our collaborators  the timing of milestones achieved and our ability to enter into additional collaboration agreements 
in addition  we have a significant balance in deferred revenue representing prior payments from collaborators 
this deferred revenue will be recognized as revenue in the future using a time based approach 
genentech we entered into an exclusive worldwide collaboration agreement with genentech in january for the development and commercialization of dacetuzumab 
under the terms of the agreement  we received an upfront payment of million and are entitled to receive progress dependent milestone payments and royalties on net sales of any resulting products 
in addition  dacetuzumab research and development activities that we perform are reimbursed by genentech 
we received milestone payments of million in and million in triggered by the initiation of dacetuzumab clinical trials 
all amounts billed under the dacetuzumab collaboration agreement are deferred and recognized as revenue over the six year development period ending february using a time based method 
we entered into an adc collaboration with genentech in april in march  genentech extended the term of the collaboration to april in accordance with the terms of the agreement 
in  we received million in milestones related to two ind enabling toxicology approvals and an ind filing 
in  genentech exercised an exclusive license to specific targets and extended the research term under the adc 
table of contents collaboration agreement by paying a fee of million 
in addition  we receive a renewal fee and other fees as well as reimbursement payments for research and development services and materials provided to genentech under the collaboration 
these payments are deferred and recognized as revenue over the research term of the collaboration using a time based approach 
we are entitled to receive additional progress dependent milestones  annual maintenance fees and support fees as genentech s adc product candidates progress through development and royalties on product sales of such product candidates 
revenues under our agreements with genentech increased by million  or  in from  and increased by million  or  in from the increase in both periods was primarily due to amounts earned under our dacetuzumab collaboration agreement 
a substantial portion of our deferred revenue balance  which totaled million as of december   relates to our dacetuzumab collaboration with genentech and will be recognized into revenue through february commensurate with our remaining service period commitment pursuant to the collaboration 
medimmune we entered into an adc collaboration agreement with medimmune  a wholly owned subsidiary of astrazeneca  in april which included an upfront technology access fee of million 
this fee was recognized as revenue over the two year research period of the collaboration 
in october  medimmune exercised its option to obtain an exclusive license to a second antigen target under the existing adc collaboration 
we received a million payment from medimmune as a result of the option exercise which was recognized as revenue over a twelve month period commensurate with our remaining service period commitment under the agreement 
revenues under our adc collaboration agreement with medimmune increased by  or in from to  revenues increased  primarily due to increased material supply fees 
we are entitled to receive additional progress dependent milestones  annual maintenance fees and support fees as medimmune s adc product candidate progresses through development and royalties on product sales 
bayer we entered into an adc collaboration agreement with bayer in september which included an upfront technology access fee of million 
this fee was recognized as revenue over the initial three year research period of the collaboration which ended in in may  we amended the collaboration agreement and bayer paid an additional fee to extend the term of the collaboration for one additional year 
in december  bayer paid us a preclincial milestone payment 
these payments are being recognized as revenue over the extended research term 
revenues under our adc collaboration agreement with bayer increased by  or  in  primarily due to the earned portion of the collaboration extension payment 
revenues decreased by  or  in  reflecting completion of the recognition of the upfront technology access fee 
we are entitled to receive additional progress dependent milestones and annual maintenance fees as bayer s adc product candidate progresses through development and royalties on product sales 
curagen we entered into an adc collaboration agreement with curagen in june which included an upfront technology access fee of million 
this fee  along with additional access fees received  was recognized as revenue over the two year research period 
in may  we received a million milestone payment in connection with the initiation of a phase ii clinical trial by curagen 
this milestone payment was recognized as revenue when received as we had completed our performance obligations under the collaboration 
recognition of the milestone payment was the primary cause of increased revenues from curagen in revenues in decreased by million  or  due to completion  in  of recognition of the upfront technology access fee 
we are entitled to receive additional progress dependent milestones  annual maintenance fees and support fees as curagen s adc product candidates progress through development and royalties on product sales 

table of contents progenics we entered into an adc collaboration agreement with psma development company  which is now a wholly owned subsidiary of progenics  in june which included an upfront technology access fee of million 
this fee was recognized as revenue over the three year research period of the collaboration 
in october  we received a milestone payment in connection with the initiation of a phase i clinical trial by progenics 
this milestone payment was recognized as revenue when received as we had completed our performance obligations under the collaboration 
revenues under our adc collaboration agreement with progenics in decreased by  or  primarily due to lower revenue attributable to technology access fees  and decreased in by  or  reflecting lower funded research and material supply fees 
we are entitled to receive additional progress dependent milestones  annual maintenance fees and support fees as progenics adc product candidate progresses through development  and royalties on product sales 
daiichi sankyo in july  we entered into an adc collaboration agreement with daiichi sankyo co  ltd 
we received a million upfront fee for an exclusive license to our adc technology to a single antigen target 
the upfront fee and other payments received will be recorded as revenue over the three year development term of the collaboration agreement using a time based approach 
we recognized revenues of  in associated with the earned portion of the upfront fee as well as the earned portion of materials and services supplied by us to daiichi sankyo under the collaboration 
we are entitled to receive additional progress dependent milestones  annual maintenance fees and support fees as daiichi sankyo s adc product candidate progresses through development and royalties on product sales 
other collaborations other collaborations consist of collaborative agreements that have concluded  research agreements established to explore future business relationships and royalty payments from suppliers to which we have granted limited access to our technology under preferred provider agreements 
research and development research and development expenses increased to million in from  and increased to million in from our research and development expenses are summarized as follows research development in thousands annual percentage change research development and contract manufacturing clinical share based compensation expense total research expenses included  among other things  personnel  occupancy and laboratory expenses associated with the discovery and identification of new monoclonal antibodies and related technologies and the development of novel classes of stable linkers and potent cell killing drugs for our adc program 
research expenses also included research activities associated with our product candidates  such as preclinical translational biology and in vitro and in vivo studies 
research expenses increased moderately during from  and increased to million in from the increase in was related to building related service costs and contracted costs 
the increase in was primarily due to higher personnel expenses  severance costs  license fees  laboratory supply and building related service costs 

table of contents development and contract manufacturing expenses included personnel and occupancy expenses and external contract manufacturing costs for the scale up and manufacturing of drug product for use in our clinical trials  including ind enabling pharmacology and toxicology studies 
development and contract manufacturing expenses also included quality control and assurance activities  including storage and shipment services of our product candidates for clinical trials 
development and contract manufacturing costs increased to million in from  and to million in from these increases were primarily driven by increased manufacturing activities  including manufacturing campaigns for clinical supply of sgn and dacetuzumab at abbott laboratories during  and for clinical supply of lintuzumab at laureate pharma in in addition  and expenses increased reflecting higher compensation costs related to an increase in staffing levels and higher pharmacology and toxicology study costs 
clinical expenses included personnel expenses  travel  occupancy costs and external clinical trial costs including principal investigator fees  clinical site expenses  clinical research organization charges and regulatory activities associated with conducting human clinical trials 
clinical costs increased to million in from  and to million in from the increases in both periods related primarily to expanded third party clinical trial costs associated with our sgn  dacetuzumab and lintuzumab programs  and compensation costs relating to increased staffing levels 
share based compensation expense included in research and development expenses reflects the non cash charge associated with stock options and the employee stock purchase plan 
the fair value of all employee share based payments is charged to expense over the vesting period of the related share based payment 
share based compensation expense increased to million in from  and to million in from the increase for both periods was primarily due to the higher weighted average grant date fair value of stock options expensed in compared to and in compared to non cash share based compensation expense in also included a charge for accelerated vesting of stock options for employee severance 
we utilize our employee and infrastructure resources across multiple development projects as well as our discovery and research programs directed towards identifying monoclonal antibodies and new classes of stable linkers and cell killing drugs for our adc program 
we track human resource efforts expended on many of our programs for purposes of billing our collaborators for time incurred at agreed upon rates and for resource planning 
we do not track actual costs on a project by project basis as it relates to our infrastructure  facility  employee and other indirect costs 
we do  however  separately track significant third party costs including clinical trial costs manufacturing costs and other contracted service costs on a project by project basis 
the following table shows expenses incurred for preclinical study support  contract manufacturing for clinical supplies and clinical trial services provided by third parties as well as milestone payments for in licensed technology for each of our product candidates 
the table also presents unallocated costs  which consist of personnel  facilities and other indirect costs not directly allocated to development programs product candidates in thousands annual percentage change years january  to december  dacetuzumab sgn sgn lintuzumab sgn sgn sgn total third party costs unallocated costs and overhead share based compensation expense total research and development expenses 
table of contents our third party costs for dacetuzumab increased by in  and by in  reflecting manufacturing activities at abbott laboratories for additional drug product and clinical trials costs related to our phase i and phase ii trials  most notably the phase iib clinical trial evaluating dacetuzumab in combination with standard therapy in non hodgkin lymphoma patients 
under our dacetuzumab collaboration agreement  genentech reimburses us for activities that we perform under the agreement 
expenses that we incur under the dacetuzumab collaboration are included in our research and development expense  while reimbursements of those expenses by genentech are recognized as revenues over the development term of the agreement 
we expect that third party costs for dacetuzumab will decrease in reflecting a reduction in planned manufacturing activities 
third party costs for sgn increased by in  primarily related to manufacturing costs at abbott laboratories and our other contract manufacturing organizations to provide clinical supplies of drug product 
higher costs in and also reflected the expansion of phase i clinical trials of sgn during the year 
third party costs in increased by from and are primarily attributable to our phase i clinical trials and contract manufacturing activities 
we expect costs for the sgn program to increase in due to planned manufacturing activities and costs associated with later stage clinical trials  including the pivotal trial of sgn to treat patients with relapsed or refractory hodgkin lymphoma that was initiated in early  and a phase ii clinical trial in patients with relapsed or refractory alcl 
our third party costs for lintuzumab increased by in  and by in these increases are attributable to clinical trial activities including the ongoing phase iib trial evaluating the combination of lintuzumab with low dose cytarabine in patients with aml 
the increase in costs also reflects manufacturing activities at laureate pharma to perform gmp manufacturing of drug product to support clinical trials 
we expect third party costs for lintuzumab to decrease in  reflecting lower planned manufacturing activities and completion of patient enrollment in the phase iib trial 
our third party costs for sgn increased in reflecting increased pharmacology toxicology activities and manufacturing costs in connection with a planned  investigational new drug  or ind  submission in we expect third party costs for the sgn program to decrease in due to lowered pharmacology toxicology activities 
our third party costs for sgn increased in and included scale up and gmp manufacturing of drug product and increased pharmacology toxicology activities to support clinical trial initiation in third party costs for sgn decreased in and primarily reflecting the ongoing phase i trial  and are expected to decrease in due to lowered manufacturing and pharmacology toxicology activities 
unallocated costs and overhead included costs associated with personnel and facilities 
these costs increased in and in  primarily reflecting an increase in staffing levels in our development and clinical groups 
our expenditures on current and future preclinical and clinical development programs are subject to numerous uncertainties in timing and cost to completion 
in order to advance our product candidates toward commercialization  the product candidates are tested in numerous preclinical safety  toxicology and efficacy studies 
we then conduct clinical trials for those product candidates that take several years or more to complete 
the length of time varies substantially based upon the type  complexity  novelty and intended use of a product candidate 
the cost of clinical trials may vary significantly over the life of a project as a result of a variety of factors  including the number of patients who participate in the trials  the length of time required to enroll trial participants  the number and location of sites included in the trials  
table of contents the costs of producing supplies of the product candidates needed for clinical trials and regulatory submissions  the safety and efficacy profile of the product candidate  the use of clinical research organizations to assist with the management of the trials  and the costs and timing of  and the ability to secure  regulatory approvals 
furthermore  our strategy may include entering into collaborations with third parties to participate in the development and commercialization of some of our product candidates 
in these situations  the preclinical development or clinical trial process for a product candidate and the estimated completion date may largely be under the control of that third party and not under our control 
we cannot forecast with any degree of certainty which of our product candidates will be subject to future collaborations or how such arrangements would affect our development plans or capital requirements 
we anticipate that our total research  development  contract manufacturing and clinical expenses will increase in the foreseeable future as we prepare to seek regulatory approval and commercialization of sgn  as well as expand our preclinical activities and advance new product candidates into clinical trials 
in particular  we expect that clinical trial and manufacturing costs for sgn will increase in compared to we expect development costs for dacetuzumab  lintuzumab  sgn and sgn to decrease in compared to  reflecting lower manufacturing and pharmacolog toxicology activities for these programs in expenses will fluctuate based upon many factors including the degree of collaborative activities  timing of manufacturing campaigns  numbers of patients enrolled in our clinical trials and the outcome of each clinical trial event 
the risks and uncertainties associated with our research and development projects are discussed more fully in item a risk factors 
as a result of the uncertainties discussed above  we are unable to determine with any degree of certainty the duration and completion costs of our research and development projects  anticipated completion dates or when and to what extent we will receive cash inflows from the commercialization and sale of a product candidate

share based compensation expense included in general and administrative expenses reflect the non cash charge associated with stock options and our employee stock purchase plan 
the fair value of all employee share based payments is charged to expense over the vesting period of the related share based payment 
share based compensation expense included in general and administrative expenses increased to million in from  and to million in from the increases in both years primarily resulted from an increase in the value of the 
table of contents options expensed due to an increase in the weighted average grant date fair value of our common stock during the periods 
we anticipate that general and administrative expenses will continue to increase as a result of increased costs related to adding administrative personnel in support of our growing operations

investment income increased to million in reflecting an increase in both interest yields and higher average cash balances 
we expect investment income in to decrease from levels as we expect a further lowering of the yield earned on our investments 
liquidity and capital resources december  liquidity and capital resources cash  cash equivalents and short term and long term investment securities working capital stockholders equity years ended december  cash provided by used in operating activities investing activities financing activities we have financed the majority of our operations through the issuance of equity securities and by amounts received pursuant to our dacetuzumab collaboration agreement with genentech 
we have supplemented this funding by amounts received from our adc collaboration and license agreements 
to a lesser degree  we have also financed our operations through interest earned on cash  cash equivalents and investment securities 
these financing sources have historically allowed us to maintain adequate levels of cash and investments 
our combined cash  cash equivalents and investment securities increased to million at december   compared to million at december  and million at december  these increases reflect proceeds from the sale of common stock totaling million in  million in and million we used million in and million in to fund our operating activities 
in  we generated million in operating activities  which included million received from genentech under our dacetuzumab and adc collaborations 
our working capital was million at december   compared to million at december  and million at december  we have structured our investment portfolio to align scheduled maturities of investment securities with our working capital needs 
our cash  cash equivalents and investments are held in a variety of interest bearing instruments and subject to investment guidelines allowing for holdings in us government and agency securities  high grade corporate bonds  taxable municipal bonds  mortgage backed securities  auction rate securities  or ars  commercial paper and money market accounts 
as of december  we held ars valued at million that have failed at auction and are currently illiquid 
liquidity of these investments is subject to either a 
table of contents successful auction process  redemption of the investment  or a sale of the security in a secondary market 
as of the date of this filing  the failed ars carried ratings ranging from bbb to bbb by standard poor s and ranging from a to bbb by fitch 
each of the securities continues to pay interest according to the stated terms on a monthly basis 
the interest rates on these ars is no longer established based on an auction process but is set at the day london interbank offering rate plus or basis points according to the terms of the issue 
based on our available cash  expected operating cash requirements and our belief that our holdings in ars can be liquidated in approximately one to three years at par  we believe that we have the ability to hold  and intend to hold  these investments until liquidation 
this belief is based on our current assessment of our future operating plans and assessment of the individual securities and general market conditions 
we periodically reassess this conclusion based on several factors  including the continued failure of future auctions  failure of the investment to be redeemed  further deterioration of the credit rating of the investment  market risk and other factors 
any such future reassessment that results in a conclusion that the unrealized losses on these investments are other than temporary would result in a write down in the fair value of these investments 
such a write down would be recognized in our operating results 
the global credit and financial markets have recently experienced a period of unusual volatility and illiquidity 
unless and until this resolves  it may be difficult for us to liquidate investments prior to their maturity without incurring a loss 
as of december   our cash  cash equivalents and investment securities are presented net of a cumulative million unrealized loss 
this amount represents the difference between our amortized cost and the fair market value of the investments and is included in accumulated other comprehensive gain loss 
as of december   we had million held in cash reserves or investment grade debt securities scheduled to mature within the next twelve months 
in addition  in february  we generated net proceeds of million from a public offering of our common stock  and we may receive an additional million in gross proceeds from the sale of our common stock to baker brothers life sciences  lp  or bbls  and its affiliated investment funds as described in note to the notes to our consolidated financial statements 
our investment portfolio is structured to provide for investment maturities and access to cash that aligns with our anticipated working capital needs 
however  if our liquidity needs should be accelerated for any reason in the near term  or investments do not pay at maturity  we may be required to sell investment securities in our portfolio prior to their scheduled maturities  which may result in a loss 
included in net cash used in investing activities in are capital expenditures related to the purchase of laboratory equipment in support of our research and development activities and for leasehold improvements 
we expect that our capital expenditures will increase moderately compared to  reflecting additional leasehold improvements and equipment purchases planned in connection with further expansion of our facilities to accommodate our anticipated growth 
at our currently planned spending rate  we believe that our financial resources  in addition to the expected fees and milestone payments earned under the dacetuzumab collaboration agreement with genentech and other existing collaboration and license agreements will be sufficient to fund our operations into however  changes in our spending rate may occur that would consume available capital resources sooner  such as increased manufacturing and clinical trial expenses and the expansion of our sales and marketing organization preceding commercialization of a product candidate 
we may seek additional funding through some or all of the following methods corporate collaborations  licensing arrangements  public or private debt or equity financings 
however  the global credit markets and the financial services industry have recently been experiencing a period of unusual volatility and upheaval characterized by the bankruptcy  failure  collapse or sale of various financial institutions and an unprecedented level of intervention from the us government 
these events have generally made equity and debt financing more difficult to obtain 
as a result of these recent events and other factors  we do not know whether additional capital will be available when needed  or that  if available  we will obtain financing on terms favorable to us or our stockholders 
if we are unable to raise additional funds when we need them  we may be required to delay  reduce the scope of  or eliminate one or more of our development programs  which may adversely affect our business and operations 

table of contents in  we expect our revenues to range from million to million 
this reflects the earned portion of the deferred revenue and milestone payments and funded research payments expected to be received from genentech  as well as revenues earned under our existing adc collaborations 
in  we expect our operating expenses to range from million to million 
we expect that costs associated with sgn development will increase in reflecting expanded clinical trial and manufacturing activities and that development expenses for dacetuzumab and lintuzumab will decrease compared to as a result of the expected decrease in dacetuzumab related activities and the resulting decrease in reimbursements from genentech under the collaboration  we expect that net cash used to fund our operating activities in will increase compared to and will be in the range of million to million 
expenses will fluctuate based upon many factors including the degree of collaborative activities  timing of manufacturing campaigns  numbers of patients enrolled in our clinical trials and the outcome of each clinical trial 
we expect that non cash expenses in will range from million to million  the majority of which relates to share based compensation expense 
this estimate is based on a number of assumptions  including future stock prices and the number and timing of option grants  and may therefore change 
certain external factors may influence our cash spending including the cost of filing and enforcing patent claims and other intellectual property rights  competing technological and market developments and the progress of our collaborators 
we expect to end with more than million in total cash  cash equivalents and short term investments 
this estimate does not include the receipt of million in gross proceeds from the potential sale of our stock to bbls  which is subject to stockholder approval 
commitments some of our manufacturing  license and collaboration agreements provide for periodic maintenance fees over specified time periods  as well as payments by us upon the achievement of development and regulatory milestones and the payment of royalties based on commercial product sales 
we do not expect to pay any royalties on net sales of products under any of these agreements for at least the next several years 
the amounts set forth below for any given year could be substantially higher if we make certain development progress that requires us to make milestone payments or if we receive regulatory approvals or achieve commercial sales and are required to pay royalties earlier than anticipated 
the following are our future minimum contractual commitments for the periods subsequent to december  in thousands total thereafter operating leases manufacturing  license and collaboration agreements tenant improvements total operating lease obligations do not assume the exercise by us of any termination or extension options 
the minimum payments under manufacturing  license and collaboration agreements primarily represent contractual obligations related to performing scale up and gmp manufacturing for our product candidates for use in our clinical trials 
the minimum payments under tenant improvements represent obligations in support of our expansion into additional office and lab space 
the above table excludes royalties and payments of up to approximately million in potential future milestone payments to third parties under manufacturing  license and collaboration agreements for our current development programs  which generally become due and payable only upon achievement of certain developmental  regulatory and or commercial milestones 
because the achievement of these milestones is neither probable nor reasonably estimable with respect to timing  such contingent payments have not been included in the above table and will not be included until the event triggering such payment has occurred 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment portfolio 
in accordance with our investment policy  we do not have any derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio 
we invest in high quality interest bearing instruments consisting of us government and agency securities  high grade corporate bonds  taxable municipal bonds  auction rate securities  commercial paper and money market accounts 
our investment securities consisted of the following in thousands december  short term investments long term investments other non current assets total included in long term investments as of december  are auction rate securities  valued at million that have failed at auction and are currently illiquid 
liquidity of these investments is subject to either a successful auction process  redemption of the investment  or a sale of the security in a secondary market 
given that further deterioration in the global credit and financial markets is a possibility  no assurance can be made that further downgrades  losses  failed auctions or other significant deterioration in the fair value of our cash equivalents  short term or long term investments will not occur 
if any such further downgrades  losses  failed actions or other significant deteriorations occur  it may negatively impact or impair our current portfolio of cash equivalents  short term or long term investments 
we have estimated the effect on our investment portfolio of a hypothetical increase in interest rates by one percent to be a reduction of million in the fair value of our investments as of december  in addition  a hypothetical decrease of one percent in the effective yield of our investments would reduce our investment income by approximately million
