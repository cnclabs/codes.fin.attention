item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview the following section presents an overview of our restaurant concepts  our related growth strategy and challenges we face 
a summary of our financial results and our outlook are also presented 
our restaurants we own and operate two restaurant concepts in the asian niche pf chang s china bistro bistro and pei wei asian diner pei wei 
on august   we sold the long lived assets of taneko japanese tavern taneko  a third restaurant concept developed in  which has been classified as a discontinued operation in the company s consolidated financial statements since the end of fiscal bistro as of december   we owned and operated full service bistro restaurants that feature a blend of high quality  traditional chinese cuisine and attentive service in a high energy contemporary bistro setting 
pf chang s was formed in early with the acquisition of the four original bistro restaurants and the hiring of an experienced management team 
utilizing a partnership management philosophy  we embarked on a strategic expansion of the concept targeted at major metropolitan areas throughout the united states 
we own and operate all of our restaurants with the exception of two bistro restaurants located in hawaii which are operated under a joint venture arrangement in which we own a minority interest 
pei wei as of december   we also owned and operated quick casual pei wei restaurants that serve freshly prepared  wok seared  contemporary pan asian cuisine in a relaxed  warm environment with friendly attentive 
table of contents counter service and take out flexibility 
we opened our first pei wei restaurant in july in the phoenix  arizona area and have expanded the concept significantly since that time 
as part of ongoing profitability initiatives  we closed underperforming pei wei restaurants during the fourth quarter of this decision was a result of a rigorous evaluation of our entire store portfolio 
we reviewed each location s past and present operating performance combined with projected future results 
the restaurants selected for closure had lower profitability and were not projected to provide acceptable returns in the foreseeable future 
the results of these pei wei restaurants are reported within discontinued operations in our consolidated financial statements for all periods presented 
see note to our consolidated financial statements for further discussion 
our strategy our objective is to be the best operator of asian restaurants as viewed by our guests and our employees 
we aim to develop and operate a nationwide system of asian inspired restaurants that offer guests a sophisticated dining experience  create a loyal customer base that generates a high level of repeat business and provide superior returns to our investors 
to achieve our objectives  we strive to offer high quality asian cuisine in a memorable atmosphere while delivering exceptional customer service and an excellent dining value 
we are currently operating restaurants exclusively in the asian niche due in part to the continued popularity of asian cuisine  combined with a relatively lower level of organized competition in this segment compared to other popular cuisines segments such as mexican and italian 
we believe this creates a significant long term opportunity for us to both grow our existing restaurant sales and open new locations in new and existing markets 
we are selective when choosing our new restaurant locations and assess anticipated returns on invested capital at both an individual restaurant and market level when determining future development plans 
we seek an average unit level return on invested capital of percent for both of our concepts and plan to continue opening new restaurants to the extent that we continue to achieve our target rate of return 
our challenges our business is highly sensitive to changes in guest traffic 
increases in guest traffic drive higher sales  which creates improved leverage of our fixed operating costs and thus enables us to achieve higher operating margins 
as guest traffic decreases  as it has during the current recession  lower sales result in decreased leverage that leads to declines in our operating margins 
in addition to the impact of sales de leverage  we currently face overall rising restaurant operating costs  including higher labor costs and increasing commodities costs 
to offset the negative impacts of both higher operating costs and decreased leverage in a declining sales environment  our bistro and pei wei operators have undertaken a series of initiatives designed to gain efficiencies at the restaurant level  with a focus on labor and cost of sales improvement opportunities  while taking special care to ensure that these initiatives do not negatively impact our guests dining experience 
the restaurant industry can be significantly affected by changes in discretionary spending patterns  economic conditions  consumer tastes  lifestyle trends and cost fluctuations 
in recent years  consumers have been under increased economic pressures and as a result  many have changed their discretionary spending patterns 
many consumers dine out less frequently than in the past or have reduced the amount they spend on meals while dining out 
accordingly  we strive to continuously evolve and refine the critical elements of our restaurant concepts to help maintain and enhance the strength of our brands and remain fresh and relevant to our guests while maintaining a high value to price perception 
we continuously update our menu offerings and have injected our restaurants with an updated contemporary look and feel 
we also began implementing a number of new marketing initiatives designed to increase brand awareness and help drive guest traffic 
the restaurant business is intensely competitive with respect to food quality  price value relationships  ambiance  service and location  and many existing restaurants compete with us at each of our locations 
additionally  the continued popularity of asian cuisine may result in increased competition from new asian branded concepts as well as non asian restaurants and other food outlets  such as supermarkets  that may increase their asian inspired menu offerings 

table of contents our financial results during  we experienced significant deteriorations in guest traffic at both of our restaurant concepts 
we believe such traffic declines have occurred as recent events such as the housing and financial market crisis  rising unemployment and higher costs for consumer staples all contributed to a deepening us economic recession  which has driven significant changes in consumer discretionary spending patterns 
as a result  we saw a decline in overall sales per location and lower operating margins at both concepts during our financial results include consolidated revenue growth of percent to billion  driven primarily by new restaurant openings  partially offset by a decline in comparable store sales at both concepts  a decrease in income from continuing operations decrease of percent to million  an increase in diluted income per share from continuing operations increase of percent to partially due to the full year benefit of lower diluted shares outstanding principally resulting from prior share repurchases  a loss from discontinued operations net of tax of million  including the impact of a million pretax asset impairment charge and million of lease termination and severance charges in connection with pei wei store closures  new bistro openings and new pei wei openings 
our results continued to be affected by concept growth during as we incurred million million  net of tax  or approximately per diluted share  in preopening expenses related to new bistro and pei wei restaurant openings 
as we continue to develop and expand our restaurant concepts at different rates  our financial results will be impacted by the mix of the number of restaurants in our concepts and the ratio of newer restaurants to more established restaurants within those concepts 
this is due to the different operating characteristics of our brands as well as variations in the economics of our new restaurants compared to our more seasoned restaurants 
outlook we anticipate a significant reduction in average weekly sales during fiscal  with an estimated decrease of approximately at both the bistro and pei wei 
consolidated revenues for fiscal are expected to be flat compared to fiscal due to projected average weekly sales declines offset by the benefit of a full year of revenues for restaurants that opened during fiscal combined with revenues from anticipated new restaurant openings during fiscal as a result of lower anticipated average weekly sales  we expect to experience deleverage of certain operating expenses  primarily related to fixed costs such as labor and depreciation 
overall restaurant operating margins for fiscal are projected to decline approximately basis points compared to fiscal we have reduced our planned new restaurant development and currently expect to open to new bistro restaurants and to new pei wei restaurants during fiscal as a result  we anticipate a significant reduction in preopening expenses for fiscal overall  we expect consolidated income from continuing operations for fiscal to decline approximately compared to fiscal development bistro we intend to open only four to six new bistros in  primarily located in existing markets 
we have signed lease agreements for all of our development planned for fiscal our bistro restaurants typically range in size from  to  square feet  and require an average total cash investment of approximately million to million and total invested capital of approximately million per restaurant net of estimated landlord reimbursements 
this total capitalized investment includes the capitalized lease value of the property  which can 
table of contents vary greatly depending on the specific trade area 
see risk factors development and construction risks 
preopening expenses are expected to average approximately  per restaurant during fiscal pei wei we intend to slow our pei wei growth substantially in fiscal and limit the number of openings to two to four new restaurants for which we already have signed leases 
our pei wei restaurants are generally  to  square feet in size and require an average total cash investment of approximately  to  and total invested capital of approximately million per restaurant net of estimated landlord reimbursements 
preopening expenses are expected to average approximately  per restaurant during fiscal global brand development based on our belief that our brands would work well in the international market  we have recently engaged in discussions with potential partners with whom we might collaborate to develop our international presence 
we expect these relationships to take the form of license agreements under which we would receive an initial territory fee  store opening fees and ongoing royalty revenues based on a percentage of international restaurant sales 
while we do not currently plan on directly investing our capital into these ventures  we do anticipate incurring incremental costs as we build infrastructure to support these initiatives 
operating statistics there are several key financial metrics that can be useful in evaluating and understanding our business 
these metrics  which are widely used throughout the restaurant industry  include short term revenue measures such as average weekly sales and total revenues and long term profitability measures such as return on invested capital  each of which are described in further detail below 
we believe it is helpful to review these measures both in total and by class year ie  year of restaurant opening 
average weekly sales represents an average sales amount per restaurant and helps gauge the changes in traffic  pricing and brand development 
new restaurants are included in our average weekly sales comparison at the start of their thirteenth month of operation 
it is not uncommon in the casual dining industry for new restaurant locations to open with an initial honeymoon period of higher than normal sales volumes and then experience a drop off in sales after initial customer trials 
total revenues by class year helps assess the sales performance of our new and existing restaurants as well as the growth of each concept as we continue our expansion strategy 
return on invested capital is a key profitability measure that provides an indication of the long term health of our concepts 
this metric is based on a comparison of operating profit to the average capital invested in our restaurants 
we believe return on invested capital is a critical indicator in evaluating our ability to create long term value for our shareholders

critical accounting policies our significant accounting policies are disclosed in note to our consolidated financial statements 
the following discussion addresses our most critical accounting policies  which are those that require significant judgment 
partnership structure we utilize a partnership philosophy to facilitate the development  leadership and operation of our restaurants 
historically  this philosophy was embodied in a traditional legal partnership structure  which included capital contributions from our partners in exchange for an ownership stake in the profits and losses of our restaurants 
under this legal partnership program  each partner who wishes to participate in our legal partnership structure  to the extent applicable  is required to make a cash capital contribution in exchange for a specified interest in the partnership 
the ownership interest purchased by each partner generally ranges between two and ten percent of the restaurant or region the partner oversees 
generally  no more than ten percent of an individual restaurant is owned in total by minority partners 
we perform an assessment of what the imputed fair value of these interests might be for a passive equity investor ie not someone actually working in the restaurant  utilizing a discounted cash flow model and updated assumptions based on the results of an annual valuation analysis performed by a third party consultant 
this methodology involves the use of various estimates relating to future cash flow projections and discount rates for which significant judgments are required 
we recognize any excess of the imputed fair value of these interests  
table of contents determined by using the discounted cash flow model  over the cash contribution paid by our partners as partner investment expense upon purchase by the partner of the respective interest 
at the end of a specific term generally five years  we have the right  but not the obligation  to purchase the minority partner s interest in the partner s respective restaurant or region at fair value 
the estimated fair value for such purchases and sales is determined by reference to current industry purchase metrics as well as the historical cash flows or net income of the subject restaurant or region 
we have the option to pay the agreed upon purchase price in cash over a period of time not to exceed five years 
given that there is no public market for these interests  the fair value determinations are subjective and require the use of various estimates for which significant judgments are required 
any excess of the purchase price over the imputed fair value is recorded as an intangible asset and amortized over approximately years for our bistro restaurants and approximately years for our pei wei restaurants 
effective january for new store openings  the bistro began employing a different partnership structure to achieve the same goal 
at the restaurant level  our operating and culinary partners at stores opened on or after january  still partners in the philosophical  but not legal sense no longer have a direct ownership stake in the profits and losses of a restaurant  but are instead eligible to receive monthly incentive payments based upon the profitability of the restaurant  as well as participate in an incentive program that rewards improvements in the operating performance of the restaurant 
as a result of these changes  awards made to the individuals participating in the new plan are classified as compensation expense rather than as minority interest expense 
accordingly  compensation expense for these operating and culinary partners is reflected in the consolidated income statement as labor expense 
additionally  a similar structure exists for our market partners  market chefs and regional vice presidents  with related compensation expense reflected as general and administrative expense in the consolidated income statement 
partner investment expense is no longer recognized for new bistro restaurant openings beginning in as a result of this change 
additionally  many existing legal partners requested an early buyout of their partnership interests during and as a result of their desire to participate in the new plan  the financial impact of which is discussed under partner investment expense in results of operations 
the pei wei partnership structure is not affected by the changes at the bistro and the traditional partnership structure remains in effect for new pei wei restaurant openings 
lease obligations we lease all of our restaurant properties 
at the inception of the lease  each property is evaluated to determine whether the lease will be accounted for as an operating or capital lease 
the term used for this evaluation includes renewal option periods only in instances in which the exercise of the renewal option can be reasonably assured and failure to exercise such option would result in an economic penalty 
there is potential for variability in the rent holiday period  which begins on the possession date and ends on the store open date  during which no cash rent payments are typically due under the terms of the lease 
factors that may affect the length of the rent holiday period generally relate to construction related delays 
extension of the rent holiday period due to delays in store opening will result in greater preopening rent expense recognized during the rent holiday period and lower occupancy expense during the rest of the lease term post opening 
for leases that contain rent escalations  we record the total rent payable during the lease term  as determined above  on a straight line basis over the term of the lease including the rent holiday period beginning upon our possession of the premises  and record the difference between the minimum rent paid and the straight line rent as a lease obligation 
many of our leases contain provisions that require additional rental payments based upon restaurant sales volume contingent rent 
contingent rent is accrued each period as the liability is incurred  in addition to the straight line rent expense noted above 
this results in variability in occupancy expense as a percentage of revenues over the term of the lease in restaurants where we pay contingent rent 
management makes judgments regarding the probable term for each restaurant property lease  which can impact the classification and accounting for a lease as capital or operating  the rent holiday and or escalations in payments that are taken into consideration when calculating straight line rent and the term over which leasehold 
table of contents improvements for each restaurant are amortized 
these judgments may produce materially different amounts of depreciation  amortization and rent expense than would be reported if different assumed lease terms were used 
share based compensation we account for share based compensation in accordance with the fair value recognition provisions of financial accounting standards board statement of financial accounting standard no 
revised  share based payment 
we use the black scholes option pricing model  which requires the input of subjective assumptions 
these assumptions include estimating the length of time employees will retain their vested stock options before exercising them expected term  the volatility of our common stock price over the expected term and the number of options that will ultimately not vest forfeitures 
additionally  we use assumptions to estimate the expected forfeiture rate related to restricted stock in determining the share based compensation for these awards 
changes in these assumptions can materially affect our estimates of share based compensation and consequently  the related amount recognized in the consolidated statements of income 
impairment of long lived assets we review property and equipment and intangible assets with finite lives those assets resulting from the acquisition of minority partners interests in the operating rights of certain of our restaurants for impairment when events or circumstances indicate these assets might be impaired  but at least quarterly 
we test impairment using historical cash flows and other relevant facts and circumstances as the primary basis for our estimates of future cash flows 
the analysis is performed at the individual restaurant or operating segment level for indicators of permanent impairment 
judgments and estimates made related to long lived assets are affected by factors such as economic conditions  changes in historical resale values and changes in operating performance 
this process requires the use of estimates and assumptions  which are subject to a high degree of judgment 
if these assumptions change in the future  we may be required to record impairment charges for these assets 
self insurance we are self insured for a significant portion of our current and prior years exposures related to our workers compensation  general liability  medical and dental programs 
we have paid to our insurance carrier amounts that approximate the cost of claims known to date and we have accrued additional liabilities for our estimate of ultimate costs related to those claims 
we develop these estimates with our insurance providers and use historical experience factors to estimate the ultimate claim exposure 
our self insurance liabilities are actuarially determined and consider estimates of expected losses  based on statistical analyses of our actual historical trends as well as historical industry data 
if actual claims experience differs from our assumptions and estimates  changes in our insurance reserves would impact the expense recorded in our consolidated income statements 
income taxes we provide for income taxes based on our estimate of federal and state income tax liabilities 
these estimates include  among other items  effective rates for state and local income taxes  allowable tax credits for items such as taxes paid on reported tip income  estimates related to depreciation and amortization expense allowable for tax purposes  and the tax deductibility of certain other items 
our estimates are based on the information available to us at the time that we prepare the income tax provision 
we generally file our annual income tax returns several months after our fiscal year end 
income tax returns are subject to audit by federal  state  and local governments  generally years after the returns are filed 
these returns could be subject to material adjustments or differing interpretations of the tax laws 
accruals for uncertain tax positions are accounted for under fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes  an interpretation of fasb statement no 
fin 
on a quarterly basis  we review and update our inventory of tax positions as necessary to add any new uncertain positions taken  or to remove previously identified uncertain positions that have been adequately resolved 
additionally  uncertain positions may be re measured as warranted by changes in facts or law 
accounting for uncertain tax positions requires significant 
table of contents judgments  including estimating the amount  timing and likelihood of ultimate settlement 
although the company believes that its estimates are reasonable  actual results could differ from these estimates 
results of operations we operate on a week year  with the fiscal year ending on the sunday closest to december fiscal years  and were each comprised of weeks 
fiscal compared to fiscal our consolidated operating results for the fiscal years ended december  fiscal and december  fiscal were as follows dollars in thousands fiscal year of revenues of revenues change change revenues costs and expenses cost of sales labor operating occupancy general and administrative depreciation and amortization preopening expense partner investment expense total costs and expenses income from operations interest and other income expense  net minority interest income from continuing operations before provision for income taxes provision for income taxes income from continuing operations loss from discontinued operations  net of tax net income certain percentage amounts do not sum to total due to rounding

revenues our revenues are derived primarily from food and beverage sales 
each segment contributed as follows bistro the increase in revenues was attributable to revenues of million generated by new bistro restaurants that opened during combined with a full year of revenues for the new stores that opened during revenues for stores that opened prior to declined by million as a significant reduction in overall guest traffic more than offset the benefit of a three to four percent average check increase  reflecting the net benefit of price and menu mix changes 
pei wei the increase in revenues was attributable to revenues of million generated by new pei wei restaurants that opened during combined with a full year of revenues for the new stores that opened during revenues for stores that opened prior to decreased by million primarily due to a significant reduction in overall guest traffic partially offset by the benefit of a slightly higher average check  reflecting the net benefit of price and menu mix changes 

table of contents costs and expenses cost of sales cost of sales is comprised of the cost of food and beverages 
cost of sales as a percentage of revenues decreased at both bistro and pei wei due to the net impact of favorable product mix shifts 
we negotiate annual pricing agreements for many of our key commodities and such contracts provided for favorable seafood and produce costs  unfavorable poultry and wok oil costs  and consistent beef costs during fiscal compared to fiscal labor labor expenses consist of restaurant management salaries  hourly staff payroll costs  other payroll related items and imputed partner bonus expense 
imputed partner bonus expense represents the portion of restaurant level operating results that is allocable to minority partners  but is presented as bonus expense for accounting purposes 
each segment contributed as follows bistro labor expenses as a percentage of revenues decreased primarily due to improved efficiency primarily in culinary as well as hospitality positions 
the decrease was partially offset by the benefit of reduced workers compensation insurance liabilities recorded in resulting from lower than anticipated claim development from prior claim years  higher management incentive costs principally resulting from the full year impact of the change in the bistro partnership structure and the impact of decreased leverage on lower average weekly sales on the portion of labor expenses that is fixed in nature 
pei wei labor expenses as a percentage of revenues decreased primarily due to improved labor efficiency in culinary and hospitality positions as well as lower manager salaries resulting from reduced management headcount 
the benefit of opening fewer new stores on a larger base of existing stores during fiscal also contributed to the decrease 
the decrease was partially offset by costs associated with the utilization of additional key hourly employees  the benefit of reduced workers compensation insurance liabilities recorded in resulting from lower than anticipated claim development from prior claim years and the impact of decreased leverage on lower average weekly sales on the portion of labor expenses that is fixed in nature 
operating operating expenses consist primarily of various restaurant level costs such as repairs and maintenance  utilities and marketing  certain of which are variable and fluctuate with revenues 
our experience has been that operating costs during the first four to nine months of a newly opened restaurant are materially greater than what can be expected after that time  both in aggregate dollars and as a percentage of revenues 
each segment contributed as follows bistro operating expenses as a percentage of revenues increased primarily due to increased marketing spend  the impact of decreased leverage on lower average weekly sales on the portion of operating costs that is fixed in nature and higher utility costs 
pei wei operating expenses as a percentage of revenues increased primarily due to the impact of decreased leverage resulting from lower average weekly sales on the portion of operating costs that is fixed in nature as well as increased marketing spend  higher utility costs  and higher menu printing costs related to new menu rollouts 
occupancy occupancy costs include both fixed and variable portions of rent  common area maintenance charges  property and general liability insurance and property taxes 
each segment contributed as follows bistro occupancy costs as a percentage of revenues remained consistent primarily due to lower contingent rent expense offset by the impact of decreased leverage on lower average weekly sales 

table of contents pei wei occupancy costs as a percentage of revenues increased primarily due to the impact of decreased leverage on lower average weekly sales 
general and administrative general and administrative expenses are comprised of costs associated with corporate and administrative functions that support restaurant development and operations and provide infrastructure to support future growth  including but not limited to management and staff compensation  employee benefits  travel  legal and professional fees  technology and market research 
consolidated general and administrative costs increased primarily due to higher management incentive accruals resulting from the accrual of a corporate bonus for fiscal compared to the absence of such an accrual in fiscal as well as higher compensation and benefits expense primarily related to the addition of corporate management personnel and increased health insurance costs 
these increases were partially offset by lower share based compensation expense 
fiscal also includes million of cash and non cash charges related to the pei wei president s separation agreement which included a severance payment  accelerated vesting of unvested options and the extension of the expiration date of all outstanding stock options 
depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization expenses include the depreciation and amortization of fixed assets  gains and losses on disposal of assets and the amortization of intangible assets and non transferable liquor license fees 
each segment contributed as follows bistro depreciation and amortization increased primarily due to depreciation on restaurants that opened during fiscal as well as a full year of depreciation on restaurants that opened during fiscal as a percentage of revenues  depreciation and amortization increased primarily due to the impact of decreased leverage resulting from lower average weekly sales 
pei wei depreciation and amortization increased primarily due to depreciation on restaurants that opened during fiscal as well as a full year of depreciation on restaurants that opened during fiscal as a percentage of revenues  depreciation and amortization increased primarily due to the impact of decreased leverage resulting from lower average weekly sales 
preopening expense preopening expenses  which are expensed as incurred  consist of expenses incurred prior to opening a new restaurant and are comprised principally of manager salaries and relocation costs  employee payroll and related training costs 
preopening expenses also include straight line rent expense for the period between the possession date of leased premises and the restaurant opening date 
each segment contributed as follows bistro preopening expense decreased primarily due to the impact of opening new restaurants during fiscal compared to opening new restaurants during fiscal in addition to a lower number of scheduled new restaurant openings in early fiscal compared to early fiscal pei wei preopening expense decreased primarily due to the timing of expenses related to restaurants that opened during the first quarter of  which resulted in a greater portion of preopening expenses related to fiscal openings being recognized during fiscal also contributing to the decrease was the impact of opening new restaurants during fiscal compared to opening new restaurants during fiscal as well as a lower number of scheduled new restaurant openings in early fiscal compared to early fiscal partner investment expense partner investment expense represents the difference between the imputed fair value of our partners ownership interests at the time the partners invest in their restaurants and our partners cash contributions for those ownership interests 
additionally  for those partners who are bought out prior to the restaurant reaching 
table of contents maturity typically after five years of operation  partner investment expense includes a reversal of previously recognized expense for the difference between the fair value of the partner s interest at inception date and the fair value at the date of repurchase  to the extent that the former is greater 
each segment contributed as follows bistro the change in partner investment expense resulted primarily from changes in the partnership structure beginning in which led to a significant increase in early buyouts of minority partner interests beginning in fiscal early buyouts resulted in a million reversal of previously recognized partner investment expense during fiscal as compared to a million reversal during fiscal  in each case due to the fair value of the partners interests at inception date exceeding the fair value of the partners interests at repurchase date 
pei wei partner investment expense decreased primarily due to the impact of opening fewer new restaurants during fiscal compared to fiscal interest and other income expense  net interest expense recognized during fiscal and fiscal primarily consists of interest costs in excess of amounts capitalized related to our outstanding credit line and other borrowings 
interest income earned during fiscal primarily related to interest bearing overnight deposits as lower borrowing levels resulted in full capitalization of interest expense 
accretion expense related to our conditional asset retirement obligations is also recognized in interest expense 
consolidated interest and other income expense  net increased primarily due to higher interest expense in resulting from interest incurred on a higher average level of outstanding credit line borrowings throughout  a portion of which exceeded our limit for capitalization during we expect to continue to recognize net interest expense until such time as we lower our outstanding debt levels or increase our development 
minority interest minority interest represents the portion of our net earnings which is attributable to the collective ownership interests of our minority partners 
as previously discussed  in many of our restaurants we employ a partnership management structure whereby we have entered into a series of partnership agreements with our regional managers  certain of our general managers  and certain of our executive chefs 
each segment contributed as follows bistro minority interest as a percentage of revenues at the bistro decreased due to the impact of partner buyouts occurring during fiscal and the full year impact of partner buyouts that occurred during fiscal during fiscal and fiscal  interests and interests were purchased  respectively  which reduced the number of minority interests to interests at the end of fiscal pei wei minority interest as a percentage of revenues decreased slightly primarily due to the impact of partnership interest buyouts occurring during fiscal and provision for income taxes our effective tax rate from continuing operations was for fiscal compared to for fiscal the increase from the prior year was primarily attributable to state taxes  and  to a lesser extent  the impact of a change in estimate related to amended tax returns 
besides the effect of state taxes and the change in estimate related to the amended returns  the income tax rate for both fiscal and fiscal differed from the expected provision for income taxes  which is derived by applying the statutory income tax rate  primarily as a result of fica tip credits 
management has evaluated all positive and negative evidence concerning the realizability of deferred tax assets and has determined that  with the exception of a small amount of state net operating losses  we will recognize sufficient future taxable income to realize the benefit of our deferred tax assets 
loss on discontinued operations  net of tax as part of ongoing profitability initiatives  we closed underperforming pei wei restaurants during the fourth quarter of this decision  which was reached during the third quarter of  was the result of a rigorous 
table of contents evaluation of our entire store portfolio 
we reviewed each location s past and present operating performance combined with projected future results 
the locations selected for closure represent restaurants with lower profitability that were not projected to provide acceptable returns in the foreseeable future 
during the second half of  we recognized non cash asset impairment charges of million million net of tax related to the write off of the carrying value of long lived assets associated with the pei wei store closures 
we also recognized additional pretax charges of million related to estimated and actual lease termination costs and million related to severance payments made in connection with the store closures 
these charges as well as all historical operations related to the closed stores are reflected within discontinued operations in the consolidated financial statements for all years presented as further discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements 
additionally  as a result of the expected sale of taneko s long lived assets  taneko was classified as a discontinued operation as of december  we recognized a million million net of tax asset impairment charge which was included within discontinued operations during all revenues  costs and expenses and income taxes attributable to taneko are reflected within discontinued operations in the consolidated financial statements for all periods presented

revenues each segment contributed as follows bistro the increase in revenues was attributable to revenues of million generated by new bistro restaurants that opened during combined with a full year of revenues for the new stores that opened during stores that opened prior to experienced a million decline in revenues due to a reduction in overall guest traffic which resulted in lower sales volumes  despite the benefit of a average check increase 
pei wei the increase in revenues was attributable to revenues of million generated by the new pei wei restaurants that opened in combined with a full year of revenues for the new stores that opened during stores that opened prior to experienced a million increase in revenues due to higher guest traffic partially offset by a slight decrease in average check 

table of contents costs and expenses cost of sales each segment contributed as follows bistro cost of sales as a percentage of revenues at the bistro increased slightly primarily due to higher produce and dry food expense as well as the impact of our new grill menu items 
the increases were partially offset by lower seafood and pork expense resulting from favorable pricing  improved yields and increased purchasing through national distribution contracts 
pei wei cost of sales as a percentage of revenues at pei wei was consistent with the prior year primarily due to lower produce expense resulting from the increase in product availability  favorable yields and the number of products covered by contract pricing as well as lower pork expense resulting from favorable pricing and yields 
this impact was fully offset by increased dry food expense and the benefit of an adjustment recorded during the second quarter of resulting from a modification of our accounting policy related to rebate accruals 
labor each segment contributed as follows bistro labor expenses as a percentage of revenues at the bistro increased primarily due to higher management incentive costs principally resulting from the change in the bistro partnership structure  wage rate pressure impacting all hourly labor categories and the impact of decreased leverage resulting from lower average weekly sales on the portion of labor costs that is fixed in nature 
the impact of these factors was partially offset by the benefit of reduced workers compensation insurance liabilities resulting from lower than anticipated claims development

the decrease in the effective rate for fiscal compared to fiscal is primarily due to an income tax benefit arising from state tax credits and state and federal net operating losses 
management has evaluated all positive and negative evidence concerning the realizability of deferred tax assets and has determined that  with the exception of a small amount of state net operating losses  the company will recognize sufficient future taxable income to realize the benefit of its deferred tax assets

liquidity and capital resources our primary sources of liquidity are cash provided by operations and borrowings under our credit facility 
historically  our need for capital resources has been driven by our construction of new restaurants 
more recently  our need for capital resources has also been driven by the purchase of minority interests in both fiscal and as well as repurchases of our common stock in fiscal  and the following table presents a summary of our cash flows for fiscal years   and in thousands net cash provided by operating activities net cash used in investing activities net cash provided by used in financing activities net increase decrease in cash and cash equivalents 
table of contents operating activities we have funded our capital requirements since inception through sales of equity securities  debt financing and cash flows from operations 
net cash provided by operating activities exceeded net income for the periods shown due principally to the effect of depreciation and amortization  a net increase in operating liabilities  share based compensation and the effect of minority interest as well as non cash asset impairment and lease termination charges recognized in fiscal and investing activities we have historically used cash primarily to fund the development and construction of new restaurants 
investment activities primarily related to capital expenditures of million  million  and million in fiscal years  and  respectively 
capital expenditures were relatively higher during fiscal and relatively lower during fiscal due to both the number of new restaurant openings in each year new restaurants during fiscal compared to new restaurants during fiscal and the timing of openings  which resulted in a greater portion of capital expenditures related to early fiscal openings being recognized during fiscal also included are purchases of minority interests of million  million and million in   and  respectively  and capitalized interest of million  million  and million in   and  respectively 
additionally  we had net sales of short term investments totaling million during we intend to open four to six new bistro restaurants and two to four new pei wei restaurants in fiscal year we expect that our planned future bistro restaurants will require  on average  a total cash investment per restaurant of approximately million to million 
we expect to spend approximately  per restaurant for preopening costs 
total cash investment per each pei wei restaurant is expected to average  to  and we expect to spend  per restaurant for preopening costs 
the anticipated total cash investment per restaurant is based on recent historical averages which have increased over prior years due to increases in construction related costs of steel  aluminum and lumber 
we expect total gross capital expenditures for fiscal to approximate million to million million to million  net of landlord reimbursements 
financing activities financing activities during fiscal   and included debt repayments  purchases of treasury stock  proceeds from stock options exercised and employee stock purchases  distributions to minority partners  and the tax benefit from disqualifying stock option dispositions  as well as million and million of credit line borrowings during fiscal and  respectively 
fiscal year also included million related to the purchase of pei wei minority interests 
future capital requirements our capital requirements  including development costs related to the opening of additional restaurants  have historically been significant 
our future capital requirements and the adequacy of our available funds will depend on many factors  including the operating performance of our restaurants  the pace of expansion  real estate markets  site locations  the nature of the arrangements negotiated with landlords and any potential repurchases of our common stock 
for fiscal  we believe that our cash flow from operations will significantly exceed our projected capital requirements 
as a result and given the uncertainty of the macroeconomic environment  we plan to evaluate other uses of capital  including  but not limited to  debt repayment and repurchases of our common stock 
in the longer term  in the unlikely event that additional capital is required  we may seek to raise such capital through public or private equity or debt financing 
future capital funding transactions may result in dilution to current shareholders 
we cannot ensure that such capital will be available on favorable terms  if at all 
credit facility on august   we entered into a senior credit facility credit facility with several commercial financial institutions  which allows for borrowings of up to million 
the credit facility is guaranteed by our material existing and future domestic subsidiaries 
the credit facility expires on august  and contains 
table of contents customary representations  warranties  and negative and affirmative covenants  including a requirement to maintain a maximum leverage ratio  as defined  of and a minimum fixed charge coverage ratio  as defined  of  as well as customary events of default and certain default provisions that could result in acceleration of the credit facility 
we were in compliance with these restrictions and conditions as of december  as our leverage ratio was and the fixed charge coverage ratio was as of december   we had borrowings outstanding under the credit facility totaling million as well as million committed for the issuance of letters of credit  which is required by insurance companies for our workers compensation and general liability insurance programs 
available borrowings under the credit facility were million at december  see item a below for a discussion of interest rates and our interest rate swap 
share repurchase program our board of directors has authorized programs to repurchase up to a total of million of our outstanding shares of common stock from time to time in the open market  pursuant to rule b trading plans or in private transactions at prevailing market prices 
we repurchased a total of million shares of our common stock for million at an average price of during fiscal years and and million of the initial million purchase authorization expired in fiscal during fiscal  we repurchased a total of million shares of our common stock for million at an average price of using cash on hand 
at december   there remains million available under the current share repurchase authorization  which expires in july we did not repurchase any shares during the fourth quarter of fiscal partnership activities as of december   there were partners within our partnership system representing partnership interests 
during fiscal  we had the opportunity to purchase partnership interests which had reached the five year threshold period during the year  as well as additional partnership interests which i had reached the end of their initial five year term in prior years ii related to partners who left the company prior to the initial five year term or iii related to partners who requested an early buyout of their interest 
we purchased of these partnership interests in their entirety for a total of million 
of the total purchase price  million was paid in cash  while the remaining balance has been recorded as debt on the consolidated balance sheet at december  during fiscal  we will have the opportunity to purchase additional partnership interests which will reach their five year anniversary 
if all of these interests are purchased  the total purchase price will approximate million to million based upon the estimated fair value of the respective interests at december  purchase commitments the following table shows our purchase commitments by category as of december  in thousands payments due by period less greater than than total year years years years long term debt operating leases capital leases purchase obligations total the table above does not include obligations related to lease renewal option periods even if it is reasonably assured that we will exercise the related option 
additionally  purchase obligations have been included only to the extent that our failure to perform would result in formal recourse against us 
accordingly  certain procurement arrangements that require us to purchase future items are included  but only to the extent they include a recourse provision for our failure to purchase 

table of contents new accounting standards see the recent accounting pronouncements section of note to our consolidated financial statements for a summary of new accounting standards 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risk primarily from fluctuations in interest rates on our revolving credit facility and other borrowings as well as from changes in commodities prices 
interest rates we have exposure to interest rate risk related to our variable rate borrowings 
our revolving credit facility allows for borrowings of up to million with outstanding amounts bearing interest at variable rates equal to libor plus an applicable margin which is subject to change based on our leverage ratio 
at december   we had borrowings of million outstanding under our credit facility as well as unsecured promissory notes totaling million 
during the second quarter of fiscal  we entered into an interest rate swap with a notional amount of million to hedge a portion of the cash flows of our variable rate borrowings 
we have designated the interest rate swap as a cash flow hedge of our exposure to variability in future cash flows attributable to interest payments on a million tranche of floating rate debt borrowed under our revolving credit facility 
under the terms of the swap  we pay a fixed rate of on the million notional amount and receive payments from the counterparty based on the month libor rate for a term ending on may   effectively resulting in a fixed rate on the libor component of the million notional amount 
the effective interest rate on the total borrowings outstanding under our revolving credit facility  including the impact of the interest rate swap agreement  was as of december  additionally  by using a derivative instrument to hedge exposures to changes in interest rates  we expose ourselves to credit risk 
credit risk is the failure of the counterparty to perform under the terms of the derivative contract 
we seek to minimize the credit risk by entering into transactions with high quality counterparties whose credit rating is evaluated on a quarterly basis 
as of december   based on current interest rates and total borrowings outstanding  including the impact of our interest rate swap  a hypothetical basis point increase in interest rates would have less than a million pre tax impact on our results of operations 
commodities prices we purchase certain commodities such as beef  pork  poultry  seafood and produce 
these commodities are generally purchased based upon market prices established with vendors 
these purchase arrangements may contain contractual features that fix the price paid for certain commodities 
historically  we have not used financial instruments to hedge commodity prices because these purchase arrangements help control the ultimate cost paid and any commodity price aberrations have historically been somewhat short term in nature
