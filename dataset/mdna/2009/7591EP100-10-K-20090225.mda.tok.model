item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation of this annual report on form k 
hurricanes and other weather related events could cause a disruption in our operations or other consequences that could have an adverse impact on our results of operations 
a significant portion of our operations are located in the areas bordering the gulf of mexico and the atlantic ocean  regions that are susceptible to hurricanes 
such weather events can cause disruption to our operations and could have a material adverse effect on our overall results of operations 
we maintain hurricane insurance  including coverage for lost profits and extra expense  however  there is no insurance against the disruption to the markets that we serve that a catastrophic hurricane could produce 
further  a hurricane in any of our market areas could adversely impact the ability of borrowers to timely repay their loans and may adversely impact the value of any collateral held by us 
some of the states in which we operate have in recent years experienced extreme droughts 
the effects of past or future hurricanes  droughts and other weather related events are difficult to predict  but could have an adverse effect on our businesses  financial condition and results of operations 
our participation in the us treasury s cpp imposes restrictions and obligations on us that limit our ability to increase dividends  repurchase shares of our common stock and access the equity capital markets 
on november   we issued and sold preferred stock and a warrant to purchase our common stock to the us treasury as part of its cpp 
prior to november   unless we have redeemed all of the preferred stock or the us treasury has transferred all of the preferred stock to a third party  the agreement pursuant to which such securities were sold  among other things  limits the payment of dividends on our common stock to the current quarterly dividend of per share without prior regulatory approval  limits our ability to repurchase shares of our common stock with certain exceptions  including the repurchase of our common stock to offset share dilution from equity based compensation awards  and grants the holders of such securities certain registration rights which  in certain circumstances  impose lock up periods during which we would be unable to issue equity securities 
in addition  unless we are able to redeem the preferred stock during the first five years  the dividends on of this capital will increase substantially at that point  from million annually to million annually 
depending on market conditions at the time  this increase in dividends could significantly impact our liquidity 
see regulation and supervision us treasury capital purchase program 

table of contents the market price of shares of our common stock will fluctuate 
the market price of our common stock could be subject to significant fluctuations due to a change in sentiment in the market regarding our operations or business prospects 
such risks may be affected by operating results that vary from the expectations of management  securities analysts and investors  developments in our businesses or in the financial sector generally  regulatory changes affecting our industry generally or our businesses and operations  the operating and securities price performance of companies that investors consider to be comparable to us  announcements of strategic developments  acquisitions and other material events by us or our competitors  changes in the credit  mortgage and real estate markets  including the markets for mortgage related securities  and changes in global financial markets and global economies and general market conditions  such as interest or foreign exchange rates  stock  commodity  credit or asset valuations or volatility 
stock markets in general and our common stock in particular have  over the past year  and continue to be experiencing significant price and volume volatility 
as a result  the market price of our common stock may continue to be subject to similar market fluctuations that may be unrelated to our operating performance or prospects 
increased volatility could result in a decline in the market price of our common stock 
industry competition may have an adverse effect on our success 
our profitability depends on our ability to compete successfully 
we operate in a highly competitive environment 
certain of our competitors are larger and have more resources than we do 
in our market areas  we face competition from other commercial banks  savings and loan associations  credit unions  internet banks  finance companies  mutual funds  insurance companies  brokerage and investment banking firms  and other financial intermediaries that offer similar services 
some of our non bank competitors are not subject to the same extensive regulations that govern regions or regions bank and may have greater flexibility in competing for business 
regions expects competition to intensify among financial services companies due to the recent consolidation of certain competing financial institutions and the conversion of certain investment banks to bank holding companies 
should competition in the financial services industry intensify  regions ability to market its products and services may be adversely affected 
changes in the policies of monetary authorities and other government action could adversely affect our profitability 
the results of operations of regions are affected by credit policies of monetary authorities  particularly the federal reserve 
the instruments of monetary policy employed by the federal reserve include open market operations in us government securities  changes in the discount rate or the federal funds rate on bank borrowings  and changes in reserve requirements against bank deposits 
in view of changing conditions in the national economy and in the money markets  we cannot predict possible future changes in interest rates  deposit levels  and loan demand on our businesses and earnings 
furthermore  ongoing military operations in the middle east or elsewhere around the world  including those in response to terrorist attacks  may result in currency fluctuations  exchange controls  market disruption and other adverse effects 
anti takeover laws and certain agreements and charter provisions may adversely affect share value 
certain provisions of state and federal law and our certificate of incorporation may make it more difficult for someone to acquire control of us without our board of directors approval 
under federal law  subject to certain exemptions  a person  entity or group must notify the federal banking agencies before acquiring control of 
table of contents a bank holding company 
acquisition of or more of any class of voting stock of a bank holding company or state member bank  including shares of our common stock  creates a rebuttable presumption that the acquiror controls the bank holding company or state member bank 
also  as noted under supervision and regulation general  a bank holding company must obtain the prior approval of the federal reserve before  among other things  acquiring direct or indirect ownership or control of more than of the voting shares of any bank  including regions bank 
there also are provisions in our certificate of incorporation that may be used to delay or block a takeover attempt 
as a result  these statutory provisions and provisions in our certificate of incorporation could result in regions being less attractive to a potential acquiror 
future issuances of additional securities could result in dilution of your ownership 
we may determine from time to time to issue additional securities to raise additional capital  support growth  or to make acquisitions 
further  we may issue stock options or other stock grants to retain and motivate our employees 
these issuances of our securities will dilute the ownership interests of our stockholders 
we need to stay current on technological changes in order to compete and meet customer demands 
the financial services market  including banking services  is undergoing rapid changes with frequent introductions of new technology driven products and services 
in addition to better serving customers  the effective use of technology increases efficiency and may enable us to reduce costs 
our future success may depend  in part  on our ability to use technology to provide products and services that provide convenience to customers and to create additional efficiencies in our operations

certain amounts in prior year presentations have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation  except as otherwise noted 
regions profitability  like that of many other financial institutions  is dependent on its ability to generate revenue from net interest income and non interest income sources 
net interest income is the difference between the interest income regions receives on interest earning assets  such as loans and securities  and the interest expense regions pays on interest bearing liabilities  principally deposits and borrowings 
regions net interest income is impacted by the size and mix of its balance sheet components and the interest rate spread between interest earned on its assets and interest paid on its liabilities 
non interest income includes fees from service charges on deposit accounts  brokerage  investment banking  capital markets  and trust activities  mortgage servicing and secondary marketing  insurance activities  and other customer services which regions provides 
results of operations are also affected by the provision for loan losses and non interest expenses such as salaries and employee benefits  occupancy and other operating expenses  including income taxes 
in addition  in regions non interest expense was impacted by a non cash goodwill impairment charge 
economic conditions  competition  and the monetary and fiscal policies of the federal government significantly affect most financial institutions  including regions 
lending and deposit activities and fee income generation are influenced by levels of business spending and investment  consumer income  consumer spending and savings  capital market activities  and competition among financial institutions  as well as customer preferences  interest rate conditions and prevailing market rates on competing products in regions market areas 
other factors  including the company s balance sheet capacity  capital levels and its liquidity management efforts also influence regions lending and deposit taking activities as well as its overall profitability 
regions business strategy has been and continues to be focused on providing a competitive mix of products and services  delivering quality customer service and maintaining a branch distribution network with offices in convenient locations 
regions delivers this business with the personal attention and feel of a community bank and with the service and product offerings of a large regional bank 
acquisitions the acquisitions of banks and other financial services companies have historically contributed significantly to regions growth 
the acquisitions of other financial services companies have also allowed regions to better diversify its revenue stream and to offer additional products and services to its customers

in the stock for stock merger  shares of regions were exchanged  on a tax free basis  for each share of amsouth common stock 
amsouth had total assets of approximately billion including goodwill and operated in states at the time of the merger

table of contents overview the year ended december  was an extremely tumultuous year for the us economy and  more specifically  for the financial services industry 
deteriorating home values  among other factors  provided a catalyst for declining valuations across nearly all asset classes  including loans and securities 
the property value declines  which began in late  continued to build throughout while regions did not have material exposure to many of the issues that plagued the industry eg  sub prime loans  structured investment vehicles  collateralized debt obligations  the company s exposure to the residential housing sector  primarily within its commercial real estate and construction loan portfolios  pressured its loan portfolio  resulting in increased credit costs and other real estate expenses 
in another significant event  the results of goodwill impairment testing in the fourth quarter of indicated that the estimated fair value of regions general banking treasury reporting unit goodwill was less than its book value  requiring a billion non cash charge to earnings 
as a result of these factors  regions reported a net loss from continuing operations of billion or per diluted common share in not included in this amount was an million after tax loss related to equifirst  which was accounted for as discontinued operations 
included in the net loss was a billion goodwill impairment charge per diluted share and million in after tax merger related expenses per diluted share 
net income from continuing operations was per diluted share in  including a reduction of per diluted share related to million in after tax merger related expenses 
excluding merger related charges and goodwill impairment charges  annual earnings per common share from continuing operations was in as compared to in significant drivers of results include a much higher provision for loan losses and lower net interest income 
offsetting to some extent was regions solid fee income  including revenues from morgan keegan 
see table gaap to non gaap reconciliation for additional details 
as a result of the large earnings impact from the goodwill impairment charge  return measures  such as return on average tangible common stockholders equity  were not meaningful for on a generally accepted accounting principles gaap basis 
excluding the goodwill impairment charge  merger related charges and discontinued operations  return on average tangible common stockholders equity was percent for the year ended december   compared to percent for the year ended december  see table gaap to non gaap reconciliation for additional details and table financial highlights for additional ratios 
net interest income was billion in compared to billion in the decrease resulted in a lower net interest margin  which declined to percent during compared to percent in the net interest margin was negatively impacted primarily by factors directly and indirectly associated with the erosion of economic and industry conditions in late and throughout these factors include an unfavorable variation in the general level and shape of the yield curve exemplified by recent federal reserve interest rate reductions  intensification of price based competition for retail deposits  disintermediation of deposits into other non bank asset classes  rate increases for new debt issuances  and rising non performing asset levels 
moreover  the costs of maintenance of the company s liquidity profile in the presently stressed environment including maintaining prudent levels of excess liquidity have increased  further pressuring the net interest margin 
net charge offs totaled billion  or percent of average loans in compared to million  or percent of average loans in the increased loss rate resulted from deteriorating economic conditions during  especially related to the housing sector 
more specifically  approximately million of net charges offs were related to non performing loan dispositions or transfers to held for sale as compared to none in non performing assets increased million between december  and december  to billion  primarily due to continued weakness in the company s residential homebuilder portfolio  which began experiencing significant pressure toward the end of this pressure was due to a combination of declining residential real estate demand and resulting price and collateral value declines in certain of the company s markets  particularly areas of florida and atlanta  georgia 
condominium loans  mainly in florida  
table of contents were also a driver of the increase in non performing assets 
regions aggressively managed its exposure to its most stressed assets by selling or transferring to held for sale approximately billion of non performing loans during non performing assets held for sale totaled million at december  the provision for loan losses is used to maintain the allowance for loan losses at a level that  in management s judgment  is adequate to cover losses inherent in the loan portfolio as of the balance sheet date 
during  the provision for loan losses from continuing operations increased to billion compared to million in the provision rose due to weakening conditions in the broad economy and  more specifically  in the residential housing market  which most significantly impacted management s estimate of inherent losses in the residential homebuilder  condominium  home equity and residential mortgage portfolios 
as a result of the increased provision for loan losses and despite significantly higher loan charge offs  which increased billion  regions increased its allowance for credit losses to percent of total loans  net of unearned income  at december   as compared to percent at december  non interest income from continuing operations excluding securities gains losses totaled billion or percent of total revenue fully taxable equivalent basis in compared to billion or percent in  and continued to reflect regions diversified revenue stream 
the increase in non interest income is primarily due to strong brokerage  investment banking and capital markets income  especially during the first half of the year 
as the year progressed  however  brokerage and equity capital markets revenue streams were affected by declining market activity and transaction flow  resulting from increasing overall market uncertainty 
despite the difficulties  was a solid year for morgan keegan  recording net income of million as compared to million in in addition  regions recorded million of other income due to proceeds from a sale of class b common stock ownership interest in visa 
offsetting these increases were decreases in service charges on deposit accounts and trust income in non interest expense from continuing operations totaled billion in compared to billion in  impacted most significantly by the billion non cash goodwill impairment charge 
also reflected in non interest expenses were merger charges totaling million and million in and  respectively 
merger costs consist mainly of personnel expenses  the cost of integrating amsouth systems with those of regions and the consolidation of branches 
excluding the goodwill impairment and merger related expenses  non interest expense increased million or percent in compared to the largest drivers were mortgage servicing rights impairment charges  increased professional fees due to litigation  occupancy expense reflecting continued investment in the branch franchise  and higher other real estate owned expenses driven by losses related to the continued decline in the housing market 
in addition  non interest expense was impacted by a million loss on the early extinguishment of debt related to the redemption of subordinated notes and million in write downs on the investment in two morgan keegan mutual funds 
see table non interest expense including non gaap reconciliation for further details 
salaries and employee benefit cost were lower in  mainly due to merger related cost savings 
regions commission driven revenues such as brokerage  investment banking and mortgage did  and will continue to  impact the salaries and employee benefits component of non interest expense in direct correlation to revenue trends 
in december  regions reached an agreement with the internal revenue service irs that resolves a broad range of tax issues for regions and all of its predecessor companies 
the agreement covers and effectively closes regions federal tax returns for tax years through as a result of the agreement  regions recorded a million earnings benefit from a reduction in the company s income tax expense during the fourth quarter of refer to income taxes under operating results for additional details 
total loans increased by percent in  driven mainly by commercial and industrial and home equity lending 
partially offsetting this growth  demand for residential related real estate lending softened during the year  primarily a result of the challenging economic backdrop and industry wide tightening of credit 
deposits declined percent in as compared to  driven by a decline in foreign deposits utilized as an alternative to overnight funding 
customer deposits  defined as total deposits less deposits used for corporate 
table of contents treasury purposes eg overnight funding sources  increased by percent during  driven largely by higher certificate of deposit balances 
table gaap to non gaap reconciliation presents computations of earnings and certain other financial measures excluding discontinued operations  merger and goodwill impairment charges non gaap 
merger and goodwill impairment charges are included in financial results presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles gaap 
regions believes the exclusion of merger and goodwill impairment charges in expressing earnings and certain other financial measures  including earnings per common share from continuing operations  excluding merger and goodwill impairment charges and return on average tangible equity  excluding discontinued operations  merger and goodwill impairment charges provides a meaningful base for period to period and company to company comparisons  which management believes will assist investors in analyzing the operating results of the company and predicting future performance 
these non gaap financial measures are also used by management to assess the performance of regions business  because management does not consider merger and goodwill impairment charges to be relevant to ongoing operating results 
management and the board of directors utilize these non gaap financial measures for the following purposes preparation of regions operating budgets calculation of performance based annual incentive bonuses for certain executives calculation of performance based multi year incentive bonuses for certain executives monthly financial performance reporting  including segment reporting monthly close out flash reporting of consolidated results management only presentations to investors of company performance regions believes that presenting these non gaap financial measures will permit investors to assess the performance of the company on the same basis as that applied by management and the board of directors 
non gaap financial measures have inherent limitations  are not required to be uniformly applied and are not audited 
to mitigate these limitations  regions has policies in place to address expenses that qualify as merger and goodwill impairment charges and procedures in place to approve and segregate merger and goodwill impairment charges from other normal operating expenses to ensure that the company s operating results are properly reflected for period to period comparisons 
although these non gaap financial measures are frequently used by stakeholders in the evaluation of a company  they have limitations as analytical tools  and should not be considered in isolation  or as a substitute for analyses of results as reported under gaap 
in particular  a measure of earnings that excludes merger and goodwill impairment charges does not represent the amount that effectively accrues directly to stockholders ie  merger and goodwill impairment charges are a reduction to earnings and stockholders equity

table of contents critical accounting policies in preparing financial information  management is required to make significant estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  income and expenses for the periods shown 
the accounting principles followed by regions and the methods of applying these principles conform with accounting principles generally accepted in the us and general banking practices 
estimates and assumptions most significant to regions are related primarily to the allowance for credit losses  intangible assets goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets  mortgage servicing rights and income taxes  and are summarized in the following discussion and in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
allowance for credit losses the allowance for credit losses allowance consists of the allowance for loan losses and the reserve for unfunded credit commitments 
management evaluates the adequacy of the allowance based on the total of these two components 
determining the appropriate level of the allowance is one of the most critical and complex accounting estimates for any financial institution 
accounting guidance requires regions to make a number of estimates related to the level of credit losses inherent in the portfolio at year end 
a full discussion of these estimates and other factors can be found in the allowance for credit losses section within the discussion of credit risk  found in a later section of this report 
the allowance is sensitive to a variety of internal factors  such as portfolio performance and assigned risk ratings  and external factors  such as interest rates and the general health of the economy 
management reviews scenarios having different assumptions for variables that could result in increases or decreases in probable inherent credit losses  which may materially impact regions estimate of the allowance and results of operations 
management s estimate of the allowance for commercial products  which includes commercial  construction  and commercial real estate mortgage loans  could be affected by risk rating upgrades or downgrades as a result of fluctuations in the general economy  developments within a particular industry  or changes in an individual s credit due to factors particular to that credit  such as competition  management or business performance 
a reasonably possible scenario would be an estimated percent migration of lower risk related pass credits to criticized status  which could increase estimated inherent losses by approximately million 
a percent reduction in the level of criticized credits is also a reasonably possible scenario  which would result in an approximate million decrease in estimated inherent losses 
for residential real estate mortgages  home equity lending and other consumer related loans  individual products are reviewed on a group basis or in loan pools eg  residential real estate mortgage pools 
the total of all residential loans  including residential real estate mortgages and home equity lending  represents approximately percent of total loans 
losses can be affected by such factors as collateral value  loss severity  the economy and other uncontrollable factors 
a basis point increase or decrease in the estimated loss rates on these residential loans would change estimated inherent losses by approximately million 
the loss analysis related to other consumer related loans includes reasonably possible scenarios with estimated loss rates increasing or decreasing by basis points  which would increase or decrease the related estimated inherent losses by approximately million  respectively 
additionally  the estimate of the allowance for credit losses for the entire portfolio may change due to modifications in the mix and level of loan balances outstanding and general economic conditions  as evidenced by changes in real estate demand and values  interest rates  unemployment or employment rates  bankruptcy filings  used car prices  real estate demand and values  and the effects of weather and natural disasters such as droughts and hurricanes 
while no one factor is dominant  each has the ability to result in actual loan losses that could differ materially from originally estimated amounts 
the pro forma inherent loss analysis presented above demonstrates the sensitivity of the allowance to key assumptions 
this sensitivity analysis does not reflect an expected outcome 

table of contents intangible assets regions intangible assets consist primarily of the excess of cost over the fair value of net assets of acquired businesses goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets primarily core deposit intangibles 
regions goodwill is tested for impairment annually or more often if events or circumstances indicate impairment may exist 
adverse changes in the economic environment  declining operations of the business unit  or other factors could result in a decline in the estimated implied fair value of goodwill 
if the estimated implied fair value is less than the carrying amount  a loss would be recognized to reduce the carrying amount to the estimated implied fair value 
for purposes of testing goodwill for impairment  regions uses both the income and market approaches to value its reporting units 
the income approach consists of discounting long term projected future cash flows  which are derived from internal forecasts and economic expectations for the respective reporting units 
the projected future cash flows are discounted using cost of capital metrics for regions peer group or a build up approach such as the capital asset pricing model 
the market approach applies a market multiple  based on observed purchase transactions and or price earnings of regions peer group for each reporting unit  to the last twelve months of net income or earnings before income taxes  depreciation and amortization or price tangible book value 
one of the critical assumptions in determining the estimated fair value of a reporting unit is the discount rate  which can change based on changes in the business climate 
a decrease in the discount rate by one percentage point would result in an increase in fair value of approximately billion for all reporting units and an increase of approximately million for the general banking treasury reporting unit 
an increase in the discount rate by one percentage point would result in a decline in fair value of approximately million for all reporting units and a decline of approximately million for the general banking treasury reporting unit 
a variation in the discount rate may result in or from changes to other assumptions used in determining the estimated fair value  these changes could materially affect the sensitivities described above 
if the estimated implied fair value of goodwill is less than the carrying amount  a loss would be recognized to reduce the carrying amount to the estimated implied fair value 
the changes or factors mentioned above  when or if they occur  could be material to regions operating results for any particular reporting period 
as previously discussed  regions incurred a billion impairment charge in see note summary of significant accounting policies to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 
other identifiable intangible assets  primarily core deposit intangibles  are reviewed at least annually for events or circumstances which could impact the recoverability of the intangible asset  such as loss of core deposits  increased competition or adverse changes in the economy 
to the extent an other identifiable intangible asset is deemed unrecoverable  an impairment loss would be recorded to reduce the carrying amount 
these events or circumstances  when they occur  could be material to regions operating results for any particular reporting period  the potential impact cannot be reasonably estimated 
mortgage servicing rights for purposes of evaluating mortgage servicing impairment  regions must estimate the fair value of its mortgage servicing rights msrs 
msrs do not trade in an active market with readily observable market prices 
although sales of msrs do occur  the exact terms and conditions of sales may not be readily available 
specific characteristics of the underlying loans greatly impact the value of the related msrs 
as a result  regions stratifies its mortgage servicing portfolio on the basis of certain risk characteristics  including loan type and contractual note rate  and values its msrs using discounted cash flow modeling techniques 
these techniques require management to make estimates regarding future net servicing cash flows  taking into consideration historical and forecasted mortgage loan prepayment rates and discount rates 
changes in interest rates  prepayment speeds or other factors could result in impairment of the servicing asset and a charge against earnings 
based on a hypothetical sensitivity analysis  regions estimates that a reduction in primary mortgage market rates of basis points and basis points would reduce the december  fair value of msrs by 
table of contents approximately percent million and percent million  respectively 
conversely  basis point and basis point increases in these rates would increase the december  fair value of msrs by approximately percent million and percent million  respectively 
the pro forma fair value analysis presented above demonstrates the sensitivity of fair values to hypothetical changes in primary mortgage rates 
this sensitivity analysis does not reflect an expected outcome

income taxes accrued taxes represent the estimated amount payable to or receivable from taxing jurisdictions  either currently or in the future  and are reported  on a net basis  as a component of other assets in the consolidated balance sheets 
the calculation of regions income tax expense is complex and requires the use of many estimates and judgments in its determination 
management s determination of the realization of the net deferred tax asset is based upon management s judgment of various future events and uncertainties  including the timing and amount of future income earned by certain subsidiaries and the implementation of various tax plans to maximize realization of the deferred tax asset 
management believes that the subsidiaries will generate sufficient operating earnings to realize the deferred tax benefits 
from time to time  for certain business plans enacted by regions  management bases the estimates of related tax liabilities on its belief that future events will validate management s current assumptions regarding the ultimate outcome of tax related exposures 
while regions has obtained the opinion of advisors that the anticipated tax treatment of these transactions should prevail and has assessed the relative merits and risks of the appropriate tax treatment  examination of regions income tax returns  changes in tax law and regulatory guidance may impact the tax treatment of these transactions and resulting provisions for income taxes

net interest income and margin net interest income interest income less interest expense is regions principal source of income and is one of the most important elements of regions ability to meet its overall performance goals 
net interest income on a taxable equivalent basis decreased percent to billion in from billion in  resulting in a decline in the net interest margin  which declined from percent in to percent in the net interest margin was impacted substantially by developments in the aforementioned economic and operating environment in more specifically  changes in market interest rates and the yield curve were closely connected with economic developments during the year 
regions balance sheet was in an asset sensitive position during  meaning that decreases in interest rates cause contraction in the company s net interest margin 
as such  falling rates in led to an unfavorable change in the yield curve and  in turn  the net interest margin 
however  changes in the level and shape of the yield curve were largely symptomatic of the pervasive disturbances in the financial markets and the broader economy  observed particularly during the second half of 
table of contents amidst the many complex implications of this recent financial turmoil  these forces intensified price based competition in the retail deposit space increasing the interest cost of maintaining and acquiring deposits  raised wholesale funding costs increasing the costs of liquidity management  prompted a disintermediation out of conventional bank deposits into other asset classes  and increased the level of non performing assets 
during  the federal reserve lowered the federal funds rate by approximately basis points in response to mounting concerns of a recession 
as indicated above  regions was asset sensitive at year end and anticipates this positioning to continue to pressure net interest income during table consolidated average daily balances and yield rate analysis including discontinued operations presents a detail of net interest income  on a fully taxable equivalent basis  the net interest margin  and the net interest spread

table of contents comparing to  interest earning asset yields were lower  decreasing basis points on average 
while interest bearing liability rates were also lower  declining by basis points  this improvement in funding cost was not enough to offset the drop in interest earning asset yields 
as a result  the net average interest rate spread declined basis points to percent in as compared to percent in changes in market interest rates  an increase in competition for deposits  and regions asset sensitive position were the most significant drivers of changes in regions rates and yields 
in terms of changes in the broad interest rate environment  the federal funds rate  which is an influential driver of loan and deposit pricing on the shorter end of the yield curve  declined approximately basis points during  ending the year at approximately percent 
longer term rates experienced similar movement  with the yield on the benchmark year us treasury note declining basis points over the same period and ending the year at percent 
both interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities were impacted by these changes in market rates 
more specifically  these rate declines immediately impact loan yields in a downward fashion  since approximately percent of the company s interest earning assets are tied to the prime rate or london inter bank offered rate libor 
the mix of interest earning assets can also affect the interest rate spread 
regions primary types of interest earning assets are loans and investment securities 
certain types of interest earning assets have historically generated larger spreads 
for example  loans typically generate larger spreads than other assets  such as securities  federal funds sold or securities purchased under agreement to resell 
however  in  the spread on loans decreased due to lower interest rates and higher levels of assets on non accrual status 
average interest earning assets at december  totaled billion  an increase of billion as compared to the prior year 
on an average basis  interest earning assets were percent higher in the proportion of average interest earning assets to average total assets measures the effectiveness of management s efforts to invest available funds into the most profitable interest earning vehicles and represented percent and percent for and  respectively 
average loans as a percentage of average interest earning assets were percent in and the categories which comprise interest earning assets are shown in table consolidated average daily balances and yield rate analysis including discontinued operations 
another significant factor affecting the net interest margin is the percentage of interest earning assets funded by interest bearing liabilities 
funding for regions interest earning assets comes from interest bearing and non interest bearing sources 
the percentage of average interest earning assets funded by average interest bearing liabilities was percent in and percent in table volume and yield rate variances provides additional information with which to analyze the changes in net interest income 
provision for loan losses the provision for loan losses is used to maintain the allowance for loan losses at a level that in management s judgment is adequate to cover losses inherent in the portfolio at the balance sheet date 
during  the provision for loan losses from continuing operations was billion and net charge offs were billion 
this compares to a provision for loan losses from continuing operations of million and net charge offs of million in net charge offs as a percent of average loans were percent in compared to percent in the significant increase in the provision and net charge offs in is related to losses on non performing loans sold or moved to held for sale 
in  these losses accounted for million of the increase in the net charge offs 
the remaining increase in the loan loss provision was primarily due to an increase in management s estimate of losses inherent in its residential homebuilder  condominium  home equity and residential mortgage portfolios  all of which are closely tied to the housing market slowdown 
losses were also impacted by the disposition of problem loans  as well as generally weaker economic conditions in the broader economy 
during the second half of the year  regions provision was billion compared to net charge offs of billion  as the loan portfolio experienced increasing incremental stress

non interest income the following section contains a discussion of non interest income from continuing operations and excludes equifirst  which is reported separately as discontinued operations in the consolidated statements of operations 
non interest income represents fees and income derived from sources other than interest earning assets 
table non interest income provides a detail of the components of non interest income 
non interest income totaled billion in compared to billion in the increase in non interest income is primarily due to stronger brokerage results  mainly from fixed income and equity markets at morgan keegan  as well as an increase in income derived from insurance commissions and fees and bank owned life insurance 
in addition  non interest income was aided by a million increase in securities gains 
offsetting these increases  service charge income declined as a result of lower insufficient funds fees 
in addition  trust income decreased due to the disarray in the markets during the latter half of the year  which affected valuations of assets under management 
non interest income excluding securities transactions as a percent of total revenue on a fully taxable equivalent basis equaled percent in compared to percent in the increase is due mainly to lower total revenues in resulting from a decline in net interest income 
table non interest income year ended december in thousands service charges on deposit accounts brokerage  investment banking and capital markets trust department income mortgage income net securities gains losses insurance commissions and fees bank owned life insurance other miscellaneous income service charges on deposit accounts income from service charges on deposit accounts decreased percent to billion in from billion in this decline was the result of a decrease in consumer insufficient funds and overdraft fees  due to policy changes which were enacted to retain customers 
also  the company s new lifegreen checking accounts  which generated new account openings  had a lower associated fee structure 
brokerage  investment banking and capital markets and trust department income regions primary source of brokerage  investment banking  capital markets and trust revenue is its subsidiary  morgan keegan 
morgan keegan s revenues are predominantly recorded in the brokerage  investment banking  capital markets and trust income lines of the consolidated statements of operations  while a smaller portion is reported in other non interest income 
morgan keegan contributed billion in total revenues in and total brokerage  investment banking  and capital markets revenues increased percent to billion in from million in  reflecting stronger capital markets income 
despite the overall year over year increase in revenues  results for reflect the impact of the effective closure of credit markets and general upheaval in domestic and foreign 
table of contents markets 
in addition  private client revenues were influenced by a reluctance of retail investors to make investment decisions in the market  due to increasing unemployment  declining property values  and declining personal wealth 
as a result  brokerage  investment banking  and capital markets income began to decline during the latter part of higher revenues from morgan keegan s fixed income business offset this decrease to some extent  however  as institutional investors seeking safety invested heavily in municipal  mortgage backed  and treasury securities 
as of december   morgan keegan employed approximately  financial advisors 
customer and trust assets under management were approximately billion and billion  respectively  at year end compared to approximately billion and billion  respectively  at year end the reduction in assets under management is primarily driven by lower asset valuations from declining markets during the year 
revenues from the private client division  which were affected by market disarray  declined percent to million  or percent of morgan keegan s total revenue in compared to million or percent in fixed income capital markets revenues were up in  totaling million  as compared to million in  the result of higher trading volumes due to investors change in preference to safe haven investments  including treasuries and highly rated municipal securities 
equity markets revenue was solid early in  but increasingly gave way to financial market turmoil as the capital markets became more dislocated 
equity capital markets revenues totaled million in  compared to million in trust revenues increased percent to million in  driven higher by revenues generated from the negotiation of natural lease drilling rights on customer properties 
the asset management division produced million of revenue in compared to million in and was pressured by the decreasing value of managed assets during the year 
morgan keegan s pre tax income was negatively affected during by million in losses on investments in two open end mutual funds managed by morgan keegan 
these losses totaled million in the company  through morgan keegan  purchased fund shares in order to provide liquidity to the funds 
the carrying value of these investments  which is equal to their estimated market value  was approximately million as of december  professional fees  primarily legal costs  also increased at morgan keegan from million in to million in table morgan keegan details the components of morgan keegan s contribution to the company s revenue and earnings for the years ended december   and table morgan keegan revenue by division illustrates morgan keegan s revenues by division for the years ended december   and

although mortgage income was affected by the increasingly challenging mortgage industry environment see economic environment in regions banking markets later in this report which deteriorated throughout the year  mortgage income increased percent  from million in to million in due in part to the recognition of million in loan servicing value during the first quarter of related to the adoption of fas see note fair value of financial instruments to the consolidated financial statements for further detail 
falling mortgage interest rates in december  however  did produce a significant increase in refinancing activity during late and into

at december   regions servicing portfolio totaled billion and included  loans 
of this portfolio  billion were serviced for third parties 
at december   the servicing portfolio totaled billion  billion of which were serviced for third parties 
regions mortgage division  primarily through retail operations in its state footprint  originated mortgage loans totaling billion in compared to billion in the decrease is primarily related to lower demand and general stresses in the housing sector 
during the first quarter of  regions sold its non conforming mortgage origination subsidiary  equifirst  for an original sales price of approximately million and recorded an after tax gain of approximately million at the time of sale 
the sales price was subject to adjustment and was finalized during resulting in approximately million of additional after tax expense to regions 
see note discontinued operations to the consolidated financial statements for further detail 
during the third quarter of  regions also exited the wholesale warehouse lending business as a result of risk and return considerations 
in addition  regions sold approximately billion of its billion out of market mortgage servicing portfolio in  realizing a loss on the sale of approximately million 
net securities gains losses regions reported net gains of million from the sale of securities available for sale in  as compared to net losses of million in the net gains were primarily related to the sale of federal agency debentures and us treasury securities in the first quarter of insurance commissions and fees insurance commissions and fees increased percent to million in  compared to million in this increase is primarily due to increased revenues from the mid acquisition of miles finch and the acquisition of barksdale bonding and insurance  inc  which closed in early a general increase in commissions related to new business production and higher premiums were also a contributing factor in the year over year increase 
bank owned life insurance bank owned life insurance income increased percent to million in  compared to million in this increase is primarily due to additional purchases of bank owned life insurance policies totaling million in late and early other miscellaneous income other miscellaneous income decreased million  or percent  from million in to million in a significant driver of the decrease is due to a million decrease in gains on the sale of loans in and a million increase in losses related to write downs of low income housing investments 
in addition in  regions recognized a million gain on the termination of union planters hybrid debt and a million gain on disposal of residual interests in an acquired subsidiary 
also  in  regions recognized a million gain related to a sale of certain mutual funds 
offsetting these events was a million gain on the redemption of visa shares in

at december   regions had  employees compared to  at december  lower incentives driven by a deteriorating business environment in were also a factor 
regions provides employees who meet established employment requirements with a benefits package that includes k  pension  and medical  life and disability insurance plans 
new enrollment in the regions pension plan ended effective december  new enrollment in the legacy amsouth pension plan ended effective with the merger date  november  former amsouth employees enrolled as of november  continue to be active in the plan  but no additional participants will be added 
effective september   the two pension plans merged into one plan 
regions k plan includes a company match of eligible employee contributions 
at december   this match totaled percent of the eligible employee contribution up to six percent of compensation 
see note pension and other employee benefit plans to the consolidated financial statements for further details 
there are various incentive plans in place in many of regions lines of business that are tied to the performance levels of employees 
at morgan keegan  commissions and incentives are a key component of compensation  which is typical in the brokerage and investment banking industry 
in general  incentives are used to reward employees for selling products and services  for productivity improvements and for achievement of corporate financial goals 
these achievements are determined through a review of profitability versus risk management 
regions long term incentive plan provides for the granting of stock options  restricted stock  restricted stock units and performance shares 
see note share based payments to the consolidated financial statements for further information 
net occupancy expense net occupancy expense includes rents  depreciation and amortization  utilities  maintenance  insurance  taxes  and other expenses of premises occupied by regions and its affiliates 
occupancy expense increased million  or percent  in due primarily to new branches opened and rising price levels 
included in net occupancy expense were merger charges of million in and million in  reflecting costs to vacate leases due to the merger 
furniture and equipment expense furniture and equipment expense increased million to million in this increase is due primarily to the increased depreciation and maintenance expense associated with capital additions  including new branches opened in and included in furniture and equipment expense were merger charges of million in and million in professional fees professional fees are comprised of amounts related to legal  consulting and other professional fees 
professional fees increased million to million in included in professional fees during and were million and million  respectively  of merger related charges 
the increase is primarily due to higher legal expenses incurred at morgan keegan 
amortization of core deposit intangibles the premium paid for core deposits in an acquisition is considered to be an intangible asset that is amortized on an accelerated basis over its useful life 
as a result  amortization of core deposit intangibles decreased percent to million in compared to million in 
table of contents other real estate owned expense other real estate owned oreo expenses include the cost of adjusting foreclosed properties to fair value after these assets have been classified as oreo  as well as other costs to maintain the property 
oreo expense increased million to million in compared to million in  driven by steep valuation declines and losses on the sale of foreclosed properties resulting from continued decline of the housing market 
another contributing factor is increased costs related to operating and maintaining the foreclosed properties during the holding period 
despite regions aggressive and successful efforts to sell foreclosed properties  balances increased million to million in see note other real estate to the consolidated financial statements 
marketing marketing expense decreased million during  including a reduction of million of merger related charges  to million from million in in  marketing expense was higher due to post merger rebranding initiatives and marketing campaigns which ran to coincide with branch conversions  as well as customer communications associated with branch conversions and consolidations 
goodwill impairment regions incurred a billion non cash goodwill impairment charge as a result of a goodwill evaluation performed in the fourth quarter of this evaluation indicated the estimated implied fair value of the general banking treasury reporting unit s goodwill was less than its book value  therefore requiring the impairment charge

regions has recognized state tax benefits related to these legal entities of million in compared to million in management s determination of the realization of deferred tax assets is based upon management s judgment of various future events and uncertainties  including the timing  nature and amount of future income earned by certain subsidiaries  the level of taxable income in prior carryback years where carryback is permitted  and the implementation of various plans to maximize realization of deferred tax assets 
management believes that the subsidiaries will generate sufficient operating earnings to realize the deferred tax benefits 
however  management does not believe that it is more likely than not that all of its state net operating loss carryforwards will be realized 
accordingly  a valuation allowance has been established in the amount of million against such benefits in compared to million in regions and its subsidiaries file income tax returns in the united states us  as well as in various state jurisdictions 
as the successor of acquired taxpayers  regions is responsible for the resolution of audits from both federal and state taxing authorities 
the company is no longer subject to us federal income tax examinations for years before  which would include audits of acquired entities 
the company is no longer subject to state and local income tax examinations for years before certain states have proposed various adjustments to the company s previously filed tax returns 
management is currently evaluating those proposed adjustments and believes the company to be adequately reserved for any potential exposures 
during the third quarter of and first quarter of  the company made deposits with the irs to stop the accrual of interest on all of its federal uncertain tax positions 
in the first quarter of  the company settled a dispute with the irs related to certain leveraged lease transactions 
in addition  federal examinations for the and tax years were closed in the first quarter 
as a result  the company re designated a portion of the deposits as an additional statutory payment of tax and interest to the irs in the first quarter of in august of  the irs announced guidelines pursuant to which taxpayers could settle disputes relating to certain leveraged lease transactions 
the deadline for notifying the irs of a taxpayer s intent to participate in the settlement initiative was early october the company gave notice of the intent to participate in the settlement initiative in october and increased its reserves for interest on exposures related to leveraged lease transactions consistent with the settlement initiative guidelines as of september  net interest income was reduced million in accordance with financial accounting standards board staff position  accounting for a change or projected change in the timing of cash flows relating to income taxes generated by a leveraged lease transaction fas  to reflect the pre tax income impact of the leasing settlement 
in december of  the company reached an agreement with the irs appeals division on the federal tax treatment of a broad range of uncertain tax positions identified by the irs 
regions had previously established reserves for the uncertain tax positions 
the agreement resulted in a million earnings benefit from a reduction of the company s income tax expense in the fourth quarter of the agreement covers the federal tax returns of regions and its previous acquisitions  including union planters corporation and amsouth bancorporation  for tax years through and includes matters related to regions real estate investment structures and acceptance of the irs global settlement initiative on leasing transactions

balance sheet analysis at december   regions reported total assets of billion compared to billion at the end of  an increase of approximately billion or percent 
the balance sheet growth reflects an increase in loans outstanding  primarily commercial and industrial and home equity balances  as well as an increase in interest bearing deposits in other banks  primarily the federal reserve bank 
offsetting these growth drivers  regions assets were reduced by the goodwill impairment charge taken during the fourth quarter of loans average loans  net of unearned income  represented percent of average interest earning assets at december  lending at regions is generally organized along three functional lines commercial and industrial loans including financial and agricultural  real estate loans commercial mortgage and construction loans and consumer loans residential first mortgage  home equity  indirect and other consumer loans 
the composition of the portfolio by these major categories is presented in table loan portfolio 
regions manages loan growth with a focus on risk management and risk adjusted return on capital 
total loans  net of unearned income  increased at a relatively slow pace during a challenging economic environment  particularly in the real estate sector  was the primary factor leading to the modest growth 
regions is continuing to make credit available to consumers  small businesses and commercial companies as intended by treasury and the congress in establishing the government investment in banks see stockholders equity section found later in this report 
during the fourth quarter of  the government s investment of billion strengthened regions regulatory capital  which supported origination of approximately billion in new and renewed loans and lines  including unfunded commitments

commercial real estate commercial real estate loans consist of loans to operating businesses  loans for real estate development  and various other loans secured by real estate 
commercial real estate loans to operating businesses are for long term financing of land and buildings  and are repaid by cash flow generated by business operations 
these loans  sometimes referred to as owner occupied commercial real estate  are a subset of the commercial real estate category presented in table  and totaled approximately billion as of december  loans for real estate development are repaid through cash flow related to the operation  sale or refinance of the property 
these loans are made to finance income producing properties such as apartment buildings  office and industrial buildings  and retail shopping centers 
while loan production and pipeline activity declined in  the commercial real estate portfolio grew billion to billion in  largely attributable to a slow down in payoffs  draws on unfunded commitments  and transfers of construction lending to permanently financed commercial real estate 
regions focus in commercial real estate lending is to effectively manage its existing portfolio and to support those clients who have full relationships with the company 
in addition  regions considers new projects with sound sponsorship and fundamentals and which meet the company s standards for risk adjusted return on capital 
construction construction loans are loans to individuals  companies or developers used for the purchase or construction of a commercial property for which repayment will be generated by cash flows related to the operation  sale or refinance to permanent financing of the property 
a significant portion of regions real estate construction portfolio is comprised of residential product types land  single family and condominium loans within regions markets  and to a lesser degree retail and multi family projects 
typically  these loans are for construction projects that have been presold  preleased or otherwise have secured permanent financing as well as loans to real estate companies that have significant equity invested in each project 
during  outstanding construction balances declined billion to billion as a result of regions selling or transferring to held for sale many of these loans 
in addition  outstanding balances declined as construction projects were completed and converted from construction to commercial real estate loans and new construction originations declined 

table of contents during late  the residential homebuilder portfolio  which totaled billion as of december   came under significant stress 
in table loan portfolio  the majority of these loans are reported in the construction loan category  while a smaller portion is reported under the commercial real estate loan category 
the residential homebuilder portfolio is geographically concentrated in florida and north georgia 
regions realigned its organizational structure in january to enable some of the company s most experienced bankers to concentrate their efforts on management of this portfolio 
see the residential homebuilder portfolio table in the credit risk section later in this report for further detail on the residential homebuilder portfolio 
residential first mortgage residential first mortgage loans represent loans to consumers to finance a residence 
these loans are typically financed over a to year term and  in most cases  are extended to borrowers to finance their primary residence 
these loans experienced a billion decline to billion in demand for this type of lending slowed during as property values declined  new and used home sales reached historically low levels  and credit markets contracted in general 
however  due to declining mortgage rates  which became especially attractive late in and into early  refinancing activity increased substantially as began 
loans to consumers with weak credit history  generally called sub prime loans  became a cause for industry concern beginning in and the performance of these loans deteriorated significantly as progressed 
regions exposure to sub prime loans is insignificant  at approximately million at december   and continues to decline 
this is a product that regions does not currently originate 
the credit loss exposure related to these loans is addressed in management s periodic determination of the allowance for credit losses 
home equity home equity lending includes both home equity loans and lines of credit 
this type of lending  which is secured by a first or second mortgage on the borrower s residence  allows customers to borrow against the equity in their home 
real estate market values as of the time the loan or line is secured directly affect the amount of credit extended and  in addition  changes in these values impact the depth of potential losses 
during  home equity balances increased billion to billion  driven by a slowing of paydowns and an increase in lending to creditworthy customers 
the majority of regions home equity lending balances was originated through its branch network and the company has not purchased broker originated or other third party production 
however  home equity losses still increased significantly in  impacted by the unprecedented drop in real estate values coupled with a deteriorating economy 
the main source of stress has been in florida  where home values declined precipitously in and further  losses on relationships in florida where regions is in a second lien position have been especially high  much higher  in fact  than the remaining areas of regions geographic footprint 
indirect indirect lending  which is lending initiated through third party business partners  is largely comprised of loans made through automotive dealerships 
loans of this type decreased million  or percent  during largely due to the company s decision to exit certain lines of business 
regions continually rationalizes the risk reward characteristics of each of its lending lines and  as noted  ceased new originations within the indirect auto lending business in and the marine and recreational vehicle lending businesses in each of these portfolios is a declining element in the overall loan portfolio and will continue to reduce as loans are repaid 
losses within the indirect portfolio increased during the year primarily driven by economic conditions  including high gasoline prices and rising unemployment levels 
other consumer other consumer loans include direct consumer installment loans  overdrafts and other revolving credit  and educational loans 
other consumer loans decreased percent in to billion due to the sale or transfer to held for sale of student loans and a general contraction in credit markets 

table of contents loans held for sale at december   loans held for sale totaled billion  consisting of million of non performing commercial real estate and construction loans  million of residential real estate mortgage loans  and million of student loans 
at december   loans held for sale totaled million  consisting solely of residential real estate mortgage loans in the process of being sold to third parties 
during  in an effort to manage its exposure to non performing assets  regions made a strategic decision to intensify its efforts to sell certain portions of non performing loans 
during  the company sold or classified as loans held for sale billion of non performing loans through its efforts 
regions marks all loans to the lower of cost or market value at the time they are classified as held for sale and continues to evaluate valuation at each reporting period 
lower residential first origination volumes and tightening of the secondary market for residential mortgage production a result of the weakening housing market in somewhat offset the increase in loans held for sale resulting from the increased commercial sales activity described above

allowance for credit losses the allowance for credit losses represents management s estimate of credit losses inherent in both the loan portfolio and unfunded credit commitments as of the balance sheet date 
the allowance consists of two components the allowance for loans losses  which is recorded as a contra asset to loans  and the reserve for unfunded credit commitments  which is recorded in other liabilities

premises and equipment at december  increased million to billion compared to year end this increase primarily resulted from the continued investment in capital additions  including the opening of new branches during goodwill goodwill at december  totaled billion as compared to billion at december  the decrease was driven by a billion fourth quarter non cash impairment charge to the asset carrying value 
the impairment testing is performed on each of the company s reportable units on an annual basis  or more often if events or circumstances indicate that there may be impairment 
as of december   regions analysis indicated impairment for the general banking treasury reporting unit s goodwill  therefore resulting in the goodwill impairment charge 
the primary cause of the goodwill impairment in the general banking treasury reporting unit was the continued and significant decline in the estimated fair value of the unit 
this was evidenced by rapid deterioration in credit costs  continued compression of the net interest margin  cost of 
table of contents preferred stock investment by the us treasury and continued declines in the company s overall market capitalization  compounded by investor anxiety caused by the financial crises affecting the us banking system

mortgage servicing rights mortgage servicing rights at december  totaled million compared to million at december  a summary of mortgage servicing rights is presented in table mortgage servicing rights 
the balances shown represent the right to service mortgage loans that are owned by other investors and include original amounts capitalized  less accumulated amortization and a valuation allowance 
the carrying values of mortgage servicing rights are affected by various factors  including estimated prepayments of the underlying mortgages and market rates 
a significant change in prepayments of mortgages in the servicing portfolio or market rates for mortgage loans could result in significant changes in the valuation adjustments  thus creating potential volatility in the carrying amount of mortgage servicing rights 
the mortgage servicing rights valuation allowance increased by million in  primarily due to lower mortgage rates and corresponding increased estimated prepayment speeds 
during  the company sold mortgage servicing rights on approximately billion of gnma loans and recognized a loss of million  including transaction costs 
on december   mortgage servicing rights on approximately billion of loans in regions out of market servicing portfolio were sold at a million loss 
on january   regions made an election allowed by statement of financial accounting standards no

other assets other assets increased billion to billion as of december  this increase is primarily related to higher customer derivatives  a result of the low interest rate environment  as well as derivatives used by the company for hedging purposes 

table of contents deposits deposits are regions primary source of funds  providing funding for percent of average interest earning assets in and percent in table deposits details year over year deposits on a period ending basis 
total deposits as of year end decreased billion  or percent  compared to year end  driven lower mainly by reduced use of wholesale deposit sources used for overnight funding purposes 
more specifically  regions reduced its usage of foreign deposits which regions uses as a source of short term wholesale funding in  due to growth in customer deposits 
customer deposits  which are total deposits excluding deposits used for treasury management purposes as described above  increased by percent to billion on an ending basis during time deposits eg  certificates of deposit were the main source of growth  while non interest bearing demand and domestic money market balances also grew slightly 
increases in time deposits were offset by decreases in interest bearing transaction accounts and foreign money market accounts 
deposit disintermediation through a flight to quality  such as treasury securities  exerted pressure on bank deposits industry wide in furthermore  during the year  regions also experienced substantial pricing strain from both community banks and some larger competitors 
however  during the fourth quarter of  regions time deposits and money market accounts grew in response to customers desire to lock in rates in a falling rate environment

regions ability to compete in the deposit market depends heavily on the pricing of its deposits and how effectively the company meets customers needs 
regions employs various means to meet those needs and enhance competitiveness  such as providing a high level of customer service  competitive pricing and expanding the traditional branch network to provide convenient branch locations for its customers 
regions also services customers through providing centralized  high quality telephone banking services and alternative product delivery channels such as internet banking 
during  the banking industry experienced very high deposit pricing due to liquidity concerns  thereby accentuating pricing pressure on regions and the industry as a whole 

table of contents non interest bearing deposits remained relatively unchanged versus the prior year  increasing by million in movement of balances to interest bearing offerings  including regions money market accounts and time deposits  among other product types or investment alternatives was a factor in limiting growth 
non interest bearing deposits accounted for approximately percent of total deposits at year end as compared to percent at year end savings balances were also consistent with prior year as they increased million to billion  generally reflecting customers preference for higher paying accounts  including money market accounts 
interest bearing transaction accounts declined percent to billion due to pricing pressure from community banks as well as larger competitors

money market accounts were down most of the year  however  regions experienced a significant increase in the fourth quarter of as customers moved into money market accounts and time deposits to take advantage of higher rates 
also  foreign money market accounts decreased billion  or percent  to billion in included in customer time deposits are certificates of deposit and individual retirement accounts 
the balance of customer time deposits increased percent in to billion compared to billion in the increase was primarily due to customers demand for higher rate deposits 
customer time deposits accounted for percent of total deposits in compared to percent in total treasury deposits  which are used mainly for overnight funding purposes  decreased by billion during  due to the company s use of other funding sources  including increased customer based deposits and the additional funding provided through new governmental liquidity programs 
the company s choice of overnight funding sources is dependent on the company s particular funding needs and the relative attractiveness of each offering 
the sensitivity of regions deposit rates to changes in market interest rates is reflected in regions average interest rate paid on interest bearing deposits 
the rate paid on interest bearing deposits decreased to percent in from percent in this decrease is largely due to the significant decrease in market rates as evidenced by the federal funds rate in  somewhat offset by increased competitive pressures

risk factors for additional information 
bank regulatory capital requirements regions and regions bank are required to comply with capital adequacy standards established by banking regulatory agencies 
currently  there are two basic measures of capital adequacy a risk based measure and a leverage measure 
the risk based capital standards are designed to make regulatory capital requirements more sensitive to differences in credit risk profiles among banks and bank holding companies  to account for off balance sheet exposure and interest rate risk  and to minimize disincentives for holding liquid assets 
assets and off balance sheet items are assigned to broad risk categories  each with specified risk weighting factors 
the resulting capital ratios represent capital as a percentage of total risk weighted assets and off balance sheet items 
banking organizations that are considered to have excessive interest rate risk exposure are required to maintain higher levels of capital 
the minimum standard for the ratio of total capital to risk weighted assets is 
at least of that capital level must consist of common equity  undivided profits and non cumulative perpetual preferred stock  less goodwill and certain other intangibles tier capital 
the remainder tier capital may consist of a limited amount of other preferred stock  mandatory convertible securities  subordinated debt  and a limited amount of the allowance for loan losses 
the sum of tier capital and tier capital is total risk based capital or total capital 
the banking regulatory agencies also have adopted regulations that supplement the risk based guidelines to include a minimum ratio of of tier capital to average assets less goodwill the leverage ratio 
depending upon the risk profile of the institution and other factors  the regulatory agencies may require a leverage ratio of to above the minimum level 
in october   president bush signed into law the emergency economic stabilization act of in response to the financial crises affecting the banking system 
the us treasury and banking regulators are implementing a number of programs under this legislation to address capital and liquidity issues in the banking system 
under the u 
s 
treasury s cpp  regions received billion through its issuance of preferred stock and a warrant for common stock to the us treasury 
the preferred stock issuance and the related warrant both qualify for tier capital and added approximately basis points to that measure 
the fair value allocation of the billion between the preferred shares and the warrant resulted in billion allocated to the preferred shares and million allocated to the warrant 
both the preferred securities and the warrant will be accounted for as components of regions regulatory tier capital

total capital at regions bank also has an important effect on the amount of fdic insurance premiums paid 
institutions not considered well capitalized can be subject to higher rates for fdic insurance 
other requirements are needed in addition to total capital in order for a company to be considered well capitalized 
see note regulatory capital requirements and restrictions to the consolidated financial statements for further details

table of contents making adjustments to the system that determines what rate a bank pays the fdic 
under this and additional proposals  the assessment rate schedule will be raised beginning on january  also during  regions one time assessment credit will expire 
based on certain assumptions regarding various assessment criteria  including future deposit levels  regions estimates fdic premiums will increase within a range of million to million pre tax during assessment rates  however  are subject to change by the fdic throughout the year 
off balance sheet arrangements regions primary off balance sheet arrangements are financial instruments issued in connection with lending activities 
these arrangements include commitments to extend credit  standby letters of credit and commercial letters of credit 
a meaningful component of the off balance sheet arrangements are facilities supporting variable rate demand notes vrdns  including certain standby letters of credit and standby bond purchase agreements also referred to as liquidity facilities 
fundings under these letters of credit are largely related to redemption requests in money market mutual funds that invested in vrdns as a result of the increased volatility in the financial markets 
late in  disruption in market liquidity supporting vrdns resulted in significant frequency of failed remarketing of vrdns 
as of december   regions had funded million in letters of credit backing vrdn s 
an additional million had been tendered but not yet funded 
the remaining unfunded vrdn letters of credit portfolio is approximately billion net of participations

these trusts meet the definition of a variable interest entity of which regions is not the primary beneficiary  the trusts only assets are junior subordinated debentures issued by regions  which were acquired by the trusts using the proceeds from the issuance of the trust preferred securities and common stock 
the junior subordinated debentures are included in long term borrowings and regions equity interests in the business trusts are included in other assets 
for regulatory reporting and capital adequacy purposes  the federal reserve board has indicated that such trust preferred securities will continue to constitute tier capital until further notice 
also  regions periodically invests in various limited partnerships that sponsor affordable housing projects  which are funded through a combination of debt and equity with equity typically comprising to of the total partnership capital 
regions maximum exposure to loss as of december  was million  which included million in unfunded commitments to the partnerships 
additionally  regions has short term construction loans or letters of credit with the partnerships totaling million as of december  the portion of the letters of credit which was funded was million at december  the funded portion is included with loans on the consolidated balance sheets

effects of inflation the majority of assets and liabilities of a financial institution are monetary in nature  therefore  a financial institution differs greatly from most commercial and industrial companies  which have significant investments in fixed assets or inventories that are greatly impacted by inflation 
however  inflation does have an important impact on the growth of total assets in the banking industry and the resulting need to increase equity capital at higher than normal rates in order to maintain an appropriate equity to assets ratio 
inflation also affects other expenses that tend to rise during periods of general inflation 
management believes the most significant potential impact of inflation on financial results is a direct result of regions ability to react to changes in interest rates 
management attempts to maintain an essentially balanced 
table of contents position between rate sensitive assets and liabilities in order to minimize the impact of interest rate fluctuations on net interest income 
this goal  however  can be difficult to completely achieve in times of rapidly changing rate structure  such as that experienced in effects of deflation a period of deflation would affect all industries  including financial institutions 
potentially  deflation could lead to lower profits  higher unemployment and deterioration in overall economic conditions 
in addition  deflation could depress economic activity and impair bank earnings through increasing the value of debt while decreasing the value of collateral for loans 
if the economy experienced a severe period of deflation  then it could depress loan demand  impair the ability of borrowers to repay loans and sharply reduce bank earnings 
management believes the most significant potential impact of deflation on financial results is a direct result of regions ability to maintain a high amount of capital to cushion against future losses 
in addition  the company s risk management can utilize certain tools to help the bank maintain its balance sheet strength even if a deflationary scenario were to develop 
risk management risk identification and risk management are key elements in the overall management of regions 
management believes the primary risk exposures are interest rate and associated prepayment risk  liquidity risk  market and other brokerage related risk associated with morgan keegan  counterparty risk  and credit risk 
interest rate risk is the risk to net interest income due to the impact of movements in interest rates 
prepayment risk is the risk that borrowers may repay their loans or securities earlier than at their stated maturities 
liquidity risk relates to regions ability to fund present and future obligations 
the company  through morgan keegan  is also subject to various market related risks associated with its brokerage and market related activities 
counterparty risk represents the risk that a counterparty will not comply with its contractual obligations 
credit risk represents the possibility that borrowers may not be able to repay loans 
external factors beyond management s control may result in losses despite risk management efforts 
management follows a formal policy to evaluate and document the key risks facing each line of business  how those risks can be controlled or mitigated  and how management monitors the controls to ensure that they are effective 
regions internal audit division performs ongoing  independent reviews of the risk management process and assures the adequacy of documentation 
the results of these reviews are reported regularly to the audit committee of the board of directors 
the company also has a risk committee that assists the board of directors in overseeing the company s policies  procedures and practices relating to market  regulatory and operational risk 
some of the more significant processes used to manage and control these and other risks are described in the remainder of this report 
interest rate risk regions primary market risk is interest rate risk  including uncertainty with respect to absolute interest rate levels as well as uncertainty with respect to relative interest rate levels  which is impacted by both the shape and the slope of the various yield curves that affect the financial products and services that the company offers 
to quantify this risk  regions measures the change in its net interest income in various interest rate scenarios compared to a base case scenario 
net interest income sensitivity is a useful short term indicator of regions interest rate risk 
sensitivity measurement financial simulation models are regions primary tools used to measure interest rate exposure 
using a wide range of sophisticated simulation techniques provides management with extensive information on the potential impact to net interest income caused by changes in interest rates 
models are structured to simulate cash flows and accrual characteristics of regions balance sheet 
assumptions are made 
table of contents about the direction and volatility of interest rates  the slope of the yield curve  and the changing composition of the balance sheet that result from both strategic plans and from customer behavior 
among the assumptions are expectations of balance sheet growth and composition  the pricing and maturity characteristics of existing business and the characteristics of future business 
interest rate related risks are expressly considered  such as pricing spreads  the lag time in pricing administered rate accounts  prepayments and other option risks 
regions considers these factors  as well as the degree of certainty or uncertainty surrounding their future behavior 
financial derivative instruments are used in hedging the values of selected assets and liabilities against changes in interest rates 
the effect of these hedges is included in the simulations of net interest income 
the primary objective of asset liability management at regions is to coordinate balance sheet composition with interest rate risk management to sustain reasonable and stable net interest income throughout various interest rate cycles 
a standard set of alternate interest rate scenarios is compared to the results of the base case scenario to determine the extent of potential fluctuations and to establish exposure limits 
the standard set of interest rate scenarios includes the traditional instantaneous parallel rate shifts of plus and minus and basis points 
however  for the purposes of analyzing the impact of further downward movement in the rate structure  in the down scenarios  whenever prevailing rates are less than basis points eg the federal funds target rate is currently at to basis points rates have been assumed to be zero 
accordingly  the company has determined that the down scenario that is typically calculated is not a meaningful measure 
refer to table interest rate sensitivity for more information 
in addition to instantaneous scenarios  regions employs simulations of gradual interest rate movements that may more realistically mimic potential interest rate movements 
the gradual scenarios include curve steepening  flattening and parallel movements of various magnitudes phased in over a six month period 
exposure to interest rate movements as of december   regions was asset sensitive in positioning to both gradual and instantaneous rate shifts 
table interest rate sensitivity demonstrates the estimated potential effects that gradual over six months beginning at december  and  respectively and instantaneous parallel interest rate shifts would have on regions net interest income 
table interest rate sensitivity estimated change in net interest income december gradual change in interest rates basis points basis points basis points basis points na estimated change in net interest income december instantaneous change in interest rates basis points basis points basis points basis points na derivatives regions uses financial derivative instruments for management of interest rate sensitivity 
the asset and liability committee alco  which consists of members of regions senior management team  in its oversight role for the management of interest rate sensitivity  approves the use of derivatives in balance sheet hedging strategies 
the most common derivatives regions employs are forward rate contracts  eurodollar futures 
table of contents contracts  interest rate swaps  options on interest rate swaps  interest rate caps and floors  and forward sale commitments 
derivatives are also used to hedge the risks associated with customer derivatives  which include interest rate  credit and foreign exchange risks 
forward rate contracts are commitments to buy or sell financial instruments at a future date at a specified price or yield 
a eurodollar futures contract is a future on a three month eurodollar deposit 
eurodollar futures contracts subject regions to market risk associated with changes in interest rates 
because futures contracts are cash settled daily  there is minimal credit risk associated with eurodollar futures 
interest rate swaps are contractual agreements typically entered into to exchange fixed for variable or vice versa streams of interest payments 
the notional principal is not exchanged but is used as a reference for the size of interest settlements 
interest rate options are contracts that allow the buyer to purchase or sell a financial instrument at a predetermined price and time 
forward sale commitments are contractual obligations to sell market instruments at a future date for an already agreed upon price 
foreign currency contracts involve the exchange of one currency for another on a specified date and at a specified rate 
these contracts are executed on behalf of the company s customers and are used to manage fluctuations in foreign exchange rates 
the company is subject to the credit risk that another party will fail to perform 
regions has made use of interest rate swaps to effectively convert a portion of its fixed rate funding position to a variable rate position and  in some cases  to effectively convert a portion of its variable rate loan portfolio to fixed rate 
regions also uses derivatives to manage interest rate and pricing risk associated with its mortgage origination business 
in the period of time that elapses between the origination and sale of mortgage loans  changes in interest rates have the potential to cause a decline in the value of the loans in this held for sale portfolio 
futures contracts and forward sale commitments are used to protect the value of the loan pipeline and loans held for sale from changes in interest rates and pricing 
regions manages the credit risk of these instruments in much the same way as it manages credit risk of the loan portfolio by establishing credit limits for each counterparty and through collateral agreements for dealer transactions 
for non dealer transactions  the need for collateral is evaluated on an individual transaction basis and is primarily dependent on the financial strength of the counterparty 
credit risk is also reduced significantly by entering into legally enforceable master netting agreements 
when there is more than one transaction with a counterparty and there is a legally enforceable master netting agreement in place  the exposure represents the net of the gain and loss positions with and collateral received from and or posted to that counterparty 
the credit risk section in this report contains more information on the management of credit risk 
regions also uses derivatives to meet the needs of its customers 
interest rate swaps  interest rate options and foreign exchange forwards are the most common derivatives sold to customers 
other derivatives instruments with similar characteristics are used to hedge the market risk and minimize volatility associated with this portfolio 
instruments used to service customers are held in the trading account  with changes in value recorded in the consolidated statements of operations 
the primary objective of regions hedging strategies is to mitigate the impact of interest rate changes  from an economic perspective  on net interest income and the net present value of its balance sheet 
the overall effectiveness of these hedging strategies is subject to market conditions  the quality of regions execution  the accuracy of its valuation assumptions  counterparty credit risk and changes in interest rates 
as a result  regions hedging strategies may be ineffective in mitigating the impact of interest rate changes on its earnings 
see note derivative financial instruments and hedging activities to the consolidated financial statements for a tabular summary of regions year end derivatives positions 
on january  regions made an election allowed by fas and began accounting for mortgage servicing rights at fair market value with any changes to fair value being recorded within mortgage income 
also  in early  regions entered into derivative transactions to mitigate the impact of market value fluctuations related to mortgage servicing rights 

table of contents prepayment risk regions  like most financial institutions  is subject to changing prepayment speeds on mortgage related assets under different interest rate environments 
prepayment risk is a significant risk to earnings and specifically to net interest income 
for example  mortgage loans and other financial assets may be prepaid by a debtor  so that the debtor may refinance its obligations at lower rates 
as loans and other financial assets prepay in a falling rate environment  regions must reinvest these funds in lower yielding assets 
prepayments of assets carrying higher rates reduce regions interest income and overall asset yields 
conversely  in a rising rate environment  these assets will prepay at a slower rate  resulting in opportunity cost by not having the cash flow to reinvest at higher rates 
regions greatest exposure to prepayment risks primarily rests in its mortgage backed securities portfolio  the mortgage fixed rate loan portfolio and the mortgage servicing asset  all of which tend to be sensitive to interest rate movements 
prepayments on mortgage backed securities slowed during the latter half of due to various factors associated with the housing crisis 
tighter lending standards  decreased home prices  and uncertainty surrounding the economic environment created slower prepayment speeds on mortgage backed securities 
regions also has prepayment risk that would be reflected in non interest income in the form of servicing income on loans sold 
in  prepayment rates were lower compared to recent years  however the company anticipates the rate of prepayments to increase in  driven primarily by the high refinancing activity the company has experienced since the start of the year 
regions actively monitors prepayment exposure as part of its overall net interest income forecasting and interest rate risk management 
liquidity risk liquidity is an important factor in the financial condition of regions and affects regions ability to meet the borrowing needs and deposit withdrawal requirements of its customers 
table contractual obligations summarizes regions contractual cash obligations at december  regions intends to fund contractual obligations primarily through cash generated from normal operations 
in addition to these obligations  regions has obligations related to potential litigation contingencies see note commitments  contingencies and guarantees to the consolidated financial statements 
assets  consisting principally of loans and securities  are funded by customer deposits  purchased funds  borrowed funds and stockholders equity 
regions goal in liquidity management is to satisfy the cash flow requirements of depositors and borrowers  while at the same time meeting its cash flow needs 
this is accomplished through the active management of both the asset and liability sides of the balance sheet 
the liquidity position of regions is monitored on a daily basis by regions treasury division 
in addition  the alco  which consists of members of regions senior management team  reviews liquidity on a regular basis and approves any changes in strategy that are necessary as a result of asset liability composition or anticipated cash flow changes 
management also compares regions liquidity position to established corporate liquidity policies on a monthly basis 
table contractual obligations payments due by period less than year years years more than years total in thousands long term borrowings time deposits lease obligations purchase obligations other 
table of contents the challenges of the current market environment demonstrate the importance of having and using various sources of liquidity to satisfy the company s funding requirements 
in  the financial industry was presented with unprecedented challenges 
those challenges included but were not limited to government assisted transactions  failure of major wall street firms  government bailouts  and government guided transactions 
all of these events contributed to severely disrupted short term money markets 
the us treasury introduced several programs in the fall of to aid in the liquidity normally generated in these markets 
taf was introduced in late  but expanded in size and duration in the securities portfolio is one of regions primary sources of liquidity 
maturities of securities provide a constant flow of funds available for cash needs see table relative contractual maturities and weighted average yields for securities 
maturities in the loan portfolio also provide a steady flow of funds see table selected loan maturities 
at december   commercial loans  real estate construction loans and commercial real estate mortgage loans with an aggregate balance of billion  as well as securities of million  were due to mature in one year or less 
additional funds are provided from payments on consumer loans and one to four family residential first mortgage loans 
in addition  liquidity needs can be met by the borrowing of funds in state and national money markets 
historically  regions liquidity has been enhanced by a relatively stable customer deposit base 
while this deposit base is significant in size  during most of  deposit disintermediation through a flight to quality  such as treasury securities  and increased pricing competition from community banks and some large competitors pressured overall customer deposit balances 
however  during the fourth quarter of  regions customer deposit base grew substantially in response to competitive offers and customers desire to lock in rates in the falling rate environment  as well as the introduction of new consumer and business checking products 
regions financing arrangement with the fhlb adds additional flexibility in managing its liquidity position 
the maximum amount that could be borrowed under the current borrowing agreement is approximately billion see note long term borrowings to the consolidated financial statements 
however  the actual borrowing capacity is contingent on the amount of collateral pledged to the fhlb 
at december   approximately billion of first mortgage loans on one to four family dwellings and home equity lines of credit held by regions bank and its subsidiaries were pledged to secure borrowings from the fhlb 
investment in fhlb stock is required in relation to the level of outstanding borrowings 
regions held million in fhlb stock at december  as of december   regions borrowings from the fhlb totaled billion 
the fhlb has been and is expected to continue to be a reliable and economical source of funding 
as mentioned previously in the long term borrowings section of this report  regions has on file with the sec  a shelf registration statement  which allows for the issuance of an indeterminate amount of various debt and or equity securities and does not have a limit on the amount of securities that can be issued 
as of december   regions bank had issued the maximum amount of billion under its previously approved bank note program 
in july  the board of directors approved a new bank note program that allows regions bank to issue up to billion aggregate principal amount of bank notes that can be outstanding at any one time 
notes issued under the new program may be senior notes with maturities of from days to years and subordinated notes with maturities of from years to years 
this program had not been drawn upon as of december  the issuance of additional bank notes could provide a significant source of liquidity and funding to meet future needs 
investor demand for bank notes had ceased in the current market environment 
however  the new tlgp recently enacted by the fdic  which is discussed later in this section  has reopened this market due to the government s guarantee backing and has to some extent renewed optimism that this platform will reopen investor demand for unguaranteed issuances 
in particular  regions issued  from the billion bank note program described above  billion in guaranteed bank notes during the fourth quarter of through the tlgp 
the company has remaining capacity under the tlgp to issue up to an additional billion 
at year end  based on assets available for collateral as of this date  regions can borrow an additional billion with terms of less than days  or billion with terms of greater than days  from the federal 
table of contents reserve bank through its discount window and or the taf program 
as of december   regions had outstanding through the taf  billion at a rate of percent that matured in january days  billion at a rate of percent that also matured in january days  and billion at a rate of percent that matures at the end of february days 
after the january taf borrowings matured  regions rebid on taf funds to maintain excess reserve balances to meet potential liquidity needs 
the taf borrowings continue to provide the opportunity to carry excess liquidity at very low rates 
future fundings under commitments to extend credit would increase regions borrowing capacity under these programs 
in october  the fdic announced its tlgp to strengthen confidence and encourage liquidity in the banking system by guaranteeing newly issued senior unsecured debt of banks  thrifts  and certain holding companies  and by providing full coverage of non interest bearing deposit transaction accounts  regardless of dollar amount 
regions issued billion of qualifying senior debt securities covered by the tlgp in december  and has remaining capacity under the program to issue up to an additional billion

morgan keegan maintains certain lines of credit with unaffiliated banks to manage liquidity in the ordinary course of business 
see note short term borrowings to the consolidated financial statements for further details 
if regions is unable to maintain or renew its financing arrangements  obtain funding in the capital markets on reasonable terms or experiences a decrease in earnings  it may be required to slow or reduce the growth of the assets on its balance sheet  which may adversely impact its earnings 
brokerage and market making activity risk morgan keegan s business activities  including its securities inventory positions and securities held for investment  expose it to market risk 
morgan keegan trades for its own account in corporate and tax exempt securities and us government agency and government sponsored securities 
most of these transactions are entered into to facilitate the execution of customers orders to buy or sell these securities 
in addition  it trades certain equity securities in order to make a market in these securities 
morgan keegan s trading activities require the commitment of capital 
all principal transactions place the subsidiary s capital at risk 
profits and losses are dependent upon the skills of employees and market fluctuations 
in order to mitigate the risks of carrying inventory and as part of other normal brokerage activities  morgan keegan assumes short positions on securities 
in the normal course of business  morgan keegan enters into underwriting and forward and future commitments 
at december   the contract amounts of futures contracts were thousand to purchase and million to sell us government and municipal securities 
morgan keegan typically settles its position by entering into equal but opposite contracts and  as such  the contract amounts do not necessarily represent future cash requirements 
settlement of the transactions relating to such commitments is not expected to have a material effect on regions consolidated financial position 
transactions involving future settlement give rise to market risk  which represents the potential loss that can be caused by a change in the market value of a particular financial instrument 
regions exposure to market risk is determined by a number of factors  including the size  composition and diversification of positions held  the absolute and relative levels of interest rates  and market volatility 
additionally  in the normal course of business  morgan keegan enters into transactions for delayed delivery  to be announced securities  which are recorded in trading account assets on the consolidated balance sheets at fair value 
risks arise from the possible inability of counterparties to meet the terms of their contracts and from unfavorable changes in interest rates or the market values of the securities underlying the instruments 
the credit 
table of contents risk associated with these contracts is typically limited to the cost of replacing all contracts on which morgan keegan has recorded an unrealized gain 
for exchange traded contracts  the clearing organization acts as the counterparty to specific transactions and  therefore  bears the risk of delivery to and from counterparties 
interest rate risk at morgan keegan arises from the exposure of holding interest sensitive financial instruments such as government  corporate and municipal bonds  and certain preferred equities 
morgan keegan manages its exposure to interest rate risk by setting and monitoring limits and  where feasible  entering into offsetting positions in securities with similar interest rate risk characteristics 
securities inventories  recorded in trading account assets on the consolidated balance sheets  are marked to market and  accordingly  there are no unrecorded gains or losses in value 
while a significant portion of the securities inventories have contractual maturities in excess of five years  these inventories  on average  turn over in excess of twelve times per year 
accordingly  the exposure to interest rate risk inherent in morgan keegan s securities inventories is less than that of similar financial instruments held by firms in other industries 
morgan keegan s equity securities inventories are exposed to risk of loss in the event of unfavorable price movements 
also  morgan keegan is subject to credit risk arising from non performance by trading counterparties  customers and issuers of debt securities owned 
this risk is managed by imposing and monitoring position limits  monitoring trading counterparties  reviewing security concentrations  holding and marking to market collateral  and conducting business through clearing organizations that guarantee performance 
morgan keegan regularly participates in the trading of some derivative securities for its customers  however  this activity does not involve morgan keegan acquiring a position or commitment in these products and this trading is not a significant portion of morgan keegan s business 
to manage trading risks arising from interest rate and equity price risks  regions uses a value at risk var model to measure the potential fair value the company could lose on its trading positions given a specified statistical confidence level and time to liquidate time horizon 
the end of period var was approximately million as of december  and approximately million as of december  maximum daily var utilization during was million and average daily var during the same period was million 
morgan keegan has been an underwriter and dealer in auction rate securities 
morgan keegan has been contacted by securities regulators and is working on a plan to provide liquidity to customers holding these instruments 
other broker dealers have entered into settlements with regulators under which the broker dealers agreed to repurchase certain of the securities at par 
as of december   approximately million of auction rate securities were subject to repurchase  and morgan keegan held approximately million of auction rate securities on the balance sheet 
during  morgan keegan recorded valuation adjustments related to those auction rate securities 
such valuation adjustments were not significant 
on june   the illinois secretary of state  securities department isd issued a notice of hearing alleging that morgan keegan failed to properly disclose limitations on transferability of shares of certain mutual funds advised by an affiliate of morgan keegan 
on january   morgan keegan and the isd entered into a settlement agreement requiring that morgan keegan make a payment of fifty thousand dollars to an investor education fund  reimburse investigation costs of thirty thousand dollars  waive and or refund contingent deferred sales charges to certain investors  implement certain disclosures  training and compliance measures  and report to isd certain investor complaints for a period of one year 
on january  the isd dismissed the notice with prejudice 
counterparty risk regions manages and monitors its exposure to other financial institutions  also known as counterparty exposure  on an ongoing basis 
the objective is to ensure that regions appropriately identifies and reacts to risks associated with counterparties in a timely manner 
this exposure may be direct or indirect exposure that could create legal  reputational or financial risk to the company 

table of contents counterparty exposure may result from a variety of transaction types and may include exposure to commercial banks  savings and loans  insurance companies  broker dealers  institutions that provide credit enhancements  and corporate debt issuers 
because transactions with a counterparty may be generated in one or more departments  credit limits are established for use by various areas of the company including treasury  capital markets  finance  the mortgage division and lines of business 
to manage counterparty risk  regions has a centralized approach to approval  management and monitoring of exposure 
to that end  regions has a dedicated counterparty credit group and credit officer  as well as a documented counterparty credit policy 
exposures to counterparties are regularly aggregated across departments and reported to senior management 
credit risk regions objective regarding credit risk is to maintain a high quality credit portfolio that provides for stable credit costs with acceptable volatility through an economic cycle 
management process regions employs a credit risk management process with defined policies  accountability and regular reporting to manage credit risk in the loan portfolio 
credit risk management is guided by credit policies that provide for a consistent and prudent approach to underwriting and approvals of credits 
within the credit policy department  procedures exist that elevate the approval requirements as credits become larger and more complex 
generally  consumer credits and smaller commercial credits are centrally underwritten based on custom credit matrices and policies that are modified as appropriate 
larger commercial and commercial real estate transactions are individually underwritten  risk rated  approved and monitored 
responsibility and accountability for adherence to underwriting policies and accurate risk ratings lies in the lines of business 
for consumer and small business portfolios  the risk management process focuses on managing customers who become delinquent in their payments and managing performance of the credit scorecards  which are periodically adjusted based on credit performance 
commercial business units are responsible for underwriting new business and  on an ongoing basis  monitoring the credit of their portfolios  including a complete review of the borrower semi annually or more frequently as needed 
to ensure problem commercial credits are identified on a timely basis  several specific portfolio reviews occur each quarter to assess the larger adversely rated credits for accrual status and  if necessary  to ensure such individual credits are transferred to regions special assets group  which specializes in managing distressed credit exposures 
separate and independent commercial credit and consumer credit risk management organizational groups exist  which report to the chief credit officer 
these organizational units partner with the business line to assist in the processes described above  including the review and approval of new business and ongoing assessments of existing loans in the portfolio 
independent commercial and consumer credit risk management provides for more accurate risk ratings and the timely identification of problem credits  as well as oversight for the chief credit officer on conditions and trends in the credit portfolios 
credit quality and trends in the loan portfolio are measured and monitored regularly and detailed reports  by product  business unit and geography  are reviewed by line of business personnel and the chief credit officer 
the chief credit officer reviews summaries of these credit reports with executive management and the board of directors 
finally  the credit review department provides ongoing independent oversight of the credit portfolios to ensure policies are followed  credits are properly risk rated and that key credit control processes are functioning as intended 

table of contents risk characteristics of the loan portfolio in order to assess the risk characteristics of the loan portfolio  it is appropriate to consider the current us economic environment and that of regions primary banking markets  as well as risk factors within the major categories of loans 
economic environment in regions banking markets the largest factor influencing the credit performance of regions loan portfolio is the overall economic environment in the us and the primary markets in which it operates 
the us economy is in the midst of an official recession that began in december overall output of goods and services is currently experiencing the sharpest decline since the early s 
consumer spending  two thirds of all recorded spending  has been hobbled by declining inflation adjusted income  low additional credit capacity  historically high required monthly payments  a negative employment outlook and historically low consumer confidence 
the business sector is struggling with weak domestic and foreign demand  and underutilized operating capacity 
as evolved  the outlook shifted rapidly from general concern about inflation to general concern about deflation 
the latter  if sustained  can lead to continuing declines in overall demand  and a deepening  prolonged recession 
however  current and pending additional monetary and fiscal policy packages could prevent a period of sustained deflation 
housing continued to weaken considerably throughout and the risk of a deepening recession is significantly increasing due to the negative impact housing is having on the overall economy 
within the regions footprint  the housing slowdown has been modest in some areas and severe in florida and selected other geographical areas  including atlanta  georgia 
florida has experienced above average price increases and construction activity in recent years 
the slowdown is evident in many areas  including steeply declining sales and prices  and high levels of excess unsold inventory on the market 
management anticipates that the housing industry will remain weak throughout housing related issues have been exacerbated by a sharp increase in unemployment across regions footprint  particularly in florida 
portfolio characteristics regions has a well diversified loan portfolio  in terms of product type  collateral and geography 
at december   commercial and industrial loans represented percent of total loans  net of unearned income  commercial real estate loans represented percent  construction loans were percent  residential first mortgage loans totaled percent and consumer loans  largely home equity lending  comprised the remaining percent 
commercial and industrial the commercial and industrial loan portfolio totaled billion at year end and primarily consists of loans to middle market commercial customers doing business in regions geographic footprint 
loans in this portfolio are generally underwritten individually and usually secured with the assets of the company and or the personal guarantee of the business owners 
net charge offs on commercial and industrial loans were percent of average commercial loans in compared to percent in regions expects that losses on these types of loans will continue to be at elevated levels during commercial real estate the commercial real estate portfolio totaled billion at year end and includes various loan types 
a large portion is owner occupied loans to businesses for long term financing of land and buildings 
these loans are generally underwritten and managed in the commercial business line 
regions attempts to minimize risk on owner occupied properties by requiring collateral values that exceed the loan amount  adequate cash flow to service the debt  and  in many cases  the personal guarantees of principals of the borrowers 
another large component of commercial real estate loans is loans to real estate developers and investors for the financing of land or buildings  where the repayment is generated from the sale of the real estate or income 
table of contents generated by the real estate property 
net charge offs on commercial real estate loans rose substantially  from percent in to percent in in reaction to the dramatic slowdown in demand for real estate properties and an associated drop in property valuations 
losses on sales or transfers to held for sale of non performing commercial real estate loans also contributed to the year over year increase in net charge offs 
in addition  the implications of a recession further pressured borrowers and contributed to higher losses 
regions expects that losses on these types of loans will continue to be at elevated levels during construction construction loans are primarily extensions of credit to real estate developers or investors where repayment is dependent on the sale of real estate or income generated from the real estate collateral 
a construction loan may also be made to a commercial business for the development of land or construction of a building where the repayment is usually derived from revenues generated from the business of the borrower eg  the sale or refinance of completed properties 
these loans are generally underwritten and managed by a specialized real estate group that also manages loan disbursements during the construction process 
as of december   real estate construction loans were billion 
most construction credits were to finance shopping centers  apartment complexes  condominiums  commercial buildings and residential property development 
overall losses in the construction portfolio increased to percent in as compared to percent in the loss rate reflects the company s aggressive efforts to dispose of non performing loans within the construction portfolio 
included in the construction loan category are loans to residential homebuilders 
the chart and table that follow provide details related to this residential homebuilder portfolio  which totaled billion at december  further details about this portfolio are also provided in the balance sheet analysis section  found earlier in this report 
credit quality of the construction portfolio is sensitive to risks associated with construction loans such as cost overruns  project completion risk  general contractor credit risk  environmental and other hazard risks  and market risks associated with the sale or rental of completed properties 
while losses within this portfolio were influenced by stresses described previously above  the most significant driver of losses was the severe decline in demand for residential real estate 
portfolio stresses are expected to continue throughout and  accordingly  losses on real estate construction loans are expected to continue at elevated levels

loans of this type are generally smaller in size and are geographically dispersed throughout regions market areas  with some guaranteed by government agencies or private mortgage insurers 
losses on the residential loan portfolio depend  to a large degree  on the level of interest rates  the unemployment rate  economic conditions and collateral values 
during  losses on single family residences totaled percent  basis points higher than in the previous year  primarily driven by declining property values and other influential economic factors  such as the unemployment rate  which deteriorated substantially as the year progressed 
deterioration of the company s residential first mortgage portfolio was most apparent in florida  where property valuations declined significantly and unemployment rose at a rapid pace 
regions expects losses on loans of this type to continue to increase during  further driven by continued rising unemployment and the continued housing slowdown throughout the us  including areas within regions operating footprint 
home equity this portfolio contains home equity loans and lines of credit totaling billion as of year end substantially all of this portfolio was originated through regions branch network 
as a percentage of outstanding home equity loans and lines  losses increased in to percent from percent in the deteriorating economic environment as described above  particularly with respect to housing  caused the significant increase in loss rate 
florida real estate markets have been particularly affected 
slightly more than one third of regions home equity portfolio is located in florida and has suffered losses reflective of the falling property values and demand in that geography 
regions has been proactive in its management of its home equity and residential first mortgage portfolios  focusing heavily on loss mitigation efforts  including providing comprehensive workout solutions to borrowers 
evidence of these efforts is reflected in the balance of these lines and loans classified as troubled debt restructurings tdrs  which grew substantially in see note loans to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion

these portfolios will continue to be impacted by rising unemployment  among other factors  which regions believes will remain elevated in the company expects losses to increase during because of these factors 
allowance for credit losses the allowance for credit losses represents management s estimate of credit losses inherent in the portfolio as of year end 
the allowance for credit losses consists of two components the allowance for loan losses and the reserve for unfunded credit commitments 
management s assessment of the adequacy of the allowance for credit losses is based on a combination of both of these components 
regions determines its allowance for credit losses in accordance with regulatory guidance  statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting by creditors for impairment of a loan fas and statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for contingencies fas 
binding unfunded credit commitments include items such as letters of credit  financial guarantees and binding unfunded loan commitments 
at december   the allowance for credit losses totaled billion or percent of total loans  net of unearned income compared to billion or percent at year end the increase in the allowance for credit loss ratio reflects management s estimate of the level of inherent losses in the portfolio  which management believes increased during due to a slowing economy and a weakening housing market 
the increase in non performing assets  driven largely by residential homebuilder and condominium loans  was a key determining dynamic in the assessment of inherent losses and  as a result  was an important factor in determining the allowance level 
deterioration of the company s home equity and residential first mortgage portfolios  especially florida based credits  was also a factor 
non performing assets increased from million at december  to billion at december  excluding loans held for sale  non performing assets increased million to billion at december  net charge offs as a percentage of average loans were percent and percent in and  respectively 
the majority of the year over year increase in net charge offs relates to the residential homebuilder portfolio  which is discussed earlier in this report  and the disposition of non performing loans 
during  a total of billion in non performing loans were sold or designated as held for sale with associated charge offs of approximately million 
net charge offs on home equity credits were also a driver of the increase  rising to percent in versus percent in losses from florida based credits were particularly high  as property valuations in certain markets continued to experience ongoing deterioration 
these loans and lines represent approximately billion of regions total home equity portfolio at december  of that balance  approximately billion represents first liens  second liens  which total billion  were the main source of losses

table of contents the company has taken a number of measures to aggressively manage the portfolios and mitigate losses  particularly in the more problematic portfolios  including the residential homebuilder portfolio  a subset of the commercial real estate and construction loan portfolios 
significant action in the management of the home equity portfolio has also been taken 
a home equity portfolio evaluation was completed during  which provided detailed property level information to assist in workout strategies 
also  the company has a strong customer assistance program in place  designed to educate customers about their loans and  as necessary  discuss options and solutions 
as a result of the unfavorable trends in credit quality previously described  including the expectation of a challenging economy and rising non performing asset levels driven largely by deterioration in the company s residential homebuilder and condominium portfolios  management expects that net loan charge offs will continue at an elevated level during the year ended december  reflecting the difficult credit environment as described above  the provision for loan losses rose significantly during  totaling billion  as compared to million in the previous year 
details regarding the allowance for credit losses  including an analysis of activity from the previous year s total  are included in table allowance for credit losses

also  refer to table allocation of the allowance for loan losses for details pertaining to management s allocation of the allowance for loan losses to each loan category 
allowance process factors considered by management in determining the adequacy of the allowance include  but are not limited to detailed reviews of individual loans  historical and current trends in gross and net loan charge offs for the various portfolio segments evaluated  the company s policies relating to delinquent loans and charge offs  the level of the allowance in relation to total loans and to historical loss levels  levels and trends in non performing and past due loans  collateral values of properties securing loans  the composition of the loan portfolio  including unfunded credit commitments  and management s analysis of current economic conditions 
various departments  including credit review  commercial and consumer credit risk management  collections  and special assets are involved in the credit risk management process to assess the accuracy of risk ratings  the quality of the portfolio and the estimation of inherent credit losses in the loan portfolio 
this comprehensive process also assists in the prompt identification of problem credits 
for the majority of the loan portfolio  management uses information from its ongoing review processes to stratify the loan portfolio into pools sharing common risk characteristics 
loans that share common risk characteristics are assigned a portion of the allowance for credit losses based on the assessment process described above 
credit exposures are categorized by type and assigned estimated amounts of inherent loss based on several factors  including current and historical loss experience for each pool and management s judgment of current economic conditions and their expected impact on credit performance 
loans deemed to be impaired include non accrual loans  excluding consumer loans  and tdrs 
impaired loans  excluding consumer loans  with outstanding balances greater than million are evaluated individually 
for these loans  regions measures the level of impairment based on the present value of the estimated projected cash flows  the estimated value of the collateral or  if available  the observable market price 
for consumer tdrs  regions measures the level of impairment based on pools of loans stratified by common risk characteristics 
if current valuations are lower than the current book balance of the credit  the negative differences are reviewed for possible charge off 
in instances where management determines that a charge off is 
table of contents not appropriate  a fas specific reserve is established for the individual loan in question 
that specific reserve is incorporated as a part of the overall allowance for credit losses 
the recorded investment in impaired loans was  million at december  and million at december  the allowance allocated to impaired loans  excluding tdrs  totaled million and million at december  and  respectively 
loans that were characterized as tdrs totaled million and million at december  and  respectively  and the allowance allocated to tdrs at december  and totaled million and zero  respectively 
the average amount of impaired loans was  million during and million during no material amount of interest income was recognized on impaired loans for the years ended december   and management considers the current level of allowance for credit losses adequate to absorb losses inherent in the loan portfolio and unfunded commitments 
management s determination of the adequacy of the allowance for credit losses  which is based on the factors and risk identification procedures previously discussed  requires the use of judgments and estimations that may change in the future 
changes in the factors used by management to determine the adequacy of the allowance or the availability of new information could cause the allowance for credit losses to be increased or decreased in future periods 
in addition  bank regulatory agencies  as part of their examination process  may require changes in the level of the allowance based on their judgments and estimates

drivers of the increase include higher year end loan outstandings in the commercial and industrial and commercial real estate sectors  combined with higher reserve allocation rates for all three loan portfolios 
the higher allocation rates are reflective of increased loan losses and adverse quality migration within the portfolio  both of which resulted primarily from the economic recession and the prolonged housing slump 
the increased allowance for consumer products relates primarily to home equity lending  where year to year outstandings have increased and a higher reserve allocation rate has been applied 
the increased allocation rate is reflective of increased loan losses and deteriorating delinquency trends which have been caused by deterioration in the housing markets  falling home equity values  and rising unemployment
