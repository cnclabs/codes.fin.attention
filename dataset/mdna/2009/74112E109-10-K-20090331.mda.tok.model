item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation 
overview we are a life sciences company focused on the development and commercialization of a novel  enabling  platform technology called pressure cycling technology pct 
pct uses cycles of hydrostatic pressure between ambient and ultra high levels up to  psi and greater to control bio molecular interactions 
our pressure cycling technology uses internally developed instrumentation that is capable of cycling pressure between ambient and ultra high levels at controlled temperatures to rapidly and repeatedly control the interactions of bio molecules 
our instrument  the barocycler  and our internally developed consumables product line  which includes pulse pressure used to lyse samples for extraction tubes as well as application specific kits  which include consumable products and reagents  together make up the pct sample preparation system pct sps 
we have experienced negative cash flows from operations with respect to our pressure cycling technology business since our inception 
as of december   we had a total cash balance of approximately  during we took a number of cost reduction measures  including a comprehensive restructuring program to significantly reduce costs  centralize core operations  and refocus our business strategy in specific areas where our products have found significant market acceptance 
the restructuring program included a reduction in personnel of eight full time employees of the workforce  reduction in travel and meeting attendance for all personnel  continued reduction in investor relations activities  decreases in the base salary of most of our employees and all of our executive officers  a shutdown of our r d facility in rockville  md  a consolidation of our r d activities in massachusetts  and delay of several research and development and marketing programs 
we believe that these initiatives will significantly decrease our rate of cash utilization  from just under million per quarter in to an average of just under  per quarter during we also believe that these actions  taken together with the proceeds we received from our million equity financing completed in february  will enable us to extend our cash resources into the second quarter of our pressure cycling technology employs a unique approach that we believe has the potential for broad applications in a number of established and emerging life sciences areas  including sample preparation for genomic  proteomic  and small molecule studies  pathogen inactivation  protein purification  control of chemical enzymatic reactions  and immunodiagnostics 
since we began operations as pressure biosciences in february  we have focused substantially all of our research and development and commercialization efforts on sample preparation for genomic  proteomic  and small molecule studies 
our business strategy is to commercialize pressure cycling technology in the area of sample preparation for genomic  proteomic  and small molecule studies sample preparation 
we also plan to pursue the further development and commercialization of pct in other life sciences applications  which could include working with various strategic partners that have greater scientific  and regulatory  expertise in the respective applications than we do 
we plan to focus primarily on the application of pct enhanced protein digestion for the mass spectrometry market and the advantages of pct in this market  and the use of pct in biomarker discovery  soil and plant biology  counter bio terror and tissue pathology applications 
to support our current strategy  our primary focus is the execution of our commercialization plan for pct in sample preparation 
we remain focused on projects that we feel represent near term revenue opportunities 
if we are successful commercializing our technology in the sample preparation market  we believe that our financial results will be positively affected by a combination of the revenue from the sale  lease  and rental of the barocycler instruments  the sale of other pct equipment  such as the pct shredder  and by the recurring revenue streams that we hope to realize from the sale of the single use pulse tubes  pct dependent kits  and extended service contracts on our instrumentation 
we believe the recurring revenue streams that could be generated from our instruments in the field is a very important component of our future financial success 
therefore  we believe that it is important for us to continue to focus on increasing the number of installed barocyclers in the field 
to this end  we have offered our prospective customers the opportunity to lease or rent the barocycler instruments  and in some cases we have engaged in short term reagent rental agreements 
under a reagent rental agreement we provide the customer with a barocycler instrument in exchange for a minimum purchase commitment of consumable products 
while these arrangements do not provide us with the immediate revenue of a sale  they do serve to expand the utilization of pct and they provide a stream of revenue in the form of rental payments and consumable purchases 
we define sales  leases  and rentals of barocycler instruments as revenue generating installations 
we also derive revenues from small business innovation research sbir grants awarded to us by the national institutes of health 
these types of grants allow us to bill the federal agency for work that we are planning to perform as part of the development  and commercialization  of our technology 
additionally  if our work in sbir phase i grants is successful  then we expect to apply for larger nih sbir phase ii grants 
to date we have been awarded two national institutes of health nih small business innovation research sbir phase i grants and one sbir phase ii grant 
both of our phase i grants have been completed 
the data on one of the phase i grants was the basis for the submission  and subsequent award  of our phase ii award of approximately  the phase ii grant is for work in the area of the use of pct to extract protein biomarkers  sub cellular molecular complexes  and organelles  with the expectation that these studies will ultimately lead to the release of a new  commercially available pct based system  with validated protocols  end user kits  and other consumables intended for the extraction of clinically important protein biomarkers  sub cellular molecular complexes  and organelles 
in february  we completed a private placement  pursuant to which we sold an aggregate of  shares of series a convertible preferred stock  together with warrants  resulting in aggregate gross proceeds to us of  we believe we have sufficient cash resources to fund normal operations into the second quarter of due to the restructuring measures we have undertaken and the  we received in connection with our february private placement 
we believe we will need substantial additional capital to fund our current operations beyond the second quarter of if we are able to obtain additional capital or otherwise increase our revenues  we may increase spending in specific research and development applications and engineering projects and may hire additional sales personnel or invest in targeted marketing programs 
in the event that we are unable to obtain financing on acceptable terms  or at all  we may be required to limit or cease our operations  pursue a plan to sell our operating assets  or otherwise modify our business strategy  which could materially harm our future business prospects 
results of operations years ended december  as compared to revenue we had total revenue of  in the year ended december  as compared to  in the prior year 
pct products  services  other 
revenue from the sale of pct products and services was  in as compared to  in this increase in revenue in was driven primarily by the installation of a total of barocycler instruments during as compared to during  and an increase in sales of consumable products and extended service contracts in compared to although the number of instruments that we installed more than doubled in as compared to  the increase in revenue was not as significant 
this decrease in revenue per instrument installed is due to the fact that twelve of the instruments that we installed during were sold to our foreign distribution partners at discounted prices 
additionally  ten of our installations were made pursuant to lease and rental agreements 
during four of our installations were made under lease and rental agreements 
when we install instrumentation under lease or rental agreements  we record the revenue over the life of the agreement  generally months or months 
we expect the number of units installed will continue to increase in future periods as we continue to gain commercial awareness of our technology  although we may experience some delays in customer purchases due to current economic conditions in the united states and globally 
we also expect that some portion of future installations will be for the smaller  lower priced  barocycler nep model and some will be placed under lease or short term rental agreements 
therefore  we expect that the average revenue per installation may continue to fluctuate from period to period as we continue to drive our installed base and commercialize pct 
we also expect that as we continue to expand the installed base of barocycler instruments in the field  we will realize increasing revenue from the sale of consumable products and extended service contracts 
in the short term  these recurring revenue streams may continue to fluctuate from period to period 
grant revenue 
during  we recorded  of grant revenue as compared to  in this decrease in grant revenue was due to a shift in resources from grant related activities to other research and development projects when the remaining portion of the phase i grant was completed in the second quarter of the revenue was earned in connection with our research and development efforts related to the completion of our sbir phase i grant and the commencement of our sbir phase ii grant in august we expect that revenue related to the sbir phase ii grant will increase in  relative to the amount earned in  as we continue to increase our efforts on this important project under an existing grant award 
the amount of grant revenue that we recognize in any given period is dependent upon the level of resources we devote to grant related work in the period under existing grant awards 
cost of pct products and services the cost of pct products and services was  for the year ended december   compared to  in this increase in cost of pct products and services was primarily due to our increase in sales of barocycler units 
costs of pct products and services as a percentage of revenue increased from in to for this increase in overall cost of goods sold as a percentage of revenue is due to the fact that we sold barocycler instruments to our foreign distributors at discounted prices during additionally  our gross margins during were higher than expected due to the sale of several prototype nep barocycler instruments during the period 
these prototype instruments had been expensed  through the research and development line in the consolidated statement of operations  as they were built  therefore there was no cost of product sales recognized in connection with the sale of these units 
we believe that our cost of pct products and services will improve as a percentage of revenue as we continue to install more instruments  and sell more consumable products  such as pulse tubes and proteosolve kits 
however  we expect our gross margin may fluctuate from period to period as we continue to sell  lease  or rent a varying mix of barocycler instrumentation and consumable products 
research and development research and development expenditures decreased to  during from  in this decrease was primarily due to the delay of several engineering projects during this reduction in project spending and a reduction in the total number of employees in our research and development function are steps that were taken as part of our overall cost cutting programs that we implemented during research and development expense included  and  of non cash  stock based compensation expense related to statement of financial accounting standards sfas r share based payment sfas r in and  respectively 
selling and marketing selling and marketing expenses increased to  in from  for the year ended december  this increase in selling and marketing expense was primarily the result of our increase in the size of our domestic sales force in early  the addition of our vice president of sales in february  and the continued emphasis on strategic marketing programs 
in the middle of  we reduced our sales force from seven full time sales directors to three and in late we further reduced our sales force to two full time directors  as we implemented a full restructuring program to further reduce our rate of cash utilization 
despite these reductions in our sales force  we more than doubled the number of barocycler instruments that we installed as compared to selling and marketing expense included  and  of non cash  stock based compensation expense related to sfas r in and  respectively 
general and administrative general and administrative costs totaled  in the year ended december   as compared to  in the decrease in general and administrative costs was due to a decrease in cash compensation paid to our independent directors  a moratorium on executive bonus payments and a decrease in investor relations spending  and sarbanes oxley compliance costs 
these decreases were partially offset by an increase in non cash  stock based compensation expense related to sfas r 
an increase in spending for patent and trademark work performed in and general sec compliance also contributed to partially offset the overall decrease in general and administrative costs 
in  our sfas r general and administrative expense was  in  our general and administrative sfas r expense was  the increase in general and administrative sfas r expense was due to the fact that our four independent directors did not receive any stock options grants in  but each received non qualified  fully vested stock options to purchase  shares of our common stock in april  resulting in approximately  in sfas r expense 
operating loss from continuing operations the operating loss from continuing operations was  in  as compared to  in the year ended december  this decrease in operating loss was due to an increase in revenue  and therefore gross profit partially offset by an increase in total operating expenses in included in our operating loss was  and  of non cash  stock based compensation expense related to sfas r in and  respectively 
realized gain on sale on securities held for sale during  we completed the liquidation of our investment in panacos pharmaceuticals and realized a gain on securities sold of  we did not hold any shares of panacos pharmaceuticals common stock in and therefore did not realize any such gains in interest income interest income totaled  for the year ended december  as compared to  for the year ended december  the decrease in interest income from to was a result of lower average cash balances and lower yield on our cash during income tax benefit from continuing operations for the year ended december  we did not record a benefit for income taxes 
for the year ended december  we recorded a benefit for income taxes from continuing operations of  despite our history of operating losses  we recorded this benefit due to our expected ability under federal income tax law to carry back current operating losses to offset taxable income that was recorded in we expect to record an income tax benefit of approximately  during due to new legislation within the american recovery and reinvestment act of relating to net operating loss carrybacks 
the cash is expected to come in during the second half of aside from the impact of the passage of this congressional act  we do not expect any other income tax benefit relating to carry backs from prior periods 
if we are successful commercializing pct and if we are able to generate operating income  then we may be able to utilize the net operating loss carry forwards that we generate 
gain on sale of net assets related to discontinued operations during  we did not realize any gain  or loss  in connection with discontinued operations 
during  we realized a gain on the sale of source scientific  llc of  this gain is comprised of the  charge that we recorded in the first quarter of under the provisions of staff accounting bulletin sab topic e  accounting for divestiture of a subsidiary or other business operation sab topic e and the gain of  net of income taxes of  that we recorded during the second quarter of  the period in which we completed the sale 
we recorded this gain in connection with the receipt on may  of  from mr 
richard w 
henson and mr 
bruce a 
sargeant  the principals of source scientific  llc  as full payment for their purchase of our remaining interest in that business 
upon completion of the transaction  we accounted for the total gain on the sale of our ownership interests in source scientific  llc as discontinued operations 
the charge that we recorded in  under the provisions of sab topic e  was reclassified as discontinued operations to reflect this change 
net loss our net loss in was  as compared to a net loss of  in this increase in net loss was due to the fact that our operating losses were not partially offset by realized gains from the sale of securities held  and a gain on sale of assets related to discontinued operations during and benefit from income taxes  as was the case during we expect that our net loss in will be lower than it was in due to the significant cost cutting measures that we implemented during liquidity and financial condition as of december   our working capital position was  the primary components of which were cash and cash equivalents  accounts receivable  inventory  prepaid expenses  and deposits 
our working capital balance was partially offset by accounts payable  accrued employee compensation  and other accrued expenses 
as of december   our working capital balance was  the primary components of which were cash and cash equivalents  income taxes receivable  prepaid expenses  and deposits 
we expect to continue to fund our operations from our working capital balance 
during  we took a number of cost reduction measures  including a comprehensive restructuring program to significantly reduce costs  centralize core operations  and refocus our business strategy in specific areas where our products have found significant market acceptance 
the restructuring program included a reduction in personnel of eight full time employees of the workforce  reduction in travel and meeting attendance for all personnel  continued reduction in investor relations activities  decreases in the base salary of most of our employees and all of our executive officers  a shutdown of the our r d facility in rockville  md  a consolidation of our r d activities in massachusetts and delay of several research and development and marketing programs 
we believe that these initiatives significantly decreased our rate of cash utilization  from just under million per quarter to an average of just under  per quarter during on february   we completed a private placement  pursuant to which we sold an aggregate of  units for a purchase price of per unit the purchase price  resulting in gross proceeds to us of  the private placement 
each unit consists of i one share of a newly created series of preferred stock  designated series a convertible preferred stock  par value per share the series a convertible preferred stock convertible into shares of our common stock  ii a warrant to purchase  at the purchaser s election to be made within days of the closing  either shares of our common stock  at an exercise price equal to per share  with a term expiring months after the date of closing month common stock warrant  or one share of series a convertible preferred stock at an exercise price equal to per share  with a term expiring months after the date of closing month preferred stock warrant  and iii a warrant to purchase shares of common stock at an exercise price equal to per share  with a term expiring months after the date of closing the month common stock warrants 
the holders of our shares of series a convertible preferred stock  however  are entitled to receive a cumulative dividend at the rate of per annum of the purchase price paid for the series a convertible preferred stock  payable semi annually on june and december  commencing on june  see note to our consolidated financial statements for a further description of the series a convertible preferred stock and warrants issued in the private placement 
on december   we received  from one of our distributors in the escrow account for the private placement 
prior to february   the distributor requested that the  be used as payment for anticipated future purchases of our pct instrument and consumable products  and not for an investment in the private placement 
this amount will be recorded as deferred revenue in the first quarter of we believe that because of the cost restructuring measures we have undertaken  together with the  we received in connection with our february private placement of units  consisting of series a convertible preferred stock and warrants  we have sufficient cash resources to fund normal operations into the second quarter of we believe we will need substantial additional capital to fund our current operations beyond the second quarter of if we are able to obtain additional capital or otherwise increase our revenues  we may increase spending in specific research and development applications and engineering projects and may hire additional sales personnel or invest in targeted marketing programs 
in the event that we are unable to obtain financing on acceptable terms  or at all  we may be required to limit or cease our operations  pursue a plan to sell our operating assets  or otherwise modify our business strategy  which could materially harm our future business prospects 
in june  we engaged emerging growth equities  ltd 
ege  an investment banking firm  to assist us in raising equity financing to support our research and development activities  commercialization efforts  working capital requirements  and general corporate purposes 
the engagement of ege contemplates a private placement of our securities exempt from the registration requirements under regulation d promulgated under the securities act of  as amended the act of up to  or more at our discretion the financing 
we have agreed to pay ege a cash fee of of the gross proceeds from the financing and to issue ege warrants to purchase of the number of securities issued in the financing 
the warrants will have a five year term and an exercise price equal to the price of the securities issued in the financing 
however  ege will receive a lower fee of of the gross proceeds from the financing and warrants to purchase of the number of securities issued in the financing with respect to all investors that they do not introduce to us 
ege is also entitled to a retainer of  per month for three months in either ege or we may terminate the engagement in general with prior written notice 
if during the month period following termination of the engagement we sell securities to any investor introduced to us by ege  we will pay a declining fee to ege based upon the number of months elapsed since the date of termination  commencing with a cash fee of of the gross proceeds received from such investors  plus warrants to purchase of the number of securities issued to such investors in the first month following termination of the engagement and with such fees being reduced by for each month following such termination 
we have also agreed to customary indemnification of ege in connection with the financing 
notwithstanding our engagement of ege  we can provide no assurance that any such equity offerings will occur  or that additional financing will be available to us of acceptable or affordable terms 
to date  they have not been successful in raising any funds for us 
in october  we revised the terms of our engagement with ege to eliminate any requirement to pay ege any fees with respect to any funds we raise without the help of ege 
net cash used in continuing operations during was  as compared to net cash used in continuing operations of  during the cash used in operations in included our net loss  an increase in inventory and accounts receivable and a decrease in accrued compensation  partially offset by decreases in deposits  and prepaid expenses 
we expect net cash used in continuing operations to decrease in as we decrease our overall rate of cash utilization 
net cash used in investing activities during was  as compared to net cash provided by investing activities of  in the prior year 
the cash generated in was entirely from the sale of  shares of panacos pharmaceuticals common stock  partially offset by purchases of fixed assets 
the cash used in was related to purchases of fixed assets in connection with barocyclers under lease 
we expect that our investment in fixed assets will decrease in as we continue to conserve our cash resources 
net cash generated from financing activities during was  and relates to the sale of  shares of our common stock to non affiliated investors pursuant to a private placement that we completed in november we had  of cash flows from financing activities during net cash provided by discontinued operations during of  was due to the completion of the divestiture of source scientific  llc 
we did not have any cash flows from discontinued operations during contractual obligations the following is a summary of our future contractual obligations as of december  contractual obligations total less than year more than year lease for easton operating office total contractual obligations in november  we signed an month lease agreement with easton norfolk realty trust  commencing in february pursuant to which we lease approximately  square feet of office space  with an option for an additional months 
we pay approximately  per month for the use of these facilities 
commitments and contingencies royalty commitments in  we acquired our initial equity interest in bioseq  inc  which at the time was developing our original pressure cycling technology 
bioseq  inc acquired its pressure cycling technology from biomolecular assays  inc bma under a technology transfer and patent assignment agreement 
in  we purchased all of the remaining outstanding capital stock of bioseq  inc  and at such time  the technology transfer and patent assignment agreement was amended to require us to pay bma a royalty on our sales of products or services that incorporate or utilize the original pressure cycling technology that bioseq  inc acquired from biomolecular assays  inc 
we are also required to pay bma of the proceeds from any sale  transfer or license of all or any portion of the original pressure cycling technology 
these payment obligations terminate in during the year ended december  and  we incurred approximately  and  respectively in royalty expense associated with our obligation to bma 
in connection with our acquisition of bioseq  inc  we licensed certain limited rights to the original pressure cycling technology back to bma 
this license is non exclusive and limits the use of the original pressure cycling technology by bma solely for molecular applications in scientific research and development and in scientific plant research and development 
bma is required to pay us a royalty equal to of any license or other fees and royalties  but not including research support and similar payments  it receives in connection with any sale  assignment  license or other transfer of any rights granted to bma under the license 
bma must pay us these royalties until the expiration of the patents held by bioseq  inc in  which we anticipate will be we have not received any royalty payments from bma under this license 
purchase commitments on september   we submitted a purchase order to source scientific  llc  the manufacturer of the company s pct barocycler instrumentation  for barocycler nep units 
pursuant to the terms of the purchase order  we placed a deposit with source scientific  llc  of approximately  representing approximately of the expected total value of the order  upon submission of the purchase order 
on november   we placed an additional deposit of approximately  with source scientific  llc to provide them with funds required to commence manufacturing of the nep units ordered 
the purchase price for the barocycler nep units is based upon a fixed bill of materials 
we expect that the nep units will be completed and ready for sale to our customers during the first quarter of we will be billed for the unpaid purchase price of each unit at the time each unit is completed and ready for sale 
as of december  we had  on deposit with source scientific  llc for remaining units pursuant to open purchase orders 
in addition  in december  we put the remaining  amount of the purchase order in an escrow account  which funds will be released to pay the remaining balance due when units are completed 
as of december  we had  on deposit with source scientific  llc for remaining units pursuant to these purchase orders 
indemnification in connection with our sale of substantially all of the assets of boston biomedica  inc bbi core businesses to seracare life sciences  inc in september  we continue to be exposed to possible indemnification claims in amounts up to the purchase price of approximately million 
our indemnification obligations for breaches of some representations and warranties relating to compliance with environmental laws extend until september   representations and warranties relating to tax matters extend for the applicable statute of limitations period which varies depending on the nature of claim  and representations and warranties relating to our due organization  subsidiaries  authorization to enter into and perform the transactions contemplated by the asset purchase agreement  and brokers fees  extend indefinitely 
severance and change of control agreements each of our executive officers is entitled to receive a severance payment if terminated by the company without cause 
the severance benefits would include a payment in an amount equal to one year of each executive officer s annualized base salary compensation plus accrued paid time off 
additionally  each executive officer will be entitled to receive medical and dental insurance coverage for one year following the date of termination 
the total commitment related to these agreements in the aggregate is approximately million 
each of our executive officers  other than mr 
richard t 
schumacher  our president and chief executive officer  is entitled to receive a change of control payment in an amount equal to one year of such executive officer s annualized base salary compensation  accrued paid time off  and medical and dental coverage  in the event of a change of control of the company 
in the case of mr 
schumacher  this payment would be equal to two years of annualized base salary compensation  accrued paid time off  and two years of medical and dental coverage 
the total commitment related to these agreements in the aggregate is approximately million 
the severance payment is meant to induce the executive to become an employee of the company and to remain in the employ of the company  in general  and particularly in the occurrence of a change in control 
critical accounting policies use of estimates to prepare our consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  we are required to make significant estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
in addition  significant estimates were made in projecting future cash flows to quantify impairment of assets  deferred tax assets  the costs associated with fulfilling our warranty obligations for the instruments that we sell  and the estimates employed in our calculation of fair value of stock options awarded 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results could differ from the estimates and assumptions used 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue in accordance with the securities and exchange commission s sec staff accounting bulletin sab no 
 revenue recognition sab 
revenue is recognized when realized or earned when all the following criteria have been met persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred and risk of loss has passed to the customer  the seller s price to the buyer is fixed or determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
our current instruments  the barocycler nep and nep  require a basic level of instrumentation expertise to set up for initial operation 
to support a favorable first experience for our customers  we send a representative to the customer site to install every barocycler that we sell through our domestic sales force 
the installation process includes uncrating and setting up the instrument and conducting introductory user training 
product revenue related to current barocycler instrumentation is recognized upon the installation of our instrumentation at the customer location 
product revenue related to sales of pct products to our foreign distributors is recognized upon shipment through a common carrier 
we provide for the expected costs of warranty upon the recognition of revenue for the sales of our instrumentation 
our sales arrangements do not provide our customers with a right of return 
product revenue related to our consumable products such as pulse tubes and application specific kits is recorded upon shipment through a common carrier 
shipping costs are included in the costs of sales 
any shipping costs billed to customers are recognized as revenue 
in accordance with the financial accounting standards board fasb statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for leases  we account for our lease agreements under the operating method 
we record revenue over the life of the lease term and we record depreciation expense on a straight line basis over the thirty six month estimated useful life of the barocycler instrument 
the depreciation expense associated with assets under lease agreement is included in the cost of pct products and services line item in our consolidated statements of operations 
many of our lease and rental agreements allow the lessee to purchase the instrument at any point during the term of the agreement with partial  or full  credit for rental payments previously made 
we pay all maintenance costs associated with the instrument during the term of the leases 
revenue from government grants is recorded when expenses are incurred under the grant in accordance with the terms of the grant award 
our transactions sometimes involve multiple element arrangements ie  products and services 
revenue under multiple element arrangements is recognized in accordance with emerging issues task force eitf issue no 
 accounting for revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables 
under this method  if an element is determined to be a separate unit of accounting  the revenue for the element is based on fair value and determined by vendor specific objective evidence vsoe  and recognized at the time of delivery 
if an arrangement includes undelivered elements that are not essential to the functionality of the delivered elements  we defer the fair value of the undelivered elements with the residual revenue allocated to the delivered elements 
fair value is determined based upon the price charged when the element is sold separately 
if there is not sufficient evidence of the fair value of the undelivered elements  no revenue is allocated to the delivered elements and the total consideration received is deferred until delivery of those elements for which objective and reliable evidence of the fair value is not available 
we provide certain customers with extended service contracts and  to the extent vsoe is established  these service revenues are recognized ratably over the life of the contract which is generally one to four years 
intangible assets we have classified as intangible assets  costs associated with the fair value of certain assets of businesses acquired 
intangible assets relate to the remaining value of acquired patents associated with pct 
the cost of these acquired patents is amortized on a straight line basis over sixteen years 
we annually review our intangible assets for impairment 
when impairment is indicated  any excess of carrying value over fair value is recorded as a loss 
an impairment analysis of intangible assets as of december  concluded they were not impaired 
long lived assets and deferred costs in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  if indicators of impairment exist  we assess the recoverability of the affected long lived assets by determining whether the carrying value of such assets can be recovered through the undiscounted future operating cash flows related to the long lived assets 
if impairment is indicated  we measure the amount of such impairment by comparing the carrying value of the asset to the fair value of the asset and record the impairment as a reduction in the carrying value of the related asset and a charge to operating results 
while our current and historical operating losses and cash flow are indicators of impairment  we performed an impairment analysis at december  and determined that our long lived assets were not impaired
