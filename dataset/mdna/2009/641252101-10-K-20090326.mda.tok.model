item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations this discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our financial statements and accompanying notes included elsewhere in this report 
operating results are not necessarily indicative of results that may occur in future periods 
overview we are a biopharmaceutical company focused on developing and commercializing novel pain management therapies 
we are assembling a portfolio of pain management product candidates based on known chemical entities to develop innovative new therapies which we believe may offer substantial advantages over currently available treatment options 
our initial focus is on the management of chronic peripheral neuropathic pain conditions 
our most advanced product candidate  qutenza  a dermal patch containing a high concentration of synthetic capsaicin  is designed to manage pain associated with peripheral neuropathic pain conditions 
we believe  based on our successful phase studies that a single or minute application of qutenza may provide up to weeks of clinically meaningful pain relief 
moreover  we believe that qutenza has demonstrated in clinical trials a positive safety and tolerability profile 
we submitted to the fda an nda for qutenza for the management of pain associated with phn in october which was filed by the fda in december our nda has a pdufa date of august  at which time we would anticipate receiving either an approval letter or a complete response letter from the fda 
a complete response letter may describe any activities which may be required to gain approval or may indicate that a product candidate is not approvable 
in september we submitted a maa for qutenza with the emea under the centralized procedure  seeking approval of qutenza 
on march   the chmp issued a positive opinion recommending the approval of our maa for qutenza for the treatment of peripheral neuropathic pain in non diabetic adults either alone or in combination with other medicinal products for pain 
in conjunction with issuing this recommendation  the chmp requested us to perform certain clinical evaluations of qutenza following approval 
we are currently awaiting the european commission s decision on the chmp opinion  a process which normally takes approximately to days 
if the european commission issues a marketing authorization  in most european union member states product pricing for government sponsored health care reimbursement must be negotiated or for hospital based products  product pricing may be established directly with hospitals 
we believe this process can take months or substantially longer to complete  if at all 
our earlier stage product candidate pipeline consists of ngx  a non patch liquid formulation of capsaicin for potential use in neuropathic pain conditions  ngx  ngx and ngx  prodrugs of acetaminophen for potential use in acute pain including traumatic pain  post surgical pain and fever  and ngx  an opioid prodrug for potential use in chronic pain indications 
ngx has been evaluated in three phase studies and is currently being considered for entry into phase evaluation 
the other product candidates are all in the pre clinical stage of development 
in response to the generally weak economic conditions which have resulted in a challenging environment for raising capital  we deferred further pre clinical and clinical development activities for all of our product candidates in order to focus our fiscal and human resources on the prosecution of our maa and nda for qutenza and on continuing support of our strategies for obtaining adequate reimbursement for qutenza in the united states 
we expect to re initiate some or all of our development programs if additional funds become available  including the studies associated with maa approval and the continuation of the ngx clinical 
table of contents program into phase further  we are currently seeking development partners for our acetaminophen and opioid prodrug product candidates 
we hold worldwide commercial rights to all of our product candidates and are actively engaged in discussions with potential commercial partners 
we were incorporated in as advanced analgesics  inc  and commenced operations in as neurogesx  inc from inception through our primary activities were related to formulation development and preclinical studies of our lead product candidate  qutenza 
since  our focus has expanded to include clinical development of qutenza  establishing sources of supply and manufacturing processes for qutenza and  more recently  regulatory activities including those related to our maa  which was submitted in september and for which a recommendation for approval by the chmp was issued on march   and our nda which was submitted to the fda in october and filed by the fda in december our focus has also expanded to include preparation for potential commercialization of qutenza should marketing approval be attained and seeking commercial partners for qutenza 
additionally  we have begun development programs for ngx  a liquid formulation of the same active ingredient used in qutenza  as well as limited preclinical development of certain prodrug product candidates 
we are a development stage company 
to date  we have not generated any revenues and have funded our operations primarily by selling equity securities and establishing debt facilities 
we have incurred significant losses since our inception 
as of december   we had a deficit accumulated during the development stage of approximately million  of which approximately million represents non cash charges for the accretion of redeemable convertible preferred stock 
we had cash  cash equivalents and short term investments totaling million at december  and for the year then ended  we used cash of million in operating activities 
we expect to continue to incur annual operating losses over the next several years and those losses may increase as we continue our efforts to gain marketing approval for qutenza in the united states and the european union  prepare for potential commercialization if qutenza is approved for marketing  and resume development of our product candidates 
critical accounting policies and significant judgments and estimates our management s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  expenses and related disclosures 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
while our significant accounting policies are described in more detail in note of notes to consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report  we believe the following accounting policies to be critical to the judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements 
research and development we expense research and development costs as incurred 
research and development expenses include personnel and personnel related costs  costs associated with pre clinical and clinical development activities  such as clinical trials  including amounts paid to clinical research organizations and clinical investigators  product and manufacturing costs such as process development  clinical product supply costs and the cost of commercially saleable product that is manufactured prior to market approval for that product candidate  internal and external costs associated with our regulatory compliance and quality assurance functions including the costs of outside consultants and contractors that assist in the process of submitting and maintaining regulatory filings  and overhead costs including allocated facility and related expenses 

table of contents clinical trials we accrue and expense costs for clinical trial activities performed by third parties  including clinical research organizations and clinical investigators  based upon estimates made  as of the reporting date  of the work completed through the reporting date as a percentage of the total work contracted for under our agreements with such third parties 
we make our estimates at the end of each reporting period after discussion with internal personnel and outside service providers and thorough evaluation as to progress or stage of completion of trials or services  as of the end of each reporting period 
on a periodic basis we adjust our estimated clinical trial costs to reflect actual expenses incurred to date 
due to the nature of the estimation of clinical trial costs  we can not assure you that we will not make changes to our estimates in the future as we become aware of additional information about the status or conduct of clinical trials 
stock based compensation effective january   we adopted the provisions of sfas no 
r  share based payments 
in march  the securities and exchange commission  or sec  issued staff accounting bulletin  or sab  no 
relating to sfas no 
r 
we have applied the provisions of sab no 
 for which the simplified method of determining the expected term of an option has been extended by sab no 
 in our adoption of sfas no 
r 
under sfas no 
r  stock based awards  including stock options  are recorded at fair value as of the grant date and recognized to expense over the employee s requisite service period generally the vesting period  which we have elected to amortize on a straight line basis 
because non cash stock compensation expense is based on awards ultimately expected to vest  it has been reduced by an estimate for future forfeitures 
sfas no 
r requires forfeitures to be estimated at the time of grant and revised  if necessary  in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates 
we adopted the provisions of sfas no 
r using the prospective transition method 
under the prospective transition method  beginning january   compensation cost recognized includes compensation cost for all share based payments granted prior to  but not yet vested as of december   based on the intrinsic value in accordance with the provisions of apb no 
 and compensation cost for all share based payments granted subsequent to december   based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
r 
all awards granted  modified  or settled after the date of adoption are accounted for using the measurement  recognition  and attribution provisions of sfas no 
r 
we have elected to use the black scholes option valuation model to estimate the fair value of stock options and significant judgment is required on the part of management in determining the proper assumptions used in this model 
the assumptions used in the black scholes option valuation model include the risk free interest rate  expected term  expected volatility and dividend yield 
we base our assumptions on historical data where available 
however  these assumptions consist of estimates of future market conditions  which are inherently uncertain  and therefore subject to management s judgment 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report for further detail 
estimation of fair value of warrants to purchase redeemable convertible preferred stock we accounted for warrants to purchase redeemable convertible preferred stock pursuant to the fasb staff position  no 
 issuers accounting under statement no 
for freestanding warrants and other similar instruments on shares that are redeemable  or fsp no 
 which required us to classify these warrants as current liabilities and to adjust the value of these warrants to their fair value at the end of each reporting period 
we estimated the fair value of these warrants at the respective balance sheet dates using the black scholes option valuation model  based on the estimated market value of the underlying redeemable convertible preferred stock at the valuation measurement date  the remaining contractual term of the warrant  risk free interest rates and expected dividends on and expected volatility of the price of the underlying redeemable convertible preferred stock 
these estimates  especially the market value of the underlying redeemable convertible preferred stock and the expected volatility  are highly judgmental 
at the time of adoption of fsp no 
 in  we recorded  for the cumulative effect of this change in accounting principle to reflect the cumulative change in estimated fair value of these warrants as of that date 
we recorded  of other income for the decrease in fair value for the remainder of and million of other expense for the year ended december  to reflect increases in the estimated fair value of all preferred stock warrants 

table of contents upon the closing of our initial public offering  or ipo  on may   all outstanding warrants to purchase shares of preferred stock were converted to warrants to purchase shares of our common stock and  as a result  are no longer subject to fsp no 
the then current aggregate fair value of these warrants of approximately  was reclassified from liabilities to additional paid in capital  a component of stockholders equity deficit  in the second quarter of and we have ceased to record any further periodic fair value adjustments 
we recorded  of other income for the year ended december  to reflect decreases in the estimated fair value of all preferred stock warrants 
results of operations our research and development expenses consist of internal and external costs 
our internal costs are primarily employee salaries and benefits  contract employee expense  non cash stock compensation expense  allocated facility and other overhead costs 
our external costs are primarily expenses related to the development of product candidates including formulation development  manufacturing process development  non clinical studies  clinical trial costs  such as the cost of clinical research organizations and clinical investigators  and costs associated with preparation and filing of regulatory submissions 
since our inception  qutenza has accounted for in excess of of our external research and development expenses  although qutenza has been declining as a percentage of our external research and development expenses in recent years due to the completion of clinical studies in qutenza and the relative increase in spending related primarily to our ngx development program 
specifically  in the years ended december   and  our external research and development costs totaled million  million and million  respectively  and of these amounts  and  respectively  were incurred in programs related to qutenza 
we commence tracking the separate  external costs of a project when we determine that a project has a reasonable chance of entering clinical development 
we use our internal research and development resources across several projects and many resources are not attributable to specific projects 
accordingly  we do not account for our internal research and development costs on a project basis 
however  over time  we believe that our internal costs are expended on our development projects generally in proportion to our external development costs for such project relative to total external development costs 
the process of conducting preclinical testing and clinical trials necessary to obtain fda approvals is costly and time consuming 
the probability of success for each product candidate and clinical trial may be affected by a variety of factors  including  among others  patient enrollment  manufacturing capabilities  successful clinical results  our funding  and competitive and commercial viability 
as a result of these and other factors  we are unable to determine the duration and completion costs of current or future clinical stages of our product candidates or when or to what extent we will generate revenues from commercialization and sale of any of our product candidates 
currently we are primarily focused on completing the development  through regulatory approval  of our lead product candidate  qutenza  for patients with phn in the united states and for patients with peripheral neuropathic pain conditions in the european union 
our maa which was filed with the emea  received  in march  a positive opinion recommending the approval for the use of qutenza for peripheral neuropathic pain in non diabetic adults either alone or in combination with other medicinal products for pain 
we are currently awaiting the european commission s decision on the chmp opinion  a process which normally takes approximately to days 
we also submitted an nda in the united states for qutenza for the management of pain associated with phn in our nda has been given a pdufa date of august  at which time we would anticipate receiving either an approval letter or a complete response letter from the fda 
we anticipate that our overall research and development expenses  excluding non cash stock based compensation expense will be consistent or possibly less than that experienced in recent quarters and will remain at those levels until we attain additional funding to support further development activities in qutenza  ngx and our other development programs 
our general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and benefits  professional fees related to our administrative  finance  human resource  legal and information technology functions  marketing expenses  costs associated with our status as a public company and patent costs 
in addition  general and administrative expenses include allocated facility  basic operational and support costs and insurance costs 
we anticipate that 
table of contents our general and administrative expenses will increase in absolute dollars and also as a percentage of total expenses over the next several years if we obtain additional capital 
these increases are likely to be attributable to increasing marketing activities in anticipation of and upon receipt of  required regulatory approvals  the costs of hiring and deploying a sales force in the united states to support a commercial launch of our product should we achieve fda approval  and the costs of being a public company  as well as the need to add additional personnel in all of the key functional areas that support growth of our general operations  including accounting and finance  legal and human resources 
comparison of years ended december  and year ended december  increase decrease increase decrease in thousands  except percentages research and development expenses general and administrative expenses interest income interest expense other income expense  net research and development expenses 
research and development expenses decreased approximately million  or  to million in the year ended december  from million for the same period in the year over year change was attributable to  in part  a decision to reduce our non clinical and clinical development expenses related both to potential label expansion of qutenza as well as our other product candidate programs 
this was due to our desire to preserve cash resources to support our regulatory submissions processes in both the united states and the european union and to devote resources to certain pre commercialization activities 
specifically  our research and development expenses declined as a result of a million decrease in clinical study related costs associated with qutenza 
during  we were conducting two phase clinical trials  whereas we completed our most recent phase clinical trial in the first half of also contributing to the year over year change was a million decrease related to manufacturing costs in support of qutenza 
in  our manufacturing costs were primarily attributed to manufacturing development activities including validation of our active pharmaceutical ingredient  or api  manufacturing processes to support our maa submission in the third quarter of and manufacturing costs associated with support of our two phase clinical trials  whereas in there was a lower level of activity in these areas 
additionally  there was a million decrease in external regulatory expenses resulting from the recognition of our maa filing fees in the third quarter of additional decreases included a million reduction in spending related to ngx  which was primarily driven by the completion of ind enabling non clinical toxicology studies in  a reduction in external quality assurance costs as a result of a lower level of clinical trial activity in and a million reduction in non cash stock based compensation expense 
these decreases were partially offset by a million increase in spending related to our manufacturing support infrastructure and increased staffing within the regulatory and quality assurance functions to support our regulatory submissions and prepare for potential commercial launch of our lead product candidate if marketing approval is attained 
general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses increased approximately million  or  to million in the year ended december  from million for the same period in the year over year change was due to a million increase in spending for pre commercialization activities such as medical education  marketing materials development and work in support of our pricing and reimbursement strategies 
also contributing to the year over year change was a million increase in general and administrative and marketing employee related expenses as a result of an increase in staffing in support of being a public company and in support of pre commercialization activities and a million increase in allocated overhead costs related to the move of our corporate headquarters to san mateo  california in october other increases were due to the costs of being a public company  including a million increase in 
table of contents directors and officers insurance expense  professional fees and other public company costs 
these increases were partially offset by a million decrease in non cash stock based compensation expense 
interest income 
interest income decreased approximately million  or  to million in from million in this decrease was primarily attributable to a decrease in the rate of return on our invested assets as rates declined in the market  in general  and as we moved our invested assets to investments of lower relative risk in light of events in the credit markets 
the decrease in our interest income was somewhat limited due to the fact that we had a higher average investment balance during as compared to interest expense 
interest expense decreased approximately million  or  to million in from million in this decrease was related to the reduction in the outstanding principal balance of notes payable as a result of the scheduled repayment of principal on those notes payable 
other income expense  net 
other income expense  net  decreased approximately million to less than million in expense in from million in income in the other income amount of million in the period was attributable to a decline in the fair value of our preferred stock warrant liability 
due to the conversion of all outstanding shares of preferred stock into common stock in connection with our ipo in the second quarter of  these warrants became exercisable for common stock  were reclassified to stockholders equity and are no longer required to be recorded at fair value at each reporting date 
we performed a final remeasurement in the period ended june  and have ceased to record any further periodic fair value adjustments 
comparison of years ended december  and year ended december  increase decrease increase decrease in thousands  except percentages research and development expenses general and administrative expenses interest income interest expense other income expense  net research and development expenses 
research and development expenses increased approximately million  or  to million in the year ended december  from million for the same period in the year over year change was primarily attributable to a million increase in clinical and manufacturing related costs associated with qutenza 
the increase in clinical costs was due to the size and scope of our phase studies conducted in compared to those conducted in the increase in manufacturing costs was primarily related to the development activities that were performed in support of our maa filing in the third quarter of and preparation for an nda filing in also contributing to the year over year change was a million increase in regulatory and quality assurance expenses related to an increase in staffing and consulting in support of the maa filing  filing fees payable to the emea and preparation for an nda filing in  a million increase in development work related to new product areas including conducting toxicology work in support of our planned ind filing for ngx as well as research in support of our new product initiatives and a million increase related to allocated facilities charges in connection with the move of our corporate headquarters to san mateo  california in non cash stock based compensation expense contributed million to the increase in research and development expenses 
these increases were partially offset by a million decrease in nonclinical costs associated with qutenza as the majority of our nonclinical activities for our lead product candidate were completed in general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses increased approximately million  or  to million in the year ended december  from million for the same period in the year over year change was due to a million increase in marketing expenses related to consulting 
table of contents and analysis in support of our pricing and reimbursement strategies  and other pre commercialization market research and other pre launch activities as well as costs associated with our efforts to build out our commercial infrastructure 
additional increases included a million increase in general and administrative employee related expenses and board compensation expense resulting from infrastructure development and the initiation of our board compensation program upon completion of our ipo  respectively 
in addition  as a result of our ipo and costs attendant to being a public company  there was a million increase in professional and corporate fees  including legal and accounting fees  public company directors and officers insurance  consulting fees and costs associated with the move of our corporate headquarters to san mateo  california in these increases were partially offset by a million decrease in non cash stock based compensation expense primarily due to the cessation of variable accounting for stock based awards upon the forgiveness of certain notes payable in january interest income 
interest income increased approximately million  or  to million in the year ended december  from million for the same period in the year over year change was primarily attributable to an increase in invested assets  due to both the completion of our ipo on may  as well as the exercise of preferred stock warrants in the first quarter of also contributing to the year over year change in interest income  although to a lesser extent  was an increase in the rate of return on invested assets 
interest expense 
interest expense increased approximately million  or  to million in the year ended december  the increase was related to our borrowing a total of approximately million under certain notes payable in july and september the notes were outstanding for the entire year ended december  which resulted in higher interest expense in compared to other income expense  net 
other income expense  net  increased approximately million  or  to million in income in the year ended december  from million in expense in the same period in the other expense of million in was primarily attributable to the increase in fair value of our preferred stock warrant liability 
the other income of million in was primarily attributable to a subsequent decline in the fair value of our preferred stock warrant liability in due to the conversion of all outstanding shares of preferred stock into common stock in connection with our ipo in the second quarter of  these warrants became exercisable for common stock and are no longer required to be recorded at fair value at each reporting date 
we performed a final remeasurement in the period ended june  and have ceased to record any further periodic fair value adjustments 
accretion of redeemable convertible preferred stock our redeemable convertible preferred stock outstanding prior to our initial public offering was redeemable at the request of the holders on or after june  we accreted the carrying value of the preferred stock issuances to the redemption amount using the effective interest method through periodic charges to additional paid in capital 
upon completion of our initial public offering on may   our preferred stock converted to common stock and the carrying value of our preferred stock was reclassified to common stock and additional paid in capital 
liquidity and capital resources since our inception through december   we have financed our operations primarily through private placements and a public offering of our equity securities and  to a lesser extent  through debt facilities 
through december   we have received approximately million from the sale of our equity securities  net of issuance costs 
on may   we completed an initial public offering of our common stock which resulted in net cash proceeds  after deducting total expenses including underwriting discounts and commissions and other offering related expenses  of approximately million 
on december  we completed the first closing 
table of contents of a private placement of our common stock and warrants resulting in net cash proceeds of million and on january   we completed the second and final closing of this private placement of our common stock and warrants resulting in net cash proceeds of million 
as of december   we had approximately million in cash  cash equivalents and short term investments and working capital of million 
our cash and investment balances are typically held in a variety of interest bearing instruments including corporate bonds  commercial paper  money market funds and obligations of us government agencies 
cash in excess of immediate operational requirements is invested in accordance with our investment policy primarily with a view to liquidity and capital preservation 
further  to reduce portfolio risk  our investment policy specifies a concentration limit of in any one issuer or group of issuers of corporate bonds or commercial paper at the time of purchase 
recent events in the credit markets have caused a liquidity crisis in most credit facilities including mortgage backed securities and auction rate securities 
we do not hold any auction rate securities or mortgage backed securities 
in response to a broad based tightening of credit and worsening economic environment in the fourth quarter  and to protect the principal balances and maintain liquidity of our investments  we have  over time  converted all of our investment holdings into us treasury or money market funds consisting of only us treasury securities as of december  our sales of investments in other than us treasury securities were generally conducted at or near cost  however certain individual investments were sold at either a gain or loss  that were not material individually or in the aggregate 
while we have resumed investing in commercial paper in  these investments have been limited to securities that are guaranteed in full by the federal deposit insurance corporation through the temporary liquidity guarantee program 
net cash used in operating activities was approximately million  million and million in  and  respectively 
net cash used in each of these periods was primarily a result of external research and development expenses  internal personnel costs associated with our research and development programs and infrastructure costs supporting our research and development activities 
included in net cash used in operating activities are net changes in assets and liabilities affecting cash  including significant reductions in accounts payable and accrued expenses in due to a generally lower level of research and development activity in  the timing of research and development activities and the timing of our payments to our suppliers  vendors and employees 
net cash provided by investing activities was approximately million in and net cash used in investing activities was approximately million and million in and  respectively 
investing activities consisted primarily of the purchase  sale and maturity of marketable securities and to a lesser extent  the purchase of capital equipment 
the net cash provided by investing activities in reflected maturities and sales of marketable securities in excess of the amount purchased during this period as we continued our efforts to reduce the relative risk of our investment portfolio 
changes in restricted cash resulted from the establishment in and subsequent reduction in related to required collateral on our line of credit in connection with our operating lease in san mateo  california 
net cash used in investing activities was significantly higher in compared to due to the investment of net proceeds from financing activities 
purchases of property and equipment increased in due to our relocating our corporate headquarters in september we expect that property and equipment expenditures may increase if our nda for qutenza is approved by the fda 
such increase is expected to relate to the capital needs for infrastructure to support commercial operations 
net cash used in financing activities was approximately million in and net cash provided by financing activities was approximately million and million in and  respectively 
financing activities consisted primarily of the sales of our common stock and warrants and the exercise of stock options in  offset by principal repayments on our venture loan financing arrangements 
in  financing activities consisted primarily of our ipo  a private placement of our common stock and warrants and the exercise of warrants underlying our preferred stock  partially offset by principal repayments on our venture loan financing arrangements 
in  financing activities consisted of the sale of equity securities including common and preferred stock and the exercise of options and warrants underlying these securities  as well as proceeds received from our venture loan financing arrangements  partially offset by principal repayments on such loans 

table of contents future minimum payments under all noncancelable lease obligations and payments under our venture loan agreement are as follows as of december  in thousands year ended december  operating leases notes payable less amounts representing interest we enter into contracts in the normal course of business with clinical research organizations and clinical investigators  for third party manufacturing and formulation development  and increasingly with organizations that are supporting our pre commercialization activities  among others 
these contracts generally provide for termination with notice  and therefore we believe that our noncancelable obligations under these agreements are not material 
in october and as amended  we licensed certain patents from the university of california for high concentration capsaicin for neuropathic pain 
under the terms of this license agreement  we are required to pay royalties on net sales of the licensed product up to a maximum of  per annum as well as a percentage of upfront and milestone payments resulting from sublicense of our rights under the agreement 
in january  we entered into a commercial supply and license agreement with lts lohman therapie systeme ag  or lts  to manufacture commercial and clinical supply of qutenza  which is currently being evaluated for marketing approval in both the united states and european union 
under the terms of the agreement  we are required to pay a transfer price for product purchased under the agreement as well as a royalty on net sales of product purchased under such agreement 
additionally  upon first market approval of qutenza  we are required to make a one time milestone payment of  our future capital uses and requirements depend on numerous forward looking factors 
these factors include but are not limited to the following the costs and timing of seeking regulatory approvals  the conduct of manufacturing activities including process development and manufacture of clinical product supply and potentially commercial product supply  the scope and cost of pre commercial activities  our ability to establish and maintain strategic collaborations  including licensing and other arrangements that we have or may establish  the costs of establishing sales and marketing infrastructure  distribution capabilities and potentially a sales force  the costs and timing of any post approval regulatory commitments  the progress of our development programs including the number  size and scope of clinical trials and non clinical development  the success of the commercialization of our products  the costs involved in enforcing or defending patent claims or other intellectual property rights  and the extent to which we acquire or invest in other products  technologies and businesses 

table of contents at december   we had approximately million in cash  cash equivalents and short term investments and the balance of our notes payable totaled approximately million 
during the three months ended december   we used a total of approximately million in operating activities and approximately million in the repayment of notes payable 
we currently anticipate that our cash uses will generally remain at these levels or less until such time as we are able to secure additional funding to increase our investment in pre commercialization activities and advance our development programs 
as a result  we anticipate that our existing cash and investments will be sufficient to meet our projected operating requirements through at least december  additionally  should we achieve market approval in the united states and additional resources become available  we expect that our cash uses will increase to support additional pre launch activities as well as launch related activities 
to date  we have incurred recurring net losses and negative cash flows from operations 
until we can generate significant cash from our operations  if ever  we expect to continue to fund our operations with existing cash resources generated from the proceeds of offerings of our equity securities as well as potentially through strategic collaboration agreements  debt financing or the sale of other equity securities 
however  we may not be successful in obtaining collaboration agreements  or in receiving milestone or royalty payments under those agreements 
in addition  we cannot be sure that our existing cash and investment resources will be adequate or that additional financing will be available when needed or that  if available  financing will be obtained on terms favorable to us or our stockholders 
having insufficient funds may require us to further delay  scale back or eliminate some or all of our development programs  relinquish some or even all rights to product candidates at an earlier stage of development or negotiate less favorable terms than we would otherwise choose 
failure to obtain adequate financing also may adversely affect the launch of our product candidates  if approved for marketing  or our ability to continue in business 
if we raise additional funds by issuing equity securities  substantial dilution to existing stockholders would likely result 
if we raise additional funds by incurring debt financing  the terms of the debt may involve significant cash payment obligations as well as covenants and specific financial ratios that may restrict our ability to operate our business 
off balance sheet arrangements since inception  we have not engaged in any off balance sheet arrangements  including the use of structured finance  special purpose entities or variable interest entities 
recently issued accounting standards not yet adopted in december  the emerging issues task force  or eitf  issued issue  accounting for collaborative arrangements  or eitf  which applies to collaborative arrangements where no separate legal entity exists and in which the parties are active participants and are exposed to significant risks and rewards that depend on the success of the activity 
this issue  among other things  requires certain income statement presentation of transactions with third parties and of payments between parties to the collaborative arrangement  along with disclosure about the nature and purpose of the arrangement 
the provisions of eitf are effective for fiscal years beginning on or after december  we are currently evaluating the impact of the adoption of eitf on our consolidated financial statements 
adopted in in june  the eitf issued issue no 
 accounting for nonrefundable advance payments for goods or services to be used in future research and development activities  or eitf  which concluded that nonrefundable advance payments for goods or services to be received in the future for use in research and development activities should be deferred and capitalized 
the capitalized amounts should be expensed as the related goods are delivered or services are performed 
such capitalized amounts should be charged to expense if 
table of contents expectations change such that the goods or services will not be delivered 
the provisions of eitf are effective for new contracts entered into during fiscal years beginning after december  the consensus may not be applied to earlier periods and early adoption is not permitted 
we adopted eitf on january  the adoption of eitf did not have a material impact on our financial position and results of operations 
we adopted the provisions of the financial accounting standards board  or fasb  statement of financial accounting standards  or sfas  no 
 fair value measurements  or sfas no 
 effective january  sfas no 
defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value under generally accepted accounting principles and enhances disclosures about fair value measurements 
fair value is defined under sfas no 
as the exchange price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability an exit price in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date 
the standard describes a fair value hierarchy based on three levels of inputs  of which the first two are considered observable and the last unobservable  that may be used to measure fair value  which are the following level quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities 
level inputs other than quoted prices included within level that are observable  either directly or indirectly  such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities  quoted prices in markets that are not active  or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities 
level unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities 
the adoption of this statement did not have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations and financial condition 
effective january   we adopted sfas no 
 the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities  or sfas no 
sfas no 
allows an entity the irrevocable option to elect fair value for the initial and subsequent measurement for specified financial assets and financial liabilities 
we did not elect the fair value option under this statement 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk s interest rate and market risk our exposure to market risk is confined to our cash  cash equivalents and short term investments which have maturities of less than one year 
the goal of our investment policy is primarily liquidity and capital preservation while attempting to maximize the income we receive without assuming significant risk 
to achieve these objectives our investment policy allows us to maintain a portfolio of cash equivalents and short term investments in a variety of securities  including us government agencies  corporate bonds  commercial paper and money market funds 
further  to reduce portfolio risk through diversification  our investment policy specifies a concentration limit of in any one issuer or group of issuers of corporate bonds or commercial paper at the time of purchase 
our cash and investments as of december  consisted of us treasury securities and money market funds 
at december   we did not hold any auction rate securities  which have experienced liquidity problems due to failed auctions 
the fair value and liquidity of our investments has not been materially impacted by the general events in the credit market 
we believe that none of our investments have been impaired during the recent sub prime mortgage market crisis  although there can be no assurance that there won t be any future impairment of our investments if the sub prime market crisis spreads to other sectors of the economy or if credit markets deteriorate further 

table of contents if interest rates rise  the market value of our investments may decline  which could result in a realized loss if we are forced to sell an investment before its scheduled maturity 
a hypothetical increase in interest rates by basis points would not result in a material decrease in the fair value of our net investment position 
additionally  as our debt facilities bear interest at fixed rates  we are not subject to market risk with respect to this debt 
foreign currency exchange rate risk we have recorded a liability related to filing fees associated with our maa filing  which occurred in the three months ended september   that will be payable upon either our withdrawal of the maa or upon the european commission s final decision regarding our maa 
this obligation  which is payable in euros  creates exposure to changes in that exchange rate 
however  the risks related to foreign currency exchange rates are not expected to be material to our consolidated financial position or results of operations 
our third party manufacturers including the manufacturer of our active ingredient  trans capsaicin  the manufacturer of qutenza and the manufacturer of our cleansing gel  are foreign manufacturers 
as a result  we may experience changes in product supply costs as a result of changes in exchange rates between the us dollar and the local currency where the manufacturing activities occur
