item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations introduction we are a nyse listed hospitality and leisure company ticker symbols rlh and rlh pa primarily engaged in the ownership  operation and franchising of midscale and upscale  full service hotels under our proprietary red lion brand 
established over years ago  the red lion brand is nationally recognized and particularly well known in the western united states  where most of our hotels are located 
the red lion brand is typically associated with three star full service hotels 
as of december   our hotel system contained hotels located in nine states and one canadian province  with  rooms and  square feet of meeting space as provided below available space hotels rooms sq 
ft 
red lion owned and leased hotels other leased hotel red lion franchised hotels total total red lion hotels leased hotels are those properties which we operate and manage and have ownership of some or all of the equipment and personal property on site  however  the hotel facility and the underlying land is subject to an operating lease from a third party 
our lease expiration dates range from to and have renewal provisions beyond that 
represents a hotel acquired in the fourth quarter of that was repositioned as a red lion in january as of december   this hotel was flagged as an independent 
red lion is about staying comfortable  and that means feeling at home when you re away from home 
our product and service culture is successful in both large urban and smaller markets 
our hotels strive to reflect the character of the unique local markets in which they operate  while maintaining a consistent experience 
we believe 
table of contents our adherence to consistent customer service standards and brand touch points make guests stay comfortable 
red lion hotels have always been known for providing a comfortable lodging experience and real  genuine and sincere service 
we operate in three reportable segments the hotels segment derives revenue primarily from guest room rentals and food and beverage operations at our owned and leased hotels 
the franchise segment is engaged primarily in licensing the red lion brand to franchisees and managing hotels for third party owners 
this segment generates revenue from franchise fees that are typically based on a percent of room revenues and are charged to hotel owners in exchange for the use of our brand and access to our central services programs 
these programs include the reservation system  guest loyalty program  national and regional sales  revenue management tools  quality inspections  advertising and brand standards 
it has also historically reflected revenue from management fees charged to the owners of managed hotels 
we have not managed any hotels for third parties since january the entertainment segment derives revenue primarily from ticketing services and promotion and presentation of entertainment productions 
we have historically owned certain commercial real estate 
we also have engaged in traditional real estate related services  including developing  managing and acting as a broker for sales and leases of commercial and multi unit residential properties collectively referred to as the real estate management business 
together  these operations comprised our real estate segment 
effective april   we divested the real estate management business 
in addition  consistent with our strategy of divesting non core assets  during the fourth quarter of  we listed one of our two remaining wholly owned commercial real estate properties for sale and have classified its results of operations within discontinued operations for all periods presented 
in september  we sold the property for approximately million and recognized a pre tax gain on sale of million 
there were no remaining discontinued operations after december  for additional information  see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
our remaining activities  none of which constitutes a reportable segment  have been aggregated into other  including the remaining operations of our former real estate segment 
results of operations for the year ended december   net loss was million or per share  compared to net income of approximately million or per share in and a net loss of million or per share in current year results were significantly impacted by a million charge recorded during the first quarter of for separation costs million of which was non cash associated with the retirement of our former president and chief executive officer in february in addition  during the fourth quarter of we recorded million in restructuring expenses as the company implemented a reduction in force and further cost savings in light of the difficult economic environment impacting current year results 
the table below summarizes our restructuring expenses and identifies whether the charge was cash or non cash in thousands severance charges stock based compensation related to separation non cash intangible and other asset write offs non cash total in october  the company terminated an employment agreement with an executive vice president resulting in an expense of million for separation payments and other benefits 
under the terms of the agreement  the unvested portion of the former executive s  stock options and  restricted stock units immediately vested  resulting in expense of million during the fourth quarter of 
table of contents includes a non cash charge of million reducing the carrying value of an intangible asset related to management contracts acquired with the westcoast and red lion brands 
since january  when the last hotel managed by us elected not to renew its management agreement  we have not managed any hotels for third parties 
revenues for the hotel segment increased over primarily due to the addition of the red lion denver southeast hotel acquired at the end of may  as well as the full year revenue impact from the anaheim hotel acquired in october however  for much of the third and fourth quarter of  anaheim was under renovation and rooms were out of service 
entertainment and franchise segment revenues were down year over year  and depreciation and amortization expense increased primarily from the two hotel acquisitions 
in total  operating income during decreased million to million compared to a summary of our consolidated statement of operations is as follows in thousands  except per share data total revenue operating expenses operating income other income expense interest expense expense of early extinguishment of debt minority interest in partnerships  net other income  net income loss from continuing operations before income taxes income tax expense benefit net income loss from continuing operations income loss from discontinued operations net income loss earnings loss per share basic and diluted ebitda ebitda from continuing operations the following table details the impact of the restructuring expenses recorded and million charge in separation costs on net loss  loss per share and ebitda for the year ended in thousands  except per share data separation costs restructuring expenses income tax benefit impact on net loss impact on ebitda separation costs restructuring expenses income tax benefit impact on loss per share net income during improved over  a direct result of an increase in hotel segment revenues during to million from million in operating income increased to million during  
table of contents primarily driven by profitability in the hotels segment due to strong gains in both rate and occupancy at our owned and leased hotels 
positive operating results were offset by increased depreciation and amortization expense over from the completed hotel renovations 
included in results was a million gain from the sale of the real estate management business 
results for reflect the transition of the red lion hotel sacramento from a leased hotel to a franchise during july  reducing revenues compared to by million  partially offset by the addition of million in revenues from our anaheim property added during the fourth quarter of net income was also positively affected by lower interest expense from the repayment of approximately million in long term debt during the second and third quarters of  and from the non recurring expense from the early extinguishment of debt of approximately million included in operating income from continuing operations increased in from  reflecting comparative improvements in revpar  adr and occupancy and increased margins from our hotel segment 
ebitda from continuing operations in increased million to million  or  compared to  which included expense of million for the early extinguishment of debt 
ebitda represents net income or loss before interest expense  income tax benefit expense and depreciation and amortization 
we utilize ebitda as a financial measure because management believes that investors find it to be a useful tool to perform more meaningful comparisons of past  present and future operating results and as a means to evaluate the results of core on going operations 
we believe it is a complement to net income and other financial performance measures 
ebitda from continuing operations is calculated in the same manner  but excludes the operating activities of business units identified as discontinued 
ebitda is not intended to represent net income loss as defined by generally accepted accounting principles in the united states gaap  and such information should not be considered as an alternative to net income loss  cash flows from operations or any other measure of performance prescribed by gaap 
we use ebitda to measure the financial performance of our owned and leased hotels because we believe interest  taxes and depreciation and amortization bear little or no relationship to our operating performance 
by excluding interest expense  ebitda measures our financial performance irrespective of our capital structure or how we finance our properties and operations 
we generally pay federal and state income taxes on a consolidated basis  taking into account how the applicable taxing laws apply to us in the aggregate 
by excluding taxes on income  we believe ebitda provides a basis for measuring the financial performance of our operations excluding factors that our hotels cannot control 
by excluding depreciation and amortization expense  which can vary from hotel to hotel based on historical cost and other factors unrelated to the hotels financial performance  ebitda measures the financial performance of our hotels without regard to their historical cost 
for all of these reasons  we believe that ebitda provides us and investors with information that is relevant and useful in evaluating our business 
we believe that the presentation of ebitda from continuing operations is useful for the same reasons  in addition to using it for comparative purposes for our intended operations going forward 
however  because ebitda excludes depreciation and amortization  it does not measure the capital we require to maintain or preserve our fixed assets 
in addition  because ebitda does not reflect interest expense  it does not take into account the total amount of interest we pay on outstanding debt nor does it show trends in interest costs due to changes in our borrowings or changes in interest rates 
ebitda from continuing operations excludes the activities of operations we have determined to be discontinued and does not reflect the totality of operations as experienced for the periods presented 
ebitda  as defined by us  may not be comparable to ebitda as reported by other companies that do not define ebitda exactly as we define the term 
because we use ebitda to evaluate our financial performance  we reconcile it to net income  which is the most comparable financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with gaap 
ebitda does not represent cash generated from operating activities determined in accordance with gaap  and should not be considered as an alternative to operating income or net income loss determined in accordance with gaap as an indicator of performance or as an alternative to cash flows from operating activities as an indicator of liquidity

undistributed corporate expenses include general and administrative charges such as corporate payroll  legal expenses  charitable contributions  director and officers insurance  bank service charges and outside accountants and various other consultants expense 
we consider these expenses to be undistributed because the costs are not directly related to our business segments and therefore are not further distributed

seasonality our business is subject to seasonal fluctuations  with more revenues and profits realized from may through october than during the rest of the year 
during  revenues during the second and third quarters approximated and  respectively  of total revenues for the year  compared to revenues of and of total revenues during the first and fourth quarters 
inflation the effect of inflation  as measured by fluctuations in the us consumer price index  has not had a material impact on our consolidated financial statements during the periods under review 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect i the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of the financial statements  and ii the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods 
actual results could differ materially from those estimates 
we consider a critical accounting policy to be one that is both important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and requires management s most subjective or complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
our significant accounting policies are described in note of notes to consolidated financial statements  however  we have also identified our most critical accounting policies and estimates below 
management has discussed the development and selection of our critical accounting policies and estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors  and the audit committee has reviewed the disclosures presented below 
revenue recognition and receivables revenue is generally recognized as services are provided 
when we receive payment from customers before our services have been performed  the amount received is recorded as deferred revenue until the service has been completed 
we recognize revenue from the following sources hotels room rental and food and beverage sales from owned and leased hotels 
revenues are recognized when our services have been performed  generally at the time of the hotel stay or guest s visit to the restaurant 
this treatment is consistent with others within our industry 
our revenues are significantly 
table of contents impacted by global  national and regional economic conditions affecting the travel and hospitality industry  as well as the relative market share of our hotels compared with our competitors 
franchise fees received in connection with the franchise of our brand names and management fees we earn from managing third party owned hotels 
franchise and management revenues are recognized as earned in accordance with the contractual terms of the franchise or management agreements 
entertainment computerized event ticketing services and promotion of broadway style shows and other special events 
where we act as an agent and receive a net fee or commission  it is recognized as revenue in the period the services are performed 
when we are the promoter of an event and are at risk for the production  revenues and expenses are recorded in the period of the event performance 
other primarily from rental income received from our direct ownership interest in a retail mall in kalispell  montana that is attached to our red lion hotel 
we review the ability to collect individual accounts receivable on a routine basis 
we record an allowance for doubtful accounts based on specifically identified amounts that we believe to be uncollectible and amounts that are past due beyond a certain date 
a receivable is written off against the allowance for doubtful accounts if collection attempts fail 
our estimate of the allowance for doubtful accounts is impacted by  among other things  national and regional economic conditions 
long lived assets property and equipment is stated at cost less accumulated depreciation 
the assessment of long lived assets for possible impairment requires us to make judgments regarding estimated future cash flows from the respective properties  which is dependent upon internal forecasts  estimation of the long term rate of growth for our business  the useful life over which our cash flows will occur  the determination of real estate and prevailing market values  asset appraisals and  if available and appropriate  current estimated net sales proceeds from pending offers or net sales proceeds from previous  comparable transactions 
if the expected undiscounted future cash flows are less than the net book value of the assets  the excess of the net book value over the estimated fair value is charged to current earnings 
we review the recoverability of our long lived assets annually or more frequently as events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
changes to our plans  including a decision to sell  dispose of or change the intended use of an asset  could have a material impact on the carrying value of the asset 
intangible assets our intangible assets include brands and goodwill which we account for in accordance with sfas no 
goodwill and other intangible assets 
we do not amortize our brands and goodwill 
instead  we test for impairment annually or more frequently as events or circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
our goodwill and other intangible asset impairment test requires judgment  including the identification of reporting units  assignment of assets and liabilities to reporting units  assignment of goodwill to reporting units  and determination of the fair value of each reporting unit  subject to the same general assumptions discussed above for long lived assets 
at december  and  our recorded goodwill and other intangible assets not subject to amortization remained unchanged at million 
while we have not recognized an impairment loss since we originally recorded goodwill  changes in our estimates and assumptions could affect  potentially materially  our financial condition or results of operations in the future 
the financial and credit market volatility directly impacts fair value measurement through our company s estimated weighted average cost of capital used to determine discount rate  and through our common stock price that is used to determine market capitalization 
during times of volatility  significant judgment must be applied to determine whether credit or stock price changes are a short term swing or a longer term trend 
our other intangible assets include management  marketing and lease contracts  the value of which is amortized on a straight line basis over the weighted average life of the agreements and totaled million and million  respectively  at december  and the assessment of these contracts requires us to make 
table of contents certain judgments  including estimated future cash flow from the applicable properties 
during the fourth quarter of  we recorded a non cash charge of million to reduce the carrying value of intangible assets  primarily related to management contracts acquired with the westcoast and red lion brands 
since january  when the last hotel managed by us elected not to renew its management agreement  we have not managed any hotels for third parties 
new accounting pronouncements in september  the fasb issued sfas no 
 fair value measurements sfas no 
 which establishes a framework for measuring fair value in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  and expands disclosures about fair value measurements 
sfas no 
does not require any new fair value measurements itself 
however  this statement applies under other accounting pronouncements that require or permit fair value measurements and may therefore change current practice if an alternative measure of fair value has been used 
sfas no 
applies an exchange price notion for fair value consistent with previously preferred practice  with a focus on exit price and market based measurements as compared to entry price and entity specific measurements 
sfas no 
became effective for financial assets and liabilities in financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after november  in february  the fasb issued a proposed staff position fsp fas  which delayed the effective date of sfas no 
for all nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities  except those that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis at least annually 
fsp fas partially deferred the effective date of sfas no 
to fiscal years beginning after november   and interim periods within those fiscal years for items within the scope of the fsp 
effective january   we adopted sfas no 
except as it applies to those nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities as noted in fsp fas we do not use derivative instruments  nor do we hold or issue financial instruments for the purpose of trading 
our financial instruments currently consist of cash and cash equivalents  restricted cash  accounts receivable  current liabilities and debt obligations 
the carrying amounts for cash and cash equivalents  current investments  accounts receivable  current liabilities and variable rate long term debt are reasonable estimates of their fair values 
therefore  we experienced no impact on the carrying value of any financial asset or liability in upon adoption 
we do not believe the adoption of fsp fas  which became effective for us on january   will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements in relation to our nonfinancial assets and liabilities 
in february  the fasb issued sfas no 
 the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities including an amendment of fasb statement no 
sfas no 

sfas no 
permits entities to choose to measure many financial instruments and certain other items at fair value  the objective of which is to improve financial reporting by providing entities with the opportunity to mitigate volatility in reported earnings caused by measuring related assets and liabilities differently without having to apply complex hedge accounting provisions 
this statement is expected to expand the use of fair value measurement  which is consistent with fasb s long term measurement objectives for accounting for financial instruments 
sfas no 
is effective as of the beginning of an entity s first fiscal year that begins after november  while sfas no 
became effective on january   we did not elect the fair value measurement option for any of our financial assets or liabilities

it requires that entities disclose the fair value of derivative instruments and their gains and losses  disclose features that are credit risk related  and cross reference footnotes to enable financial statement end users to locate significant derivative instrument information more easily 
sfas no 
is effective for all financial statements that are issued for fiscal years and interim periods after november  but entities are encouraged to adopt its requirements early 
we do not currently engage in hedging activities and do not currently have derivative instruments recorded within our consolidated financial statements 
thus  we do not expect the adoption of sfas no 
to have any effect on our consolidated financial statements 
in may  the fasb issued sfas no 
 the hierarchy of generally accepted accounting principles sfas no 
 which identifies the sources of accounting principles and the framework for selecting the principles used in the preparation of financial statements of nongovernmental entities that are presented in conformity with gaap to improve the quality of standards and the standard setting process  including improving the conceptual framework  codifying existing accounting literature  transitioning to a single standard setter regime  and converging fasb and standards of the international accounting standards board

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk at december   million of our outstanding debt was subject to currently fixed interest rates and is not exposed to market risk from rate changes 
during  we borrowed million from our revolving credit facility 
outstanding borrowings under the facility accrue interest at rates ranging from to basis points over libor  with an option for base rate loans based upon the federal funds rate or prime rate 
at december   million was outstanding under the facility at an interest rate of based on a day libor plus 
in september  we closed on a million loan that provides for a five year term and a spread over libor that was at december  we do not foresee any significant changes in our exposure to fluctuations in interest rates  although we will continue to manage our exposure to this risk by monitoring available financing alternatives
