recent developments current united states and worldwide economic conditions have resulted in an extraordinary tightening of credit markets 
these economic conditions have been characterized in news reports as a global economic crisis that has been marked by dramatic and rapid shifts in market conditions and government responses  and they have resulted in unprecedented intervention in financial institutions and markets by governments throughout the world 
although many economists originally characterized this crisis as limited to the subprime mortgage markets  the current adverse conditions have quickly spread to broader financial  manufacturing and labor markets 
as reported by the bureau of labor statistics us department of labor in a report released march   nonfarm payroll employment fell by approximately  in february and the unemployment rate rose to 
in october  the emergency economic stabilization act of was enacted 
under this act  up to billion has been made available to stabilize us banks and enable the government to purchase devalued financial instruments held by banks and other financial institutions

management has been closely monitoring the economic conditions and government responses 
the company has also implemented new procedures to contain or reduce its expenses 
the impact of the tight credit markets on our interest expense in the second half of was limited  but we expect our interest expense in future periods to increase unless the credit markets improve significantly 
in addition  we have observed a weakening in the labor markets that has resulted in declines in revenues in our staff augmentation segment during the second half of as compared to the comparable period 
furthermore  some of our clients have announced reductions in workforce  including contingent labor  which may cause some of the vendors we manage as part of our human capital management services and rightsourcing services programs to reduce or discontinue operations  which would further impact our management of these programs 
while the current economic conditions have not had a significant negative impact on our operations through the end of  if these conditions persist or deteriorate  they could potentially have a significant adverse impact on our operations in future periods 
see risk factors global economic conditions have created turmoil in credit and labor markets that could have a significant adverse impact on our operations in item a of this report

while management believes that such an increase is reflective of a trend over the past decade for companies to rely increasingly on providers of human capital management services  such as those provided by the company s pro unlimited subsidiary  the current economic environment see overview and recent developments in this item has impacted this trend 
management has observed that  since the second quarter of  pro s customers generally have not sought to expand the scope of services they engage pro to perform

selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales of services were for the year ended december   compared to for the year ended december  the million increase in selling  general and administrative expenses is primarily due to higher personnel costs incurred to support the increase in consultant consolidation services provided in the human capital management services segment discussed above

the company s interest expense for the year ended december  was principally attributable to interest recorded on the pnc credit facility  the convertible note and  prior to their redemption  the senior notes 
interest expense of million for fiscal was lower as compared to the interest expense of million for fiscal this decrease in interest expense was principally due to the repurchases and redemptions of million of senior notes since the beginning of  including the redemption of the remaining million principal amount of senior notes in august  and to lower interest rates under the pnc credit facility

in the staff augmentation segment  the decrease of million  or  is principally attributable to the decrease of services provided to telecom  other staffing and technical services customers  partially offset by an increase in services provided to information technology and healthcare support customers

cost of services for the year ended december  was of net sales of services as compared to cost of services of of net sales of services for the year ended december  the cost of services as a percentage of net sales for the year ended december  decreased slightly from the prior year principally due to higher gross margins as a result of increased consultant consolidation services provided by the human capital management services segment and lower state unemployment rates  partially offset by less favorable workers compensation claims experience during selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales of services were for the year ended december   compared to for the year ended december  the million increase in selling  general and administrative expenses is primarily due to higher personnel and professional costs incurred to support the increase in consultant consolidation services provided in the human capital management services segment discussed above and additional professional fees and personnel costs associated with sarbanes oxley compliance

the net income from discontinued operations was million for the year ended december   which represented the settlement received in november as a result of a capital loss relating to this settlement  no provision for income taxes was recorded 
financial condition  liquidity and capital resources as described in overview and recent developments in this item  management has observed weakening of the labor markets and a tightening of the credit markets coupled with an increase in interest rates 
these conditions  which are interrelated  could affect our liquidity in future periods in a number of ways  including by decreasing the demand for contingent staff  although the pool of employee candidates should increase  affecting our customers ability to timely make payment on our invoices  and increasing our interest expense and  if conditions persist or deteriorate  making it more difficult for us to refinance or extend the pnc credit facility at its maturity on july  the company generally pays its billable employees weekly or bi weekly for their services  and remits certain statutory payroll and related taxes as well as other fringe benefits 
invoices are generated to reflect these costs plus the company s markup 
these invoices are typically paid within days 
increases in the company s net sales of services  resulting from expansion of existing offices or establishment of new offices  will require additional cash resources 
staffing personnel placed by the company are employees of the company 
the company is responsible for employment related expenses for its employees  including workers compensation  unemployment compensation insurance  medicare and social security taxes and general payroll expenses 
the company offers health  dental  k  disability and life insurance to its eligible employees 
staffing and consulting companies  including the company  typically pay their billable employees for their services before receiving payment from their customers  resulting in significant outstanding receivables 
to the extent the company grows  these receivables will increase and there will be greater need for borrowing availability under the pnc credit facility 
at march   the company had outstanding million principal amount under the pnc credit facility with remaining availability of up to million based upon the borrowing base  as defined under the pnc credit facility agreement  to fund operations 
off balance sheet and contractual obligations as of december   we had no off balance sheet arrangements other than operating leases entered into in the normal course of business  as indicated in the table below 
the following table represents contractual commitments associated with operating lease agreements  employment agreements and principal repayments on debt obligations excluding interest payments due by fiscal year in thousands thereafter operating leases employment agreements pnc credit facility principal repayments convertible note principal repayments total see note to our consolidated financial statements 
comforce  coi and various of their operating subsidiaries  as co borrowers and guarantors  are parties to the million pnc credit facility with pnc  as a lender and administrative agent  and other financial institutions participating as lenders to provide for a revolving line of credit with available borrowings based  generally  on of the company s accounts receivable aged days or less  subject to specified limitations and exceptions 
the company entered into the pnc credit facility in june and it has been subject to eight amendments 
the obligations under the pnc credit facility are collateralized by a pledge of the capital stock of certain key operating subsidiaries of the company and by security interests in substantially all of the assets of the company 
the pnc credit facility contains various financial and other covenants and conditions  including  but not limited to  a prohibition on paying cash dividends and limitations on engaging in affiliate transactions  making acquisitions and incurring additional indebtedness 
the maturity date of the pnc credit facility is july  the company also had standby letters of credit outstanding under the pnc credit facility at december  in the aggregate amount of million  principally as security for the company s obligations under its workers compensation insurance policies 
as reported in the accompanying cash flow statement  during  the company s primary sources of funds were million provided by its operating activities due significantly to the continued profitability of the company 
the company also used cash of million in investing activities due to the purchases of property and equipment 
in addition  the cash used in financing activities of million is primarily a result of the repurchase and redemption of million aggregate principal amount of senior notes 
at december   the company had outstanding million principal amount under the pnc credit facility bearing interest at a weighted average rate of per annum 
at such date  the company had remaining availability of up to million based upon the borrowing base  as defined in the agreement  under the pnc credit facility 
at december   the company also had outstanding million principal amount of convertible notes bearing interest at per annum 
the company has made significant progress in improving its capital structure and reducing interest expense through the elimination of long term debt through the repurchase  redemption or exchange of senior notes  convertible notes and other instruments 
since june and through the date of this report  the company has eliminated million of public debt and reduced its total long term debt from million to million 
the company has reduced its annualized interest expense principally by borrowing at the lower rates available under the pnc credit facility to effectuate the repurchase and redemption of long term debt and by exchanging preferred stock and lower interest rate convertible notes for public debt 
substantially all of the consolidated net assets of the company are assets of coi and all of the net income that had been generated by the company was attributable to the operations of coi 
prior to the redemption of the remaining senior notes in august as described under results of operations fiscal year ended december  compared to december  in this item  these assets and any cumulated net income were restricted as to their use by comforce 
the indenture imposed restrictions on coi making specified payments  which were referred to as restricted payments  including making distributions or paying dividends referred to as upstreaming funds to comforce 
upon the completion of the redemption of the senior notes  these restrictions were eliminated 
however  the pnc credit facility includes significant restrictions and covenants that continue to be binding on the company  including many that are comparable to or more restrictive than those that were applicable under the indenture see note to our consolidated financial statements 
the company s series a  b and a preferred stock provide for dividends of per annum and  at december  there were cumulated  unpaid and undeclared dividends of million on the series a preferred stock   on the series b preferred stock and million on the series a preferred stock 
if such dividends and underlying instruments were converted to voting or non voting common stock  the aggregate amount would equal million shares at december  as compared to million shares at december  
management of the company believes that cash flow from operations and funds anticipated to be available under the pnc credit facility will be sufficient to service the company s indebtedness and to meet currently anticipated working capital requirements for the next months 
the company was in compliance with all covenants under the pnc credit facility at december  and expects to remain in compliance for the next months 
the company has had preliminary discussions with pnc to extend the pnc credit facility beyond its current maturity date of july  no assurance can be given that the company will resolve such discussions on a satisfactory basis 
the company is currently undergoing audits for certain state and local tax returns 
the results of these audits are not expected to have a material effect upon the results of operations 
in  comforce technical services  inc cts entered into a contract with a united states government agency the agency to provide technical  operational and professional services in foreign countries throughout the world for humanitarian purposes 
persons employed by cts in the host countries include us nationals  nationals of the host countries local nationals and nationals of other countries third country nationals 
the contract provides  generally  that the us government will reimburse the company for all direct labor properly chargeable to the contract plus fringe benefits  in some cases at specified rates and profit 
although not anticipated  the amount of foreign payroll taxes and other taxes related to these employees could potentially exceed the amount available to us from our own resources or under the pnc credit facility 
see note to our consolidated financial statements 
critical accounting policies and estimates management s discussion in this item addresses the company s consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses reported in those financial statements 
these judgments can be subjective and complex  and consequently actual results could differ from those estimates 
a discussion of the more significant estimates follows 
management has discussed the development  selection and disclosure of these estimates and assumptions with the audit committee of the board of directors 
revenue recognition staff augmentation and human capital management services the company provides supplemental staff to its customers under arrangements that typically require supervision by the customers management for a period of time 
in these arrangements  the company is solely responsible for employees engaged to provide services to a customer 
the company is the sole employer of record  pays the employees wages  pays unemployment taxes and workers compensation insurance premiums  provides health insurance and other benefits to eligible employees  and is responsible for paying all related taxes 
the company enters into service agreements with its customers  negotiates the terms of the services  including pricing  and bears the credit risk relative to customer payments 
the company bills its customers for these services with payment generally due upon receipt of the invoice 
revenue under these arrangements is recognized upon the performance of the service by the company s employees 
the associated payroll costs are recorded as cost of sales 
there is no right of cancellation or refund provisions in these arrangements and the company has no further obligations once the services are rendered by the employee 
the company s contingent staffing management services enable customers to manage the selection  procurement and supervision of contingent staffing suppliers through its web enabled proprietary and third party software  and include providing company operating and support personnel to assist customers 
the company does not sell its software to customers  but rather utilizes it in connection with providing services 
consultant consolidation services  provided as a component of contingent staffing management services  comprise the management of invoicing for a customer s multiple services providers that results in the consolidation of invoices for all of a customer s individual staffing vendors 
the company recognizes revenue for the amount of its fees for these services  which are determined as a percentage of the gross billings to customers from the contingent staffing suppliers  as the services are performed 
the company invoices its customers for its fees together with the billings from the contingent staffing suppliers  which are reflected in accounts receivable as there is no right of offset with the liabilities for amounts due to the contingent staffing suppliers 
amounts invoiced related to contingent staffing supplier billings are included in accrued expenses and are settled after our collection of the related receivables 
we rely on our billable employees  staffing suppliers and clients to timely submit their work and expense reports 
it is our policy to record all activity net sales of services and cost of services performed during each reporting period for which we receive and process the submissions of our billable employees  staffing suppliers and clients within two weeks after the end of each of our first three quarters and within five weeks after the end of our fiscal year 
in accordance with emerging issues task force issue no 
 income statement characterization of reimbursements received for out of pocket expenses incurred  reimbursements received by the company for out of pocket expenses are characterized as revenue 
the company follows emerging issues task force eitf  reporting revenue gross as a principal versus net as an agent  in the presentation of revenues and expenses 
this guidance requires that the company assess whether it acts as a principal in the transaction or as an agent acting on behalf of others 
in situations where the company is the principal in the transaction and has the risks and rewards of ownership  the transactions are recorded gross in our consolidated statements of income 
staff augmentation a portion of the company s revenue is attributable to license agreements 
under the terms of such license agreements  the company is fully responsible for the payment of the employees 
the company submits all invoices for services performed to the customers and they are required to remit their payments for services performed directly to the company 
the company includes these revenues and related direct costs in its net sales of services and cost of services on a gross basis 
the net distribution to the licensee is based on a percentage of gross profit generated 
financial outsourcing services the company provides back office support to unaffiliated independently owned staffing companies 
these arrangements typically require the company to process the payrolls and invoicing for these unaffiliated staffing companies through the use of the company s information technology system 
in return  these unaffiliated staffing companies the company s customers pay the company a fixed percentage of the weekly billings it processed for them 
payment of the company s fees is due upon the completion of the processing of weekly payrolls and invoicing 
revenue is recognized over the period as the company performs these services for the amount of the fixed fee the company receives as stipulated in the applicable contract 
there is no right of cancellation or refund provisions in these arrangements and the company has no further obligations once the services are rendered 
the company also provides funding services to unaffiliated independently owned staffing companies 
these arrangements typically require the company to advance funds to these unaffiliated staffing companies the company s customers in exchange for the receivables related to invoices remitted to their clients for services performed during the prior week 
the advances are repaid through the remittance of payments of receivables by their clients directly to the company 
the company withholds from these advances an administrative fee and other charges as well as the amount of receivables relating to prior advances that remain unpaid after a specified number of days 
these administrative fees and other charges are recognized as revenue when earned 
there is no right of cancellation or refund provisions in these arrangements and the company has no further obligations once the services are rendered 
accounts receivable the company s accounts receivable balances are comprised of trade and unbilled receivables 
the company maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts recorded as an estimate of the accounts receivable balance that may not be collected 
this allowance is calculated on the trade receivables with consideration for the company s historical write off experience  the current aging of receivables  general economic climate and the financial condition of customers 
after giving due consideration to these factors  the company establishes specific allowances for uncollectible accounts 
the allowance for the funding and service fee receivables is calculated with consideration for the ability of the company s clients to absorb chargebacks due to the uncollectibility of the funded receivables 
bad debt expense  which increases the allowance for doubtful accounts  is recorded as an operating expense in our consolidated statements of income 
factors that would cause this provision to increase primarily relate to increased bankruptcies by customers  the inability of the company s funding services clients to absorb chargebacks and other difficulties collecting amounts billed 
on the other hand  an improved write off experience and aging of receivables would result in a decrease to the provision 
accrued workers compensation liability the company records its estimate of the ultimate cost of  and liabilities for  workers compensation based on actuarial computations using the company s loss history as well as industry statistics 
furthermore  in determining its liabilities  the company includes amounts for estimated claims incurred but not reported 
the ultimate cost of workers compensation will depend on actual costs incurred to settle the claims and may differ from the liabilities recorded for those claims 
accruals for workers compensation claims are included in accrued expenses in our consolidated balance sheets 
a significant increase in claims or changes in laws may require the company to record additional expenses related to workers compensation 
on the other hand  significantly improved claim experience may result in lower annual expense levels 
income taxes deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases  and net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
the company records a valuation allowance against deferred tax assets for which realization of the asset is not considered more likely than not 
management s judgment is required in determining the realizability of the deferred tax assets and liabilities  and any valuation allowances recorded 
the net deferred tax assets may need to be adjusted in the event that tax rates are modified  or management s estimates of future taxable income change  such that deferred tax assets or liabilities are expected to be recovered or settled at a different tax rate than currently estimated 
in addition  valuation allowances may need to be adjusted in the event that management s estimate of future taxable income changes from the amounts currently estimated 
the company provides for income taxes on a quarterly basis based upon an estimated annual effective tax rate 
in determining this rate  management estimates taxable income for each of the jurisdictions where the company operates  as well as the tax rate that will be in effect for each state and foreign country 
to the extent these estimates change during the year  or that actual results differ from these estimates  the estimated annual tax rate may change between quarterly periods and may differ from the actual effective tax rate for the year 
goodwill impairment the company is required to test goodwill for impairment in accordance with the provisions of fasb statement no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas  as of the end of each fiscal year or earlier during each fiscal year as circumstances require 
in connection with these goodwill tests  the company engages an independent valuation firm to assist management in the determination of the fair values of its reporting units as defined by sfas 
in its determination of the fair values  the firm engaged by the company primarily utilizes a discounted cash flow analysis as well as various other valuation approaches  including i capitalization multiples of companies with investment characteristics resembling those of the reporting units  ii the enterprise value of the company  and iii asset and liability structure 
significant assumptions used in this analysis include i expected future revenue growth rates  operating unit profit margins  and working capital levels  ii a discount rate  and iii a terminal value multiple 
the revenue growth rates  working capital levels and operating unit profit margins are based on management s expectation of future results 
if management s expectations of future operating results change  or if there are changes to other assumptions  the estimate of the fair value of the company s reporting units could change significantly 
such a change could result in additional goodwill impairment charges in future periods  which could have a significant impact on the company s consolidated financial statements 
share based payment with our adoption of statement of financial accounting standards no 
revised  share based payment sfas no 
r  effective december   we are required to record the fair value of share based payment awards as an expense 
in order to determine the fair value of stock options on the date of grant  the company utilizes the black scholes option pricing model 
inherent in this model are assumptions related to expected stock price volatility  option life  risk free interest rate and dividend yield 
expected volatilities are based on historical volatility of our shares using daily price observations over a period consistent with the expected life 
for options granted in fiscal and later  we use the safe harbor guidance in sab to estimate the expected life of options 
the risk free rate is based on the us treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant for periods similar to the expected life 
while the risk free interest rate and dividend yield are less subjective assumptions that  typically  are based on factual data derived from public sources  the expected stock price volatility and option life assumptions require a greater level of judgment which makes them critical accounting estimates 
new accounting pronouncements in december  the fasb issued sfas r  business combinations sfas r 
this statement is effective for us on december   and applies prospectively to business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after december  sfas r significantly changes the accounting for acquisitions 
some of the major provisions are that acquisition related costs will generally be expensed as incurred  contingent consideration will be recorded at fair value on the acquisition date  with adjustments to certain forms of contingent liabilities impacting the results of operations 
the impact that sfas r will have on our consolidated financial statements after adoption will depend on the nature  terms  and size of the acquisitions  if any  we consummate after adoption 
in december  the fasb issued fas no 
 noncontrolling interest in consolidated financial statements fas 
fas re characterizes minority interests in consolidated subsidiaries as non controlling interests and requires the classification of minority interests as a component of equity 
under fas  a change in control will be measured at fair value  with any gain or loss recognized in earnings 
the effective date for fas is for annual periods beginning on or after december  early adoption and retroactive application of fas to fiscal years preceding the effective date are not permitted 
we currently do not have minority interests in our consolidated subsidiaries 
seasonality in the human capital management services segment  pro unlimited does not observe significant seasonal variations in its business 
in the staff augmentation segment  demand for services has historically been lower during the second half of the fourth quarter through the following second quarter  and  generally shows gradual improvement until the second half of the fourth quarter 
the company s quarterly operating results are  however  affected by the number of billing days in the quarter 
management has noted that the observance of seasonal trends has been limited in the current economic climate
