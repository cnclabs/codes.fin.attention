item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
overview ameren executive summary operations in and early  we were able to successfully execute on key aspects of our long term strategic plan 
our strategic plan calls for generation excellence and improvement of customer service and satisfaction 
ue s callaway nuclear plant completed its first ever breaker to breaker run and completed a plant record day refueling and maintenance outage in the fall of in addition  the equivalent availability for ue s coal fired generating units was a solid as compared to in ameren s non rate regulated generation business segment set new generation records  producing approximately million total megawatthours  as equivalent availability for its coal fired units was compared to in amidst the economic challenges facing us and our nation  we have remained focused on our customers and have made significant investments in our energy infrastructure to improve overall reliability and customer satisfaction 
in missouri  through ue s power on reliability program  we buried more than miles of electric line  trimmed trees along more than  miles of overhead line  tested nearly  wood utility poles  and inspected more than  miles of electric line 
in illinois  we targeted the worst performing circuits and aggressively trimmed trees in illinois regulated s  square mile territory and continued to automate its transmission system to elevate its reliability 
we believe that high quality customer service is essential to earning solid returns in our rate regulated businesses 
in missouri  ue received approval of an electric rate increase in january with new rates effective march  the authorized increase in annual electric revenues is approximately million based on a return on equity 
the mopsc rate order authorized a fac  as well as a vegetation management and infrastructure inspection cost tracking mechanism 
the fac and tracking mechanisms improve ue s ability to continue to invest in its infrastructure so that ue will be able to meet its customers expectations for safe and reliable service 
in illinois  the icc authorized in september new electric and gas rates for the ameren illinois utilities effective october  these new rates provide approximately million in additional annual revenue based on allowed returns on equity of nearly 
the icc also approved an increase in the fixed non volumetric monthly charge for natural gas residential and commercial customers such that the ameren illinois utilities now recover of delivery service costs through this charge versus the prior 
the remainder is recovered through volume based charges 
this will make our gas utility earnings less sensitive to volumetric swings 
earnings ameren reported net income of million  or per share  for compared with net income of million  or per share  in the decline in earnings in versus was principally due to higher fuel and related transportation prices  increased spending on utility distribution system reliability  higher plant operations and maintenance costs  milder weather  and net unrealized mark to market losses on nonqualifying hedges  among other things 
those items more than offset the positive items 
the positive items included improved generating plant output and higher realized margins from non rate regulated generation operations  the absence of costs in that were incurred in january associated with electric outages caused by severe ice storms and the amount of these costs that ue will recover as a result of an accounting order issued by the mopsc  the reduced impact in of the illinois electric settlement agreement  the absence in of the march ferc order that resettled costs among miso market participants retroactive to that was recorded in and subsequent recovery of a portion of these costs in through a mopsc order  net increases in electric and natural gas rates  and a lump sum settlement payment from a coal supplier for expected higher fuel costs in as a result of a premature mine closure and contract termination  among other things 
liquidity cash flows from operations of billion in at ameren  along with other funds  were used to pay dividends to common shareholders of million and to partially fund capital expenditures of billion 
the remaining capital expenditures were primarily funded with debt 
we have taken actions to build on our financial strength and enhance our financial flexibility in light of the current difficult economic and capital and credit market conditions 
these actions included the february decision of ameren s board of directors to reduce its common dividend and accessing the capital markets to increase our available liquidity  as well as making significant reductions in our and projected spending plans while still meeting our reliability  environmental  and safety objectives 
outlook the global capital and credit markets experienced extreme volatility and disruption in  and we expect those conditions to continue throughout we believe that the disruption in the capital and credit markets will further weaken global economic conditions 
these weak economic conditions will likely result in volatility in the power and commodity markets  greater risk of defaults by our counterparties  weaker customer sales growth  particularly with respect to industrial sales  higher bad debt expense and possible impairment of goodwill and long lived assets  among other things 

table of contents over the next few years  we continue to expect to make significant investments in our electric and natural gas infrastructure to improve reliability of our distribution systems and to comply with environmental requirements 
from through  we expect our rate regulated rate base to grow approximately per year 
earnings growth in our rate regulated businesses is expected to come from updating existing customer rates to reflect these investments and the current levels of costs ue and the ameren illinois utilities are experiencing 
we consider the and illinois and missouri rate orders to be constructive 
however  the returns that ue and the ameren illinois utilities expect to earn in are below levels allowed by the respective state utility commissions in their last rate orders 
the new rates were based on historic test year data and costs are expected to be higher than the levels recovered in rates 
this is especially true of financing costs in illinois  where sharply higher debt financing costs  which were incurred after our rate cases were filed  are not being recovered in rates 
ue and the ameren illinois utilities will file more frequent rate cases requesting moderate rate increases  as well as continue to seek appropriate cost recovery and tracker mechanisms to mitigate regulatory lag 
in addition  we will continue to optimize ameren s non rate regulated generation s assets  focusing on improving the output of these plants and related energy marketing 
we believe non rate regulated generation s plants will be well positioned for earnings growth in the future should energy prices improve 
we will incur significant costs in future years to comply with existing federal epa and state regulations regarding so  nox  and mercury emissions from coal fired power plants 
between and  ameren expects that certain ameren companies will be required to invest between billion and billion to retrofit their coal fired power plants with pollution control equipment 
any pollution control investments will result in decreased plant availability during construction and significantly higher ongoing operating expenses 
approximately of this investment is expected to be in our missouri regulated operations  and it is therefore expected to be recoverable from ratepayers 
future initiatives regarding greenhouse gas emissions and global warming are subject to active consideration in the us congress 
president obama supports an economy wide cap and trade greenhouse gas reduction program that would reduce emissions to levels by and to below levels by president obama has also indicated support for auctioning of the emission allowances to be distributed under the legislation 
although we cannot predict the date of enactment or the requirements of any global warming legislation or regulations  it is likely that some form of federal greenhouse gas legislation or regulations will become law during president obama s administration 
potential impacts from proposed legislation could vary depending upon proposed co emission limits  the timing of implementation of those limits  the method of allocating allowances  and provisions for cost containment measures 
future federal and state legislation or regulations that mandate limits on the emission of greenhouse gases would result in significant increases in capital expenditures and operating costs  which  in turn  could lead to increased liquidity needs and higher financing costs 
excessive costs to comply with future legislation or regulations might force ue  genco  cilco through aerg and eei and other similarly situated electric power generators to close some coal fired facilities and could lead to possible impairment of assets 
as a result  mandatory limits could have a material adverse impact on ameren s  ue s  genco s  cilco s through aerg and eei s results of operations  financial position  or liquidity

genco s estimated capital expenditures are primarily for compliance with environmental regulations and upgrades to existing coal and gas fired generating facilities 
cilco aerg s estimate includes capital expenditures primarily for compliance with environmental regulations at aerg s generating facilities  as well as generation related activities 
we continually review our generation portfolio and expected power needs 
as a result  we could modify our plan for generation capacity  which could include changing the times when certain assets will be added to or removed from our portfolio  the type of generation asset technology that will be employed  and whether capacity or power may be purchased  among other things 
in addition  ameren and genco are currently considering divestiture of some of genco s smaller non rate regulated generating units 
any changes that we may plan to make for future generating needs could result in significant capital expenditures or losses being incurred  which could be material 
as a result of the disruption and uncertainties in the capital and credit markets  we are actively evaluating opportunities to defer or reduce our planned capital spending 
this included reducing our expenditures from previously expected levels 
see outlook in management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations under part ii  item of this report for further discussion 
environmental capital expenditures ameren  ue  genco  aerg and eei will incur significant costs in future years to comply with existing federal epa and state regulations regarding so  so and mercury emissions from coal fired power plants 
in may  the epa issued regulations with respect to so and so emissions the clean air interstate rule and mercury emissions the clean air mercury rule 
the federal clean air interstate rule requires generating facilities in eastern states  including missouri and illinois where our generating facilities are located  and the district of columbia to participate in cap and trade programs to reduce annual so emissions  annual so emissions  and ozone season so emissions 
the cap and trade program for both annual and ozone season nox emissions went into effect on january  the nox emissions cap and trade program is scheduled to take effect in in february  the us court of appeals for the district of columbia issued a decision that vacated the federal clean air mercury rule 
the court ruled that the epa erred in the method used to remove electric generating units from the list of sources subject to the maximum available control technology requirements under the clean air act 
the epa and a group representing the electric utility industry filed petitions for rehearing  however  the court denied those petitions in may a group representing the electric utility industry and the epa filed petitions for review of the us court of appeals decision with the us supreme court in september and october  respectively 
in february  the epa withdrew its petition to the us supreme court 
in february  the us supreme court denied the petition for review filed by a group representing the electric utility industry 
the impact of this decision is that the epa will move forward with a mact standard for mercury emissions 
the standard is expected to be available in draft form by mid to late  and compliance is expected to be required in the to timeframe 
we are currently evaluating the impact that the court decision will have on our environmental compliance strategy 
at this time  we are unable to predict the outcome of this legal proceeding  the actions the epa or us congress may take in response to the court decision and the timing of such actions 
we also cannot predict at this time the ultimate impact the court decision and resulting regulatory actions will have on our estimated capital costs for compliance with environmental rules 
in july  the us court of appeals for the district of columbia issued a decision that vacated the federal clean air interstate rule 
the court ruled that the regulation contained several fatal flaws  including a regional cap and trade 
table of contents program that cannot be used to facilitate the attainment of ambient air quality standards for ozone and fine particulate matter 
in september  the epa as well as several environmental groups  a group representing the electric utility industry and the national mining association filed petitions for rehearing with the us court of appeals 
in december  the us court of appeals essentially reversed their july decision to vacate the federal clean air interstate rule 
the us court of appeals granted the epa petition for reconsideration and decided to remand the rule to the epa for further action to remedy the rule s flaws in accordance with the us court of appeals july opinion in the case 
the impact of the decision is that the existing illinois and missouri rules to implement the federal clean air interstate rule will remain in effect until the federal clean air interstate rule is revised by the epa at which point the illinois and missouri rules may be subject to change 
the state of missouri adopted state rules to implement the federal clean air interstate rule for regulating so and so emissions from electric generating units in missouri 
the rules are a significant part of missouri s plan to attain existing ambient standards for ozone and fine particulates  as well as meeting the requirements of the federal clean air visibility rule 
as a result of the missouri rules  ue will manage emission allowances and install pollution control equipment 
missouri also adopted state rules to implement the federal clean air mercury rule  however  the state rules are not enforceable as a result of the us court of appeals decision to vacate the federal clean air mercury rule 
we do not believe the court decision that vacated the federal clean air mercury rule will significantly affect pollution control obligations in illinois 
under the mps  illinois generators may defer until the requirement to reduce mercury emissions by in exchange for accelerated installation of nox and nox controls 
to comply with the rule  genco  cilco aerg and eei have begun putting into service equipment designed to reduce mercury emissions 
as a result of the illinois rules  genco  aerg and eei will need to procure allowances and install pollution control equipment 
current plans include the installation of scrubbers for so reduction and optimizing operations of selective catalytic reduction scr systems for nox reduction at certain coal fired plants in illinois 
in october  genco  cilco aerg and eei submitted a request for a variance from the mps to the illinois pollution control board 
in preparing this request  genco  cilco aerg and eei worked with the illinois epa and agreed to the installation of more stringent so and nox controls at various stages between and in order to make the variance proposal environmentally neutral 
in january  the illinois pollution control board denied the variance request on procedural grounds 
genco  cilco aerg and eei filed a motion for reconsideration in february and  with the illinois epa s concurrence  seek to amend the mps within a pending rulemaking pertaining to technical amendments of the underlying mercury regulations 
revisions to the mps within that rulemaking will require illinois pollution control board approval 
if approved  this variance or rule amendment could allow genco to defer approximately million of environmental capital expenditures from the timeframe to the timeframe 
this amount is reduced from the million disclosed in genco s quarterly report on form q for the period ended september   because of revisions to the size and timing of projected environmental capital expenditures if no variance is granted 
a decision is expected in the epa finalized regulations in march that will lower the ambient standard for ozone 
states must submit their nonattainment plans in march a final action by the epa to designate areas as nonattainment is expected in march  and state implementation plans will need to be submitted in unless illinois and missouri seek extensions of various requirement dates 
additional emission reductions may be required as a result of future state implementation plans 
at this time  we are unable to determine the impact such state actions would have on our results of operations  financial position  or liquidity 

table of contents the table below presents estimated capital costs that are based on current technology to comply with the federal clean air interstate rule and related state implementation plans through as well as federal ambient air quality standards including ozone and fine particulates  and the federal clean air visibility rule 
the estimates described below could change depending upon additional federal or state requirements  the implementation of any revisions to the federal clean air interstate rule  the requirements under a mercury mact standard  whether the variance or rule amendment request with respect to the illinois mps discussed above is granted  new technology  variations in costs of material or labor  or alternative compliance strategies  among other reasons 
the timing of estimated capital costs may also be influenced by whether emission allowances are used to comply with any future rules  thereby deferring capital investment

at december   the ameren companies were in compliance with their credit facility  term loan agreement  indenture  and articles of incorporation provisions and covenants 
we consider access to short term and long term capital markets a significant source of funding for capital requirements not satisfied by our operating cash flows 
inability to raise capital on favorable terms  particularly during times of uncertainty in the capital markets  could negatively affect our ability to maintain and expand our businesses 
after assessing our current operating performance  liquidity  and credit ratings see credit ratings below  we believe that we will continue to have access to the capital markets 
however  events beyond our control may create uncertainty in the capital markets or make access to the capital markets uncertain or limited

the new annualized dividend rate of per share would represent a payout rate of based on net income 
the amount and timing of dividends payable on ameren s common stock are within the sole discretion of ameren s board of directors 
the board of directors has not set specific targets or payout parameters when declaring common stock dividends 
however  as it has done in the past  the board of directors is expected to consider various issues  including ameren s overall payout ratio  payout ratios of our peers  projected cash flow and potential future cash flow requirements  historical earnings and cash flow  projected earnings  return on investments with similar risk characteristics  impacts of regulatory orders or legislation  and other key business considerations 
certain of our financial agreements and corporate organizational documents contain covenants and conditions that  among other things  restrict the ameren companies payment of dividends in certain circumstances 
at december   except as discussed below with respect to the million credit facility and the million credit facility  none of these circumstances existed at the ameren companies and  as a result  they were allowed to pay dividends 
ue would be restricted as to dividend payments on its common and preferred stock if it were to extend or defer interest payments on its subordinated debentures 
cips articles of incorporation require its dividend payments on common stock to be based on ratios of common stock to total capitalization and other provisions related to certain operating expenses and accumulations of earned surplus 
genco s indenture includes restrictions that prohibit it from making any dividend payments on common stock if debt service coverage ratios are below a defined threshold 
cilcorp has common and preferred stock dividend payment restrictions if leverage ratio and interest coverage ratio thresholds are not met  or if cilcorp s senior long term debt does not have the ratings described in its indenture 
cilco has restrictions in its articles of incorporation on dividend payments on common stock relative to the ratio of its balance of retained earnings to the annual dividend requirement on its preferred stock 
the million credit facility and the million credit facility limit cips  cilcorp  cilco and ip to common and preferred stock dividend payments of million per year each if cips  cilco s or ip s senior secured long term debt securities or first mortgage bonds  or cilcorp s senior unsecured long term debt securities  have received a below investment grade credit rating from either moody s or s p

table of contents moody s ratings actions on february   moody s affirmed the ratings of ameren and genco but changed their rating outlook to negative from stable 
moody s placed the long term credit ratings of ue under review for possible downgrade and affirmed ue s commercial paper rating 
in addition  moody s affirmed the ratings of cips  cilcorp  cilco and ip and maintained a positive rating outlook on these four companies 
according to moody s  the review of ue s ratings was prompted by declining cash flow coverage metrics  increased operating costs  higher capital expenditures for environmental compliance and transmission and distribution system investment  and significant regulatory lag in the recovery of these costs 
moody s stated that the negative outlook on the credit rating of genco reflected genco s position as a predominantly coal generating company that is likely to be seriously affected by more stringent environmental regulations  including a potential cap or tax on carbon emissions 
the negative outlook on the ratings of ameren  according to moody s  reflects the factors that impacted its subsidiaries  ue and genco 
on may   moody s lowered the credit ratings of ue to baa for its senior secured debt and to baa for its issuer rating and changed the rating outlook to stable 
in its reasons for these actions  moody s reiterated the items noted above  attributing the declining cash flow metrics to increased fuel and purchased power costs  growing capital expenditures for environmental compliance and for transmission system reliability  and higher labor costs 
they noted that ue was one of the few utilities in the country at the time of their report operating without fuel  purchased power  and environmental cost recovery mechanisms 
moody s also placed ue s commercial paper rating on review for possible downgrade due to its review of ameren s short term rating as noted below 
at the same time  the ratings of ameren and genco were changed from negative outlook to being on review for possible downgrade 
on august   moody s downgraded both the issuer and senior unsecured debt ratings of ameren and the senior unsecured debt rating of genco to baa from baa and changed the outlooks on these ratings to stable 
moody s also downgraded the commercial paper ratings of ameren and ue to p from p moody s stated that these downgrades were because of declining consolidated coverage ratios over the last several years and the expectation that ongoing cost pressures and the lack of timely regulatory recovery of some costs will prevent ratios from returning to historical levels in the near term 
on january   moody s affirmed the ratings of cips  cilcorp  cilco and ip and changed their rating outlooks to stable from positive 
according to moody s  the change in the rating outlooks of these four companies was based on the near term expiration of the and million credit facilities in january and related liquidity concerns 
moody s also on january   affirmed the ratings of ameren and ue with a stable outlook based on the january mopsc electric rate order approving a rate increase and a fac for ue 
on february   moody s affirmed the ratings of ameren  ue  cips  genco  cilcorp  cilco  and ip with a stable outlook 
the affirmation reflects moody s view that ameren s announcement to reduce its common dividend by is a conservative  prudent  and credit positive action that will conserve cash and support financial coverage metrics 
moody s stated that the more conservative dividend payout should also help facilitate the renewal of ameren s credit facilities that expire in they stated the dividend reduction should continue to reduce reliance on the credit facilities going forward and will likely be viewed favorably by lenders considering renewing or entering into new facilities with ameren and its subsidiaries  which is important considering currently constrained credit market conditions 
according to moody s  the stable outlook on ameren  ue  cips  genco  cilcorp  cilco  and ip reflects recently constructive rate case outcomes at ue  cips  cilco and ip  including the approval of a fac at ue  the improving regulatory environments for investor owned utilities in illinois and missouri  and moody s expectation that financial and cash flow coverage metrics should remain adequate to maintain current rating levels 
in addition  moody s notes that the recent dividend reduction is supportive of the stable ratings outlooks and provides ameren and its subsidiaries additional cushion at current rating levels

all of ameren s other ratings were affirmed and all outlooks were stable 
at the same time  s p raised the business profiles of cips and ip to strong from satisfactory 
the business profiles of cilcorp and cilco remain satisfactory 
s p stated that the ratings upgrades were due to its assessment that the regulatory and political environment in illinois will be reasonably supportive of investment grade credit quality with regard to the ameren illinois utilities then pending rate cases

table of contents strong to reflect the recent electric rate order issued by the mopsc  which s p viewed as constructive 
see note rate and regulatory matters under part ii  item  of this report for a discussion of the rate order issued by the mopsc on january  s p lowered the business profile of cilco to satisfactory from strong reflecting s p s concerns regarding large capital expenditures needed to meet environmental compliance standards  while relying on falling market prices  due to the economic recession  for recovery 
fitch ratings actions on october   fitch upgraded its issuer credit ratings on cilco to bbb from bb and on cilcorp  cips and ip to bbb from bb 
the senior secured debt ratings were raised at cips and ip to bbb from bbb and at cilco to a from bbb 
senior unsecured debt ratings were raised at cips and ip to bbb from bbb  at cilco to bbb from bbb  and at cilcorp to bbb from bb 
the outlook for each of these entities was changed to stable from rating watch positive 
fitch stated that the ratings upgrades were a result of the expected positive financial impact of electric and gas rate case decisions issued by the icc in september and the reduction in business risk associated with the illinois electric settlement agreement in on february   fitch stated that the reduction in ameren s common stock dividend and other cost cutting measures will be favorable to bondholders and credit quality 
fitch did not make any changes in ameren s or its subsidiaries ratings or outlooks as a result of this action 
collateral postings any adverse change in the ameren companies credit ratings may reduce access to capital and trigger additional collateral postings and prepayments 
such changes may also increase the cost of borrowing and fuel  power and gas supply  among other things  resulting in a negative impact on earnings 
collateral postings and prepayments made with external parties at december   were million  million  million  million  million  and million at ameren  ue  cips  cilcorp  cilco and ip  respectively 
the amount of collateral external counterparties posted with ameren was million at december  sub investment grade issuer or senior unsecured debt ratings lower than bbb or baa at december   could have resulted in ameren  ue  cips  genco  cilcorp  cilco or ip being required to post additional collateral or other assurances for certain trade obligations amounting to million  million  million  million  million  million  and million  respectively 
in addition  changes in commodity prices could trigger additional collateral postings and prepayments 
the cost of borrowing under our credit facilities can also increase or decrease depending upon the credit ratings of the borrower

it should be evaluated independently of any other rating

outlook below are some key trends that may affect the ameren companies financial condition  results of operations  or liquidity in and beyond 
economy and capital and credit markets the global capital and credit markets experienced extreme volatility and disruption in  and we expect those conditions to continue throughout and potentially longer 
several factors have driven this situation  including deteriorating global economic conditions and the weakened condition of major financial institutions  as evidenced by the bankruptcy of lehman 
these conditions have led governments around the world to establish policies and programs that are designed to strengthen the global financial system  to enhance liquidity  and to restore investor confidence 
we believe that these events have several implications for the capital and credit markets  the economy and our industry as a whole  including ameren 
they include the following access to capital markets the extreme disruption in the capital markets has limited the ability of many companies  including the ameren companies  to freely access the capital and credit markets to support their operations and to refinance debt 
we are unable to predict how long these conditions will persist  but we expect the capital markets to remain uncertain throughout and potentially longer 
however  we believe we will continue to have access to the capital markets on terms commercially acceptable to us  as evidenced by ip s sale of million in senior secured notes in october and cilco s sale of million of senior secured notes in december cilcorp and ip have long term debt maturities of million and million  respectively  in in addition  ameren s million term loan agreement is due in we currently expect to issue approximately million of debt at our rate regulated utilities  million at ameren  and approximately million at the non rate regulated generation subsidiaries in credit facilities at december   the ameren companies had in place revolving bank credit facilities aggregating billion 
in total  financial institutions participated in these credit facilities 
in january  billion of these facilities expire  and the revolving billion facility expires in july due to the lehman bankruptcy filing  the size of these facilities was effectively reduced by up to million 
we cannot predict whether other lenders that are currently participating in our credit facilities will declare 
table of contents bankruptcy or otherwise fail to honor their commitments thereunder  and thus reduce the level of access to credit facilities 
we are actively developing plans and strategies to renew these facilities prior to their expiration dates 
we are unable to predict the degree of success we will have in renewing or replacing any of these facilities and whether the size and terms of any new credit facilities will be comparable to the existing facilities 
cost of capital the disruption in the capital and credit markets has led to higher financing costs compared with recent years 
we expect this trend to continue while the current level of uncertainty in the financial markets persists 
economic conditions we believe that the disruption in the capital and credit markets will further weaken global economic conditions 
limited access to capital and credit and higher cost of capital for businesses and consumers will reduce spending and investment  result in job losses  and pressure economic growth for the foreseeable future 
these weak economic conditions will likely result in volatility in the power and commodity markets  greater risk of defaults by our counterparties  weaker customer sales growth  particularly with respect to industrial sales  higher bad debt expense  and possible impairment of goodwill and long lived assets  among other things 
the estimated fair values of cilcorp s illinois regulated reporting unit and non rate regulated generation reporting unit exceeded carrying values by a nominal amount as of october   when we conducted our annual evaluation of goodwill 
as a result  the failure in the future of either of these reporting units to achieve forecasted operating results and cash flows or a decrease in observable market multiples  may reduce their estimated fair value below their carrying value and would likely result in the recognition of a goodwill impairment charge 
we will continue to monitor the actual and forecasted operating results and cash flows of these reporting units for signs of possible declines in estimated fair value and potential goodwill impairment 
we would not necessarily expect any future goodwill impairment charge recorded at the cilcorp reporting unit level to also result in a goodwill impairment charge at the consolidated ameren level because of the aggregation of reporting units 
to date  the level of defaults by counterparties  lower sales growth  and bad debt expense resulting from the weak economy have not significantly affected the ameren companies 
however  we are unable to predict the ultimate impact of these weak economic conditions on our results of operations  financial position  or liquidity 
investment returns the disruption in the capital markets  coupled with weak global economic conditions  has adversely affected financial markets 
as a result  we experienced lower than assumed investment returns in in our pension and postretirement benefit plans 
the market value of plan assets in declined by and within the pension and postretirement benefit plans  respectively  compared with assumed investment returns of for both funds 
these lower returns will increase our future pension and postretirement expenses and pension funding levels 
our future expenses and funding levels will also be affected by future discount rate levels 
based on ameren s assumptions at december   and investment performance in  and reflecting ameren s pension funding policy  ameren expects to make annual contributions of million to million in each of the next five years 
operating and capital expenditures the ameren companies will continue to make significant levels of investments and incur expenditures for their electric and natural gas utility infrastructure in order to improve overall system reliability  comply with environmental regulations  and improve plant performance 
however  due to the significant level of disruption and uncertainties in the capital and credit markets  we are actively evaluating opportunities to defer or reduce planned capital spending and operating expenses to mitigate the risks associated with accessing these uncertain markets 
we took action in this regard by reducing operating and capital expenditures from levels previously expected 
separately  genco  aerg and eei are seeking a variance from the illinois pollution control board to an environmental requirement in illinois that  while environmentally neutral  would defer approximately million of genco s environmental capital expenditures scheduled for through to subsequent years 
any expenditure control initiatives would be balanced against our continued long term commitment to invest in our electric and natural gas infrastructure to provide safe  reliable electric and natural gas delivery services to our customers  to meet federal and state environmental  reliability  and other regulations  and the need to maintain a solid overall liquidity and credit ratings profile to meet our operating  capital and financing needs under challenging capital and credit market conditions 
liquidity at february   ameren  on a consolidated basis  had available liquidity  in the form of cash on hand and amounts available under its existing credit facilities  of approximately billion  excluding unfunded lehman bank facility participation commitments  which was million higher than the same time last year 
we expect our available liquidity to remain at acceptable levels through the end of as we strategically access the capital markets and execute the expenditure control initiatives 
however  we are unable to predict whether significant changes in economic conditions  further disruption in the capital and credit markets  or other unforeseen events could materially impact our estimate 
although we believe that the uncertainty in the capital and credit markets will persist throughout and potentially longer  we do believe that actions taken by the us government and governments around the world will 
table of contents ultimately help ease the extreme volatility and disruption of these markets 
in addition  we believe we will continue to have access to the capital markets on terms commercially acceptable to us 
as discussed above  additional financings are expected through  subject to market conditions 
also  in february  ameren s board of directors made the decision to reduce the common stock dividend 
the dividend was reduced to enhance ameren s financial strength and flexibility as the company executes its long term business strategy through the dramatically weakened state of the economy and the continued uncertainties in the capital  credit  and commodity markets 
in addition  ameren s board of directors was mindful of the company s current business mix and need to make reliability and environmental infrastructure investments 
specifically  this dividend reduction would be consistent with an annual dividend level that would allow ameren to retain approximately million of cash annually  which would provide incremental funds to enhance reliability to meet our customers expectations  satisfy federal and state environmental requirements  reduce our reliance on dilutive equity and high cost debt financings  and enhance our access to the capital and credit markets 
we believe that our expected operating cash flows  capital expenditures  and related financing plans including accessing our existing credit facilities will provide the necessary liquidity to meet our operating  investing  and financing needs through the end of  at a minimum 
however  there can be no assurance that significant changes in economic conditions  further disruptions in the capital and credit markets  or other unforeseen events will not materially impact our ability to execute our expected operating  capital or financing plans  including our plans to renew or replace our existing credit facilities 
current capital expenditure plans between and  ameren expects that certain ameren companies will be required to invest between billion and billion to retrofit their coal fired power plants with pollution control equipment in compliance with emissions related environmental laws and regulations 
any pollution control investments will result in decreased plant availability during construction and significantly higher ongoing operating expenses 
approximately of this investment is expected to be in our missouri regulated operations  and it is therefore expected to be recoverable from ratepayers 
the recoverability of amounts expended in non rate regulated generation operations will depend on whether market prices for power adjust as a result of market conditions reflecting increased environmental costs for generators 
future federal and state legislation or regulations that mandate limits on the emission of greenhouse gases would result in significant increases in capital expenditures and operating costs 
excessive costs to comply with future legislation or regulations might force ameren and other similarly situated electric power generators to close some coal fired facilities 
investments to control carbon emissions at ameren s coal fired power plants would significantly increase future capital expenditures and operation and maintenance expenses 
ue continues to evaluate its longer term needs for new baseload and peaking electric generation capacity 
at this time  ue does not expect to require new baseload generation capacity until to however  due to the significant time required to plan  acquire permits for  and build a baseload power plant  ue is actively studying future plant alternatives  including those that would use coal or nuclear fuel 
in july  ue filed a cola with the nrc for a potential new nuclear unit at ue s existing callaway county  missouri  nuclear plant site 
pursuant to doe s procedures  in ue filed with the doe part i and part ii of its application for a loan guarantee to support the potential construction and operation of a new nuclear unit 
ue has also signed contracts for certain long lead time nuclear unit related equipment heavy forgings 
the filing of the cola and the doe loan guarantee application and entering into these contracts does not mean a decision has been made to build a new nuclear unit 
these are only the first steps in the regulatory licensing and procurement process 
they are necessary actions to preserve the option to develop a new nuclear unit 
as of december   ue spent million and million on the cola and heavy forgings  respectively 
if ue elects not to build a new nuclear unit  we believe the cola and heavy forgings could be sold in the open market during this time of expected growth in the nuclear industry 
the missouri clean and renewable energy construction act was introduced in the missouri senate and house of representatives in early this bill would allow the mopsc to authorize the use of certain financing tools for constructing clean and renewable electric generation  including a tool that would allow utilities to recover the costs of financing and tax payments associated with a new generating plant while that plant is being constructed 
ue has stated that legislation allowing timely recovery of financing costs during construction must be enacted in order for ue to elect to build a new nuclear unit to meet its baseload generation capacity needs 
however  passage of such legislation does not commit or guarantee that ue will elect to build a new nuclear unit 
ue is unable to predict whether this legislation will be adopted by lawmakers 
ue intends to submit a license extension application with the nrc to extend its callaway nuclear plant s operating license by years so that the operating license will expire in ue cannot predict whether or when the nrc will approve the license extension 
over the next few years  we expect to make significant investments in our electric and natural gas infrastructure and to incur increased operations and maintenance expenses to improve overall system reliability 
we are projecting higher labor and material costs for these capital expenditures 
we expect these costs or investments at our rate regulated businesses 
table of contents to be ultimately recovered in rates  although regulatory lag could materially impact our cash flows and related financing needs 
increased investments for environmental compliance  reliability improvement  and new baseload capacity will result in higher depreciation and financing costs 
revenues the earnings of ue  cips  cilco and ip are largely determined by the regulation of their rates by state agencies 
rising costs  including fuel and related transportation  purchased power  labor  material  depreciation and financing costs  coupled with increased capital and operations and maintenance expenditures targeted at enhanced distribution system reliability and environmental compliance  are expected 
ameren  ue  cips  cilco and ip anticipate regulatory lag until requests to increase rates to continue to recover such costs on a timely basis are granted by state regulators 
ameren  ue  cips  cilco and ip expect more frequent rate cases will be necessary in the future 
ue has agreed not to file a natural gas delivery rate case before march  the icc issued a consolidated order in september approving a net increase in annual revenues for electric delivery service of million in the aggregate cips million increase  cilco million decrease and ip million increase and a net increase in annual revenues for natural gas delivery service of million in the aggregate cips million increase  cilco million decrease  and ip million increase  based on a return on equity with respect to electric delivery service and a return on equity with respect to natural gas delivery service 
these rate changes were effective on october  because of the ameren illinois utilities pledge to keep the overall residential electric bill increase resulting from these rate changes during the first year to less than for each utility  ip will not recover approximately million in revenue in the first year the electric delivery service rates are in effect 
thereafter  residential electric delivery service rates will be adjusted to recover the full increase 
in addition  the icc changed the depreciable lives used in calculating depreciation expense for the ameren illinois utilities electric and natural gas rates 
as a result  annual depreciation expense for the ameren illinois utilities will be reduced for financial reporting purposes by a net million in the aggregate cips million reduction  cilco million reduction  and ip million increase 
because of continuing investments in the ameren illinois utilities infrastructure  rising operating costs and costs of capital  the ameren illinois utilities are not expected to earn the return on equity allowed in the icc september consolidated order 
the ameren illinois utilities return on equity in is estimated to be approximately 
as a result  rate case filings with the icc are being targeted for late in the second quarter or early in the third quarter of the mopsc issued an electric rate order in january approving an increase in annual electric revenues of approximately million based on a return on equity  a capital structure composed of common equity  and a rate base of billion 
the rate change was effective march  in addition  pursuant to the accounting order issued by the mopsc in april  the rate order concluded that the million of operations and maintenance expenses incurred as a result of a severe ice storm in january should be amortized and recovered over a five year period starting march  the mopsc also allowed recovery of million of costs associated with a march ferc order that resettled costs among miso market participants 
ue recorded a regulatory asset for these costs at december   which will be amortized and recovered over a two year period beginning march  because of continuing investments in ue s utility infrastructure  rising operating costs and costs of capital  ue is not expected to earn the return on equity allowed in the mopsc s january electric rate order during ue s return on equity in is estimated to be approximately 
as a result  ue expects to file another electric rate case in missouri later this year 
the exact timing will depend on the timing and magnitude of cost increases and rate base additions  among other things 
in current and future rate cases  ue  cips  cilco and ip will continue to seek cost recovery and tracking mechanisms from their state regulators to reduce regulatory lag 
in the icc consolidated electric and natural gas rate order issued in september  the icc rejected the ameren illinois utilities requested rate adjustment mechanisms for electric infrastructure investments 
as an alternative to the ameren illinois utilities requested decoupling of natural gas revenues from sales volumes  the icc order approved an increase in the percentage of costs to be recovered through fixed non volumetric residential and commercial customer charges to from 
this increase will impact quarterly results of operations and cash flows but is not expected to have any impact on annual margins 
the icc also approved an increase in the supply cost adjustment sca factors for the ameren illinois utilities 
the sca is a charge applied only to the bills of customers who take their power supply from the ameren illinois utilities 
the change in the sca factors is expected to result in increased electric revenues of million per year in the aggregate cips million  cilco million  and ip million covering the increased cost of administering the ameren illinois utilities power supply responsibilities 
in the mopsc electric rate order issued in january  the mopsc approved ue s implementation of a fac and a vegetation management and infrastructure inspection cost tracking mechanism 
the fac allows an adjustment of electric rates three times per year for a pass through to customers of of changes in fuel 
table of contents and purchased power costs  net of off system revenues  including miso costs and revenues  above or below the amount set in base rates  subject to mopsc prudency review 
the vegetation management and infrastructure inspection cost tracking mechanism provides for the tracking of expenditures that are greater or less than amounts provided for in ue s annual revenues for electric service in a particular year  subject to a limitation on increases in any one year 
the tracked amounts may be reflected in rates set in future rate cases 
ue provides power to noranda s smelter plant in new madrid  missouri  which has historically used approximately four million megawatthours of power annually  making noranda ue s single largest customer 
as a result of a major winter ice storm in january  noranda s smelter plant experienced a power outage related to non ue lines delivering power to the substation serving the plant 
noranda stated that the outage affected approximately of the smelter plant s capacity and that based on preliminary information and management s initial assessment  restoring full plant capacity may take up to months  with partial capacity phased in during the month period 
to the extent ue s sales to noranda are reduced  generation made available could be sold as off system sales 
however  the fac approved in the mopsc electric rate order would require ue to flow substantially all of the off system revenues to customers 
if this were to occur  and the noranda smelter plant operates at capacity for months  ue estimates its pretax earnings during such period could be reduced by up to approximately million due to the loss of up to approximately million megawatthours of retail sales 
in order to adjust the fac for this unanticipated event  ue sought rehearing by the mopsc of its january electric rate order in february  to allow ue to first recover from the off system sales any revenues it would lose as a result of the reduced tariff sales to noranda with any excess revenues collected being provided to customers through the fac 
also in february  other parties to the rate case filed for rehearing of certain aspects of the mopsc order 
in february  the mopsc denied all rate case rehearing requests filed by ue and other parties 
ue continues to consider other alternatives to recover any lost revenues resulting from the noranda power outage 
the illinois electric settlement agreement reached in provides approximately billion over a four year period that began in to fund rate relief for certain electric customers in illinois  including approximately million to customers of the ameren illinois utilities 
funding for the settlement is coming from electric generators in illinois and certain illinois electric utilities 
the ameren illinois utilities  genco  and aerg agreed to fund an aggregate of million  of which the following contributions remained to be made at december  ameren cips cilco illinois regulated ip genco cilco aerg a a total a estimated 
in january  the icc approved the electric power procurement plan filed by the ipa for both the ameren illinois utilities and commonwealth edison company 
the plan outlined the wholesale products capacity  energy swaps  and renewable energy credits that the ipa will procure on behalf of the ameren illinois utilities for the period of june   through may  the products will be procured through a rfp process  during the first half of the ameren illinois utilities will be allowed to pass through to customers the costs of procuring electric power supply with no markup by the utility  plus any reasonable costs that the utility incurs in arranging and providing for the supply of electric power 
as part of the illinois electric settlement agreement  the ameren illinois utilities entered into financial contracts with marketing company for the benefit of genco and aerg  to lock in energy prices for to  megawatts annually of their round the clock power requirements during the period june  to december   at then relevant market prices 
these financial contracts do not include capacity  are not load following products and do not involve the physical delivery of energy 
under the terms of the illinois electric settlement agreement  these financial contracts are deemed prudent  and the ameren illinois utilities are permitted full recovery of their costs in rates 
in addition  the illinois electric settlement agreement would allow the ameren illinois utilities to lease or invest in generation facilities  subject to icc approval 
volatile power prices in the midwest can affect the amount of revenues ameren  ue though to a lesser extent after the implementation of ue s fac  genco  cilco through aerg and eei generate by marketing power into the wholesale and spot markets and can influence the cost of power purchased in the spot markets 
lower prices are expected in as compared with the availability and performance of ue s  genco s  aerg s and eei s electric generation fleet can materially impact their revenues 
genco and aerg are seeking to raise the equivalent availability and capacity factors of their power plants over the long term through greater investments and a process improvement program 
the non rate regulated generation segment expects to generate million megawatthours of power in genco million  aerg million  eei million based on expected power prices in should power 
table of contents prices rise more than expected in  the non rate regulated generation segment has the capacity and availability to sell more generation 
in  two million contracted megawatthours of genco s and aerg s legacy power supply agreements  which had an average embedded selling price of per megawatthour  expired 
these agreements were replaced with market based sales 
the marketing strategy for the non rate regulated generation segment is to optimize generation output in a low risk manner to minimize volatility of earnings and cash flow  while seeking to capitalize on its low cost generation fleet to provide solid  sustainable returns 
to accomplish this strategy  the non rate regulated generation segment has established hedge targets for near term years 
through a mix of physical and financial sales contracts  marketing company targets to hedge non rate regulated generation s expected output by to for the following year  to for two years out  and to for three years out 
as of february   marketing company had sold approximately of non rate regulated generation s expected generation  at an average price of per megawatthour  and had sold approximately of non rate regulated generation s generation at an average price of per megawatthour 
the development of ancillary services and capacity markets in miso could increase the electric margins of ue  genco  aerg and eei 
ancillary services are services necessary to support the transmission of energy from generation resources to loads while maintaining reliable operation of the transmission provider s system 
miso s regional wholesale ancillary services market began in january we expect miso will begin development of a capacity market now that its ancillary services market is in place 
a capacity requirement obligates a load serving entity to acquire capacity sufficient to meet its obligations 
ue and the ameren illinois utilities have committed to developing energy efficiency programs for their customers 
ue expects it will spend million on electric energy efficiency programs in that number will increase to million annually by the ameren illinois utilities expect to spend million  million  and million in the   and program years  respectively  in accordance with their electric energy efficiency and demand response plan approved by the icc in the ameren illinois utilities also expect to spend million  million  and million in the   and program years  respectively  in accordance with their natural gas energy efficiency plan approved by the icc in the illinois program years run from june through may the costs incurred by the ameren illinois utilities are recoverable from customers through rate riders 
future energy efficiency programs developed by ue  cips  cilco and ip and others could also result in reduced demand for our electric generation and our electric and gas transmission and distribution services 
fuel and purchased power in  of ameren s electric generation ue  genco  aerg  eei was supplied by coal fired power plants 
about of the coal used by these plants ue  genco  aerg  eei was delivered by rail from the powder river basin in wyoming 
in the past  deliveries from the powder river basin have been restricted because of rail maintenance  weather  and derailments 
as of december   coal inventories for ue  genco  aerg and eei were at targeted levels 
disruptions in coal deliveries could cause ue  genco  aerg and eei to pursue a strategy that could include reducing sales of power during low margin periods  buying higher cost fuels to generate required electricity  and purchasing power from other sources 
genco is incurring incremental fuel costs in to replace coal from an illinois mine that was prematurely closed by its owner at the end of a settlement agreement reached with the coal mine owner in june fully reimbursed genco  in the form of a lump sum payment of million  for increased costs for coal and transportation that it incurred in million and expects to incur in million 
the entire settlement was recorded in earnings  so ameren s and genco s earnings in will be lower than they otherwise would have been 
the annual nox trading program under the federal clean air interstate rule was reinstated by the us court of appeals for the district of columbia in december at this time  genco and aerg may not have sufficient nox allowances to meet forecasted obligations under the annual nox trading program 
the costs of these allowances would depend on market prices at the time these allowances are purchased 
genco and aerg currently estimate that they could incur additional fuel expense in of million and million  respectively  to purchase additional nox allowances to come into compliance with the program 
ameren s fuel costs including transportation are expected to increase in and beyond 
see item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk of this report for additional information about the percentage of fuel and transportation requirements that are price hedged for through other costs in december  there was a breach of the upper reservoir at ue s taum sauk pumped storage hydroelectric facility 
this resulted in significant flooding in the local area  which damaged a state park 
ue has settled with the ferc and the state of missouri all issues associated with the december taum sauk incident 
in addition  ue received approval from ferc to rebuild the upper reservoir at its taum sauk plant and is in the process of rebuilding the facility 
the estimated cost to rebuild the upper reservoir is in the range of million 
ue expects the taum sauk plant to be out of service through early ue believes 
table of contents that substantially all damages and liabilities caused by the breach  including costs related to the settlement agreement with the state of missouri  the cost of rebuilding the plant  and the cost of replacement power  up to million annually  will be covered by insurance 
insurance will not cover lost electric margins and penalties paid to ferc 
under ue s insurance policies  all claims by or against ue are subject to review by its insurance carriers 
as a result of this breach  ue is engaged in litigation initiated by certain private parties and the department of the army  corps of engineers 
we are unable to predict the timing or outcomes of this litigation  or its possible effect on ue s results of operation  financial position  or liquidity

ue s callaway nuclear plant had a day scheduled refueling and maintenance outage during the fourth quarter of ue s callaway nuclear plant s next scheduled refueling and maintenance outage is in the spring of during a scheduled outage  which occurs every months  maintenance and purchased power costs increase  and the amount of excess power available for sale decreases  versus non outage years 
over the next few years  we expect rising employee benefit costs  as well as higher insurance premiums as a result of insurance market conditions and loss experience  among other things 
other under an executory tolling agreement  cilco purchased steam  chilled water  and electricity from medina valley  which cilco in turn sold to an industrial customer 
in january  cilco transferred both the tolling agreement and the related power supply agreement with the industrial customer to marketing company 
the transfer of these agreements is expected to benefit cilco s non rate regulated pretax operating generation income by million compared with its operating income 
a ballot initiative passed by missouri voters in november created a renewable energy portfolio requirement 
ue and other missouri investor owned utilities will be required to purchase or generate electricity from renewable energy sources equaling at least of native load sales by  with that percentage increasing in subsequent years to at least by  subject to a limit on customer rate impacts 
at least of each portfolio requirement must be derived from solar energy 
compliance with the renewable energy portfolio requirement can be achieved through the procurement of renewable energy or renewable energy credits 
rules are required to be issued by the mopsc to implement the law 
ue expects that any related costs or investments would ultimately be recovered in rates 
the above items could have a material impact on our results of operations  financial position  or liquidity 
additionally  in the ordinary course of business  we evaluate strategies to enhance our results of operations  financial position  or liquidity 
these strategies may include acquisitions  divestitures  opportunities to reduce costs or increase revenues  and other strategic initiatives to increase ameren s shareholder value 
we are unable to predict which  if any  of these initiatives will be executed 
the execution of these initiatives may have a material impact on our future results of operations  financial position  or liquidity

accounting matters critical accounting estimates preparation of the financial statements and related disclosures in compliance with gaap requires the application of appropriate technical accounting rules and guidance  as well as the use of estimates 
these estimates involve judgments regarding many factors which in and of themselves could materially affect the financial statements and disclosures

based upon our intent and ability to physically deliver commodities purchased and sold 
further  our forecasted purchases and sales also support our designation of some fair valued derivative instruments as cash flow hedges 
fair value of our derivatives is measured in accordance with sfas no 
 which provides a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes inputs to valuation techniques 
we use valuation techniques that maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs 
without observable inputs  we use certain assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability  including assumptions about risks inherent in the inputs to the valuation 
our valuations also reflect our own assessment of counterparty default risk using the best internal and external information available 
if we were required to discontinue our use of the normal purchase and normal sales exception or cash flow hedge treatment for some of our contracts  the impact of changes in fair value for the applicable contracts could be material to our earnings

effects of inflation and changing prices our rates for retail electric and gas utility service are regulated by the mopsc and the icc 
nonretail electric rates are regulated by ferc 
adjustments to rates are based on a regulatory process that reviews a historical period 
as a result  revenue increases will lag behind changing prices 
inflation affects our operations  earnings  stockholders equity  and financial performance 
the current replacement cost of our utility plant substantially exceeds our recorded historical cost 
under existing regulatory practice  only the historical cost of plant is recoverable from customers 
as a result  cash flows designed to provide recovery of historical costs through depreciation might not be adequate to replace the plant in future years 
our non rate regulated generation businesses do not have regulated recovery mechanisms 
historically  in ue s missouri electric utility jurisdiction  there was no tariff for adjusting rates to accommodate changes in the cost of fuel for electric generation or the cost of purchased power 
as a part of the electric rate order issued by the mopsc on january   ue was granted permission to put in place  effective march   a fac 
see note rate and regulatory matters to our financial statements under part ii  item  of this report for information on ue s electric rate order 
in july  a law was enacted that enables the mopsc to also put in place mechanisms for missouri s utilities to recover environmental costs directly from customers outside of a rate case proceeding 
the mopsc initiated a proceeding in december to develop revised rules for the environmental cost recovery mechanisms 
rules for the environmental cost recovery mechanism are expected to be approved by the mopsc during the second quarter of and will be effective once published in the missouri register 
ue will not be able to implement an environmental cost recovery mechanism until so authorized by the mopsc as part of a rate case proceeding

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk is the risk of changes in value of a physical asset or a financial instrument  derivative or nonderivative  caused by fluctuations in market variables such as interest rates  commodity prices  and equity security prices 
a derivative is a contract whose value is dependent on  or derived from  the value of some underlying asset 
the following discussion of our risk management activities includes forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
actual results could differ materially from those projected in the forward looking statements 
we handle market risks in accordance with established policies  which may include entering into various derivative transactions 
in the normal course of business  we also face risks that are either nonfinancial or nonquantifiable 
such risks  principally business  legal and operational risks  are not part of the following discussion 
our risk management objective is to optimize our physical generating assets and to pursue market opportunities within prudent risk parameters 
our risk management policies are set by a risk management steering committee  which is composed of senior level ameren officers 
interest rate risk we are exposed to market risk through changes in interest rates associated with long term and short term variable rate debt  fixed rate debt  commercial paper  and auction rate long term debt 
we manage our interest rate exposure by controlling the amount of these instruments we have within our total capitalization portfolio and by monitoring the effects of market changes in interest rates 
the following table presents the estimated increase in our annual interest expense and decrease in net income if interest rates were to increase by on variable rate debt outstanding at december  interest expense net income a ameren b ue cips genco c cilcorp cilco ip c c a calculations are based on an effective tax rate of 
b includes intercompany eliminations 
c less than million 
the estimated changes above do not consider potential reduced overall economic activity that would exist in such an environment 
in the event of a significant change in interest rates  management would probably act to further mitigate our exposure to this market risk 
however  due to the uncertainty of the specific actions that would be taken and their possible effects  this sensitivity analysis assumes no change in our financial structure 
insured tax exempt auction rate bonds certain auction rate tax exempt environmental improvement and pollution control revenue bonds previously issued for the benefit of ue  cips  cilco and ip through governmental authorities were insured by monoline bond insurers 
see note long term debt and equity financings under part ii  item  of this report for a description and details of this indebtedness 
as a result of developments in the capital markets with respect to residential mortgage backed securities and collateralized debt obligations  the credit rating agencies have downgraded the credit ratings of the monoline bond insurers that insured such securities 
as a result  our insured auction rate bonds were similarly downgraded 
in  we experienced higher interest expense and or failed auctions  in which there were not sufficient clearing bids in an auction to set the interest rate for a portion of our auction rate bonds 
according to press reports  many other series of auction rate securities similarly experienced failed auctions 
to mitigate the effect of these credit ratings downgrades and the resulting impact on the interest rates of our auction rate tax exempt environmental improvement and pollution control revenue bonds  we redeemed all of ue s  cips  cilco s and ip s outstanding auction rate bonds  except for ue s series and series a  b and c bonds  which had an aggregate balance of million at december   and interest rates ranging from to during the year ended december  in april  ue and ip issued senior secured notes in the principal amount of million and million  respectively  to refinance their auction rate indebtedness

credit risk credit risk represents the loss that would be recognized if counterparties fail to perform as contracted 
nymex traded futures contracts are supported by the financial and credit quality of the clearing members of the nymex and have nominal credit risk 
in all other transactions  we are exposed to credit risk in the event of nonperformance by the counterparties to the transaction 
our physical and financial instruments are subject to credit risk consisting of trade accounts receivables and executory contracts with market risk exposures 
the risk associated with trade receivables is mitigated by the large number of customers in a broad range of industry groups who make up our customer base 

table of contents the increase in electric rates in illinois  and a related increase in extended payment plan arrangements  resulted in an increase in the ameren illinois utilities past due accounts receivable balances during and the first quarter of such past due balances have improved during the last nine months of  primarily as a result of enhanced collection efforts and an increase in the volume of write offs of past due balances deemed uncollectible 
the ameren illinois utilities will continue to monitor the impact of increased electric rates on customer collections and to make adjustments to their allowances for doubtful accounts  as deemed necessary  to ensure that such allowances are adequate to cover estimated uncollectible customer account balances

we establish credit limits for these counterparties and monitor the appropriateness of these limits on an ongoing basis through a credit risk management program 
it involves daily exposure reporting to senior management  master trading and netting agreements  and credit support  such as letters of credit and parental guarantees 
we also analyze each counterparty s financial condition before we enter into sales  forwards  swaps  futures or option contracts  and we monitor counterparty exposure associated with our leveraged lease

the ameren illinois utilities will be exposed to credit risk in the event of nonperformance by the parties contributing to the illinois comprehensive rate relief and assistance programs under the illinois electric settlement agreement 
the agreement provides to certain electric customers of the ameren illinois utilities million in rate relief over a four year period that commenced in under funding agreements among the parties contributing to the rate relief and assistance programs  at the end of each month  the ameren illinois utilities bill the participating generators for their proportionate share of that month s rate relief and assistance  which is due in days  or drawn from the funds provided by the generators escrow

equity price risk our costs for providing defined benefit retirement and postretirement benefit plans are dependent upon a number of factors  including the rate of return on plan assets 
ameren manages plan assets in accordance with the prudent investor guidelines contained in erisa 
ameren s goal is to earn the highest possible return on plan assets consistent with its tolerance for risk 
ameren delegates investment management to specialists in each asset class 
where appropriate  ameren provides the investment manager with guidelines that specify allowable and prohibited investment types 
ameren regularly monitors manager performance and compliance with investment guidelines 
the expected return on plan assets is based on historical and projected rates of return for current and planned asset classes in the investment portfolio 
assumed projected rates of return for each asset class were selected after an analysis of historical experience  future expectations  and the volatility of the various asset classes 
after considering the target asset allocation for each asset class  we adjusted the overall expected rate of return for the portfolio for historical and expected experience of active portfolio management results compared with benchmark returns and for the effect of expenses paid from plan assets 
in future years  the costs of such plans reflected in net income  oci  or regulatory assets  and cash contributions to the plans could increase materially  without pension asset portfolio investment returns equal to or in excess of our assumed return on plan assets of

ue also maintains a trust fund  as required by the nrc and missouri law  to fund certain costs of nuclear plant decommissioning 
as of december   this fund was invested primarily in domestic equity securities and debt securities 
it totaled million in million 
by maintaining a portfolio that includes long term equity investments  ue seeks to maximize the returns to be used to fund nuclear decommissioning costs within acceptable parameters of risk 
however  the equity securities included in the portfolio are exposed to price fluctuations in equity markets 
the fixed rate  fixed income securities are exposed to changes in interest rates 
ue actively monitors the portfolio by benchmarking the performance of its investments against certain indices and by maintaining and periodically reviewing established target allocation percentages of the assets of the trust to various investment options 
ue s exposure to equity price market risk is in large part mitigated  because ue is currently allowed to recover its decommissioning costs  which would include unfavorable investment results  through electric rates 

table of contents foreign currency risk ameren and ue are exposed to foreign currency exchange risk from ue s procurement agreement related to construction of a potential new nuclear unit 
this agreement provides a fixed price for heavy forgings as well as consulting services to aid with design certification 
the agreement requires ue to pay for goods and services in euros 
ue uses foreign currency forward contracts for the purchase of euros to mitigate the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates  which could affect the amount of us dollars required to satisfy the obligation denominated in euros 
to the extent the value of the us dollar versus the euro declines  the effect would be reflected in construction work in process within property and plant  net  and would be subject to routine depreciation and impairment considerations 
commodity price risk we are exposed to changes in market prices for electricity  fuel  and natural gas 
ue s  genco s  aerg s and eei s risks of changes in prices for power sales are partially hedged through sales agreements 
genco  aerg and eei also seek to sell power forward to wholesale  municipal and industrial customers to limit exposure to changing prices 
we also attempt to mitigate financial risks through risk management programs and policies  which include forward hedging programs  and the use of derivative financial instruments primarily forward contracts  futures contracts  option contracts  and financial swap contracts 
however  a portion of the generation capacity of ue  genco  aerg and eei is not contracted through physical or financial hedge arrangements and is therefore exposed to volatility in market prices 
the following table shows how our earnings might decrease if power prices were to decrease by on unhedged economic generation for through net income a ameren b ue genco cilco aerg eei a calculations are based on an effective tax rate of 
b includes amounts for ameren registrant and nonregistrant subsidiaries and intercompany eliminations 
ameren also uses its portfolio management and trading capabilities both to manage risk and to deploy risk capital to generate additional returns 
due to our physical presence in the market  we are able to identify and pursue opportunities  which can generate additional returns through portfolio management and trading activities 
all of this activity is performed within a controlled risk management process 
we establish value at risk var and stop loss limits that are intended to prevent any negative material financial impact 
on september   lehman filed for protection under chapter of the federal bankruptcy code in the us bankruptcy court in the southern district of new york 
at that time  ue  cips  genco  ip  marketing company and afs were counterparties with lehman brothers commodity services inc lehman commodity services  a subsidiary of lehman  in energy commodity transactions that support their utility and generation businesses 
the obligations of lehman commodity services were guaranteed by lehman  and the lehman bankruptcy filing gives ue  cips  genco  ip  marketing company and afs the right to terminate any open transactions 
on october   ameren sent notice to lehman commodity services terminating all transactions between ue  genco  and marketing company and lehman commodity services 
as of december   ameren s and its subsidiaries direct exposure to lehman commodity services  based on existing transactions and current market prices  was estimated to be less than million before taxes  collectively 
we manage risks associated with changing prices of fuel for generation using similar techniques as those used to manage risks associated with changing market prices for electricity 
most ue  genco and aerg fuel supply contracts are physical forward contracts 
genco  aerg and eei do not have the ability to pass through higher fuel costs to their customers for electric operations 
prior to march  ue did not have this ability either except through a general rate proceeding 
as a part of the january mopsc electric rate order  ue was granted permission to put a fac in place which was effective march  the fac allows ue to recover directly from its electric customers of changes in fuel and purchased power costs  net of off system revenues  including miso costs and revenues  above or below the amount set in base rates  subject to mopsc prudency review 
thus  ue remains exposed to of changes in its fuel and purchased power costs  net of off system revenues 
ue  genco  aerg and eei have entered into long term contracts with various suppliers to purchase coal to manage their exposure to fuel prices 
the coal hedging strategy is intended to secure a reliable coal supply while reducing exposure to commodity price volatility 
price and volumetric risk mitigation is accomplished primarily through periodic bid procedures  whereby the amount of coal purchased is determined by the current market prices and the minimum and maximum coal purchase guidelines for the given year 
ue  genco  aerg and eei generally purchase coal up to five years in advance  but we may purchase coal beyond five years to take advantage of favorable deals or market conditions 
the strategy also allows for the decision not to purchase coal to avoid unfavorable market conditions 
transportation costs for coal and natural gas can be a significant portion of fuel costs 
ue  genco  aerg and eei typically hedge coal transportation forward to provide supply certainty and to mitigate transportation price volatility 
natural gas transportation expenses for ameren s gas distribution utility companies and the gas fired generation units of ue  genco  aerg and eei are regulated by ferc through approved tariffs governing the rates  
table of contents terms and conditions of transportation and storage services 
certain firm transportation and storage capacity agreements held by the ameren companies include rights to extend the contracts prior to the termination of the primary term 
depending on our competitive position  we are able in some instances to negotiate discounts to these tariff rates for our requirements 
the following table presents the percentages of the projected required supply of coal and coal transportation for our coal fired power plants  nuclear fuel for ue s callaway nuclear plant  natural gas for our cts and retail distribution  as appropriate  and purchased power needs of cips  cilco and ip  which own no generation  that are price hedged over the five year period through  as of december  the projected required supply of these commodities could be significantly affected by changes in our assumptions for such matters as customer demand of our electric generation and our electric and natural gas distribution services  generation output  and inventory levels  among other matters

larger customers are purchasing power from the competitive markets

table of contents the following table shows how our total fuel expense might increase and how our net income might decrease if coal and coal transportation costs were to increase by on any requirements not currently covered by fixed price contracts for the five year period through coal transportation fuel expense net income a fuel expense net income a ameren b ue genco cilcorp cilco eei a calculations are based on an effective tax rate of 
b includes amounts for ameren registrant and nonregistrant subsidiaries 
in addition  coal and coal transportation costs are sensitive to the price of diesel fuel as a result of rail freight fuel surcharges 
if diesel fuel costs were to increase or decrease by gallon  ameren s fuel expense could increase or decrease by million annually ue million  genco million  aerg million and eei million 
as of december   ameren had price hedged approximately of expected fuel surcharges in in the event of a significant change in coal prices  ue  genco  aerg and eei would probably take actions to further mitigate their exposure to this market risk 
however  due to the uncertainty of the specific actions that would be taken and their possible effects  this sensitivity analysis assumes no change in our financial structure or fuel sources 
with regard to exposure for commodity price risk for nuclear fuel  ue has fixed priced and base price with escalation agreements  or it uses inventories that provide some price hedge to fulfill its callaway nuclear plant needs for uranium  conversion  enrichment  and fabrication services 
there is no fuel reloading scheduled for or ue has price hedges for of the to nuclear fuel requirements 
although nuclear fuel market prices declined in  pricing remains subject to an unpredictable supply and demand environment 
ue has continued to follow a strategy of managing inventory of nuclear fuel as an inherent price hedge 
new long term uranium contracts are almost exclusively market price related with an escalating price floor 
new long term enrichment contracts usually have some market price related component 
ue expects to enter into additional contracts from time to time in order to supply nuclear fuel during the expected life of the callaway nuclear plant  at prices which cannot now be accurately predicted 
unlike the electricity and natural gas markets  nuclear fuel markets have limited financial instruments available for price hedging  so most hedging is done through inventories and forward contracts  if they are available 
with regard to the electric generating operations for ue  genco and aerg that are exposed to changes in market prices for natural gas used to run cts  the natural gas procurement strategy is designed to ensure reliable and immediate delivery of natural gas while minimizing costs 
we optimize transportation and storage options and price risk by structuring supply agreements to maintain access to multiple gas pools and supply basins 
through the market allocation process  ue  cips  genco  cilco and ip have been granted ftrs associated with the miso day two energy market 
in addition  marketing company has acquired ftrs for its participation in the pjm northern illinois market 
the ftrs are intended to mitigate expected electric transmission congestion charges related to the physical electricity business 
depending on the congestion and prices at various points on the electric transmission grid  ftrs could result in either charges or credits 
complex grid modeling tools are used to determine which ftrs to nominate in the ftr allocation process 
there is a risk of incorrectly modeling the amount of ftrs needed  and there is the potential that the ftrs could be ineffective in mitigating transmission congestion charges 
with regard to ue s natural gas distribution business and  commencing march   its electric distribution business  and to cips  cilco s and ip s electric and natural gas distribution businesses  exposure to changing market prices is in large part mitigated by the fact that there are cost recovery mechanisms in place 
these cost recovery mechanisms allow ue  cips  cilco and ip to pass on to retail customers prudently incurred fuel  purchased power and gas supply costs 
ue s  cips  cilco s and ip s strategy is designed to reduce the effect of market fluctuations for our regulated customers 
the effects of price volatility cannot be eliminated 
however  procurement strategies involve risk management techniques and instruments similar to those outlined earlier  as well as the management of physical assets 
with regard to our exposure for commodity price risk for construction and maintenance activities  ameren is exposed to changes in market prices for metal commodities and labor availability

table of contents fair value of contracts most of our commodity contracts qualify for treatment as normal purchases and normal sales 
we use derivatives principally to manage the risk of changes in market prices for natural gas  fuel  electricity  ftrs and emission allowances 
price fluctuations in natural gas  fuel  electricity  ftrs and emission allowances may cause any of these conditions an unrealized appreciation or depreciation of our contracted commitments to purchase or sell when purchase or sales prices under the commitments are compared with current commodity prices  market values of fuel and natural gas inventories or purchased power that differ from the cost of those commodities in inventory under contracted commitment  or actual cash outlays for the purchase of these commodities that differ from anticipated cash outlays 
the derivatives that we use to hedge these risks are governed by our risk management policies for forward contracts  futures  options and swaps 
our net positions are continually assessed within our structured hedging programs to determine whether new or offsetting transactions are required 
the goal of the hedging program is generally to mitigate financial risks while ensuring that sufficient volumes are available to meet our requirements 
see note derivative financial instruments to our financial statements under part ii  item  of this report for further information
