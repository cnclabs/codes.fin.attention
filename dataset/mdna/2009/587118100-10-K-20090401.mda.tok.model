overview fiscal presented us with a challenging economic and retail environment 
the recessionary trend of the us economy that started in late and a weakening canadian economy continued to negatively impact consumer spending during in response to the more challenging consumer and retail environment we took actions to stimulate sales through deeper discounts and other events  reduce inventory purchases and implement expense control initiatives 
we had revenues of  million and net earnings of million in fiscal  compared to revenues of  million and net earnings of million in fiscal and revenues of  million and net earnings of million in fiscal the more significant factors impacting these results are addressed in the results of operations discussion below 
in addition  our fiscal results included the following items of interest on march   we announced that golden brand clothing canada ltd  an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of the company  intended to close its montreal  quebec based manufacturing facility 
despite previous reductions in production over the last three years  the strengthening canadian dollar during that period and the increasing pace of imports by competitors resulted in the decision to close the manufacturing facility 
we recognized pretax costs of million in fiscal for closure of the facility  including million for severance payments  million for the write off of fixed assets  million for lease termination payments and million for other costs related to the july  facility closing 
these charges are included in selling  general and administrative expenses in our consolidated statement of earnings 
net cash payments of million related to the closure of the facility were made in the accrued balance of million at january  for closure of the facility relates to the remaining lease termination payments which will be paid over the remaining term of the lease through february we do not expect to incur any additional charges in connection with the closure of this facility 
in january  we received cash proceeds of approximately million from the state of california the state for certain property being acquired by the state pursuant to eminent domain 
we recognized a pretax gain of million from this transaction 
the property acquired by the state is primarily machinery  equipment and leasehold improvements at the site of our arleta  california distribution facility 
through an arrangement with the state  we plan to continue to occupy and operate this facility until november   at which time we will relocate to a recently leased location in bakersfield  california 
the gain is included in selling  general and administrative expenses in the accompanying consolidated statement of earnings for the period ended january  we opened stores in  stores in and stores in  however  due to the current economic conditions that have caused lower traffic levels in our stores  we plan to open only about ten stores in we plan to expand and or relocate approximately seven existing men s wearhouse stores  four existing men s wearhouse and tux stores  three existing k g stores and four existing moores stores 
during the first quarter of fiscal  we plan to rename our stores that were acquired from after hours in april and operated as mw tux to men s wearhouse and tux 
these renamed men s wearhouse and tux stores will continue to offer a full selection of tuxedo rental product as well as an expanded selection of retail merchandise  including formalwear and suit separates  denim and sportswear targeted towards a younger customer 
we believe that renaming and expanding the retail merchandise at these stores will generate an opportunity for incremental apparel sales by introducing more of our tuxedo rental customers to the quality merchandise selection and superior level of customer service associated with our stores 

table of contents we also plan to apply a new store design which was tested in three k g stores during to approximately additional k g stores in the spring of the new store design establishes a modern look and feel from the exterior entrance of the store to the inside of the fitting rooms 
we believe these new design elements convey a more vibrant and energetic attitude for our customers 
in  we closed two men s wearhouse stores due to substandard performance 
we also closed men s wearhouse and tux stores formerly mw tux seven due to substandard performance  one due to lease expiration and due to consolidation of operations with other existing men s wearhouse stores in the area 
in  we closed stores due to the integration of after hours into our operations and two men s wearhouse stores and one k g store due to lease expirations 
in  two stores were closed due to lease expiration 
we plan to close one men s wearhouse store  two k g stores and men s wearhouse and tux stores formerly mw tux in we also recorded non cash asset impairment charges of million in related mainly to leasehold improvement assets for two stores still in operation 
we expect general economic conditions to remain difficult in in response to these challenges  we plan to continue to stimulate sales with deeper discounts and other events  to manage our inventory purchases and to further implement cost controls and operational changes to reduce expenses 
we also anticipate a significant reduction in store openings and other capital expenditures in as compared to levels as indicated above 
based on our experience with previous economic downturns  we believe long term fundamentals for the men s specialty apparel industry remain strong and that current negative conditions will stabilize over time 
however  we cannot predict when a meaningful recovery will occur

buying patterns for men are considered to be more discretionary than those in other apparel areas

these inventory purchases will be funded by cash from operations  trade credit and  if necessary  borrowings under our revolving credit facility 
the actual amount of future capital expenditures and inventory purchases will depend in part on the number of new stores opened and the terms on which new stores are leased  as well as on industry trends consistent with our anticipated operating plans 
additionally  market conditions may produce attractive opportunities for us to acquire assets or retail chains larger than our past acquisitions 
any such acquisitions may be undertaken as an alternative to opening new stores

in addition  the recent turmoil in the financial markets could limit our access to additional capital resources  if needed  and could increase associated costs 
we anticipate  as discussed above  a significant reduction in store openings and other capital expenditures in the next months relative to levels 
we believe based on our current business plan that our existing cash  short term investments and cash flows from operations will be sufficient to fund our planned store openings  other capital expenditures and operating cash requirements and that we will be able to maintain compliance with the covenants in our credit agreement for at least the next months

the purchase orders represent executory contracts requiring performance by the vendors suppliers  including the delivery of the merchandise prior to a specified cancellation date and compliance with product specifications  quality standards and other requirements 
in the event of the vendor s failure to meet the agreed upon terms and conditions  we may cancel the order 

table of contents off balance sheet arrangements other than the noncancelable operating leases  other contractual obligations and letters of credit discussed above  the company does not have any off balance sheet arrangements that are material to its financial position or results of operations 
inflation the company believes the impact of inflation on the results of operations during the periods presented has been minimal 
however  there can be no assurance that the company s business will not be affected by inflation in the future 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires the appropriate application of accounting policies in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 
in many instances  this also requires management to make estimates and assumptions about future events that affect the amounts and disclosures included in our financial statements 
we base our estimates on historical experience and various assumptions that we believe are reasonable under our current business model 
however  because future events and conditions and their effects cannot be determined with certainty  actual results will differ from our estimates and such differences could be material to our financial statements 
our accounting policies are described in note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
we consistently apply these policies and periodically evaluate the reasonableness of our estimates in light of actual events 
historically  we have found our accounting policies to be appropriate and our estimates and assumptions reasonable 
our critical accounting policies  which are those most significant to the presentation of our financial position and results of operations and those that require significant judgment or complex estimates by management  are discussed below 
revenue recognition clothing product revenue is recognized at the time of sale and delivery of merchandise  net of actual sales returns and a provision for estimated sales returns 
revenues from tuxedo rental  alteration and other services are recognized upon completion of the services 
proceeds from the sale of gift cards are recorded as a liability and are recognized as revenues when the cards are redeemed 
we do not recognize revenue from unredeemed gift cards as these amounts are reflected as a liability until escheated in accordance with applicable laws 
in accordance with the emerging issues task force issue  how taxes collected from customers and remitted to governmental authorities should be presented in the income statement that is  gross versus net presentation  we present all non income government assessed taxes sales  use and value added taxes collected from our customers and remitted to governmental agencies on a net basis excluded from net sales in our consolidated financial statements 
the government assessed taxes are recorded in accrued expenses and other current liabilities until they are remitted to the government agency 

table of contents inventories our inventory is carried at the lower of cost or market 
cost is determined on the average cost method for approximately of our inventory and on the retail inventory method for the remaining primarily k g inventories 
our inventory cost also includes estimated buying and distribution costs warehousing  freight  hangers and merchandising costs associated with the inventory  with the balance of such costs included in cost of sales 
we make assumptions  based primarily on historical experience  as to items in our inventory that may be damaged  obsolete or salable only at marked down prices and reduce the cost of inventory to reflect the market value of these items 
if actual damages  obsolescence or market demand is significantly different from our estimates  additional inventory write downs could be required 
in addition  buying and distribution costs are allocated to inventory based on the ratio of annual product purchases to inventory cost 
if this ratio were to change significantly  it could materially affect the amount of buying and distribution costs included in cost of sales 
impairment of long lived assets long lived assets  such as property and equipment and identifiable intangibles with finite useful lives  are periodically evaluated for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
if the asset carrying amount exceeds its estimated undiscounted future cash flows  an impairment charge is recognized in the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the fair value of the asset 
fair value is generally determined by discounting the estimated future cash flows associated with the asset 
estimating future cash flows requires management to make assumptions and to apply judgment  including forecasting future sales  costs and useful lives of assets 
significant judgment is also involved in selecting the appropriate discount rate to be applied in determining the estimated fair value of an asset 
changes to our key assumptions related to store performance  market conditions and other economic factors could result in future impairment charges 
for example  unanticipated adverse market conditions could cause individual stores to become unprofitable and could result in an impairment charge for the property and equipment assets in those stores 
during fiscal  we recognized non cash asset impairment charges of million related mainly to store leasehold improvement assets for two stores still in operation 
no impairment charges were recorded in fiscal or goodwill and other intangible assets goodwill and other intangible assets are initially recorded at their fair values 
trademarks  tradenames and other identifiable intangible assets with finite useful lives are amortized to expense over their estimated useful lives of to years using the straight line method and are periodically evaluated for impairment as discussed in the impairment of long lived assets section above 
goodwill  which totaled million at january   represents the excess cost of businesses acquired over the fair value of the identifiable tangible and intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed in prior business combinations 
goodwill is not amortized but is evaluated annually as of our fiscal year end for impairment 
a more frequent evaluation is performed if events or circumstances indicate that impairment could have occurred 
such events or circumstances could include  but are not limited to  significant negative industry or economic trends  unanticipated changes in the competitive environment  decisions to significantly modify or dispose of operations and a significant sustained decline in the market price of our stock 
for purposes of our impairment evaluation  the reporting units are our operating brands identified in note to the consolidated financial statements 
goodwill has been assigned to the reporting units based on prior business combinations related to the brands 
the goodwill impairment evaluation is performed in two steps 
the first step is intended to determine if potential impairment exists and is performed by comparing each reporting unit s fair value to its carrying value  including goodwill 
if the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value  goodwill is considered potentially impaired and we must complete the second step of the testing to determine the amount of any impairment 
the second step requires an allocation of the reporting unit s first step estimated fair value to the individual assets and liabilities of the reporting unit in the same manner as if the reporting unit was being acquired in a business combination 
any excess of the estimated fair value over the amounts allocated to the individual assets and liabilities represents the implied fair value of goodwill for the reporting unit 
if the implied fair value of goodwill is less than the recorded goodwill  we would recognize an impairment charge for the difference 
in our step one process  we estimate the fair value of our reporting units using a combined income and market comparable approach 
our income approach uses projected future cash flows that are discounted using a weighted average cost of capital analysis that reflects current market conditions 
the market comparable approach primarily considers market price multiples of comparable companies and applies those price multiples to certain key drivers of the reporting unit 
we engage an independent valuation firm to assist us in estimating the fair value of our reporting units 

table of contents management judgment is a significant factor in the goodwill impairment evaluation process 
the computations require management to make estimates and assumptions 
critical assumptions that are used as part of these evaluations include the potential future cash flows of the reporting unit 
the income approach relies on the timing and estimates of future cash flows 
the projections use management s estimates of economic and market conditions over the projected period  including growth rates in revenue  gross margin and expense 
the cash flows are based on the company s most recent forecast and business plans and various growth rates have been assumed for years beyond the current business plan period 
we believe that the assumptions and rates used in our impairment evaluation are reasonable  however  variations in the assumptions and rates could result in significantly different estimates of fair value 
selection of an appropriate discount rate 
the income approach requires the selection of an appropriate discount rate  which is based on a weighted average cost of capital analysis 
the discount rate is affected by changes in short term interest rates and long term yield as well as variances in the typical capital structure of marketplace participants 
given the current volatile economic conditions  it is possible that the discount rate will fluctuate in the near term 
the weighted average cost of capital used to discount the cash flows ranged from to for the analysis 
selection of comparable companies within the industry 
for purposes of the market comparable approach  valuations were determined by calculating average price multiples of relevant key drivers from a group of companies that are comparable to the reporting units being analyzed and applying those price multiples to the key drivers of the reporting unit 
while the market price multiple is not an assumption  a presumption that it provides an indicator of the value of the reporting unit is inherent in the valuation 
the determination of the market comparable also involves a degree of judgment 
earnings multiples of to were used for the analysis 
as discussed above  the fair values of reporting units in were determined using a combined income and market comparable approach 
we believe these two approaches are appropriate valuation techniques and we generally weight the two values equally as an estimate of reporting unit fair value for the purposes of our impairment testing 
however  we may weigh one value more heavily than the other when conditions merit doing so 
the fair value derived from the weighting of these two methods provided appropriate valuations that  in aggregate  reasonably reconciled to our market capitalization  taking into account observable control premiums 
therefore  we used the valuations in evaluating goodwill for possible impairment and determined that none of our goodwill was impaired 
we also performed a sensitivity analysis on our estimated fair values which were determined using a combined income and market comparable approach 
a key assumption for the income approach involves selection of the discount rate  which ranged from to for the analysis as discussed above 
we noted that an increase in the weighted average cost of capital of approximately basis points for twin hill  basis points for mw cleaners  basis points for men s wearhouse and moores and basis points for k g would result in an estimate of fair value using the income approach of less than the carrying value 
the goodwill impairment evaluation process requires management to make estimates and assumptions with regard to the fair value of the reporting units 
actual values may differ significantly from these judgments  particularly if there are significant adverse changes in the operating environment for our reporting units 
sustained declines in the company s market capitalization could also increase the risk of goodwill impairment 
such occurrences could result in future goodwill impairment charges that would  in turn  negatively impact the company s results of operations  however  any such goodwill impairments would be non cash charges that would not affect our cash flows or compliance with our current debt covenants 
no impairment was identified in fiscal  or 
table of contents tuxedo rental product the cost of our tuxedo rental product is amortized to cost of sales based on the cost of each unit rented  which is estimated based on the number of times the unit is expected to be rented and the average cost of the rental product 
lost  damaged and retired rental product is also charged to cost of sales 
tuxedo rental product is amortized to expense generally over a two to three year period 
we make assumptions  based primarily on historical experience and information obtained from tuxedo rental industry sources  as to the number of times each unit can be rented 
if the actual number of times a unit can be rented were to vary significantly from our estimates  it could materially affect the amount of tuxedo rental product amortization included in cost of sales 
self insurance we self insure significant portions of our workers compensation and employee medical costs 
we estimate our liability for future payments under these programs based on historical experience and various assumptions as to participating employees  health care costs  number of claims and other factors  including industry trends and information provided to us by our insurance broker 
we also use actuarial estimates 
if the number of claims or the costs associated with those claims were to increase significantly over our estimates  additional charges to earnings could be necessary to cover required payments 
income taxes significant judgment is required in determining the provision for income taxes and the related taxes payable and deferred tax assets and liabilities since  in the ordinary course of business  there are transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax outcome is uncertain 
additionally  our tax returns are subject to audit by various domestic and foreign tax authorities that could result in material adjustments or differing interpretations of the tax laws 
although we believe that our estimates are reasonable and are based on the best available information at the time we prepare the provision  actual results could differ from these estimates resulting in a final tax outcome that may be materially different from that which is reflected in our consolidated financial statements 
operating leases our operating leases primarily relate to stores and generally contain rent escalation clauses  rent holidays  contingent rent provisions and occasionally leasehold incentives 
we recognize rent expense for operating leases on a straight line basis over the term of the lease  which is generally five to ten years based on the initial lease term plus first renewal option periods that are reasonably assured 
rent expense for stores is included in cost of sales as a part of occupancy cost and other rent is included in selling  general and administrative expenses 
the lease terms commence when we take possession with the right to control use of the leased premises and  for stores  is generally days prior to the date rent payments begin 
rental costs associated with ground or building operating leases that are incurred during a construction period are recognized as rental expense 
deferred rent that results from recognition of rent on a straight line basis is included in other liabilities 
landlord incentives received for reimbursement of leasehold improvements are recorded as deferred rent and amortized as a reduction to rent expense over the term of the lease 
contingent rentals are generally based on percentages of sales and are recognized as store rent expense as they accrue

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk foreign currency risk moores conducts its business in canadian dollars 
the exchange rate between canadian dollars and us dollars has fluctuated over the last ten years 
if the value of the canadian dollar against the us dollar weakens  then the revenues and earnings of our canadian operations will be reduced when they are translated to us dollars 
also  the value of our canadian net assets in us dollars may decline 
interest rate risk we are also subject to market risk as a result of the outstanding balance of million under our revolving credit facility and the outstanding balance of us million under our canadian term loan at january   both of which bear a variable interest rate see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
an increase in market interest rates would increase our interest expense and our cash requirements for interest payments 
for example  an average increase of in the variable interest rate would increase our interest expense and payments by approximately million 
we also have exposure to market rate risk for changes in interest rates as those rates relate to our investment portfolio 
the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while at the same time maximizing yields without significantly increasing risk 
as of january   we have highly liquid investments classified as cash equivalents and short term investments in our consolidated balance sheet 
future investment income earned on our cash equivalents and short term investments will fluctuate in line with short term interest rates
