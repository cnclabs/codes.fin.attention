item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations introduction we are a bank holding company headquartered in rosemont  illinois  a suburb of chicago 
we derive substantially all of our revenue from our wholly owned subsidiary  cole taylor bank 
we provide a range of banking services to our customers  with a primary focus on serving closely held businesses in the chicago metropolitan area and the people who own and manage those businesses 
the following discussion and analysis presents our consolidated financial condition at december  and and the results of operations for the years ended december   and this discussion should be read together with the selected consolidated financial data  our audited consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto and other financial data contained elsewhere in this annual report 
in addition to the historical information provided below  we have made certain estimates and forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results could differ significantly from those anticipated in these estimates and forward looking statements as a result of certain factors  including those discussed in the section captioned risk factors and elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
overview results of operations we reported a net loss applicable to common shareholders for the year ended december  of million  or per common share  compared with a net loss of million  or per common share  for the year ended december  the largest component of the net loss in was a million provision for loan losses  compared with a provision of million in the net loss in was also impacted by the establishment of a million  or per common share  valuation reserve against our deferred tax assets and preferred stock dividends of million in the net loss in included a non cash  after tax charge of million  or per share  for the write off of our goodwill 
our total assets increased million  or  during to billion at december   compared to billion at december  total loans increased million  or  to billion at december   with the increase attributable to primarily commercial and industrial loans c i loans 
c i loans increased million  or during  as we hired over new commercial bankers and embarked on a significant growth strategy 
our new commercial bankers established new commercial banking relationships and originated more than million in new commercial loans 
our senior management team changed beginning with the hiring of a new president in february during  we recruited a new chief credit officer  chief lending officer  chief operating officer and chief financial officer 
we also hired an executive vice president to lead an expanded asset based lending capability 
we launched our asset based lending initiative  which operates under the name cole taylor business capital  and opened offices in kansas city  milwaukee  houston and baltimore to support these operations 
all of our new executives previous experience was with a substantially larger banking organization and included many years of experience in the chicago banking market 
series a preferred stock issuance on september   we completed a private placement of million of non cumulative convertible perpetual preferred stock  series a  to certain institutional and individual accredited investors 
the preferred stock private placement included a total of million shares of non cumulative convertible perpetual preferred stock  series a  with a purchase price and liquidation preference of per share 
the preferred stock pays non cumulative dividends at an annual rate of of the liquidation preference beginning in january each share of the preferred stock can be converted into shares of our common stock at a 
table of contents conversion price of per common share 
the preferred stock is convertible into an aggregate of million shares of our common stock at the option of the preferred stockholders at any time  and will be convertible at our option on or after september  the preferred stock will cease to pay dividends after september   if the volume weighted average price of our common stock on the nasdaq global select market exceeds of the then applicable conversion price for at least trading days in any consecutive day period  or after september   if the volume weighted average price of our common stock on the nasdaq global select market exceeds of the then applicable conversion price for at least trading days in any consecutive day period 
issuance of subordinated bank notes and common stock warrants simultaneously with the issuance of the series a preferred stock  we closed a sale of million in principal amount of subordinated notes issued by our bank which included detachable warrants to purchase shares of our company s common stock 
the subordinated notes issued by the bank bear interest at an annual rate of and mature on september   but may be prepaid at the bank s option after september  for every  in principal amount of the subordinated notes  investors in this transaction also received a warrant to purchase shares of our common stock at an exercise price of per share  which represents an aggregate of  shares of common stock 
the warrants are not exercisable until march  and expire on september  in connection with the private placement of series a preferred stock  we also issued to financial investments corporation fic warrants to purchase up to  shares of our common stock at an exercise price of per share 
the fic warrants are not transferable or assignable after their initial issuance  and are exercisable anytime up to the september  expiration date 
participation in us treasury department s tarp capital purchase program on november   we received million from the us treasury department in exchange for the issuance of  shares of our series b preferred stock and warrants to purchase  shares of our common stock as part of the federal government s tarp capital purchase program 
the series b preferred shares pay a dividend of per year for the first five years and reset to per year thereafter 
the series b preferred shares are callable at par after three years and can be redeemed prior to then at of the issue price  subject to the approval of our federal regulator 
the warrants have a term of ten years and an exercise price of per share 
counterparty borrowing lines during  our pre approved borrowing lines for federal funds purchased and repurchase agreements declined 
our approved overnight federal funds borrowing lines have declined to million at december  from million at december  our pre approved repurchase agreement lines have declined to million at december  from million at december  in response  we have increased our pledge of qualifying commercial loan collateral under the federal reserve bank s borrower in custody program  which increased our borrowing capacity to million at december  from million at december  subsequent to year end  the bank has increased its pre approved borrowing lines for federal funds purchased by million 
the bank has further increased its ability to purchase federal funds by cultivating relationships with a growing group of correspondent banking customers who may sell federal funds to the bank in order to manage their excess liquidity 
in addition  an independent debt rating agency  fitch ratings  downgraded its ratings of the holding company and the bank during fitch reduced the long and short term debt and deposit ratings from investment grade to non investment grade and revised their ratings outlook to negative from stable 
we have also experienced a decline in our ratings from entities such as idc  lace  and bankrate 
com 
the bank has not 
table of contents experienced any difficulty acquiring deposits at market rates 
however  these ratings declines could negatively impact our acquisition or retention of deposits in the future 
overview we reported a net loss for the year ended december  of million  or per share  compared with net income of million  or per diluted common share  for the year ended december  the net loss in included a non cash  after tax charge of million  or per share  for the write off of our goodwill 
in addition  the provision for loan losses was million in  compared with a provision of million in net income in included million  or per share  of tax benefits associated with the resolution of particular tax uncertainties 
these tax benefits were recognized in the second half of because of the expiration of the statute of limitations on our income tax return and the completion of certain taxing authority examinations 
total assets at december  were billion  compared to billion at december   an increase of million  or 
application of critical accounting policies our accounting and reporting policies conform to accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america and general reporting practices within the financial services industry 
our accounting policies are described in the section of this annual report captioned notes to consolidated financial statements summary of significant accounting and reporting policies 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with these accounting principles requires management to make estimates  assumptions and judgments that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
these estimates  assumptions and judgments are based on information available to us as of the date of the consolidated financial statements and  accordingly  as this information changes  actual results could differ from the estimates  assumptions and judgments reflected in the financial statements 
the estimates  assumptions and judgments made by us are based upon historical experience or other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
certain accounting policies inherently have greater reliance on the use of estimates  assumptions and judgments and as such  have a greater possibility of producing results that could be materially different than originally reported 
we consider our policies for the allowance for loan losses  the valuation of deferred tax assets and establishment of tax liabilities and the valuation of financial instruments such as investment securities and derivatives to be critical accounting policies 
in  we revised which of our accounting policies we consider critical 
we added as a critical accounting policy the valuation of investment securities  specifically our policy regarding other than temporary impairment 
in addition  our policy regarding goodwill impairment was no longer critical as all of our goodwill was written off at the end of the following accounting policies materially affect our reported earnings and financial condition and require significant estimates  assumptions and judgments 
allowance for loan losses we have established an allowance for loan losses to provide for loans in our portfolio that may not be repaid in their entirety 
the allowance is based on our regular  quarterly assessments of the probable estimated losses inherent in our loan portfolio 
our methodology for measuring the appropriate level of the allowance relies on several key elements  which include a general allowance computed by applying loss factors to categories of loans outstanding in the portfolio  specific allowances for identified problem loans and portfolio segments  and an unallocated allowance 
we maintain our allowance for loan losses at a level considered adequate to absorb probable losses inherent in our portfolio as of the balance sheet date 
in evaluating the adequacy of our allowance for loan losses  we consider numerous quantitative factors  including historical charge off experience  growth of our loan portfolio  changes in the composition of our loan portfolio and the volume of delinquent and criticized 
table of contents loans 
in addition  we use information about specific borrower situations  including their financial position  work out plans and estimated collateral values under various liquidation scenarios to estimate the risk and amount of loss on loans to those borrowers 
finally  we also consider many qualitative factors  including general and economic business conditions  duration of the current business cycle  the impact of competition on our underwriting terms  current general market collateral valuations  trends apparent in any of the factors we take into account and other matters  which are by nature more subjective and fluid 
our estimates of risk of loss and amount of loss on any loan are complicated by the uncertainties surrounding not only our borrowers probability of default  but also the fair value of the underlying collateral 
the current illiquidity in the real estate market has increased the uncertainty with respect to real estate values 
because of the degree of uncertainty and the sensitivity of valuations to the underlying assumptions regarding holding period until sale and the collateral liquidation method  our actual losses may materially vary from our current estimates 
as a business bank  our loan portfolio is comprised primarily of commercial loans to businesses 
these loans are inherently larger in amount than loans to individual consumers and  therefore  have higher potential losses on an individual loan basis 
the individually larger commercial loans can cause greater volatility in our reported credit quality performance measures  such as total impaired or nonperforming loans 
our current credit risk rating and loss estimate with respect to a single sizable loan can have a material impact on our reported impaired loans and related loss estimates 
because our loan portfolio contains a significant number of commercial loans with relatively large balances  the deterioration of any one or a few of these loans can cause a significant increase in uncollectible loans and  therefore  our allowance for loan losses 
we review our estimates on a quarterly basis and  as we identify changes in estimates  our allowance for loan losses is adjusted through the recording of a provision for loan losses 
income taxes we have maintained significant net deferred tax assets for deductible temporary differences  the largest of which relates to the allowance for loan losses 
for income tax return purposes  only net charge offs are deductible  not the provision for loan losses 
under generally accepted accounting principles  a valuation allowance is required to be recognized if it is more likely than not that the deferred tax asset will not be realized 
the determination of the realizability of the deferred tax assets is highly subjective and dependent upon judgment concerning management s evaluation of both positive and negative evidence  the forecasts of future income  applicable tax planning strategies  and assessments of the current and future economic and business conditions 
we consider both positive and negative evidence regarding the ultimate realizability of our deferred tax assets 
positive evidence includes the existence of taxes paid in available carry back years as well as the probability that taxable income will be generated in future periods  while negative evidence includes a cumulative loss in the current year and prior two years and general business and economic trends 
at december   we recorded a valuation allowance relating to our deferred tax asset 
this determination was based  largely  on the negative evidence of a cumulative loss in the most recent three year period caused primarily by the significant loan loss provisions made during in addition  general uncertainty surrounding the future economic and business conditions have increased the likelihood of volatility in our future earnings 
we believe  based on our internal earnings projections  that we will generate future taxable income that will result in the realization of this deferred tax asset 
however  this positive evidence was not sufficient to overcome the negative evidence of our recent cumulative loss 
at times  we apply different tax treatment for selected transactions for tax return purposes than for income tax financial reporting purposes 
the different positions result from the varying application of statutes  rules  regulations  and interpretations  and our accruals for income taxes include reserves for these differences in position 
our estimate of the value of these reserves contains assumptions based upon our past experience and judgments about potential actions by taxing authorities  and we believe that the level of these reserves is reasonable 
we initially recognize the financial statement effects of a tax position when it is more likely than not  based on the technical merits  that the position will be sustained upon examinations 
subsequently  the reserves are then utilized or reversed when we determine the more likely than not threshold is no longer met  once the 
table of contents statute of limitations has expired  or the tax matter is effectively settled 
however  because reserve balances are estimates that are subject to uncertainties  the ultimate resolution of these matters may be greater or less than the amounts we have accrued 
derivative financial instruments we use derivative financial instruments derivatives  including interest rate exchange and floor and collar agreements  to accommodate individual customer needs and to assist in our interest rate risk management 
in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities sfas  all derivatives are measured and reported at fair value on our consolidated balance sheet as either an asset or a liability 
for derivatives that are designated and qualify as a fair value hedge  the gain or loss on the derivative  as well as the offsetting loss or gain on the hedged item attributable to the effective portion of the hedged risk  are recognized in current earnings during the period of the change in the fair values 
for derivatives that are designated and qualify as a cash flow hedge  the effective portion of the gain or loss on the derivative is reported as a component of other comprehensive income and reclassified into earnings in the same period or periods during which the hedged transaction affects earnings 
for all hedging relationships  derivative gains and losses that are not effective in hedging the changes in fair value or expected cash flows of the hedged item are recognized immediately in current earnings during the period of the change in fair value 
similarly  the changes in the fair value of derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting under sfas or are not designated as an accounting hedge are also reported currently in earnings 
at the inception of a hedge and quarterly thereafter  a formal assessment is performed to determine whether changes in the fair values or cash flows of the derivatives have been highly effective in offsetting the changes in the fair values or cash flows of the hedged item and whether they are expected to be highly effective in the future 
if it is determined that derivatives are not highly effective as a hedge  hedge accounting is discontinued for the period 
once hedge accounting is terminated  all changes in fair value of the derivatives flow through the consolidated statements of operations in other noninterest income  which results in greater volatility in our earnings 
the estimates of fair values of our derivatives are calculated using independent valuation models to estimate market based valuations 
the valuations are determined using widely accepted valuation techniques  including discounted cash flow analysis of the expected cash flow of each derivative 
this analysis reflects the contractual terms of the derivative and uses observable market based inputs  including interest rate curves and implied volatilities 
in addition  the fair value estimate also incorporates a credit valuation adjustment to reflect the risk of nonperformance by both us and our counterparties in the fair value measurement 
the resulting fair values produced by these proprietary valuation models are in part theoretical and  therefore  can vary between derivative dealers and are not necessarily reflective of the actual price at which the derivative contract could be traded 
small changes in assumptions can result in significant changes in valuation 
the risks inherent in the determination of the fair value of a derivative may result in volatility in our statement of operations 
valuation of investment securities each quarter we review our investment securities portfolio to determine whether unrealized losses are temporary or other than temporary  based on an evaluation of the creditworthiness of the issuers guarantors  as well as the underlying collateral  if applicable 
our analysis includes an evaluation of the type of security  the length of time and extent to which the fair value has been less than the security s carrying value  the characteristics of the underlying collateral  the degree of credit support provided by subordinate tranches within the total issuance  independent credit ratings and discounted cash flow analysis 
we utilize various independent pricing sources to obtain fair values and perform discounted cash flow analysis for selected securities 
when the discounted cash flow analysis we obtain from those independent pricing sources indicates that it is probable that all future principal and interest payments would be received in accordance with their original contractual terms and we have both the intent and ability to hold the investment security until maturity  the unrealized loss is 
table of contents deemed temporary 
our assessments of creditworthiness and the resultant expected cash flows are complicated by the significant uncertainties surrounding not only the specific security and its underlying collateral but also the severity of the current overall economic downturn 
our cash flow estimates for mortgage backed securities are based on estimates of mortgage default rates and future housing prices  which are difficult to predict 
changes in assumptions can result in material changes in expected cash flows 
therefore  unrealized losses that we have determined to be temporary may at a later date be determined to be other than temporary and have a material impact on our statement of operations 
results of operations as of and for the years ended december    and net interest income net interest income is the difference between total interest income and fees generated by interest earning assets and total interest expense paid on interest bearing liabilities 
net interest income is our principal source of earnings 
the amount of net interest income is affected by changes in the volume and mix of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities  and the level of rates earned or paid on those assets and liabilities 
year ended december  as compared to year ended december  net interest income was million for the year ended december   as compared to million for  a decrease of million  or

our tax equivalent net interest margin was during  basis points lower than the net interest margin of during the decline in the net interest margin resulted from the decline in earning asset yields outpacing the decline in our interest bearing funding cost 
the yield on our interest earning assets decreased basis points to in from during  primarily as a result of the decline in short term market interest rates driving down the yield on variable rate loans 
the percentage of fixed rate loans declined to of the portfolio at december   as compared to at december  this change in the mix of our loans also contributed to the decline in our net interest margin 
this decline in loan yield was offset by an increase in loan volume and an increase in both volume and rate on the investment portfolio

the decrease in net interest income was a result of a decline in our net interest margin 

table of contents our tax equivalent net interest margin was during  basis points lower than the net interest margin of during the decline in the net interest margin resulted from our funding cost outpacing the increase in our total earning asset yield 
while investment yields during benefited from increases in term market interest rates that occurred during  competitive pricing pressure for loans and the impact of higher nonaccrual loans resulted in a decline in the yield on total loans 
our funding costs increased as a result of changes in funding mix and the repricing of term deposits to higher interest rates 
our tax equivalent net interest spread  which is determined by subtracting the yield on interest earning assets from the cost of interest bearing liabilities  declined basis points during to  compared to in during  our yield on our interest earning assets increased basis points to from during however  over the same time period  the cost of our interest bearing liabilities increased basis points to during from during average interest earning assets increased million  or  to billion during  compared to billion during higher average loans accounted for most of the increase in average earning assets during average loans were billion in  an increase of million  or  as compared to average loans of billion in average commercial loans increased million  or  to billion during  compared to billion during decreases in consumer related loans of million  or  partly offset this increase 
average fhlb borrowings were million during as compared to million during  and average interest bearing deposit balances were billion during  compared to billion during increases in interest bearing demand deposits  primarily higher rate money market accounts  were offset by decreases in average time deposit and savings account balances 
see deposits below for further discussion of the changes in our deposit balances during tax equivalent measures 
as part of our evaluation of net interest income  we review our consolidated average balances  our yield on average interest earning assets  and the costs of average interest bearing liabilities 
such yields and costs are derived by dividing income or expense by the average balance of assets or liabilities 
because management reviews net interest income on a taxable equivalent basis  the analysis contains certain non gaap financial measures 
in these non gaap financial measures  interest income and net interest income are adjusted to reflect tax exempt interest income on an equivalent before tax basis assuming a tax rate of 
this assumed rate may differ from our actual effective income tax rate 
in addition  the earning asset yield  net interest margin  and the net interest rate spread are adjusted to a fully taxable equivalent basis 
we believe that these measures and ratios present a more meaningful measure of the performance of interest earning assets because they provide a better basis for comparison of net interest income regardless of the mix of taxable and tax exempt instruments

in addition  loan syndication fees declined million to  in  as compared to million in the market value of assets in our employees deferred compensation plan declined million in the change in market value is reported in both noninterest income and salary expense and therefore does not impact our net operating results 
our noninterest income increased  or  to million during  as compared to million during a million increase in loan syndication fees in primarily produced the increase 
this increase was partly offset by a decline in investment management fees and an increase in losses from partnership interests 
our service charges are principally derived from deposit accounts 
service charges increased million  or  in to million  as compared to million in service charge income is impacted by a number of factors  including the volume of deposit accounts and service transactions  the price established for each deposit service  the earnings credit rate and the collected balances customers maintain in their commercial checking accounts 
the increase in service charge revenue in was primarily caused by a decrease in the earnings credit rate given to customers on their collected account balances to offset gross activity charges 
the general movement of our earnings credits rates correlates with the movement of short term market interest rates 
in december  we recorded a million loss for other than temporary impairment on a private label mortgage backed security 
the security  which had a par value of million on december   is collateralized by adjustable rate loans with a fixed interest rate and interest only payments for the first five years 
after the five year period  the principal is amortized over the remaining year term of the mortgage and the interest rate adjusts annually 
these mortgage loans are primarily in california and are scheduled for payment resets in mid we recognized an impairment loss for the amount by which the par value exceeded the fair value of million as determined by a nationally recognized independent pricing service 
we held private label mortgage related securities at december  with a carrying value of million and a fair value of million 
as part of our quarterly evaluation process  we obtain fair value estimates from additional independent 
table of contents sources and perform cash flow analysis to determine if other than temporary impairment has occurred 
our analysis indicates that it is probable all cash flows will be received and we do not believe that other than temporary impairment has occurred on these securities at december  see investment securities below for a further discussion of private label mortgage backed securities 
trust fees have approximated million over the last three years  through trust fees are earned in connection with our offering of corporate trust services  primarily our paying agent and escrow services 
we expect trust fees to decline significantly in as a result of the maturity of certain agreements that have produced approximately  annually in revenues and the decline in spread income we earn on invested trust funds 
we began increasing the offering of derivative instruments to our customers in other derivative income of million in was comprised of  of fees earned from customer derivatives and million from changes in the fair value of derivatives that are not designated as accounting hedges 
the majority of the gain in fair value arose from derivative instruments that were designated as accounting hedges at inception  but de designated at a later date 
changes in the fair value of derivative instruments after de designation are recorded currently in earnings 
other derivative income of  in and  in  related primarily to changes in the fair value of derivative instruments not designated as accounting hedges 
see derivative financial instruments below for further discussion of our derivative instruments sold to borrowing customers 
our employees deferred compensation plan allows the participants to direct the investment of their deferred compensation in selected mutual funds 
the investment in these mutual funds are assets of the company and carried at market value  while an equal and offsetting liability is recorded to reflect the obligation by the company to the plan participants 
the change in the market value of assets in our employees deferred compensation plan is reported in both noninterest income and salary expense and therefore has no net impact on our operating results 
during  the market value of those assets declined million to million 
in and  the market value of the plan assets increased  and  respectively 
investment management fee income decreased  or  to million in  compared to million in and million in the decline in fee income resulted primarily from the decline in assets under management 
the decline in assets under management was a result of the decline in the general equity markets as well as fewer customers 
we have investments in limited partnerships that specialize in providing low income housing and community development in the chicago metropolitan area 
we account for our limited partnership investments under the equity method of accounting and recognize our share of partnership losses in noninterest income and the related low income housing tax credits as a reduction of income tax expense 
our portion of partnership losses totaled  in  as compared to  and  in and  respectively 
at december   we had investments in a total of partnerships with a total carrying value of million 
loan syndication fees totaled  in  compared with million in historically  we earned syndication fees in connection with the syndication of real estate development loans 
the decline in loan syndication fees was a result of reduced lending activity in the real estate development market in we expect our increased asset based lending activity to result in increased loan syndication fees in and future periods 
other noninterest income  which includes safe deposit rental fees  fees from financial planning services and other miscellaneous banking activities totaled   and million for the years ended december    and  respectively

total noninterest expense in was million  a decrease of million  or  from million in noninterest expense in included a one time charge of million for the impairment of our goodwill 
total noninterest expense in was million  which was million higher than noninterest expense of million in this increase was due primarily to the million goodwill impairment charge partially offset by a decrease in total salaries and employee benefits expense 
total salaries and employee benefits expense in was million  compared to million in salaries and benefit expense in increased million  or  as base salary expense increased million  severance expense increased million  sign on bonus expense increased million and the cost of restricted stock grants increased to million 
the increases in total salaries and benefits expenses were partially offset by the million reduction in the market value of the employees deferred compensation plan assets 
changes in the market value of the employees deferred compensation plan assets are included in the salaries  employment taxes  and medical insurance expense caption within total salaries and employee benefits expense 
during  we hired a new senior management team and commercial relationship managers to implement a strategic growth plan 
in addition  we replaced a number of our existing support staff 
our recruiting increased base salary expense  cash sign on bonuses  incentives and stock based awards to attract new employees 

table of contents total salaries and employee benefits expense in was million  compared to million in a million decrease in incentive and employee benefit plan expenses produced most of the decrease as compared to salaries  employment taxes and medical insurance expense increased million  or  to million in  as compared to million in base salaries increased million  or  and the number of total full time equivalent employees increased to at december   from at december  in addition  employment taxes and medical insurance premiums also increased 
the increases in salaries  taxes and insurance were partially offset by the million reduction in the market value of the employees deferred compensation plan assets 
changes in the market value of the deferred compensation plan assets is reported both in noninterest income and salary expense and therefore has no net impact on our operating results 
total salaries  employment taxes and medical insurance expense of million in were largely unchanged compared to the expense of million in the number of full time equivalent employees was at december  compared to at the end of severance expense was million in  as compared to  in and  in sign on bonuses were million in  as compared to  in and  in total incentives  commissions and retirement benefits increased  or  to million in  compared to million in the increase was primarily a result of increased stock based awards in which were primarily due to the granting of stock based awards associated with the hiring of key individuals associated with our strategic growth initiative 
equity based compensation increased to million in  as compared to million in while we incurred incentive  guaranteed and other bonus expense primarily associated with our recruiting activities in  we did not accrue for any annual performance based bonus pool in total incentives  commissions and retirement benefits decreased million  or  to million in  compared to million in the decrease in cash based incentives and retirement plan expenses reflected the diminished financial performance in and as compared to our occupancy of premises expense was million in  as compared to million in and million in occupancy expenses were higher in because we moved our downtown chicago facility from one leased facility to another  as the lease on the existing facility was set to expire in december as a result  we incurred lease expense for the new facility and the existing facility as we transitioned to the new space 
in addition  we incurred costs to physically move to the new facility 
also  costs associated with the closing of our orland park banking center and portions of our leased administrative offices at our burbank facility contributed to the increase in occupancy costs in furniture and equipment expense was million in  compared to million and million in and  respectively 
lower depreciation and maintenance produced the decrease in the yearly comparisons 
total legal fees  net of reimbursements  were million in  compared to million and million in and  respectively 
legal fees are reported net of reimbursements received from customers 
the increase in legal fees in was primarily related to our lending and collection activities  in particular relating to our nonperforming assets 
in addition  we incurred increased legal fees in for revising our employee benefit plans  recruiting and regulatory matters 
we recorded a million goodwill impairment charge in to write off our remaining goodwill balance 
our goodwill was created from our acquisition of the bank 
historically  we tested goodwill for impairment on july of each year  or between annual assessment dates whenever events or significant changes in circumstances indicated that the carrying value may be impaired 
because of adverse changes in the business climate that impacted the bank during the fourth quarter of  we performed an additional goodwill impairment test as of december  as a result of a decline in the market price of our common stock to 
table of contents levels significantly below our book value  we determined that the entire amount of our goodwill was impaired and recorded the goodwill impairment charge in the fourth quarter of nonperforming asset expense was million in  compared to  in and  in the increase in nonperforming asset expense in was primarily a result of the recognition of a million liability for unfunded commitments under standby letters of credit associated with certain of our impaired loans 
in addition  we recognized  of additional provisions to reduce the carrying value of certain other real estate owned in  as compared to  in nonperforming asset expense is influenced by the number and complexity of the lending relationships being managed in our work out area and properties being maintained pending their sale 
an increase in nonperforming assets and loans in our work out area caused the increase in we expect that a higher level of nonperforming assets at december  than in past years may result in an increase in this expense in fdic insurance premiums were million in as compared to  and  in and  respectively 
in  the fdic increased the rates paid for deposit insurance and  at the same time  granted assessment credits to qualifying institutions 
the bank utilized its assessment credit throughout and in the first quarter of to offset the increased deposit insurance premiums 
the fdic is raising insurance premiums significantly in for the first half of  premium rates will be doubled as compared to the fourth quarter of in addition  beginning in june  the fdic is further increasing insurance premiums for banks that utilize brokered cds and secured fhlb advances over certain defined limits 
based on our balance sheet at december   both of these additional premiums will likely apply to our bank 
additionally  we elected to participate in the fdic s temporary liquidity guarantee program tlgp  which will also increase our insurance premiums 
we expect that deposit insurance premiums for the bank in will increase significantly 
on february   the fdic announced an interim rule pursuant to which the fdic will impose an emergency special assessment equal to basis points on each insured institution s assessment base on june   and paid to the fdic on september  the assessment base of the special assessment will be the same as the assessment base for regular deposit insurance premiums 
we estimate that our share of the emergency special assessment will be approximately million 
in  we incurred early extinguishment of debt expense of million for the early redemption of approximately million of above market rate brokered certificates of deposits 
the unamortized issuance costs and fair value adjustments on these deposits were charged to expense at the time of redemption 
at december   we have million of brokered certificates of deposit that are callable at our option in with  of unamortized issuance costs and fair value adjustments 
other professional fees were million during  compared to million and million in and  respectively 
other professional services expense in increased compared to  primarily due to the engagement of a third party asset management firm to provide sub advisory investment management services 
corporate insurance expense was million in each of the years ended december  and and was million for the year ended december  due to adverse economic conditions in the banking industry  we expect that our corporate insurance expense may be higher in the future 
consulting expense was   and million for the years ended december    and  respectively 
the increase in consulting expense in was a result of the management services agreement entered into with financial investments corporation on september  the contract amount of  was prepaid and is being expensed over the nine month term of the contract  which ends june  other noninterest expense principally includes certain professional fees  operating losses and other operating expenses such as telephone  postage  office supplies  and printing 
other noninterest expense was million in 
table of contents compared to million in and million in increases in business entertainment and loan related expenses  board of director s fees and operating losses all contributed to the higher level of other noninterest expense in as compared to the increase in business entertainment was due to the increase in the number of commercial bankers 
board of director s fees increased as a result of an increase in the number of board meetings as well as an increase in the number of directors 
our efficiency ratio was for  compared to for and for the increase in the efficiency ratio in was primarily caused by the decrease in net interest income 
the increase in the efficiency ratio in was primarily caused by the million goodwill impairment charge 
income taxes we reported an income tax benefit of million for the year ended december  on a pre tax loss of million  in recognition of our ability to carry back the current loss to recover taxes paid in prior years 
as of december   we had a current federal income tax receivable of million reflecting the impact of utilizing the federal income tax loss generated in to file for refunds of taxes paid in and a portion of taxes paid in we also established a million valuation allowance resulting in a net deferred tax asset of million at december  the realizability of our deferred tax asset depends upon our ability to derive benefits from the tax deductions inherent in the deferred tax asset by refunds of prior taxes paid or by reducing future tax obligations 
we believe  based on our internal earnings projections  that we will realize the benefit of this deferred tax asset as we achieve profitability in the future 
however  the significance of our pre tax loss  which resulted in a cumulative loss when combined with our results in the prior two years  created a presumption under generally accepted accounting principles that a valuation allowance is required 
in addition  the uncertain future economic and business climate increases the likelihood of volatility in our future earnings 
generally accepted accounting principles limit the extent to which a company can utilize projections of future income to support recorded deferred tax assets when a cumulative loss has occurred 
therefore  we recorded an after tax  non cash charge of million to establish a valuation allowance against our deferred tax asset 
management is required to re evaluate the deferred tax asset and the related valuation allowance quarterly 
a reduction in the valuation allowance would lower the amount of income tax expense recognized in our consolidated statement of operations in future periods 
income tax expense was million for the year ended december   notwithstanding the pre tax loss of million  primarily because the goodwill impairment charge of million was not deductible for income tax purposes 
our effective tax rate was lower because of the lower level of pre tax earnings and the impact on the effective income tax rate of our tax exempt interest income was larger than in previous periods 
in addition  during  the state of illinois passed legislation increased our effective tax rate beginning in as a result of the enactment of this legislation  we recognized a reduction in income tax expense of  by increasing our deferred tax assets 
income tax expense was million in  resulting in an effective tax rate of 
in  income tax expense of million was reduced by the recognition of million of tax benefits relating to deductions taken on prior year tax returns that had not been recognized for financial reporting purposes 
tax liabilities established for these tax uncertainties were no longer required in primarily as a result of the expiration of the statute of limitations with respect to our federal income tax return and based upon the results of examinations by taxing authorities with respect to other tax years 
in addition  tax expense in was reduced by refunds of prior years state income taxes totaling  impact of inflation and changing prices the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto presented herein have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  which require the measurement of our financial position and operating results in terms of historical amounts without considering the changes in the relative purchasing power 
table of contents of money over time due to inflation 
the impact of inflation is reflected in the increased cost of our operations 
unlike industrial companies  nearly all of our assets and liabilities are monetary in nature 
as a result  interest rates have a greater impact on our performance than do the effects of the general levels of inflation 
interest rates do not necessarily move in the same direction or  to the same extent  as the price of goods and services

we analyze each of these securities to determine if other than temporary impairment has occurred 
the factors we consider include the magnitude of the unrealized loss in comparison to the security s carrying value  the length of time the security has been in an unrealized loss position and the current independent bond rating for the security 
those securities with unrealized losses for more than months or for more than of their carrying value are subjected to further analysis to determine if it is probable that not all the contractual cash flows will be received 
we obtain fair value estimates from additional independent sources and perform cash flow analysis to determine if other than temporary impairment has occurred

in addition  an objective loan review function independently risk rates loans to monitor and confirm the reasonableness of the lending officer s loan risk rating conclusion 
delinquency reports are reviewed monthly by the lending officers  their managers and credit administration 
the responsible lending officer reports to a loan committee about the current status of loans past due or current but graded below a designated level 
the committee evaluates whether the loan is appropriately risk rated and determines if the loan should be placed on nonaccrual  the need for a specific allowance for loan loss  or  if appropriate  a partial or full charge off 
loans rated substandard or below are transferred to a separate loan work out department  staffed by collection experts

nonperforming loans include nonaccrual loans and interest accruing loans contractually past due days or more 
all loans on which principal or interest is contractually past due days or more are evaluated to determine if they are adequately secured and in the process of collection

nonperforming residential real estate construction loans comprised approximately of total nonaccrual loans at december  the downturn in the residential housing market that began in persisted throughout and has reduced demand and market prices for developed residential lots and vacant land as well as homes 
this depressed housing market has negatively impacted many of our residential real estate development customers and resulted in an increase in our nonperforming loans 
we also experienced an increase in nonperforming loans in commercial and industrial and income producing commercial real estate properties during nonaccrual commercial and industrial loans of 
table of contents million at december  included three loans that in aggregate totaled million and represented of nonaccrual c i loans 
if a borrower fails to comply with the contractual terms of a loan agreement and the loan becomes past due  then we classify the loan as nonperforming 
however  not all nonperforming loans are considered impaired loans 
a loan may be contractually past due with respect to the note maturity date but current on interest or otherwise performing such that we believe the loan is probable of payment of interest and principal in full 
a loan is considered impaired if  based upon current information and events  it is probable that we will be unable to collect the scheduled payments of principal and interest when due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement 
we regard all nonaccrual loans as impaired  as well as those accruing loans that we believe to have higher risk of noncompliance with the contractual repayment schedule for both interest and principal 
once we determine that a loan has been impaired  we then determine what we believe is the likely amount of the impairment 
while impaired loans exhibit weaknesses that may inhibit repayment in compliance with the original note terms  our impairment analysis may not always result in an allowance for loan loss for every impaired loan 
the amount in the allowance for loan losses for impaired loans is based on the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan s effective interest rate or  for collateral dependent loans  impairment may be measured using the fair value of the collateral  net of cost to sell 
information about impaired loans at or for the years ended december    and is as follows in thousands recorded balance of impaired loans  at end of year with related allowance for loan loss with no related allowance for loan loss total allowance for loan losses related to impaired loans  at end of year average balance of impaired loans for the year interest income recognized on impaired loans for the year certain categories of loans that are more homogenous  such as residential mortgage and consumer loans  are evaluated collectively for impairment 
therefore  we do not assign individual credit risk ratings to these loans and they are excluded from impaired loans 
the dollar amount of impaired loans increased to million at december  as compared to million the prior year end 
impaired loans increased million in  after net charge offs totaling million  as loan quality continued to deteriorate 
we experienced loan quality deterioration across all segments of our commercial loan portfolio  construction  commercial real estate secured and c i 
the allowance for loan losses related to impaired loans increased in both dollar amount and as a percentage of impaired loans 
the allowance related to impaired loans was million at december  compared to million the prior year end and represented and of impaired loans at december  and  respectively 
in addition to nonperforming and impaired loans  we also actively monitor performing loans where appropriate 
the number and dollar amount of loans that  while performing currently  are receiving heightened monitoring  increased throughout allowance for loan losses we have established an allowance for loan losses to provide for loans in our portfolio that may not be repaid in their entirety 
the allowance is based on our regular  quarterly assessments of the probable estimated losses inherent in the loan portfolio 
our methodology for measuring the appropriate level of the allowance relies on 
table of contents several key elements  which include the formula described below  specific allowances for identified problem loans and portfolio segments  and the unallocated allowance 
the formula portion of the allowance is calculated by applying loss factors to categories of loans outstanding in the portfolio 
the loans are categorized by loan type as commercial and industrial  commercial real estate secured  residential real estate construction  commercial real estate construction loans  residential real estate mortgage and consumer loans 
those categories are further segregated by risk classification for commercial loans and by delinquency status for consumer loans 
each commercial  commercial real estate and real estate construction loan has a risk grade based on formal defined criteria 
for consumer loans  we further categorize the loans into consumer loan product types  for example home equity loans and loans secured by manufactured homes 
segregation of the loans into more discrete pools facilitates greater precision in matching historic and expected loan losses with the source of the loss 
we adjust these pools from time to time  based on the changing composition of the loan portfolio  segmenting loans with similar attributes and risk characteristics 
we calculate actual historic loss rates for prior years for each separate loan segment identified 
each of the prior years historical loss rates is then weighted based on our evaluation of the duration of the economic cycle to arrive at a current expected loss rate 
in  we attributed more weight to our loss experience in the most recent two years 
the current expected loss rates are adjusted  if deemed appropriate  for other relevant factors affecting the portfolio segments  including changes in lending practices  trends in past due loans and industry  geographical  collateral and size concentrations 
finally  the resulting loss factors are multiplied against the current period loans outstanding to derive an estimated loss 
specific allowances are established in cases where management has identified significant conditions or circumstances related to a loan that indicate a loss will probably be incurred  but the degree of certainty and loss quantification has not reached the charge off level 
the amount in the allowance for loan losses for impaired loans is determined based on the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan s effective interest rate  or the fair value of the collateral  net of cost to sell 
our estimate of the amount of loss on a loan secured by real estate has increased in complexity as a result of the current illiquidity in the real estate market 
the degree of uncertainty and the sensitivity of real estate valuations to the underlying assumptions regarding holding period until sale and the collateral liquidation method  can have a material impact on our loss estimates on loans 
if the measure of the impaired loan is less than the recorded investment in the loan  a specific allowance is established 
the unallocated portion of the allowance contains amounts that are based on management s evaluation of conditions that are not directly measured in the determination of the formula and specific allowances 
the evaluation of the inherent loss with respect to these conditions is subject to a higher degree of uncertainty because they are not identified with specific problem credits or portfolio segments 
the factors assessed are more qualitative in nature 
conditions affecting the entire lending portfolio evaluated in connection with the unallocated portion of the allowance include general economic and business conditions  duration of the current business cycle  the impact of competition on our underwriting terms  current general market collateral valuations and findings of our independent loan review process 
management reviews these conditions quarterly in discussion with our senior lenders and credit officers 
to the extent that any of these conditions is evidenced by a specifically identifiable problem credit or portfolio segment as of the evaluation date  management s estimate of the effect of such condition may be reflected as part of the formula allowance applicable to such credit or portfolio segment 
where any of these conditions is not evidenced by a specifically identifiable problem credit or portfolio segment  management s evaluation of the probable loss related to such conditions is reflected in the unallocated portion of the allowance 
management believes that the allowance for loan losses is adequate to absorb probable losses on existing loans that may become uncollectible 
however  there can be no assurance that our allowance will prove sufficient to cover actual loan losses in the future 
in addition  various regulatory agencies  as an integral part of their examination process  periodically review the adequacy of our allowance for loan losses 
such agencies may require us to make additional provisions to the allowance based upon their judgments about information available to them at the time of their examinations

net charge offs were million  or of average loans  during in comparison  net charge offs were million  or of average loans  during and million  or of average loans  during net charge offs have increased as a result of the increase in the volume of nonperforming and impaired loans 
the allowance for loan losses increased in to million at december   as compared to million at the prior year end 
the allowance as a percentage of total loans also increased  representing of total loans at december   compared to at december  in  the specific reserves established for impaired loans increased million as both the volume of impaired loans and the severity of the estimated loss within the impaired loans increased 
the increase in total loans combined with higher expected loss experience increased the formula portion of the allowance an additional million 
qualitative factors  the most significant being the current economic environment also increased the allowance 

table of contents as a business bank  our loan portfolio is comprised primarily of commercial loans to businesses 
these loans are inherently larger in amount than loans to individual consumers and therefore have higher potential losses on an individual loan basis 
the individually larger commercial loans can cause greater volatility in reported credit quality performance measures  such as total impaired or nonperforming loans 
our current credit risk rating and loss estimate with respect to a single sizable loan can have a material impact on our reported impaired loans and related loss exposure estimates 
in  we increased our in house exposure guidelines for certain portions of our non real estate lending portfolio and increased the number of borrowing relationships in excess of million 
the deterioration of any one or a few loans over million may cause a significant increase in uncollectible loans and  therefore  our allowance for loan losses 
we review our estimates on a quarterly basis and  as we identify changes in estimates  the allowance for loan losses is adjusted through the recording of a provision for loan losses 
the table below presents an allocation of the allowance for loan losses among the various loan categories and sets forth the percentage of loans in each category to gross loans 
the allocation of the allowance for loan losses as shown in the table should neither be interpreted as an indication of future charge offs  nor as an indication that charge offs in future periods will necessarily occur in these amounts or in the indicated proportions

within this customer group  there were two customers with combined balances of million at december   as compared to million at december  during  one significant customer withdrew the majority of their deposits and the other transferred their deposits from a money market account to a now account 
on april   we sold one of our branches located in the city of chicago to another financial institution 
the branch s deposits totaled million on the date it was sold 
in october  we entered the certificate of deposit account registry service network  which allows the bank to accommodate depositors with large funds seeking the full deposit insurance protection  by placing these 
table of contents funds in cds issued by other banks in the network 
through a matching system  we will receive funds back for cds that we issue for other banks in the network  thus allowing us to retain the full amount of the original deposit

we utilize out of market cds to fund the portion of our earning asset growth that is not funded with in market deposits and other borrowings 
we offer cds to out of local market customers by providing rates to a private third party electronic system that provides certificate of deposit rates from institutions across the country to its subscribers 
these cds are generally issued at amounts of  or less as the purchasers sought to maintain full fdic deposit insurance protection 
the balance of cds obtained through this marketing medium was million at december   as compared to million and million at december   and  respectively

total brokered money market balances were million  million and million at december   and  respectively 
under fdic regulations  only well capitalized institutions may issue brokered cds without prior regulatory approval 
the bank is currently categorized as well capitalized and therefore may continue to utilize this funding source 
brokered cd distributors utilize capital ratios and other criteria in evaluating and approving those banks that they allow to issue brokered cds through their distribution network 
extreme distress in the financial markets  combined with our adverse operating results at the bank have resulted in a reduction in our access to some of these brokered cd distribution networks 
reduced access to the brokered cd market may 
table of contents lead to an inability to replace brokered deposits at maturity  which would result in higher costs or limit asset growth at the bank 
the bank manages this risk by utilizing multiple brokered cd distributors and has not experienced any difficulty acquiring sufficient deposits at market rates through this funding source

brokered cds are carried net of the related broker placement fees and the remaining unamortized fair value adjustments associated with brokered cds previously accounted for as fair value hedges 
the broker placement fees and unamortized fair value adjustments are amortized to the maturity date of the related brokered cds and included in deposit interest expense 
a portion of our brokered cds were issued with options that allow us to call the brokered cds at par prior to their scheduled maturity date 
during  we called million of brokered cds and recognized million of early extinguishment of debt expense for the amount of unamortized broker placement fees and fair value adjustments 
brokered cds callable by us totaled million at december  other borrowings at december   our other borrowings totaled million  as compared to million at december  our other borrowings include securities sold under agreements to repurchase  federal funds purchased and us treasury tax and loan note option accounts 
the decline in total other borrowings was largely a result of the million decline in overnight repurchase agreements and the million decline in us treasury tax and loan note option borrowings 
securities sold under agreements to repurchase repos include overnight and term agreements 
the overnight securities sold under agreements to repurchase are collateralized financing transactions and are primarily executed with local bank customers 
overnight repos totaled million and million at december  and  respectively 
we believe the decline in the volume of overnight repos was primarily a result of our reduction of the interest rates paid on these funds  as short term market interest rates declined during our term repos totaled million at both december  and and include embedded derivatives 
these structured repos consist of million with embedded interest rate caps and a five year term with a two year no call provision  million with a three year term and a three month no call provision  and million with a five year term and a three month no call provision 
at december   million of the term repos were currently eligible to be called at the counterparty s option and the remaining million will 
table of contents be callable in in addition  the structured repo agreements allow the counterparty to terminate the agreement prior to the call date if the bank were to lose its well capitalized status

at december  and  the bank had pre approved overnight federal funds borrowing lines of million and million  respectively 
adverse operating results at the bank have resulted in a reduction in our approved federal funds borrowing lines 
our number of pre approved federal funds borrowing lines has declined as well  to four at december  from seven at december  subsequent to year end  the bank has increased its pre approved borrowing lines for federal funds purchased by million 
the bank has further increased its ability to purchase federal funds by cultivating relationships with a growing group of correspondent banking customers who may sell federal funds to the bank in order to manage their excess liquidity 
under the us treasury tax and loan note option  the bank is authorized to accept us treasury department deposits of excess funds along with deposits of customer taxes 
these borrowings are collateralized by investment securities

the revolving credit facility was amended during  reducing the commitment amount to million from million  primarily as a result of our adverse operating results in the underlying loan agreement requires that the bank remain well capitalized and the holding company remain adequately capitalized as defined by regulatory guidelines 
as of december   we were in compliance with these covenants 
we are currently in discussions to renew our credit facility at maturity 

table of contents our fhlb advances consist of borrowings from the federal home loan bank of chicago fhlbc 
at december   total fhlb advances were million  compared to million at december  during  the bank increased its borrowing from the fhlb to fund purchases of investment securities 
the fhlb advances are collateralized by investment securities and a blanket lien on qualified first mortgage residential and home equity loans 
as of december   million of the fhlb advances were overnight and an additional million were either callable or scheduled to mature within the next months 
the remaining million of fhlb advances can be called in currently  the fhlbc is under a formal written agreement with its regulator requiring the regulator s prior approval for the payment of dividends or redemptions of capital stock 
based on written correspondence and verbal communications with the fhlbc  we believe the order should not impact the fhlbc s ability to provide us with liquidity and funding needs provided we continue to meet their credit standards

the warrants  which represent an aggregate of  shares of common stock  will expire on the fifth anniversary of issuance 
the proceeds received from this transaction were allocated to the subordinated notes and the warrants based upon their relative fair values 
at december   the subordinated notes reported on the consolidated balance sheet totaled million  which was net of million of unamortized discount 
the discount consists primarily of the fair value allocated to the warrants and was reported as an addition to surplus in the equity portion of the consolidated balance sheet 
the discount is being amortized as an additional interest expense of the subordinated notes  over the remaining contractual life of the notes 
preferred stock during  the holding company issued two series of preferred stock 
both the series a and series b preferred stock qualifies as tier capital for regulatory purposes 
series a preferred stock was sold to private investors in september for gross proceeds of million 
the series a preferred stock is noncumulative  carries a rate of and each share of preferred stock is convertible into shares of our common stock at a conversion price of per common share 
the non detachable conversion right was determined to constitute a beneficial conversion feature because the conversion price was less than the market price of the company s stock on the commitment date 
therefore  the preferred stock was recorded upon issuance net of the million beneficial conversion feature and increased to its stated value through the recording of a million one time  implied non cash dividend to the holders of the preferred stock

in addition  under the terms of the junior subordinated debentures and the series a preferred stock  any deferral of the payment of interest or dividends results in a defined restriction in the payment of common dividends regulatory capital we monitor compliance with bank regulatory capital requirements  focusing primarily on the risk based capital guidelines 
under the risk based capital method of capital measurement  the ratio computed is dependent on the amount and composition of assets recorded on the balance sheet and the amount and composition of off balance sheet items  in addition to the level of capital 
generally  tier i capital includes common stockholders equity  noncumulative perpetual preferred stock and trust preferred securities up to certain limits 
bank regulators however  also specifically approved the series b preferred stock for inclusion in tier capital  in spite of its cumulative dividend feature 
total capital represents tier i capital plus a portion of the allowance for loan loss up to certain limits  subordinated debt and the portion of the trust preferred securities not includable in tier i capital 
at december    and  the holding company was considered well capitalized under capital guidelines set by the federal reserve for bank holding companies 
in  while the dollar amount of regulatory capital increased  an increase in risk weighted assets resulted in two of the three capital ratios declining at december  as compared to the prior year end 
regulatory capital increased as a result of the issuance of both series of preferred stock and the warrants to purchase common stock 
these capital injections more than offset the net loss applicable to common shareholders of million in the holding company s regulatory ratios at december  decreased in comparison to the end of primarily as a result of our repurchase of million of holding company common stock during at december    and  the bank was considered well capitalized under regulatory capital guidelines

we manage the risks associated with this reliance on wholesale funding sources by maintaining adequate alternate sources of funding and excess collateral available for immediate use 
for example  the bank is able to borrow from the federal reserve bank using securities or commercial loans as collateral through the borrower in custody program 
the bank also maintains pre approved overnight federal funds borrowing lines at various correspondent banks and repurchase agreement availability with major brokers and banks

in addition  an independent debt rating agency  fitch ratings  downgraded its rating of the holding company and the bank three times during fitch reduced the long and short term debt and deposit ratings from investment grade to non investment grade and revised their ratings outlook to negative from stable 
we have also experienced a decline in our ratings from other independent bank rating entities such as idc  lace and bankrate

these ratings declines could negatively impact our acquisition or retention of deposits and could increase our cost of borrowing or limit our asset growth

commitments to extend credit and financial guarantees are used to meet the financial needs of our customers 
we had commitments to extend credit of million and million at december  and  respectively 
commitments to extend credit are agreements to lend to a customer as long as there is no violation of any condition established in the contract 
commitments generally have fixed expiration dates or other termination clauses and may require payment of a fee 
many customers do not utilize the total approved commitment amounts 
at december   of available consumer and commercial loan commitment amounts were drawn compared to as of december  the total commitment amounts do not typically represent future cash requirements 
we had million and million of financial and performance standby letters of credit at december  and  respectively 
financial standby letters of credit are conditional commitments issued by us to guarantee the payment of a specified financial obligation of a customer to a third party 
performance standby letters of credit are conditional commitments issued by us to make a payment to a specified third party in the event a customer fails to perform under a non financial contractual obligation 
the terms of these financial guarantees range from less than one to five years 
the credit risk involved in issuing these letters of credit is essentially the same as that involved in extending loan facilities to customers 
we expect most of these letters of credit to expire undrawn and we expect no significant loss from our obligation under financial guarantees to the extent not already recognized as a liability on the company s consolidated balance sheets 
at december   a liability for million was established for commitments under standby letters of credit for which we believed funding and loss were probable

these derivative instruments are not designated as accounting hedges and changes in fair value of these instruments  as well as any net cash settlements  are recognized in noninterest income as other derivative income or expense 
as of december  and  we had notional amounts of million and million  respectively  of interest rate swaps with customers in which we agreed to receive a fixed interest rate and pay a variable interest rate 
in addition  as of december  and  we had offsetting interest rate swaps with other counterparties with a notional amount of million and million  respectively  of notional amount in which we agreed to receive a variable interest rate and pay a fixed interest rate 
we also use derivative instruments  such as interest rate swaps  floors and collars  in the management of our own interest rate risks 
during the second quarter of  we entered into a million notional amount interest rate swap agreement that was designated as a cash flow hedge against interest receipts from prime based loans 
under this agreement  we received payments at a fixed rate of  computed on the notional amount  and paid a variable rate based upon the prime lending rate  computed on the notional amount 
the fair value of cash flow hedging derivative instruments was recorded as an asset or liability with the effective portion of the corresponding unrealized gain or loss recorded in other comprehensive income in stockholders equity  net of tax 
this cash flow hedge was highly effective  however  we elected to remove the hedge designation on this derivative in december when we determined that this hedge would no longer be considered highly effective in the future 
the unrealized gain on the swap at the date of de designation was million 
the amount in accumulated other comprehensive income  along with the related deferred tax liability  will be amortized over what would have been the remaining term of the hedge 
during   of the deferred gain was reclassified into loan interest income and million will be reclassified during from the date of de designation to december   the change in fair value  along with net settlements attributed to this period  was recorded in other derivative income in non interest income and totaled  this derivative was terminated in january for million 

table of contents during march  we terminated two interest rate floor agreements with a notional amount of million 
one of the floor agreements  with a notional amount of million  was not designated as an accounting hedge 
other derivative income  reported in noninterest income  included  of income from changes in the fair value from this non designated floor agreement during prior to termination 
this floor agreement had been designated as a cash flow hedge  but we discontinued hedge accounting in may upon de designation  the balance in accumulated other comprehensive income  which was comprised of the change in fair value since inception less amortization of the original floor cost  net of tax  is being amortized to loan interest income over the remaining four year term of the floor 
during and   and  respectively  was reclassified as a reduction in loan interest income and  is expected to be reclassified in we did not receive any payments in or under this floor agreement 
the second floor agreement  with a notional amount of million was designated as a cash flow hedge 
upon termination of this floor agreement  the million of unrealized gain that had been accumulated in other comprehensive income  which consisted of the increase in fair value since inception less the cumulative amortization of the floor premium  will be amortized over what would have been the remaining life of the floor agreement 
this floor was scheduled to mature in july during   of deferred gains were amortized as additional loan interest income and  of the deferred gain will be amortized in we did not receive any payments in or under this floor agreement 
during  we entered into two interest rate collars with a total notional amount of million that were designated as cash flow hedges against interest receipts from prime based loans 
the collars were obtained at no cost 
during  we received  of settlements under the collar agreements when the floating rate decreased below the collar floor rate 
these settlements were recorded as loan interest income 
we did not make any payments under the collars in in december  we terminated these collars with the counterparty 
the fair value of the collars at termination was million 
because the forecasted hedged transactions were probable of occurring  the gain realized upon termination was deferred and is amortized as loan interest income over what would have been the remaining life of the derivatives  which were scheduled to mature in may and may during and  million and  respectively of deferred gains were amortized as loan interest income and million of the deferred gain will be amortized in we also have used interest rate swaps cd swaps to hedge the interest rate risk inherent in certain of our brokered certificates of deposits brokered cds 
the cd swaps were used to convert the fixed rate paid on the brokered cds to a variable rate based upon month libor 
in may  we terminated all of the million notional amount of cd swaps that had been used as fair value hedges against brokered cds 
upon termination  we began amortizing the associated cumulative fair value adjustment to the hedged brokered cds of million as deposit interest expense over the remaining life of the cds using an effective yield method 
during and   and  respectively  of this fair value adjustment was amortized as deposit interest expense  and  of this adjustment is expected to be amortized in in addition  noninterest expense during included the write off of million of the unamortized fair value adjustments when we exercised our option to call certain of the brokered cds before their maturity date

quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risks interest rate risk is the most significant market risk affecting us 
other types of market risk  such as foreign currency risk and commodity price risk  do not arise in the normal course of our business activities 
interest rate risk can be defined as the exposure to a movement in interest rates that could have an adverse effect on our net interest income or the market value of our financial instruments 
the ongoing monitoring and management of this risk is an important component of our asset and liability management process  which is governed by policies 
table of contents established by the board of directors and carried out by the bank s asset liability management committee  or alco 
alco s objectives are to manage  to the degree prudently possible  our exposure to interest rate risk over both the one year planning cycle and the longer term strategic horizon and  at the same time  to provide a stable and steadily increasing flow of net interest income 
interest rate risk management activities include establishing guidelines for tenor and repricing characteristics of new business flow  the maturity ladder of wholesale funding and investment security purchase and sale strategies  as well as the use of derivative financial instruments 
we have used various interest rate contracts  including swaps and interest rate floors and collars  to manage interest rate and market risk 
these contracts can be designated as hedges of specific existing assets and liabilities 
our asset and liability management and investment policies do not allow the use of derivative financial instruments for trading purposes 
our primary measurement of interest rate risk is earnings at risk  which is determined through computerized simulation modeling 
the primary simulation model assumes a static balance sheet  a parallel interest rate rising or declining ramp and uses the balances  rates  maturities and repricing characteristics of all of our existing assets and liabilities  including derivative financial instruments 
these models are built with the sole objective of measuring the volatility of the embedded interest rate risk as of the balance sheet date and  as such  do not provide for growth or any changes in balance sheet composition 
projected net interest income is computed by the model assuming market rates remaining unchanged and compares those results to other interest rate scenarios with changes in the magnitude  timing  and relationship between various interest rates 
the impact of embedded options in the balance sheet such as callable agencies and mortgage backed securities  real estate mortgage loans  and callable borrowings are also considered 
changes in net interest income in the rising and declining rate scenarios are then measured against the net interest income in the rates unchanged scenario 
alco utilizes the results of the model to quantify the estimated exposure of net interest income to sustained interest rate changes 
net interest income for year one in a basis points rising rate scenario was calculated to be million  or  higher than the net interest income in the rates unchanged scenario at december  at december   the projected variance in the rising rate scenario was million  or higher than the rates unchanged scenario 
these exposures were within our policy guidelines of 
no simulation for net interest income at risk in a falling rate scenario was calculated because of the low level of market interest rates at december  computation of prospective effects of hypothetical interest rate changes are based on numerous assumptions  including  among other factors  no change in the balance sheet size or composition  relative levels of market interest rates  product pricing  reinvestment strategies and customer behavior influencing loan and security prepayments and deposit decay and should not be relied upon as indicative of actual results 
further  the computations do not contemplate any actions we may take in response to changes in market interest rates 
we cannot assure you that our actual net interest income would increase or decrease by the amounts computed by the simulations 
the following table indicates the estimated impact on net interest income in year one under various parallel ramp interest rate scenarios at december  and change in future net interest income at december  at december  change in interest rates dollar change percentage change dollar change percentage change dollars in thousands basis points over one year basis points over one year n a n a  
table of contents we also monitor the repricing terms of our assets and liabilities through gap matrix reports for the rates in unchanged  rising and falling interest rate scenarios 
the reports illustrate  at designated time frames  the dollar amount of assets and liabilities maturing or repricing under the different interest rate scenarios 
the following table sets forth the amounts of our interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities outstanding at december   on a consolidated basis  that we anticipate  based upon certain assumptions  to reprice or mature in each of the future time periods shown 
the projected repricing of assets and liabilities anticipates prepayments and scheduled rate adjustments  as well as contractual maturities under an interest rate unchanged scenario within the selected time intervals 
while we believe such assumptions are reasonable  there can be no assurance that assumed repricing rates would approximate our actual future experience 
volumes subject to repricing within days days days years years over years total dollars in thousands interest earning assets short term investments and federal funds sold investment securities and fhlb federal reserve bank stock loans total interest earning assets interest bearing liabilities interest bearing checking  savings and money market accounts certificates of deposit other borrowings notes payable fhlb advances junior subordinated debentures subordinated notes  net total interest bearing liabilities period gap cumulative gap period gap to total assets cumulative gap to total assets cumulative interest earning assets to cumulative interest bearing liabilities certain shortcomings are inherent in the method of analysis presented in the gap table 
for example  although certain assets and liabilities may have similar maturities or periods of repricing  they may react in different degrees to changes in market interest rates 
additionally  certain assets  such as adjustable rate loans  have features that restrict changes in interest rates  both on a short term basis and over the life of the asset 
more importantly  changes in interest rates  prepayments and early withdrawal levels may deviate significantly from those assumed in the calculations in the table 
as a result of these shortcomings  we focus more on earnings at risk simulation modeling than on gap analysis 
even though the gap analysis reflects a ratio of cumulative gap to total assets within acceptable limits  the earnings at risk simulation modeling is considered by management to be more informative in forecasting future income at risk 
finally  we also monitor core funding utilization in each interest rate scenario as well as market value of equity 
these measures are used to evaluate long term interest rate risk beyond the two year planning horizon
