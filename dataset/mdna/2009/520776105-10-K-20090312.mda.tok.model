item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
overview the two principal factors affecting our results were the one time million dpa settlement penalty and the global economic recession and contraction in the credit markets that led to decreased customer demand throughout our industry 
the duration of the recession is uncertain and industry demand is expected to continue to decline and create downward pressure on sales volume in despite the negative effects of the economy  we were able to take steps to improve our financial condition during operationally  we made progress in integrating previously separate businesses to allow our customers access to an expanded range of products from a single point of contact 
we were able to generate cash by reducing our working capital requirements primarily through initiatives taken to improve inventory management 
additionally  the settlement with the united states attorney s office for the northern district of illinois substantially brings to a close the uncertainty created by the investigation initiated in summary of financial performance year ended december  amount of net sales amount of net sales amount of net sales dollars in thousands net sales mro oem consolidated total gross profit mro oem consolidated total operating expenses selling  general and administrative expenses settlement related costs severance and other charges impairment of goodwill loss on sale of equipment operating loss income other  net loss income from continuing operations before income tax expense income tax expense loss income from continuing operations

net sales of our mro business experienced a severe decline of in the fourth quarter of compared to as our customers  affected by overall weakness in the economy and a much more restrictive credit environment  reduced their purchasing requirements 
we expect the demand level to continue to deteriorate until the credit markets recover and the global economic environment improves 
sales were also negatively impacted by a net reduction of over sales agents in compared to net sales of our oem segment decreased million due to customer losses and the economic slowdown in the fourth quarter  partially offset by increased sales generated from some of our current customers 
gross profit decreased million to million in primarily due to the reduction in net sales and a decline of percentage points as a percent of sales 
the decline was primarily attributable to higher product and commodity costs 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative costs declined by to million in compared to million in primarily due to decreases in sales commissions and compensation expenses 
selling  general and administrative costs as a percent of sales increased percentage points to in as fixed costs were not reduced in direct proportion to the overall decrease in net sales 
settlement and related costs settlement costs relate to the investigation by the us attorney s office for the northern district of illinois as to whether our sales representatives provided improper gifts or awards to purchasing agents including government purchasing agents through our customer loyalty programs 
in august  in connection with the investigation  we entered into the dpa with the us attorney s office and agreed to pay a million penalty 
in addition to the penalty  we incurred legal and other expenses of million in and million in in connection with the investigation

of this amount  million related to severance costs associated with the departure of certain executives and operational efficiency improvement initiatives and million related to unclaimed property liabilities primarily associated with years prior to during  the company implemented several initiatives designed to improve operating efficiencies 
as a result of these initiatives  certain positions and departments were eliminated and restructured  resulting in million of severance costs and other charges 
impairment of goodwill annually  we assess the fair value of our goodwill for impairment 
our review resulted in a million non cash charge to reflect the impairment of goodwill recorded in our oem segment related to acs

results of operations for as compared to sales and gross profit sales and gross profit results for the years ending december  and were as follows year ended december  change amount dollars in thousands net sales mro oem consolidated gross profit mro oem consolidated gross profit margin mro oem consolidated the decrease in net sales to million in compared to million in resulted from decreases in both the mro and oem segments 
the sales decrease for mro businesses was primarily driven by lower sales of metalworking products due to order fulfillment problems encountered during the reno  nevada distribution facility expansion which was completed in december oem sales decreased primarily due to the loss of some customer contracts 
gross profit decreased million to million in compared to million in primarily due to lower overall sales in as a percent of sales  gross profit declined by percentage points to in from

selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative costs declined by to million in compared to million in as a percent of sales selling  general and administrative costs declined percentage points to in compared to in primarily due to several initiatives undertaken during designed to improve operating efficiencies 
the initiatives included the elimination of certain positions and restructuring of departments 
settlement related costs the company incurred legal and other expenses of million in and million in in connection with the investigation by the us attorney s office for the northern district of illinois related to whether company sales representatives provided improper gifts or awards to purchasing agents including government purchasing agents through the company s customer loyalty programs 
severance and other charges the company implemented several initiatives during designed to improve operating efficiencies

the company incurred million of severance and other charges in other expense income  net the company recorded million of other expense  net in compared to million of other income  net  in the million increase in other expense  net was primarily due to a higher average balance on our revolving line of credit which increased our interest expense in and lower foreign currency gains realized in compared to income tax expense the effective tax rates for continuing operations for and were and  respectively 
the higher effective tax rate in primarily reflects adjustments related to the deductibility of the company s customer loyalty programs in its mro business for tax years  and many of the customer loyalty and promotion programs in place for these years were terminated or replaced early in liquidity and capital resources cash provided by operating activities for  and was million  million and million  respectively 
the million increase in compared to was primarily due to improved working capital utilization which was mostly offset by a decrease in net income and the million payment related to the dpa penalty 
the million decline in cash provided by operating activities from was due primarily to lower net income and increases in inventories  prepaid expenses and miscellaneous receivables 
working capital at december  and was million and million  respectively 
the million decrease in working capital is primarily attributable to a million reduction in inventory  and a million reduction in accounts receivable  partially offset by decreases in other liabilities 
initiatives taken to improve the inventory management process led to the lower inventory balance  while increased attention to collections and a reduction in sales during the fourth quarter led to the decrease in the amount of outstanding accounts receivable 

table of contents cash used to purchase property plant and equipment was million in compared to million in and million in included million related to the reno  nevada facility expansion 
capital spending was reduced in in response to the economic downturn that began in the second half of financing activities included a million paydown of our line of credit in compared to million borrowed from the line of credit in the company paid dividends of million  million and million to shareholders of its common stock in  and  respectively 
in october  we purchased  of our common shares in a dutch auction tender offer at a cost of million 
we did not purchase any of our common stock in or at december    shares remained available for purchase pursuant to the authorization by our board of directors to purchase up to  shares of our common stock 
in november  we entered into a first amended and restated credit agreement the credit facility with bank of america  na the credit facility provides for a total commitment of million in the form of revolving loans and letters of credit and matures on november  the interest rate for the credit facility bears interest at either  libor plus  or the prime rate minus  as elected by us 
the interest rate may be adjusted based on the ratio of consolidated total debt to ebitda calculated on the basis of our most recent annual or quarterly financial statements 
we had million outstanding as of december  under the credit facility 
the weighted average interest rate was for the year ended december  the credit facility specifies certain financial covenants  including a fixed charge coverage and total debt to equity and minimum net worth calculations which must be met as of the end of each fiscal quarter 
at december  we were in compliance with all covenants 
in march we amended the credit facility the amended credit facility  reducing the amount of the facility  adjusting the covenants and providing additional security to bank of america  na the amended credit facility provides for a total commitment of million 
the maturity date remains november  the interest rate is libor plus a margin of to  based on the ratio of total debt to ebitda 
the amended credit facility contains covenants for adjusted ebitda  as defined in the agreement  for each quarter through september  commencing with the quarter ending december   additional covenants will be in place  including fixed charge coverage  total debt to equity and minimum net worth  as defined in the credit agreement 
the amended credit facility places a restriction on quarterly dividends of million  or million on an annual basis 
the amended credit facility is secured by substantially all of the assets of the company  excluding real property and the capital stock of the company s subsidiaries  except for the stock of lawson canada 
the company paid an amendment fee of million 
we believe that cash provided by operations and the million revolving line of credit will be sufficient to fund our operating requirements  cash dividends and capital improvements for the upcoming fiscal year 

table of contents contractual obligations contractual obligations that will require payment over future periods are as follows payments due in years ended december  total thereafter amounts in thousands operating leases capital leases revolving line of credit deferred compensation security bonus plan severance obligation long term incentive plan purchase commitments deferred prosecution agreement total contractual cash obligations payments to beneficiaries of the security bonus plan are made on a lump sum basis at time of retirement 
payouts for known retirement dates have been included in  while payouts for unknown retirement dates are reflected in the thereafter column 
off balance sheet arrangements we have not entered into any off balance sheet arrangements 
critical accounting policies the company has disclosed its significant accounting policies in note b to the consolidated financial statements 
the following provides supplemental information to these accounting policies as well as information on the accounts requiring more significant estimates 
allowance for doubtful accounts methodology we evaluate the collectibility of accounts receivable based on a combination of factors 
in circumstances where we are aware of a specific customer s inability to meet its financial obligations eg  bankruptcy filings  substantial down grading of credit ratings  a specific reserve for bad debts is recorded against amounts due to reduce the receivable to the amount we believe will be collected 
for all other customers  we recognize reserves for bad debts based on our historical experience of bad debt write offs as a percent of accounts receivable outstanding 
if circumstances change ie  higher than expected defaults or an unexpected material adverse change in a major customer s ability to meet its financial obligations  the estimates of the recoverability of amounts due to us could be revised by a material amount 
in  we recorded an allowance reserve equal to of our trade receivables outstanding 
a hypothetical change of one percent to our reserve allowance would have affected our annual doubtful accounts expense by approximately million 
inventory reserves we carry a significant amount of inventory as part of our strategy to fulfill the vast majority of our customers orders the same day received 
however  this strategy increases the chance that portions of the inventory have lost value through obsolescence or becoming slow moving or excess 
to reduce inventory to a lower of cost or market value  we record a reserve for slow moving and obsolete inventory 
obsolete and slow moving inventory is monitored by examining reports of parts which have not been sold for extended periods 
if experience or market conditions change  estimates of the reserves needed could be revised by a material amount 
in  we have an allowance reserve of million equal to approximately of our total inventory 
a hypothetical change of one percent to our reserve allowance would have affected our selling  general and administrative expenses by approximately million 
income taxes deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the difference between the financial statements and tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the 
table of contents differences are expected to reverse 
we record a provision for income taxes based on domestic and international statutory income tax rates and tax planning opportunities in the jurisdictions in which we operate 
significant judgment is required in determining income tax provisions as well as deferred tax asset and liability balances  including the estimation of valuation allowances and the evaluation of tax positions 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk through one of our subsidiaries  we distribute products in canada 
the functional currency of this subsidiary is the canadian dollar which is translated into us dollars when included in our consolidated financial statements 
therefore  we are exposed to market risk relating to the change in the value of the canadian dollar relative to the us dollar 
a hypothetical change in the canadian foreign currency exchange rate would have affected our net sales by million and total assets by million 
we are exposed to investment market risk relating to changes in the value of the million cash value of life insurance asset 
this exposure is mostly offset by the million value of the deferred compensation liability 
a hypothetical increase or decrease in the investment portfolios of both the cash value of life insurance asset and the deferred compensation liability would have affected our net income by million 
at december   we had a million outstanding balance on our revolving line of credit 
the market risk of a one percentage point change in the libor or prime interest rates would be immaterial to our operating results 
we are exposed to market risk relating to increased commodity and energy costs affecting the production costs of our vendors 
those vendors typically look to pass their increased costs along to us and if we are unable to fully pass these costs through to our customers or to modify our activities  the impact would have an adverse effect on our operating profit margins
