item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations you should read the following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations in conjunction with the audited financial statements and the notes to those statements included elsewhere in this form k 
this discussion contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
you should specifically consider the various risk factors identified in this filing that could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements 
executive overview what were our key financial results our net sales in increased to million compared to million in our operating income increased to million in from million in  a increase 
our earnings per diluted common share increased to per diluted common share in compared with per diluted common share in we continued our trend of positive operating cash flow in of million compared with million in we have generated positive operating cash flow each of the last eight years 
what did we focus on in in  we focused on pursuing profitable growth of our converted product business by utilizing internally more of our paper making capacity  achieving greater efficiency in our paper making and converting operations  and reducing costs in our converting processes 
we were able to increase our net sales of converted products in by over through a combination of price increases and utilizing a production increase in our converting plant in to increase sales to existing customers and to increase our presence in the grocery retail channels 
our efforts to improve the efficiency of our paper making operation centered on the production from our new paper machine 
through these efforts  we were able to increase production by in over beginning in late and continuing through  we undertook an initiative to increase our converting efficiency 
as an initial step  we increased the depth of our converting operating team by adding personnel with greater experience in engineering and reliability maintenance 
then  during the second quarter of we hired a productivity consultant to assist our converting operations team to design and implement a management operating system and assist the operating team to implement new work schedules and work practices 
the management operating system helped identify and confirm the root causes of issues which impaired production efficiency 
as a result  we realized productivity levels from september through february that exceeded by those experienced in the first eight months of in early  we began a converting automation project to lower our labor costs in our converting facility 
we completed this million project which included purchasing and installing case packers  conveyors and robotics in february this project was undertaken to eliminate manual labor intensive processes and thus reduce the labor associated with those manual labor processes 
as previously reported  we expect to reduce overall costs by million a year 

table of contents what challenges and opportunities did our business face in we experienced significant cost pressures during the year  particularly in the price of waste paper and natural gas 
this resulted in a need to affect price increases through actual price increases and content changes 
in many instances  a change in product content resulted in a need for modifications to equipment  which delayed the implementation of the content change 
the overall cost of paper in increased year over year due mainly to an increase in waste paper prices as well as higher natural gas prices 
in  average waste paper costs and average natural gas prices increased and over levels 
what will we focus on in in  we will continue to focus on optimizing our operating assets 
in particular  our converting operations team will utilize the management operating system installed in the converting operations in to continue the production improvement trends experienced to date 
in addition  we have projects scheduled for to re build certain converting lines which should increase productivity and projects to improve the flexibility of certain converting lines 
we will also focus on the optimization of the million converting automation project that was completed in february  and we anticipate increased year over year production in the paper mill 
we currently are reviewing our logistics operations and our strategy of employing a third party warehouse 
the results of this study may indicate a need to expand our current warehouse facility and eliminate the use of the third party warehouse 
the cost of expanding our warehouse is estimated at million 
funding for this project would come from either cash earnings  a new borrowing agreement or a combination of both 
we are also studying a project to purchase a new converting line to aid in our strategy to increase sales and profitability and to consume all of our paper making production in our converting operation 
this project is in the early stages of evaluation and is expected to cost between million and million 
we will pursue profitable sales growth of our increased output in our converting operations by increasing sales to established customers as well as continuing to focus on obtaining new customers in the grocery sales channels 
business overview we are a manufacturer and converter of tissue paper for the private label segment of the value retail consumer tissue market 
we have focused our product design and manufacturing on the discount retail market  primarily the dollar stores  due to their consistent order patterns  limited number of stock keeping units  or skus  offered and the growth being experienced in this channel of the retail market 
all of our converted product revenue is derived pursuant to truck load purchase orders from our customers 
parent roll revenue is derived from purchase orders that generally cover a one month time period 
we do not have supply contracts with any of our customers 
revenue is recognized when title passes to the customer 
because our product is a daily consumable item  the order stream from our customer base is fairly consistent with no significant seasonal fluctuations 
changes in the national economy  in general  do not materially affect the market for our converted products 
our profitability depends on several key factors  including the market price of our product  the cost of recycled waste paper used in producing paper  the efficiency of operations in both our paper mill and converting plant  and the cost of energy 

table of contents the private label segment of the tissue industry is highly competitive  and discount retail customers are extremely price sensitive 
as a result  it is difficult to effect price increases 
we expect these competitive conditions to continue 
in june  we began operating a new paper machine with a rated annual capacity of approximately  tons 
the capacity of the new machine in addition to the capacity of our older paper machines increased our total production capacity to approximately  tons per year 
as a result  beginning in the third quarter of  we were able to eliminate the requirement to purchase recycled parent rolls on the open market and we commenced the sale of parent rolls on the open market 
prior to the third quarter of  we had purchased parent rolls on the open market because our own parent roll production had not adequately supplied the requirements of our converting facility 
in the second quarter of  due to the relatively high price of parent rolls  we began operating all of our older machines on a full time basis 
our strategy is to sell all of our parent roll capacity as converted products which have higher margins than parent rolls 
as previously discussed  we are focusing considerable efforts to improve our converting efficiencies in order to achieve that goal 
we plan to use the additional converting production to further our penetration into existing markets including grocery store chains whose distribution centers are located close to our facility thereby allowing us to maximize our competitive freight cost advantage over our competitors who are not located within our geographic region 
we plan to continue to sell any excess parent roll capacity on the open market as long as such sales are profitable 
parent rolls are a commodity product and as such are subject to market price and availability 
our additional paper making capacity has exceeded the current demands of our converting operation and  as a result  we sold  tons of parent rolls on the open market during comparative years ended december   and net sales years ended december  in thousands  except price per ton and tons converted product net sales parent roll net sales total net sales total tons shipped average price per ton net sales for the year ended december  increased million  or  to million  compared to million for the year ended december  sales figures include gross selling price  including freight  less discounts and sales promotions 
net sales of converted product in increased million  or  to million compared to million in the same period of  while net sales of parent rolls increased million or in period to million  compared to million in period 
in the year ended december   the net selling price per ton of converted product increased compared to the same period of while tonnage shipped decreased slightly 
the decrease in tonnage shipped is due to product content changes made during net sales of parent rolls in the year ended december  increased due to a increase in tonnage shipped and a increase in selling prices compared to the period 
the increase in parent roll tonnage shipped was primarily the result of our increased parent roll production due to the full year effect of running all of our older paper machines on a full time basis 

table of contents net sales increased million  or  to million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december  the increase in net sales was attributable primarily to increased volumes of parent rolls sold to third parties and an increase in net sales of converted products  resulting from both higher prices and increased shipment volumes 
parent roll sales increased approximately million to million for the year ended december   compared to million in the same period in the increase in parent roll sales in were attributable to the full year effect of the production from the new paper machine we began operating in june and  to a lesser extent  the effect of running all of our older paper machines on a full time basis beginning in may for the year ended december   the volume of parent rolls sold to third parties increased by approximately  tons 
net sales of converted product increased million  or  to million for the year ended december   compared to million in the same period in the net sales price per ton for converted product shipments for the year ended december  increased over the same period of while converted product shipment volumes increased compared to the same period in cost of sales years ended december  in thousands  except gross profit margin cost of paper non paper materials  labor  supplies  etc 
sub total depreciation cost of sales gross profit gross profit margin total paper cost per ton consumed major components of cost of sales are the cost of internally produced paper  parent rolls purchased from third parties  raw materials  direct labor and benefits  freight on products shipped to customers  insurance  repairs and maintenance  energy  utilities and depreciation 
cost of sales for the year ended december  increased million or  to million compared to million in the year ended december  our cost of sales were negatively affected by an increase in waste paper and energy costs as well higher converting costs 
cost of sales as a percentage of net sales improved to in the period compared to in the period 
cost of sales as a percent of net sales was favorably affected by higher net sales prices 
partially offsetting the net sales price improvement was higher paper production costs and higher converting costs 
paper production costs were per ton in the year ended december   an increase of per ton compared to per ton in the period 
paper production costs increased primarily due to higher waste paper prices and the higher cost of natural gas 
the prices we paid for waste paper increased approximately in the year ended december   compared to the same period in as a result  our cost of waste paper consumed increased approximately million 
waste paper prices began to decrease in the latter part of the fourth quarter of and had reduced by in december  compared to the prices paid in october  which was the highest price point in natural gas prices increased approximately in the year ended december  compared to the same period in  resulting in increased costs of approximately  
table of contents our converting production costs increased primarily due to higher maintenance and repair costs  which includes parts and service technicians  the cost of a productivity consultant and outside warehouse expense 
maintenance and repair costs increased approximately million in the year ended december  compared to the same period in late in the second quarter of through the end of the third quarter  we engaged a productivity consultant at a cost of  to assist our management team in their ongoing efforts to increase converting productivity 
the project included the design and implementation of a management operating system and assistance for our management team with the implementation of a new work schedule and work practices 
the project ended late in the third quarter 
as a result of these efforts  converting productivity from the beginning of september through february increased compared with the run rate experienced in the first eight months of we began leasing a third party warehouse late in the first quarter of  at a cost of approximately  in  to increase our shipping capacity and provide better customer service to handle our increasing converting product shipments 
we expect our annual cost to utilize this warehouse in to be approximately million 
waste paper and natural gas costs began to abate somewhat during the fourth quarter of waste paper prices decreased slightly in november and to a greater extent in december 
by the end of december  waste paper prices had decreased approximately from their highest point in october waste paper prices have continued to drop through the month of february and are now approximately off the october high 
our cost of natural gas decreased approximately in the fourth quarter of compared to the average cost for the third quarter of cost of sales increased approximately million  or  to million for the year ended december   compared to million for the same period in cost of sales as a percentage of net sales declined to in the period compared with in the period 
cost of sales as a percentage of net sales was favorably affected by the higher sales volume and prices discussed above as well as a lower overall cost of paper  excluding depreciation 
partly offsetting these factors was higher depreciation expense and higher converting labor costs 
depreciation for the year ended december  increased  to million  primarily the result of recognizing a full year of depreciation on the million paper machine project started up in june our overall cost of paper was per ton for the year ended december   compared to per ton in the same period of reduced purchases of parent rolls on the open market  attributable to the successful start up and ramp up of our new paper machine in the second half of  partially offset by higher costs of internally produced paper were the reasons for the decrease in overall cost per ton 
for the year ended december   approximately of the paper consumed in our converting operation was internally produced compared to in the same period in the cost per ton of paper produced internally was in compared to in the same period of higher waste paper costs were partially offset by lower per ton costs of fixed and semi variable costs 
waste paper prices began to increase in the third and fourth quarters of and experienced a more rapid increase during the first and second quarters of waste paper prices were generally level in the last half of overall  the price paid for waste paper in increased in the period compared to the same period in gross profit gross profit increased by million  or  to million in the year ended december   compared to million in the prior year 
as a percentage of net sales  gross profit increased to in compared to in gross profit as a percentage of net sales improved primarily due to the increase in net selling prices being partially offset by higher paper and converting costs cited above 

table of contents gross profit increased by million to million in the year ended december   compared to million in the prior year 
as a percentage of net sales  gross profit increased to in compared to in the major reasons for the increase in gross profit as a percentage of net sales is the lower overall cost of paper and higher selling prices for converted products being partially offset by higher depreciation expense and higher converting labor costs 
selling  general and administrative expenses years ended december  in thousands  except sg a as a of net sales commission expense other s  g a expenses selling  general adm exp sg a as a of net sales operating income selling  general and administrative expenses include salaries  commissions to brokers and other miscellaneous expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased million  or  to million in the year ended december  compared to million in the comparable period 
this increase was attributable to additions to the senior management team in late and during  accruals under our incentive bonus plan  higher commission expense and increased packaging costs related to product content changes 
as a percentage of net sales  selling  general and administrative expenses were basically flat at in compared to in selling  general and administrative expenses increased by to million in the year ended december   compared to million in the prior year 
costs related to the hiring of our new chief executive officer  additions to our senior management team  increased costs related to our first year implementation of section of the sarbanes oxley act of  and higher director s fees and expenses were the major reasons for the increase 
nonrecurring selling  general and administrative costs incurred in included the first year stock option expense and recruitment and relocation costs associated with the hiring of our new chief executive officer  as well as recruitment and relocation costs associated with additions to the senior management team totaling  our costs to complete our first year implementation of section of the sarbanes oxley act of increased our fees paid to our external auditors and outside consultants that assisted in the management assessment process by operating income as a result of the foregoing factors  operating income for the years ended december   and was million  million  and million  respectively 
interest and other expense years ended december  in thousands interest expense other income income before income taxes 
table of contents interest expense includes interest paid and accrued on all debt and amortization of both deferred debt financing costs and of the discount on our subordinated debt related to warrants issued with the debt 
see liquidity and capital resources below 
interest expense for the year ended december  was million a decrease of million compared to the same period in this decrease was attributable to lower libor interest rates  lower margins over libor reflecting the terms of our amended and restated credit agreement entered into in april and improved financial performance under our debt covenants since that time  as well as  the absence of interest of  on our subordinated debentures  which we retired in december  and decreased average outstanding bank borrowings 
interest expense for the year ended december  was million  an increase of  compared to the same period in this increase resulted primarily from the absence of interest capitalization in compared to interest capitalization of  in in connection with the new paper machine 
including the capitalized interest in  total interest costs in the period decreased  or  compared with the same period of lower libor interest rates during and reduced margins over libor following the april refinancing all contributed to the lower interest costs 
partly offsetting these factors was a increase in average bank borrowings in the period reflecting the drawdown of the construction loan during the first half of other income was  in the year ended december   compared to  in the same period of the decrease reflects the absence of interest income in the period as a result of eliminating the restricted certificate of deposit after the bank refinancing in april other income was  in the year ended december   compared to  in the same period of the decrease reflects the absence of a  net currency transaction gain recorded in and lower interest income as a result of eliminating the restricted certificate of deposit after the bank debt refinancing in april  which was used to pay down amounts outstanding under the revolving credit agreement 
income before income taxes as a result of the foregoing factors  income before income taxes increased million to million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  for the year ended december   income before income taxes increased million to million compared to  for the year ended december  income tax provision benefit for the year ended december   income tax expense amounted to million resulting in an effective tax rate of 
contributing to the reduced tax burden for year was the oklahoma investment tax credits oitc associated with our investment in our new paper machine 
the federal indian employment credit iec  which was extended in october through december   also contributed to the reduced tax burden 
we continue to have net operating loss nol carryforwards for federal and oklahoma taxes and expect the federal nol carryforward to be fully exhausted in for the year ended december   income tax expense amounted to  resulting in an effective tax rate of 
the largest contributor to the reduced tax burden was oitc associated with our investment in our new paper machine 
the iec also contributed to the reduced tax burden 
also benefiting the tax provision was the recognition of tax benefits associated with management and directors stock options not qualifying as incentive stock options under the internal revenue code 
in accordance with sfas r  we have established a deferred tax asset to account for the future deductibility of the value of these grants upon exercise by the holder 

table of contents for the year ended december   the income tax benefit amounted to  resulting in an effective tax rate of a negative 
the current tax benefit of million primarily resulted from the carryback of nol for tax purposes to tax years and the deferred provision of  was the result of substantial tax depreciation in excess of financial depreciation  partially offset by the recognition of investment  employment and other tax carryforwards for financial reporting purposes 
the law extending the iec also reinstated accelerated depreciation deductions  the most important of which was a four year tax life on investments in machinery and equipment placed in service on former indian lands in oklahoma 
accelerated depreciation will continue to benefit our current tax position for the next few years  as will the oitc  which is earned ratably over five years 
liquidity and capital resources overview liquidity refers to the liquid financial assets available to fund our business operations and pay for near term obligations 
these liquid financial assets consist of cash 
our cash requirements have historically been satisfied through a combination of cash flows from operations and debt financings 
our strategy to eliminate the need to purchase paper from third party suppliers through the purchase of a new paper machine was funded through the net proceeds of our initial public offering  additional bank financing and cash flows from operations 
the total cost of the paper machine project was million  exclusive of capitalized interest 
on july   we completed our initial public offering of  shares of common stock  which included the exercise in full of the underwriter s option to purchase  shares of common stock to cover overallotments 
the shares were registered on form s file number  which the sec declared effective on july  the public offering price of the shares was 
following the offering   shares of common stock  par value 
per share  were outstanding 
in july  we effected a for stock split increasing the shares of common stock outstanding to  shares outstanding 
net proceeds from the offering were million with gross proceeds totaling million and with costs related to offering totaling million as follows underwriting discount of or million charged against additional paid in capital  and direct expenses of  charged against additional paid in capital  including legal fees  printing costs  accounting fees  qualified independent underwriter fees and other miscellaneous direct expenses 
as of december   all but  of the net proceeds had been used to fund expenditures for our new paper machine project 
the remaining funds were invested in short term investment grade  interest bearing instruments 
in january  we expended the remaining  on the paper machine project and we began to draw on the construction loan facility at that time 
we estimate nol carryforwards of million federal and million state which are available to offset future taxable income 
in addition  we plan to claim million in oitc carryforward as of december   which is available to offset future oklahoma income tax liability 
the oitc carryforward is expected to grow over the next three years as it is earned ratably over five years at two percent per year on qualified investments 
we expect to claim  in oitc in each of the next three years related to the new paper machine 
the combination of accelerated depreciation deductions and the oitc will likely eliminate all oklahoma income tax liability for the next few years 
cash increased slightly to  at december  compared to  at december  we were able to generate sufficient cash during to fund million in capital expenditures  including a million converting automation project 
cash was level at  from december  to december  we generated sufficient cash during the first three quarters of to pay off all amounts outstanding under our revolving credit agreement 
we used a cash build up in the 
table of contents fourth quarter and borrowings under our revolving credit line to retire all of our outstanding subordinated debentures in december totaling million 
cash decreased by  during to  at december  the decrease was attributable to the application of remaining funds from the public offering to the paper machine project 
our annual maintenance capital expenditures are estimated to be million 
in  per the terms of our waste water pre treatment agreement with the oowa  our bod and tss limits are reduced 
as a result we are required to expand our waste water pre treatment facility at an estimated cost of million 
funding for the pre treatment expansion is contemplated in the current debt facility in an amount up to million 
we currently are reviewing our logistics operations and our strategy of employing a third party warehouse 
the results of this study may indicate a need to expand our current warehouse facility and eliminate the use of the third party warehouse 
the cost of expanding our warehouse is estimated at million 
funding for this project would come from either cash earnings  a new borrowing agreement or a combination of both 
we are also studying a project to purchase a new converting line to aid in our strategy to increase sales and profitability and to consume all of our paper making production in our converting operation 
this project is in the early stages of evaluation and is expected to cost between million and million 
the following table summarizes key cash flow information for the years ended december   and years ended december  in thousands cash flow provided by used in operating activities investing activities financing activities cash flows from operating activities increased  to million in an increase in cash earnings of approximately million was mostly offset by working capital changes in  particularly  increased accounts receivable and inventory levels of approximately million and the absence of the realization in of million in carryback claims for federal taxes paid in and accounts receivable increased due to increased sales levels 
inventory increased due to higher levels of parent roll inventory and overall increased sales levels 
cash flows used in investing activities increased million in  primarily due to increased expenditures on capital projects of million 
of the total expenditures in  million was related to the previously announced million project to automate certain operations in our converting plant 
this project was completed in february and the remaining  of expenditures will be incurred in the first quarter of cash flows used in financing was million in  primarily attributable to million in normally scheduled principal payments on our bank term loans which was partially offset by an approximate  increase in our revolving credit facility 
cash flow from operating activities in the year ended december  increased by million  to million  more than three times the amount reported for stronger earnings before non cash charges for depreciation  deferred taxes and stock option expense was the primary reason for the increase 
the realization of million in carryback claims for federal taxes paid in and also contributed to the increased cash flow 
an increase in the level of business activity resulted in higher accounts payable and accrued liabilities  partially offset by increases in inventory and accounts receivable 

table of contents cash flow used in investing activities in the year ended december  of  was for capital expenditures  mainly of maintenance projects 
offsetting these outflows was the release of the million restricted certificate of deposit in connection with the april refinancing of our bank debt 
cash flows used in financing activities in the year ended december  was million  primarily attributable to a million reduction in amounts outstanding under our revolving credit facility  million in normally scheduled principal payments on our bank term loans and the retirement of all of our subordinated debentures at a cost of million 
our april refinancing of our debt facility resulted in a net increase in funds of cash provided by operations totaled million during the year ended december  an increase in income taxes receivable in was mainly attributable to accelerated depreciation on the new paper machine 
the recently extended tax benefits for property placed in service on former indian lands added to the net operating loss for tax purposes 
this increase was largely offset by the absence of the inventory increase incurred during accounts receivable increased during the year ended december   reflecting higher sales volumes 
accounts payable increased during the year ended december   reflecting higher levels of purchasing 
cash used in investing activities during the year ended december   was million  mostly related to the new paper machine project 
capital expenditures for the new machine amounted to million in  inclusive of capitalized interest of  the start up date for the project was june  cash provided from financing activities amounted to million during the year ended december   mainly attributable to borrowings under a construction loan agreement with established bank creditors 
cash provided from financing activities decreased million during due to the absence of the proceeds from the initial public offering and reduced borrowings under the revolving credit line 
principal payments on the bank debt remained level at million in each period 
on april   we re financed our existing credit facility with the existing bank group 
the facility was amended on march  and november  following the amendments  the credit facility consists of the following at december  a million revolving credit facility with a year term  million outstanding at december   including million of bank overdrafts  a million term loan a with a ten year term  no principal repayments for the first months and then amortized as if it had an year life million outstanding at december   a million term loan b with a four year term and is being amortized as if it had a six year life million outstanding at december   and a million capital expenditures facility with a four year term that will be amortized as if it had a five year life outstanding at december  
under the terms of the amended agreement  amounts outstanding under the revolving credit facility bear interest at our election at the prime rate or libor plus a margin and amounts outstanding under term loan b and the capital expenditures facility will bear interest at libor plus a margin  which is set quarterly and based on the ratio of funded debt to ebitda less income taxes paid 
the all in interest rate  libor rate plus rate margin  for the capital expenditures facility bears a minimum rate of 
amounts outstanding under term loan a will bear interest at libor plus basis points 
for the revolving credit facility  the margin ranges from a negative basis points to basis points for prime rate loans and to basis points for libor based loans 
for term loan b  
table of contents the margin ranges from basis points to basis points over libor 
for the capital expenditures facility  the margin ranges from basis points to basis points over libor 
the credit agreement contains covenants that  among other things  require us to maintain a specific funded debt to ebitda ratio  debt service coverage ratio and an annual limit on un financed capital expenditures 
the amount available under the revolving credit line may be reduced in the event that our borrowing base  which is based upon our qualified receivables and qualified inventory  is less than million 
obligations under the amended and restated credit agreement are secured by substantially all of our assets 
the agreement contains representations and warranties  and affirmative and negative covenants customary for financings of this type  including  but not limited to  a covenant prohibiting us from declaring or paying dividends 
the financial covenants in the agreement require us to maintain specific ratios of funded debt to ebitda and debt service coverage which are tested as of the end of each quarter and places a limit on the amount of annual non financed capital expenditures 
the maximum allowable funded debt to ebitda ratio is to and the minimum allowable debt service coverage ratio is to following the november  amendment  our annual expenditures for non financed capital equipment are limited to million for the fiscal year and million per fiscal year thereafter  increasing to million if we achieve an ebitda threshold for two consecutive quarters  beginning with the third quarter of we reached that threshold as of december  the annual capital expenditures limit excludes up to million of expenditures on the waste water treatment project 
the increased capital expenditures limit in was used to complete the previously discussed automation project in our converting facility 
the capital expenditures facility is intended to fund an expansion of our waste water pre treatment 
a new water discharge permit was issued effective august  which requires us to reduce our bod and tss from our effluent stream 
as a result  we need to expand our waste water pre treatment facility at an estimated cost of million 
under the new permit  we are required to meet the stricter limits by august  the project is in the construction phase 
if an event of default occurs  the agent may declare the banks obligation to make loans terminated and all outstanding indebtedness  and all other amounts payable under the credit agreement  due and payable 
contractual obligations as of december   our contractual cash obligations were limited to our long term debt and associated interest 
we do not have any leasing commitments or debt guarantees outstanding as of december  we do not have any defined benefit pension plans or any obligation to fund any postretirement benefit obligations for our work force 

table of contents maturities of these contractual obligations consist of the following payments due by period years contractual cash obligations total and and after thousands long term debt interest payments natural gas contract committed capital projects total under our revolving credit and term loan agreements  the maturity of outstanding debt could be accelerated if we do not maintain certain financial covenants 
at december   we were in compliance with our loan covenants 
these amounts assume interest payments at the year end borrowing amount and rate for our revolving credit facility 
the amount borrowed in future years is dependent on our free cash flow from time to time 
interest payments on the term loans have been calculated based on the interest rate in effect as of december  in october  we entered into a contract to purchase  mmbtu of natural gas requirements at per mmbtu plus a per mmbtu management delivery fee for the period from april through march the amounts represent approximately of our natural gas requirements based on our expected usage rates for if we are unable to purchase the contracted amounts and the market price at that time is less than the contracted price  we would be obligated under the terms of our agreement to reimburse an amount equal to the volume purchased that was less than the contracted amount multiplied by the difference between our contract price and current spot price 
amounts committed to but not yet paid on the converting automation project  and the expansion of the existing pre treatment facility million as of december  critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of our financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect our reported amounts of assets and liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates and assumptions based upon historical experience and various other factors and circumstances 
management believes that our estimates and assumptions are reasonable under the circumstances  however  actual results may vary from these estimates and assumptions under different future circumstances 
we have identified the following critical accounting policies that affect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements accounts receivable 
accounts receivable consist of amounts due to us from normal business activities 
our management must make estimates of accounts receivable that will not be collected 
we perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers and adjust credit limits based upon payment history and the customer s creditworthiness as determined by our review of their current credit information 
we continuously monitor collections and payments from our customers and maintain a provision for estimated losses based on historical experience and specific customer collection issues that 
table of contents we have identified 
trade receivables are written off when all reasonable collection efforts have been exhausted  including  but not limited to  external third party collection efforts and litigation 
while such credit losses have historically been within management s expectations and the provisions established  there can be no assurance that we will continue to experience the same credit loss rates as in the past 
accounts receivable balances that have been written off  net of recoveries  in the years ended december    and were   and  respectively 
inventory 
our inventory consists of converted finished goods  bulk paper rolls and raw materials and is based on standard cost  specific identification  or fifo first in  first out 
standard costs approximate actual costs on a first in  first out basis 
material  labor and factory overhead necessary to produce the inventories are included in the standard cost 
our management regularly reviews inventory quantities on hand and records a provision for excess and obsolete inventory based on the age of the inventory and forecasts of product demand 
a significant decrease in demand could result in an increase in the amount of excess inventory quantities on hand 
during the years ended december  and  we increased the inventory valuation reserve by  and  respectively 
the increase in the reserve in was due to the extensive changes in product content during the year and its resultant effect on the usability of raw materials 
new accounting pronouncements in december  the fasb revised sfas no 
business combinations to clarify certain issues regarding business combinations 
the major impact for us would be the requirement to write off certain costs of completing an acquisition as incurred 
the standard is effective for periods beginning after december  also  in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
non controlling interests in consolidated financial statements 
at present this standard would not apply to us as it has no related entities which qualify for consolidation 
the standard is effective for minority interest accounting for periods beginning after december  on march   the fasb issued sfas no

we have no transactions subject to the accounting or disclosure requirements of fas on december   the fasb issued staff position fsp no 
fas r  employers disclosures about postretirement benefit plan assets 
we do not currently have pension plans or other postretirement benefits  therefore  we are not subject to this statement 
non gaap discussion in addition to our generally accepted accounting principles gaap results  we also consider non gaap measures of our performance for a number of purposes 
we use earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation  and amortization ebitda as a supplemental measure of our performance that is not required by  or presented in accordance with  gaap 
ebitda is not a measurement of our financial performance under gaap and should not be considered as an alternative to net income  operating income or any other performance measure derived in accordance with gaap  or as an alternative to cash flow from operating activities or a measure of our liquidity 
ebitda represents net income before net interest expense  income tax expense  depreciation and amortization 

table of contents we believe ebitda facilitates operating performance comparisons from period to period and company to company by backing out potential differences caused by variations in capital structures affecting relative interest expense  tax positions such as the impact on periods or companies of changes in effective tax rates or net operating losses and the age and book depreciation of facilities and equipment affecting relative depreciation expense 
ebitda has limitations as an analytical tool  and you should not consider it in isolation  or as a substitute for analysis of our results as reported under gaap 
some of these limitations are it does not reflect our cash expenditures for capital expenditures  it does not reflect changes in  or cash requirements for  our working capital requirements  it does not reflect the interest expense  or the cash requirements necessary to service interest or principal payments on our indebtedness  although depreciation and amortization are non cash charges  the assets being depreciated and amortized will often have to be replaced in the future  and ebitda does not reflect cash requirements for such replacements  other companies  including other companies in our industry  may calculate these measures differently than we do  limiting their usefulness as a comparative measure  and it does not reflect tax obligations whether current or deferred 
because of these limitations  ebitda should not be considered as a measure of discretionary cash available to us to invest in the growth of our business or to reduce our indebtedness 
we compensate for these limitations by relying primarily on our gaap results and using ebitda only supplementally 
the following table reconciles ebitda to net income for the years ended december   and  years ended december  in thousands  except of net sales net income plus interest expense  net plus income tax benefit expense plus depreciation ebitda of net sales ebitda increased million to million for the year ended december   compared to million in the same period in ebitda as a percent of net sales increased from in to in the foregoing factors discussed in the net sales  cost of sales and selling  general and administrative expenses sections are the reasons for the change

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk our market risks relate primarily to changes in interest rates 
our revolving line of credit and our term loans carry a variable interest rate that is tied to market indices and  therefore  our statement of income and our cash flows will be exposed to changes in interest rates 
as of december   we had floating rate borrowings of million  excluding bank overdrafts  which are classified with bank debt in the balance sheet  but which bear no interest 
outstanding balances under our line of credit and term loans bear interest at the prime rate or libor  plus a margin based upon the debt service coverage ratio 
we considered the historical volatility of short term interest rates and determined that it would be reasonably possible that an adverse change of basis points could be experienced in the near term 
based on the current borrowing  a basis point increase in interest rates would result in a pre tax  increase to our annual interest expense 
commodity price risk we are subject to commodity price risk  the most significant of which relates to the price of waste paper 
selling prices of tissue products are influenced by the market price of waste paper  which is determined by industry supply and demand 
the effect of a waste paper price increase of per ton would be approximately  per year 
as previously discussed under item a  risk factors  increases in waste paper prices could adversely affect earnings if selling prices are not adjusted or if such adjustments trail the increase in pulp prices 
natural gas price risk we are exposed to market risks for change in natural gas commodity pricing 
we will partially mitigate this risk through our natural gas firm price contract starting in april and continuing through march  for of our natural gas requirements for our manufacturing facilities 
the effect of a mmbtu increase on the not under firm price contract would be approximately  a year
