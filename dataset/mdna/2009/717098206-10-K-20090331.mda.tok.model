through our ecost 
com business unit  we are also a leading multi category online discount retailer of new  close out and recertified brand name merchandise 
we derive our revenues from three business segments ecommerce and business process outsourcing  a master distributor and an online discount retailer 
first  in our ecommerce and business process outsourcing business segment  we derive our revenues from a broad range of services  including professional consulting  technology collaboration  order management  managed web hosting and web development  the deployment of an ecommerce technology platform  customer relationship management  financial services including billing and collection services and working capital solutions  kitting and assembly services  information management and international fulfillment and distribution services 
we offer our services as an integrated solution  which enables our clients to outsource their complete infrastructure needs to a single source and to focus on their core competencies 
our distribution services are conducted at warehouses that we lease or manage and include real time inventory management and customized picking  packing and shipping of our clients customer orders 
we currently offer the ability to provide infrastructure and distribution solutions to clients that operate in a range of vertical markets  including technology manufacturing  computer products  cosmetics  fragile goods  contemporary home furnishings  apparel  aviation  telecommunications and consumer electronics  among others 
in this ecommerce and business process outsourcing segment  we do not own the underlying inventory or the resulting accounts receivable  but provide management services for these client owned assets 
we typically charge our service fee revenue on a cost plus basis  a percent of shipped revenue basis or a per transaction basis  such as a per minute basis for web enabled customer contact center services and a per item basis for fulfillment services 
additional fees are billed for other services 
we price our services based on a variety of factors  including the depth and complexity of the services provided  the amount of capital expenditures or systems customization required  the length of contract and other factors 
many of our service fee contracts involve third party vendors who provide additional services such as package delivery 
the costs we are charged by these third party vendors for these services are often passed on to our clients 
our billings for reimbursements of these costs and other out of pocket expenses include travel  shipping and handling costs and telecommunication charges and are included in pass through revenue 
our second business segment is a product revenue model 
in this segment  we are a master distributor of product for ips and certain other clients 
in this capacity  we purchase  and thus own  inventory and recognize the corresponding product revenue 
as a result  upon the sale of inventory  we own the accounts receivable 
freight costs billed to customers are reflected as components of product revenue 
this business segment requires significant working capital requirements  for which we have senior credit facilities to provide for approximately million of available financing 

table of contents our third business segment is a web commerce product revenue model focused on the sale of products to a broad range of consumer and small business customers 
in this segment we operate as a multi category online discount retailer of new  close out and recertified brand name merchandise 
our product line currently offers approximately  products in several primary merchandise categories  primarily including computers  networking  electronics and entertainment  tv s  plasmas and monitors  cameras and camcorders  memory and storage  for the home and sports and leisure 
growth is a key element to achieving our future goals  including achieving and maintaining sustainable profitability 
growth in our ecommerce and business process outsourcing segment is driven by two main elements new client relationships and organic growth from existing clients 
we focus our sales efforts on larger contracts with brand name companies within two primary target markets  online brands and retailers and technology manufacturers  which  by nature  require a longer duration to close but also have the potential to be higher quality and longer duration engagements 
growth within our product revenue business is primarily driven by our ability to attract new master distributor arrangements with ips or other manufacturers and the sales and marketing efforts of the manufacturers and third party sales partners 
growth within our web commerce product revenue model is primarily driven by ecost s ability to increase sales by generating organic growth  new customers and expanding its product line 
we continue to monitor and control our costs to focus on profitability 
while we are targeting our new service fee contracts to yield increased gross profit  we also expect to incur incremental investments to implement new contracts  investments in infrastructure and sales and marketing to support our targeted growth and increased public company professional fees 
our expenses comprise primarily four categories cost of product revenue  cost of service fee revenue  cost of pass through revenue and operating expenses 
cost of product revenue consists of the purchase price of product sold and freight costs  which are reduced by certain reimbursable expenses 
these reimbursable expenses include pass through customer marketing programs  direct costs incurred in passing on any price decreases offered by vendors to cover price protection and certain special bids  the cost of products provided to replace defective product returned by customers and certain other expenses as defined under the master distributor agreements 
vendor marketing programs  such as co op advertising  also reduce cost of product revenue 
cost of service fee revenue consists primarily of compensation and related expenses for our web enabled customer contact center services  international fulfillment and distribution services and professional consulting services  and other fixed and variable expenses directly related to providing services under the terms of fee based contracts  including certain occupancy and information technology costs and depreciation and amortization expenses 
cost of pass through revenue the related reimbursable costs for pass through expenditures are reflected as cost of pass through revenue 
operating expenses consist primarily of selling  general and administrative sg a expenses such as compensation and related expenses for sales and marketing staff  advertising  online marketing and catalog production  distribution costs excluding freight applicable to the supplies distributors and ecost businesses  executive  management and administrative personnel and other overhead costs  including certain occupancy and information technology costs and depreciation and amortization expenses 
monitoring and controlling our available cash balances continues to be a primary focus 
our cash and liquidity positions are important components of our financing of both current operations and our targeted growth 
in recent years we have added to our available cash and liquidity positions through various transactions 

table of contents each of our primary operating subsidiaries has one or more asset based working capital financing agreements with various lenders 
in and  we raised approximately million in net proceeds from the sale of approximately million shares of common stock in private placements to certain investors 
historical financial presentation as a result of our acquisition of ecost

product revenue  net 
ecost product revenue was million in  a decrease as compared to million in the prior year 
the decrease is primarily due to a decline in sales to its business to business bb channel during the period partially offset by an increase in its higher margin business to consumer bc sales channel 
the bc sales channel increase is primarily due to continued emphasis on growth through an expanded product line  improved service capabilities and enhanced website capabilities 

table of contents supplies distributors product revenue of million decreased million  or in as compared to the prior year 
this decrease is primarily due to decreased sales volume on certain products partially offset by the impact of foreign exchange rates 
we currently expect our annual product revenue to decline from due to ecost s continued shift in focus from the bb channel to the bc channel as well as the impact of the current economic environment on both the ecost and supplies distributor s segments 
service fee revenue 
the increase in service fee revenue for the years ended december  and reflects the favorable impact from new clients that were added in calendar year and  benefits from incremental project work and a modified contract with an existing client 
the change in service fee revenue  excluding pass through revenue  is shown below millions year ended december  new service contract relationships  including certain incremental projects under new contracts change in existing client service fees and certain incremental projects with existing clients terminated clients not included in revenue year ended december  based on historical activity and current projection of existing clients  including new clients signed in and  and the non renewal of a certain us government agency client and certain other clients  we currently anticipate that service fee revenue will decline from service fee revenue levels 
cost of product revenue 
the gross margin for ecost was million or of product revenue in and million or of product revenue during gross margin for ecost increased from the prior year primarily due to a shift in product sales to the higher margin bc sales channel 
supplies distributors cost of product revenue decreased by million  or  to million in  primarily as a result of reduced product sales 
the resulting gross profit margin was million or of product revenue for the year ended december  and million or of product revenue for the gross profit margin for the and periods include certain incremental inventory cost reductions 
cost of service fee revenue 
the increase in gross profit as a percentage of service fees to in from in is primarily due to the impact of certain existing client projects and the impact of a modified contract with an existing client 
we expect to earn an overall gross profit of on existing and new service fee contracts  but we have and may continue to accept lower gross margin percentages on certain contracts depending on contract scope and other factors 
operating expenses 
operating expenses increased by million compared to operating expenses were million  or of total net revenues in the period and million  or of total net revenues in the prior year 
operating expenses in include a goodwill and intangible asset impairment charge of million resulting from our annual analysis required under accounting standards see discussion below 
excluding the impact of the million impairment charge for goodwill and intangible assets  operating expenses were of total net revenues in the period 
the remaining increase in operating expenses is primarily due to increased facility and personnel related expenses and the prior year results benefitting from the favorable impact of exchange rates on certain intercompany accounts 
in  we intend to implement certain cost reductions to decrease operating expenses for certain of our facilities to correspond to our anticipated decline in revenue 
impairment charge for goodwill and identifiable intangible assets 
as a result of the decline in our common stock price  our market capitalization plus an implied control premium fell significantly below the recorded value of our consolidated net assets as of december  in performing our annual impairment test  we used current market capitalization  control premiums  discounted cash flows and other factors as the best evidence of fair value 

table of contents the impairment test resulted in a reduction in value attributable to our goodwill and accordingly  we recorded an million impairment charge against goodwill during in connection with the goodwill impairment test  we determined that certain of our identifiable intangible assets were impaired 
the determination was based on the carrying values exceeding the future undiscounted cash flows and fair value attributable to such intangible assets 
as a result  we recorded an impairment charge of million during  which represents the difference between the estimated fair values of these long lived assets and their carrying values 
fair values were determined based upon market conditions  the relief from royalty approach which utilized cash flow projections  and other factors 
income taxes 
we recorded a tax provision associated primarily with state income taxes and our subsidiary supplies distributors canadian and european operations 
a valuation allowance has been provided for the majority of our net deferred tax assets as of december  and december   which are primarily related to our net operating loss carryforwards and certain foreign deferred tax assets

fiscal includes a full year of ecost activity as compared to eleven months in following the acquisition of ecost in february supplies distributors product revenue of million decreased million  or in as compared to the prior year 
this decrease was primarily due to the decreased sales volume of certain products as a result of improvement in the products useful lives  which slowed consumer s demand for replenishment  the impact of foreign currency fluctuations which created alternative purchasing channels for certain customers  and incremental vendor promotion activity in  which did not occur in service fee revenue

cost of service fee revenue 
the increase in gross profit as a percentage of service fees to in from in was primarily due to improved cost controls and productivity on certain clients and additional higher margin client project activity compared to operating expenses 
operating expenses for the year ended december  include a full year of activity for ecost as compared to only eleven months of activity in the year ended december  following the acquisition of ecost in february ecost s operating expenses declined during by million as compared to the prior year primarily due to the realization of savings through the reduction of certain advertising and overhead expenses  reduced merger and integration related expenses  changes in corporate infrastructure expenses and operating efficiencies attained as a result of the ecost integration 
operating expenses in also include a goodwill impairment charge of million resulting from the annual analysis pursuant to statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
under this analysis  we determined that the carrying value of goodwill exceeded the fair value  which resulted in a million non cash write off of goodwill 

table of contents excluding ecost  operating expenses were million  or of total net revenues in the period and million  or of total net revenues in the comparable prior year period 
the increase in operating expenses was primarily due to increased facility and personnel related expenses partially offset by the favorable impact of exchange rates on intercompany accounts during the period 
income taxes 
we recorded a tax provision associated primarily with state income taxes and our subsidiary supplies distributors canadian and european operations 
a valuation allowance was provided for the majority of our net deferred tax assets as of december   which are primarily related to our net operating loss carryforwards and certain foreign deferred tax assets 
supplies distributors and its subsidiaries supplies distributors and its subsidiaries act as master distributors of various ips and other products and  pursuant to a transaction management services agreement between us and supplies distributors  we provide transaction management and fulfillment services to supplies distributors and its subsidiaries 
in addition to our equity investment in supplies distributors  we have also provided supplies distributors with a subordinated loan that  as of december   had an outstanding balance of million 
supplies distributors has paid us dividends of million  million and million in  and  respectively 
supplies distributors has received lender approval to pay us dividends of approximately million in  and to reduce its subordinated debt to us by million  but pursuant to the terms of its amended credit agreements  is restricted from paying further cash dividends without the prior approval of its lenders

ecost and its subsidiaries ecost is a multi category online discount retailer of new  close out and recertified brand name merchandise  selling products primarily to customers in the united states 
as of december   we have advanced million to ecost to support its operations 
liquidity and capital resources net cash provided by operating activities was million for the year ended december  and primarily resulted from cash income before working capital changes of million  an increase in accounts payable  accrued expenses and other liabilities of million  a decrease in accounts receivable of million and a decrease in restricted cash of million  partially offset by an increase in prepaid expenses  other receivables and other assets of million and an increase in inventories of million

net cash used in investing activities for the years ended december  and totaled million and million  respectively  primarily resulting from capital expenditures 
capital expenditures have historically consisted primarily of additions to upgrade our management information systems and general expansion of our facilities  both domestic and foreign 
we expect to incur capital expenditures to support new contracts and anticipated future growth opportunities 
based on our current client business activity and our targeted growth plans  we anticipate our total investment in upgrades and additions to facilities and information technology services for the upcoming twelve months will be approximately million to million  although additional capital expenditures may be necessary to support the infrastructure requirements of new clients 

table of contents to maintain our current operating cash position  a portion of these expenditures may be financed through debt  operating or capital leases or additional equity 
we may elect to modify or defer a portion of such anticipated investments in the event that we do not achieve the revenue necessary to support such investments 
net cash used in financing activities was approximately million for the year ended december   primarily representing payments on capital leases 
net cash used in financing activities was approximately million for the year ended december   primarily representing million of payments on capital leases and million of payments on debt partially offset by a decrease in restricted cash of million 
our liquidity has been negatively impacted as a result of the merger with ecost 
since the merger  ecost has experienced a net use of cash primarily due to operating losses 
as a result  we have had to support ecost s cash needs with the goal of reducing operating losses 
the amount of further cash needed to support ecost operations will depend upon the financing available as well as ecost s ability to improve its financial results 
ecost s results  excluding the impact of any non cash impairment charges  improved in and and we currently expect continued improvement as a result of efforts to increase sales  improve product mix and further improve operational efficiencies 
our liquidity may also be negatively impacted by an expected decline in service fee revenue due to the current general economic decline as well as the nonrenewal of a large contract with an agency of the us government and certain other clients 
to help minimize the impact of lower service fee revenue we have implemented certain measures that reduced variable costs and expenses and redeployed existing infrastructure to other client activities 
no assurance can be given that a further decline in service fee revenue  beyond those noted above  will not have a material adverse effect upon our business  financial condition or results of operations 
in june  our board of directors authorized a for reverse split to reduce the number of outstanding shares of common stock 
there was no impact on the number of authorized shares or the stated par value of our common stock as a result of the reverse stock split 
all share and per share amounts for common stock  warrants and stock options have been restated to reflect the reverse split on a retro active basis 
during the year ended december   our working capital decreased to million from million at december  to obtain additional financing in the future  in addition to our current cash position  we plan to evaluate various financing alternatives including the sale of equity  utilizing capital or operating leases  borrowing under our credit facilities  expanding our current credit facilities  entering into new debt agreements or transferring to third parties a portion of our subordinated loan balance due from supplies distributors 
in conjunction with certain of these alternatives  we may be required to provide certain letters of credit to secure these arrangements 
no assurances can be given that we will be successful in obtaining any additional financing or the terms thereof 
we currently believe that our cash position  financing available under our credit facilities and funds generated from operations including targeted cost reductions related to the nonrenewal of our us government contract will satisfy our presently known operating cash needs  our working capital and capital expenditure requirements  our current debt and lease obligations  and additional loans to our subsidiaries supplies distributors and ecost  if necessary  for at least the next twelve months 
recently  the credit markets and the financial services industry have been experiencing a period of unprecedented turmoil and upheaval characterized by the bankruptcy  failure  collapse or sale of various financial institutions and an unprecedented level of intervention from the united states and foreign governments 
while the ultimate outcome of these events cannot be predicted  they may have a material adverse effect on our liquidity  financial condition  results of operations and our ability to renew our credit facilities 
the following is a schedule of our total contractual cash obligations  which is comprised of operating leases  debt  vendor financing and capital leases including interest  as of december  in millions 
table of contents payments due by period less than more than total year years years years contractual obligations debt and vendor financing capital lease obligations operating leases total in support of certain debt instruments and leases  as of december   we had million of cash restricted for repayment to lenders 
in addition  as described above  we have provided collateralized guarantees to secure the repayment of certain of our subsidiaries credit facilities 
many of these facilities include both financial and non financial covenants  and also include cross default provisions applicable to other credit facilities and agreements 
these covenants include minimum levels of net worth for the individual borrower subsidiaries and restrictions on the ability of the borrower subsidiaries to advance funds to other borrower subsidiaries 
as a result  it is possible for one or more of these borrower subsidiaries to fail to meet their respective covenants even if another borrower subsidiary otherwise has available excess funds which  if not restricted  could be used to cure the default 
to the extent we fail to comply with our debt covenants  including the monthly financial covenant requirements and our required level of shareholders equity  and the lenders accelerate the repayment of the credit facility obligations  we would be required to repay all amounts outstanding thereunder 
in particular  in the event ecost is unable to increase its revenue and or gross profit from its present levels it may fail to comply with one or more of the financial covenants required under its working capital line of credit 
in such event  absent a waiver  the working capital lender would be entitled to accelerate all amounts outstanding thereunder and exercise all other rights and remedies  including sale of collateral and payment under our parent guaranty 
a requirement to accelerate the repayment of the credit facility obligations would have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations 
we can provide no assurance that we will have the financial ability to repay all of such obligations

in the future  we may attempt to acquire other businesses or seek an equity or strategic partner to generate capital or expand our services or capabilities in connection with our efforts to grow our business 
acquisitions involve certain risks and uncertainties and may require additional financing

inventory management we manage our inventories held for sale by maintaining sufficient quantities of product to achieve high order fill rates while at the same time maximizing inventory turnover rates 
inventory balances will fluctuate as we add new product lines 
to reduce the risk of loss due to supplier price reductions  our master distributor agreement  as well as certain vendor agreements in our ecost business  provide for price protection under which we receive credits if the supplier lowers prices on previously purchased inventory 
seasonality the seasonality of our service fee business is dependent upon the seasonality of our clients business and sales of their products 
accordingly  our management must rely upon the projections of our clients in assessing quarterly variability 
we believe that with our current client mix and their current business volumes  our run rate service fee business activity will be at its lowest in the quarter ended march we anticipate that our supplies distributors product revenue will be highest during the quarter ended december our ecost business is moderately seasonal  reflecting the general pattern of peak sales for the retail industry during the holiday shopping season 
typically  a larger portion of our ecost revenues occur during the fourth fiscal quarter 
we believe that our historical revenue growth makes it difficult to predict the effect of seasonality on our future revenues and results of operations we believe that results of operations for a quarterly period may not be indicative of the results for any other quarter or for the full year 
inflation management believes that inflation has not had a material effect on our operations 
impact of recently issued accounting standards in september  the fasb issued sfas  fair value measurements sfas 
sfas defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosures about fair value measurements 
in february  the fasb issued fasb staff position fsp  effective date of fasb statement 
table of contents no 
 which delays the effective date of sfas for nonfinancial assets and nonfinancial liabilities  except those that are recognized or disclosed at fair value on a recurring basis  at least annually  until fiscal years beginning after november   and interim periods within those fiscal years 
sfas is effective for fiscal years beginning after november  and we adopted sfas for financial assets and liabilities on january   with no material impact to our consolidated financial statements 
we adopted fair value measurement treatment for nonfinancial assets and liabilities on january   which did not have a material impact 
in february  the fasb issued statement no 
 the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities 
this new standard allows companies to elect to measure specified financial instruments and warranty and insurance contracts at fair value on a contract by contract basis  with changes in fair value recognized in earnings in each reporting period 
the company did not elect the fair value option under this statement 
in december  the fasb issued statement no 
r  business combinations  and statement no 
 noncontrolling interests in consolidated financial statements  an amendment of arb no 
statement no 
r modified the accounting and disclosure requirements for business combinations and broadens the scope of the previous standard to apply to all transactions in which one entity obtains control over another business 
statement no 
establishes new accounting and reporting standards for noncontrolling interests in subsidiaries 
we will be required to apply the provisions of the new standards in the first quarter of the impact of this statement on our financial statements is expected to be immaterial 
in december  the sec issued staff accounting bulletin no 
sab 
sab permits companies to continue to use the simplified method  under certain circumstances  in estimating the expected term of plain vanilla options beyond december  sab updates guidance provide in sab that previously stated that the staff would not expect a company to use the simplified method for share option grants after december  we will continue to use the simplified method until we have sufficient historical exercise data to provide a reasonable basis upon which to estimate the expected term of its options 
in april  the fasb issued fsp no 
 determination of the useful life of intangible assets fsp no 

this guidance is intended to improve the consistency between the useful life of a recognized intangible asset under sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas no 
 and the period of expected cash flows used to measure the fair value of the asset under sfas no 
r when the underlying arrangement includes renewal or extension of terms that would require substantial costs or result in a material modification to the asset upon renewal or extension 
companies estimating the useful life of a recognized intangible asset must now consider their historical experience in renewing or extending similar arrangements or  in the absence of historical experience  must consider assumptions that market participants would use about renewal or extension as adjusted for sfas no 
s entity specific factors 
fsp no is effective beginning january  and will be applied prospectively to intangible assets acquired after the effective date 
we are currently assessing the impact this adoption will have on our consolidated financial statements 
critical accounting policies and estimates our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the us these accounting principles require us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of our financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
while we do not believe the reported amounts would be materially different  application of these policies involves the exercise of judgment and the use of assumptions as to future uncertainties and  as a result  actual results could differ from these estimates 
if there is a significant unfavorable change to current conditions  it would likely result in a material adverse impact to our business  operating results and financial condition 
we evaluate our estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis 
we base our estimates on experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
all of our significant accounting policies are disclosed in the notes to our consolidated financial statements 
we have defined a critical accounting estimate as one that is both important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and requires us to make difficult  subjective or complex judgments or estimates about matters that are uncertain 
during the past three fiscal years  we have not made any material changes in accounting methodology used to establish the critical accounting estimates discussed below 
the following represent certain critical accounting policies that require us to exercise our business judgment or make significant estimates 
in addition  there are other items within our consolidated financial statements that require estimation but are not deemed critical as defined above 

table of contents product revenue recognition we adhere to the revised guidelines and principles of sales recognition described in staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition 
under sab  sales are recognized when the title and risk of loss are passed to the customer  there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement for the sale  delivery has occurred and or services have been rendered  the sales price is fixed or determinable and collectability is reasonably assured 
under these guidelines  we recognize a majority of our sales  including revenue from product sales and gross outbound shipping and handling charges  upon receipt of the product by the customer 
for all product sales shipped directly from suppliers to customers  we are the primary obligor in the transaction  and we take title to the products sold upon shipment  bear credit risk  and bear inventory risk for returned products that are not successfully returned to suppliers  therefore  we recognize these revenues at gross sales amounts 
sales are reported net of estimated returns and allowances  credit card fraud and chargebacks  all of which are estimated based upon historical information such as return and redemption rates  and fraud and chargeback experience 
management also considers any other current information and trends in making estimates 
if actual sales returns  allowances  discounts and credit card fraud and chargebacks are greater than estimated by management  additional expense may be incurred 
cost of service fee revenue our service fee revenue primarily relates to our distribution services and order management customer care services 
distribution services relate primarily to inventory management  product receiving  warehousing and fulfillment ie  picking  packing and shipping 
order management customer care services relate primarily to taking customer orders for our clients products via various channels such as telephone call center  electronic or facsimile 
these services also entail addressing customer questions related to orders  as well as cross selling up selling activities 
our cost of service fee revenue represents the cost to provide the services described above  primarily compensation and related expenses and other fixed and variable expenses directly related to providing the services 
these include certain occupancy and information technology costs and depreciation and amortization expenses 
certain of these costs are allocated from general and administrative expenses 
for these allocations  we estimate the amount of direct expenses based on a client specific number of transactions processed 
we believe our allocation methodology is reasonable  however a change in assumptions would result in a different gross profit in our statement of operations  yet no change to the resulting net income or loss 
allowance for doubtful accounts the determination of the collectability of amounts due from our customers requires us to use estimates and make judgments regarding future events and trends  including monitoring our customers payment history and current credit worthiness to determine that collectability is reasonably assured  as well as consideration of the overall business climate in which our clients and customers operate 
inherently  these uncertainties require us to make frequent judgments and estimates regarding our clients and customers ability to pay amounts due us to determine the appropriate amount of valuation allowances required for doubtful accounts 
provisions for doubtful accounts are recorded when it becomes evident that the client or customer will not make the required payments at either contractual due dates or in the future 
with our master distributor and online discount retail businesses  we also maintain an allowance for uncollectible vendor receivables  which arise from inventory returns to vendors  vendor rebate and advertising programs  price protections and other promotions 
we determine the sufficiency of the vendor receivable allowance based upon various factors  including payment history 
amounts received from vendors may vary from amounts recorded because of potential non compliance with certain elements of vendor programs 
if our estimated allowances for uncollectible accounts or vendor receivables subsequently prove insufficient  additional allowance maybe required 
allowances for doubtful accounts totaled million and million at december  and  respectively 
we believe that our allowances for doubtful accounts are adequate to cover anticipated losses under current conditions  however  uncertainties regarding changes in the financial condition of our clients and customers  
table of contents either adverse or positive  could impact the amount and timing of any additional provisions for doubtful accounts that may be required 
inventory reserves inventories merchandise  held for resale  all of which are finished goods are stated at the lower of weighted average cost or market 
supplies distributors and its subsidiaries assume responsibility for slow moving inventory under certain master distributor agreements  subject to certain termination rights  but have the right to return product rendered obsolete by engineering changes  as defined 
ecost assumes responsibility for slow moving inventory but has limited rights to return product based on specific inventory agreements 
we review inventory for impairment on a periodic basis  but at a minimum  annually 
recoverability of the inventory on hand is measured by comparison of the carrying value of the inventory to the fair value of the inventory 
this requires us to record provisions and maintain reserves for excess or obsolete inventory 
to determine these reserve amounts  we regularly review inventory quantities on hand and compare them to estimates of future product demand and market conditions 
these estimates and forecasts inherently include uncertainties and require us to make judgments regarding potential outcomes 
at both december  and  our allowance for slow moving inventory was million 
we believe that our reserves are adequate to cover anticipated losses under current conditions 
significant or unanticipated changes to our estimates and forecasts  either adverse or positive  could impact the amount and timing of any additional provisions for excess or obsolete inventory that may be required 
income taxes the liability method is used for determining our income taxes  under which current and deferred tax liabilities and assets are recorded in accordance with enacted tax laws and rates 
under this method  the amounts of deferred tax liabilities and assets at the end of each period are determined using the tax rate expected to be in effect when taxes are actually paid or recovered 
valuation allowances are established to reduce deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
in determining the need for valuation allowances  we have considered and made judgments and estimates regarding estimated future taxable income 
these estimates and judgments include some degree of uncertainty and changes in these estimates and assumptions could require us to adjust the valuation allowances for our deferred tax assets 
the ultimate realization of our deferred tax assets depends on the generation of sufficient taxable income in the applicable taxing jurisdictions 
although we believe our estimates and judgments are reasonable  actual results may differ  which could be material 
as we operate in multiple countries  we are subject to the jurisdiction of multiple domestic and foreign tax authorities 
determination of taxable income in any jurisdiction requires the interpretation of the related tax laws and regulations and the use of estimates and assumptions regarding significant future events such as the amount  timing and character of deductions  permissible revenue recognition methods under the tax law and the sources and character of income and tax credits 
changes in tax laws  regulations  foreign currency exchange restrictions or our level of operations or profitability in each taxing jurisdiction could have an impact on the amount of income taxes that we provide during any given year 
long lived assets long lived assets include property  intangible assets  goodwill and certain other assets 
we make judgments and estimates in conjunction with the carrying value of these assets  including amounts to be capitalized  depreciation and amortization methods and useful lives 
additionally  we review long lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
we review goodwill for impairment at least annually 
we record impairment losses in the period in which we determine that the carrying amount is not recoverable 
recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to future net cash flows expected to be generated by the asset 
this may require us to make judgments regarding long term forecasts of our future revenues and costs related to the assets subject to review 
during the fourth quarter of and  we determined the carrying values of the goodwill and intangible assets resulting from our acquisition of ecost were impaired  which resulted in an million write off of goodwill and a million write off of intangible assets in and a million write off of goodwill in 
table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk we are exposed to various market risks including interest rates on our financial instruments and foreign exchange rates 
interest rate risk our interest rate risk relates to the outstanding balances on our inventory and working capital financing agreements  taxable revenue bonds  factoring agreement  and loan and security agreements for the financing of inventory  accounts receivable and certain other receivables and certain equipment  which amounted to million at december  a basis point movement in interest rates would result in approximately million annualized increase or decrease in interest expense based on the outstanding balance of these agreements at december  foreign exchange risk currently  our foreign currency exchange rate risk is primarily limited to the canadian dollar and the euro 
in the future  our foreign currency exchange risk may also include other currencies applicable to certain of our international operations 
we have and may continue  from time to time  to employ derivative financial instruments to manage our exposure to fluctuations in foreign currency rates 
to hedge our net investment and intercompany payable or receivable balances in foreign operations  we may enter into forward currency exchange contracts
