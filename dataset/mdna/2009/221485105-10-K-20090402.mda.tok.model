table of contents net interest expense net interest expense  which includes interest on capital leases and debt  net of interest earned on investments  was million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal the increase in net interest expense was primarily due to additional long term debt related to the virginia and california distribution center sale leaseback transactions  the california distribution center expansion  and higher seasonal borrowings under the company s revolving line of credit 
excluded from net interest expense was interest capitalized primarily related to distribution center projects totaling  and  for fiscal years and  respectively 
income taxes the company s effective income tax rate for fiscal was a benefit of  compared to a benefit of in fiscal the decrease in the company s effective income tax rate benefit was due to the establishment of a valuation allowance on its net deferred tax assets in fiscal for more information  see note to the company s consolidated financial statements 
liquidity and capital resources the company s cash and cash equivalents balance at the end of fiscal was million compared to million at the end of fiscal the company s primary uses for cash are to provide working capital for operations  to service our obligations to pay interest and principal on debt  and to fund capital expenditures 
historically  the company has financed its operations primarily from cash generated from operations and seasonal borrowings under a revolving credit facility 
the company believes that the combination of its cash and cash equivalents  cash generated from operations and available borrowings under its revolving credit facility will be sufficient to finance its working capital and other capital projects for the next twelve months 
including fiscal  the company has experienced net losses each annual period since fiscal as of january   the company had an accumulated deficit of million 
for fiscal and for each annual period since fiscal  the company had decreases in cash and cash equivalents 
there can be no assurance that the business will be profitable in the future or that additional losses and negative cash flows will not be incurred  which could have a material adverse affect on the company s financial condition 
the company believes that its existing cash balance  combined with cash flows from operations  borrowings under its revolving credit facility and minimal capital expenditure requirements  will be sufficient to enable it to meet planned expenditures under its turnaround plan through at least the next months 
the turnaround plan calls for  among other things  the closing of underperforming stores in fiscal  corporate and distribution center work force reductions that occurred in the fourth quarter of fiscal  delaying new store expansion  reductions in marketing and capital expenditures  and delaying new hires 
the company is dependent upon its revolving credit facility to fund operating losses and seasonal inventory purchases 
the company does not plan on paying off its revolving credit facility during fiscal access to the company s revolving credit facility is dependent upon meeting its debt covenant and not exceeding the borrowing limit of the revolving credit facility 
there can be no assurance that the company will achieve or sustain positive cash flows or profitability 
if the company is unable to maintain adequate liquidity  future operations will need to be scaled back or discontinued 
cash flows from operating activities net cash used in operating activities totaled million for fiscal versus net cash provided by operating activities of million in fiscal the decrease in net cash provided by operations was primarily due to a higher net loss in fiscal and a reduction in accounts payable 
this was partially offset by a reduction in inventory and other assets 
net cash provided by operating activities totaled million for fiscal versus net cash used in operating activities of million in fiscal the increase in net cash provided by operations was primarily due to an increase in accounts payable reflecting the effect of better terms with vendors and timing factors  the add back of a million non cash charge for a valuation allowance on the deferred tax assets  as well as less cash used for the payment of income taxes and a decrease in other assets 
this was partially offset by a higher net loss 

table of contents cash flows from investing activities net cash used in investing activities totaled million in fiscal  a decrease of million from fiscal largely due to decreased capital expenditures

the credit agreement allows for cash borrowings and letters of credit under a secured revolving credit facility of up to million 
the amount available for borrowing at any time is limited by a stated percentage of the aggregate amount of the liquidated value of eligible inventory and the face amount of eligible credit card receivables 
the credit agreement includes three options to increase the size of the revolving credit facility by up to million in the aggregate 
all borrowings and letters of credit under the credit agreement are collateralized by all assets presently owned and hereafter acquired by the company

table of contents availability  as defined in the credit agreement 
in addition  the company pays a commitment fee on the unused portion of the amount available for borrowing as described in the credit agreement 
the credit agreement includes limitations on the ability of the company to  among other things  incur debt  grant liens  make investments  enter into mergers and acquisitions  pay dividends  repurchase its outstanding common stock  change its business  enter into transactions with affiliates  and dispose of assets including closing stores 
the events of default under the credit agreement include  among others  payment defaults  cross defaults with certain other indebtedness  breaches of covenants  loss of collateral  judgments  changes in control  and bankruptcy events 
in the event of a default  the credit agreement requires the company to pay incremental interest at the rate of and the lenders may  among other remedies  foreclose on the security which could include the sale of the company s inventory  eliminate their commitments to make credit available  declare due all unpaid principal amounts outstanding  and require cash collateral for any letter of credit obligations 
in addition  in the event of a default or if the company s average excess availability is or less of the borrowing capacity under the revolving credit facility  the company will be subject to additional restrictions  including specific restrictions with respect to its cash management procedures 
the company intends to use the proceeds from the credit agreement for working capital  issuance of commercial and standby letters of credit  capital expenditures  and other general corporate purposes 
as of january   the company was in compliance with its loan covenant requirements  had million in borrowings and million in outstanding letters of credit  and had credit available under the credit agreement of million 
the company s business is highly seasonal  reflecting the general pattern associated with the retail industry of peak sales and earnings during the fourth quarter holiday season  therefore borrowings under the line of credit often peak during the beginning of the fourth quarter 
contractual obligations and commercial commitments the following table provides summary information concerning the company s future contractual obligations and commercial commitments as of january  contractual obligations in millions less than year years years after years total amount committed operating leases capital leases principal and interest long term debt distribution center obligations merchandise letters of credit loan outstanding standby letters of credit purchase obligations severance payments interest total this table excludes million of liabilities for uncertain tax positions under fin  as we are not able to reasonably estimate when cash payments for these liabilities will occur 
this amount  however  has been recorded as a liability in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet as of january  as of january   the company had approximately million of outstanding purchase orders  which were primarily related to merchandise inventory 
such purchase orders are generally cancelable at the discretion of the company until the order has been shipped

table of contents off balance sheet arrangements other than the operating leases and letters of credit discussed above  the company has no financial arrangements involving special purpose entities or lease agreements  commonly described as synthetic leases  or any off balance sheet arrangements that have a material current effect  or that are reasonably likely to have a material future effect  on the company s financial condition  revenues or expenses  results of operations  liquidity  capital expenditures or capital resources 
impact of new accounting standards on february   the company adopted statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 fair value measurements 
sfas no 
clarifies the definition of fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value in generally accepted accounting principles  and expands disclosures about fair value measurements 
this statement does not require any new fair value measurements 
the adoption of sfas no 
for financial assets and liabilities did not have a significant impact on the company s consolidated financial statements 
additionally  in february  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued fasb staff position fsp no 
fas  or fsp no 
 effective date of fasb statement no 
 to partially defer fasb statement no 
 fair value measurements 
fsp no 
defers the effective date of fas for non financial assets and non financial liabilities  except those that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis at least annually  to fiscal years and interim periods within those fiscal years  beginning after november  the company does not expect the adoption of fsp to have a material impact on the company s consolidated financial statements 
inflation the company does not believe that inflation has had a material effect on its financial condition and results of operations during the past three fiscal years 
however  there can be no assurance that the company s business will not be affected by inflation in the future 
quarterly results and seasonality the following tables set forth the company s unaudited quarterly operating results for the eight most recent quarterly periods fiscal quarters ended in thousands  except per share data and number of stores may  august  november  january  net sales gross profit net loss from continuing operations net loss from discontinued operations net loss net loss per weighted average share from continuing operations basic diluted net loss per weighted average share from discontinued operations basic diluted net loss per weighted average share basic diluted number of stores open at end of period 
table of contents fiscal quarters ended in thousands  except per share data and number of stores may  august  november  february  net sales gross profit net loss from continuing operations net loss from discontinued operations net loss net loss per weighted average share from continuing operations basic diluted net loss per weighted average share from discontinued operations basic diluted net loss per weighted average share basic diluted number of stores open at end of period the company s business is highly seasonal  reflecting the general pattern associated with the retail industry of peak sales and earnings during the fourth quarter holiday season 
due to the importance of the holiday selling season  the fourth quarter of each fiscal year has historically contributed  and the company expects it will continue to contribute  a disproportionate percentage of the company s net sales and most of its net income  if any  for the entire fiscal year 
any factors negatively affecting the company during the holiday selling season in any year  including unfavorable economic conditions  could have a material adverse effect on the company s financial condition and results of operations 
the company generally experiences lower sales and earnings during the first three quarters and  as is typical in the retail industry  may incur losses in these quarters 
the results of operations for these interim periods are not necessarily indicative of the results for a full fiscal year 
in addition  the company makes decisions regarding merchandise well in advance of the season in which it will be sold 
significant deviations from projected demand for products could have a material adverse effect on the company s financial condition and results of operations  either by lost gross sales due to insufficient inventory or lost gross margin due to the need to mark down excess inventory 
the company s quarterly results of operations may also fluctuate based upon such factors as delays in the flow of merchandise  the ability to realize the expected operational and cost efficiencies from its distribution centers  the number and timing of store openings and related store preopening expenses  the amount of net sales contributed by new and existing stores  the mix of products sold  the timing and level of markdowns  store closings or relocations  competitive factors  changes in fuel and other shipping costs  general economic conditions  geopolitical conditions  fluctuations in the value of the us dollar against foreign currencies  labor market fluctuations  changes in accounting rules and regulations and unseasonable weather conditions 
critical accounting policies and estimates cost plus  inc s and its subsidiaries discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based upon the company s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires the company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
estimates and assumptions include  but are not limited to  inventory values  fixed asset lives  intangible asset values  deferred income taxes  self insurance reserves and the impact of contingencies and litigation 
the 
table of contents company bases its estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from those estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the company has also chosen certain accounting policies when options are available  including the retail inventory method of accounting for inventories and  prior to fiscal  the intrinsic value method to account for common stock options 
these accounting policies are applied consistently for all years presented except for the adoption of sfas r as of january  operating results would be affected if other alternatives were used 
although not all inclusive  the company believes that the following represent the more critical estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition the company recognizes revenue from the sale of merchandise either at the point of sale in its stores or at the time of receipt by the customer for merchandise purchased from its website 
revenue from sales of gift cards is deferred until redemption or until the likelihood of redemption by the customer is remote gift card breakage 
income from gift card breakage is recorded as a reduction to selling  general and administrative expenses 
shipping and handling fees charged to customers are recognized as revenue at the time the merchandise is delivered to the customer 
the company s revenues are reported net of discounts and returns  including an allowance for estimated returns 
the allowance for sales returns is based on historical experience and was approximately million at the end of fiscal and million at the end of fiscal and fiscal revenues are presented net of any taxes collected from customers and remitted to governmental authorities 
inventory inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market with cost determined under the retail inventory method rim  in which the valuation of inventories at cost and gross margins are calculated by applying a cost to retail ratio to the retail value of inventories 
rim is an averaging method that is widely used in the retail industry due to its practicality 
the company s use of the rim results in valuing inventories at lower of cost or market as markdowns are currently taken as a reduction of the retail value of inventories 
inherent in the rim calculation are certain significant management judgments and estimates including  among others  merchandise markup  markdowns and shrinkage  which impact the ending inventory valuation at cost as well as gross margin 
the company s rim utilizes multiple departments in which fairly homogeneous classes of merchandise inventories having similar gross margins are grouped 
management believes that the company s rim provides an inventory valuation that reasonably approximates cost and results in carrying inventory at the lower of cost or market 
inventory costs also include certain buying and distribution costs related to the procurement  processing and transportation of merchandise 
during fiscal  the company took a million charge to permanently write down selected inventory to current retail value 
self insured liabilities the company is primarily self insured for workers compensation  employee health benefits and general liability claims 
the company determines self insurance liabilities based on claims filed  including the development of those claims  and an estimate of claims incurred but not yet reported 
factors affecting this estimate include future inflation rates  changes in severity  benefit level changes  medical costs and claim settlement patterns 
should a different amount of claims occur compared to what was estimated  or costs of the claims increase or decrease beyond what was anticipated  reserves may need to be adjusted accordingly 
other accounting estimates estimates inherent in the preparation of the company s financial statements include those associated with the evaluation of the recoverability of deferred tax assets  the adequacy of tax contingencies  the impairment of goodwill and long lived assets and those estimates used in the determination of liabilities related to litigation  claims and assessments 
the company assesses the likelihood that deferred tax assets will be realized in the future and records a valuation allowance  if necessary  to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that it believes is more likely than not to be realized 
in evaluating our ability to recover our deferred tax assets we consider all available positive 
table of contents and negative evidence  including scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities  projected future taxable income  tax planning strategies  and recent financial operations 
during fiscal  the company recorded a million non cash charge on its statement of operations to provide a full valuation allowance against its net deferred tax assets 
this is a non cash charge that management felt was appropriate to record as the cumulative losses in recent years and the store closure activities met the prescribed criteria for taking an allowance under fasb statement no 
 accounting for income taxes  sfas 
the company s effective tax rate may be materially impacted by changes in the estimated level of earnings and changes in the deferred tax valuation allowance 
the company recognizes tax liabilities in accordance with fin  and we adjust these liabilities when our judgment changes as a result of the evaluation of new information not previously available 
due to the complexity of some of these uncertainties  the ultimate resolution may result in a payment that is materially different from our current estimate of the tax liabilities 
these differences will be reflected as increases or decreases to income tax expense in the period in which they are determined 
the company reviews long lived assets and intangible assets with finite useful lives for impairment at least annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying values may not be recoverable 
using its best estimates based on reasonable assumptions and projections  the company records an impairment loss to write such assets down to their estimated fair values if the carrying values of the assets exceed their related undiscounted expected future cash flows 
store specific long lived assets and intangible assets with finite lives are evaluated along with the stores in their respective media market  which is the lowest level at which individual cash flows can be identified 
corporate assets or other long lived assets that are not store specific are evaluated at a consolidated entity level 
based on the impairment tests performed in fiscal  the company recorded a million non cash charge for the write down of property and equipment at the stores that will close in fiscal and certain other underperforming stores 
the company records the estimated future liability for any store closures where a lease obligation still exists  associated with the rental obligation on the date the store is closed in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities 
during fiscal  the company expects to record a pre tax charge of approximately million related to the store closures consisting primarily of lease exit costs 
the company is involved in litigation  claims and assessments incidental to its business  the disposition of which is not expected to have a material effect on the company s financial position or results of operations 
it is possible  however  that future results of operations for any particular quarterly or annual period could be materially affected by changes in the company s assumptions related to these matters 
the company accrues its best estimate of the probable cost for the resolution of claims 
when appropriate  such estimates are developed in consultation with outside counsel handling the matters and are based upon a combination of litigation and settlement strategies 
to the extent additional information arises or the company s strategies change  it is possible that the company s best estimate of its probable liability may change 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is exposed to financial market risks  which include changes in us interest rates and foreign exchange rates 
the company does not engage in financial transactions for trading or speculative purposes 
interest rate risk the interest payable on the company s bank line of credit is based on a variable interest rate and therefore is affected by changes in market interest rates 
if interest rates on existing variable rate debt were to rise basis points a change from the company s borrowing rate as of january   the company s results of operations and cash flows would not be materially affected 
in the event of a default on the company s revolving credit facility  the company would be required to pay incremental interest at a rate of on the outstanding loan balance 
foreign currency risks the majority of purchase obligations outside of the united states of america into which the company enters are settled in us dollars  therefore  the company has only minimal exposure to foreign currency exchange risks 
the cost of products purchased in international markets can be affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates and significant exchange rate changes could have a material impact on future product costs 
the extent to which an increase in costs from foreign currency exchange rate changes will be able to be recovered in higher prices charged to customers is uncertain 
the company does not currently hedge against foreign currency risks
