below is a summary of changes in our portfolio which have occurred during the years ended december   and the table summarizes the number of hotels and number of rooms  excluding unconsolidated joint ventures hotels number of hotels  beginning of year acquisitions dispositions number of hotels  end of year rooms number of rooms  beginning of year acquisitions room expansions dispositions rooms converted to other uses number of rooms  end of year total portfolio and same store asset definitions 
we define our total portfolio as properties that are wholly or partially owned or leased by us 
we present certain information about our hotel operating results on a comparable hotel basis  which we refer to as our same store analysis 
we define our same store assets as those hotels a that are owned or leased by us  and whose operations are included in our consolidated operating results and b for which we reported operating results throughout the entire reporting periods being presented 
our same store assets for purposes of the comparison of the years ended december  and exclude the renaissance paris  the hotel del coronado  which we account for using the equity method of accounting  and all sold properties included in discontinued operations 
our same store assets for purposes of the comparison of the years ended december  and exclude the renaissance paris  the four seasons washington  dc  the westin st 
francis  the ritz carlton laguna niguel  the intercontinental prague  the marriott london grosvenor square  the fairmont scottsdale princess  the hotel del coronado  which we account for using the equity method of accounting  and all sold properties included in discontinued operations 
we present these same store asset results because we believe that doing so provides useful information for evaluating the period to period performance of our hotels and facilitates comparisons with other hotel reits and hotel owners 
in particular  these measures assist in distinguishing whether increases or decreases in revenues and or expenses are due to operations of the same store assets or from acquisition or disposition activity 
revenues 
substantially all of our revenue is derived from the operation of our hotels 
specifically  our revenue for the years ended december  and consisted of total portfolio of total revenues same store assets of total revenues revenues rooms food and beverage other hotel operating revenue lease revenue total revenues rooms revenue 
occupancy and average daily rate adr are the major drivers of rooms revenue 
food and beverage revenue 
occupancy  local catering and banquet events are the major drivers of food and beverage revenue 
other hotel operating revenue 
other hotel operating revenue consists primarily of internet access  telephone  parking  golf course  spa  space rentals  retail and other guest services and is also driven by occupancy 
lease revenue 
we sublease our interest in the marriott hamburg to a third party and earn annual base rent plus additional rent contingent on the hotel meeting performance thresholds 
we subleased our interest in the paris marriott to a third party through december  effective january   we no longer sublease our interest in the paris marriott and consolidate the operating results of the hotel in our consolidated statements of operations 
changes in our revenues are most easily explained by performance indicators that are used in the hotel real estate industry average daily occupancy  adr  revenue per available room revpar  which is the product of adr and average daily occupancy  but does not capture food and beverage revenues or other hotel operating revenue such as telephone  parking and other guest services  and total revpar which captures food and beverage and other hotel operating revenue 
we generate a significant portion of our revenue from two broad categories of customers  transient and group 
our transient customers include individual or group business and leisure travelers that occupy less than rooms per night 
transient customers accounted for approximately of the rooms sold during the year ended december  we divide our transient customers into the following subcategories transient leisure this category generates the highest room rates and includes travelers that receive published rates offered to the general public that do not have access to negotiated or discounted rates 
transient negotiated this category includes travelers  which are typically associated with companies and organizations that generate high volumes of business  that receive negotiated rates that are lower than the published rates offered to the general public 
our group customers include groups of or more individuals that occupy or more rooms per night 
group customers accounted for approximately of the rooms sold during the year ended december  we divide our group customers into the following subcategories group association this category includes group bookings related to national and regional association meetings and conventions 
group corporate this category includes group bookings related to corporate business 
group other this category generally includes group bookings related to social  military  education  religious  fraternal and youth and amateur sports teams 
fluctuations in revenues  which  for our domestic hotels  tend to correlate with changes in the us gdp  are driven largely by general economic and local market conditions as well as general health and safety concerns  which in turn affect levels of business and leisure travel 
guest demographics also affect our revenues 
for example  a greater percentage of transient guests will generate higher rooms revenues 
however  a greater percentage of certain group guests  which consume larger relative amounts of food and beverage and other services  may contribute to higher total revenue 
in addition to economic conditions  supply is another important factor that can affect revenues 
room rates and occupancy tend to fall when supply increases unless the supply growth is offset by an equal or greater increase in demand 
one reason why we target upper upscale and luxury hotels in select urban and resort markets  including major business centers and leisure destinations  is because they tend to be in locations that have greater supply constraints such as lack of available land  high development costs  long development and entitlement lead times and brand trade area restrictions that prevent the addition of a certain brand or brands in close proximity 
nevertheless  our hotels are not completely insulated from competitive pressures and our hotel operators will lower room rates to compete more aggressively for guests in periods when occupancy declines 
for purposes of calculating our total portfolio revpar for  we exclude unconsolidated joint ventures and the marriott hamburg because we sublease the operations of the hotel and only record lease revenue 
for purposes of calculating total portfolio revpar in and  we excluded unconsolidated joint ventures  the marriott hamburg and the paris marriott hotels because we subleased the operations of these hotels and only recorded lease revenue 
same store assets revpar is calculated in the same manner as total portfolio revpar but also excludes the renaissance paris for the years ended december  and same store assets revpar for is calculated in the same manner as total portfolio revpar in and also excludes the four seasons washington  dc  the westin st 
francis  the ritz carlton laguna niguel  the intercontinental prague  the marriott london grosvenor square  and the fairmont scottsdale princess 
these methods for calculating revpar each period are consistently applied through the remainder of this item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and should be taken into consideration wherever revpar results are disclosed 
overall  our same store assets revpar  excluding the paris marriott in  decreased by to during the year ended december  from during the year ended december  hotel operating expenses 
our hotel operating expenses for the years ended december  and consisted of the costs and expenses to provide hotel services  including total portfolio of total hotel operating expenses same store assets of total hotel operating expenses hotel operating expenses rooms food and beverage other departmental expenses management fees other hotel expenses total hotel operating expenses rooms expense 
occupancy is a major driver of rooms expense  which has a significant correlation with rooms revenue 
food and beverage expense 
occupancy  local catering and banquet events are the major drivers of food and beverage expense  which has a significant correlation with food and beverage revenue 
other departmental expenses 
other departmental expenses consist of general and administrative  marketing  repairs and maintenance  utilities and expenses related to earning other operating revenue 
management fees 
we pay base and incentive management fees to our hotel operators 
base management fees are computed as a percentage of revenue and correlate to revenues 
incentive management fees are incurred when operating profits exceed levels prescribed in our management agreements 
other hotel expenses 
other hotel expenses consist primarily of insurance costs and property taxes 
salaries  wages and related benefits are included within the categories of hotel operating expenses described above and represented approximately of the total hotel operating expenses for the year ended december  most categories of variable operating expenses  such as utilities and certain labor such as housekeeping  fluctuate with changes in occupancy 
increases in revpar attributable to increases in occupancy are accompanied by increases in most categories of variable operating costs and expenses while increases in revpar attributable to increases in adr typically only result in increases in limited categories of operating costs and expenses  such as management fees charged by our operators  which are based on hotel revenues 
thus  changes in adr have a more significant impact on operating margins 
lease expense 
as a result of sale and leaseback transactions applicable to the paris marriott and marriott hamburg hotels  we recorded lease expense in our statements of operations 
in conjunction with the sale and leaseback transactions  we also recorded a deferred gain 
net lease expense includes an offset for the amortization of the deferred gain of million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
corporate expenses 
corporate expenses include our corporate level expenses such as payroll and related costs  professional fees  travel expenses and office rent 
recent events 
we expect that the following events will cause our future results of operations to differ from our historical performance aqua building 
during the third quarter of  we decided not to purchase an interest in a mixed use building  the aqua building  which is currently under construction and adjacent to the fairmont chicago hotel 
in conjunction with our decision not to purchase an interest in the aqua building  we recorded a charge of approximately million in the year ended december   which includes the loss of our million deposit in the form of a letter of credit that secured the contract and approximately million in planning and development costs 
we made the decision to not proceed with this investment because it no longer meets our investment criteria due to escalating total project costs and our increased corporate focus on liquidity 
impairment losses 
overall weakness in the us economy  particularly the turmoil in the credit markets  weakness in the housing market  and volatile energy and commodity costs  have resulted in considerable negative pressure on both consumer and business spending 
as a result  lodging demand  which is primarily driven by us gdp growth  business investment and employment growth  continued to weaken during with an acceleration of this trend in the third and fourth quarters of the year 
we determined that these conditions have contributed to our low stock price and reduced market capitalization relative to the book value of our equity  which are indicators of potential impairment of goodwill and long lived assets  and that an evaluation of carrying values of goodwill  intangibles and long lived assets was therefore required 
based on our evaluation  we recorded an estimated non cash impairment charge that consisted of million of goodwill and other intangible assets in the third quarter of in the fourth quarter of  the company performed its annual impairment analysis and recorded a non cash impairment charge to goodwill  other intangible assets  and investment in joint ventures totaling million 
in addition  we determined that there was no impairment of investment in hotel properties at the time of our review 
see critical accounting policies for further detail regarding our analysis 
paris marriott 
as the result of a sale leaseback transaction that occurred in  we have a leasehold interest in the paris marriott 
prior to  we subleased our leasehold interest in the paris marriott to a third party 
we classified the sublease arrangement as an operating lease and recorded lease revenue in our statement of operations 
effective january   we no longer sublease the operations of the paris marriott to a third party and no longer record lease revenue 
instead  we record the operating results of the paris marriott in our consolidated statements of operations 
suspension of stock dividends 
on november   shr s board of directors elected to suspend the quarterly dividend to holders of shares of shr common stock 
on february   shr s board of directors elected to suspend the quarterly dividend to holders of shares of shr preferred stock 
amendment to bank credit facility 
in february  we entered into an amended bank credit facility agreement 
this amendment  among other things  provides us with additional flexibility with respect to our financial covenants and related financial calculations  reduces the facility size from million to million and increases the interest rate from libor plus a margin of to to libor plus a margin of

operating loss income for the total portfolio decreased by million  or 
this decrease in operating loss income is primarily due to the following a a million decrease at the same store assets  other than the paris marriott  primarily attributable to million of impairment on goodwill and other intangible assets in  and the write off of million of costs related to projects abandoned due to unfavorable market conditions in  b a million decrease at the non same store assets primarily attributable to impairment losses of million at the renaissance paris and million at our investment in the four seasons residence club punta mita rcpm  c a million decrease in corporate impairment losses and other charges primarily attributable to charges from abandoning our planned purchase of an interest in the aqua building in  and d a million decrease attributable to an increase in corporate depreciation  partially offset by e a million increase attributable to consolidating the operations of the paris marriott effective january   and f a million increase attributable to a decrease in corporate expenses

we owned the renaissance paris for the full year ended december  but only owned the hotel for five months during the year ended december  the additional ownership period generated approximately million of additional rooms revenue 
another significant factor increasing rooms revenue was the consolidation of the paris marriott  which generated million of rooms revenue during the year ended december  the remaining properties contributed to a million decrease in rooms revenue  which is more fully explained below as part of our rooms revenue same store asset analysis

the increase in same store revpar was primarily due to the consolidation of the paris marriott operations  which we included in our same store asset analysis because we continue to hold a leasehold interest in the hotel 
the paris marriott generated revpar of during the remaining same store assets contributed to a revpar decrease of 
this was driven mainly by revpar declines at the marriott lincolnshire  which saw a drop in group demand due to increased competition coupled with a discounting of transient room rates  at the marriott london grosvenor square  which experienced displacement from room renovations earlier in the year as well as foreign currency translation  and at the fairmont chicago  which experienced displacement from renovations during the first half of food and beverage 
food and beverage revenue for the same store assets decreased million  or 
the same store assets food and beverage revenue  excluding the paris marriott  decreased by million due to a shifting of the mix of business from group to transient at several of our hotels 
in addition  lower overall occupancy has resulted in decreases in ancillary revenues such as food and beverage 
this decrease was partially offset by the consolidation of the paris marriott in  which generated food and beverage revenue of million 
for the total portfolio  food and beverage revenue decreased million  or 
this decrease related to the million decrease at the same store assets which was partially offset by an increase in food and beverage revenue of approximately million related to our additional ownership period of the renaissance paris during when compared to other hotel operating revenue

the same store assets other hotel operating revenues  excluding the paris marriott  decreased by million as a result of decreases in various ancillary revenues such as spa  garage  gift shop  recreation  and telephone driven mainly by lower occupancy 
these decreases were partially offset by increases in group cancellation fees  increases in fees earned from the villa rental program at the four seasons punta mita due to higher demand  increases in theatre revenue earned at the marriott lincolnshire due to two highly popular shows performed at the theatre  and increases in spa revenues at the fairmont chicago and intercontinental miami  as both opened new spas in lease revenue

operating income for the total portfolio increased million  or 
this increase in operating income is primarily due to the following a a million increase attributable to the same store assets  as described below  b a million increase attributable to the fairmont scottsdale princess  which we purchased in september  c a million increase attributable to the marriott london grosvenor square  which we purchased in august  d a million increase attributable to the westin st

the events mentioned above have had a significant impact on our overall operations  including increases in both revenue and operating expenses  therefore  we believe that an analysis of changes in each line item comprising the total portfolio hotel operating income is not meaningful in addressing the factors that drive year over year operating results 
a more relevant approach is to analyze the changes in hotel operating income of the same store assets for the years ended december  and  as described below 
rooms 
for the total portfolio  rooms revenue increased million  or 
a significant factor related to the overall portfolio rooms revenue increase is the acquisition of new properties 
in addition  revpar from our total portfolio excluding leased properties and unconsolidated joint ventures for the year ended december  increased by from the year ended december  the components of revpar from our total portfolio excluding leased properties and unconsolidated joint ventures for the years ended december  and are summarized as follows years ended december  occupancy adr revpar for the same store assets  rooms revenue increased million  or 
revpar from our same store assets excluding leased properties for the year ended december  increased by from the year ended december  the components of revpar from our same store assets excluding leased properties for the years ended december  and are summarized as follows years ended december  occupancy adr revpar the increase in revpar for the same store assets excluding leased properties resulted from a percentage point increase in occupancy and a increase in adr 
significant revpar increases within the same store assets were noted at the four seasons mexico city with a increase and the intercontinental miami with a increase 
at the four seasons mexico city  the increase in revpar was due to political unrest and protests surrounding mexico s presidential election that decreased the hotel s revpar  in addition to a significant increase in transient demand during  which allowed the hotel to yield a higher rate 
the increase at the intercontinental miami hotel was attributed to the city of miami hosting the superbowl in february  two large bi annual groups and no serious hurricane threats during the year  all of which increased occupancy by approximately four percentage points and adr by approximately at this property 
food and beverage 
for the total portfolio  food and beverage revenue increased million  or  which was primarily due to the acquisition of hotels 
for the same store assets  food and beverage revenue increased million  or 
this same store increase was primarily driven by the increase in food and beverage revenue of at the intercontinental miami  at the four seasons punta mita resort and at the intercontinental chicago 
most of the food and beverage increase at the intercontinental miami was due to group occupied rooms increasing by approximately  which increased banquet revenues by million  or 
the four seasons punta mita resort expanded by rooms in and total occupied rooms increased by approximately 
this resulted in increased usage of the food and beverage outlets 
in addition  a new restaurant opened in late  which contributed million in revenues 
at the intercontinental chicago  group occupied rooms increased by  which resulted in an increase in banquet revenues of million  or 
additionally  the hotel opened a wine room  which contributed million in additional food and beverage revenue 
other hotel operating revenue 
for the total portfolio  other hotel operating revenue increased million  or  which was primarily due to the acquisition of hotels 
the significant other operating revenues generated by these acquired properties during the year ended december  include spa and health club revenue of approximately million  cancellation fees of approximately million  gift shop revenue of approximately million  garage parking revenue of approximately million  recreation revenue of approximately million  telephone services revenue of approximately million  space rental revenue of approximately million  laundry revenue of approximately million and other incidental hotel services such as in house movies of approximately million 
additionally  we recognized million related to a performance guarantee at the renaissance paris for the year ended december  for the same store assets  other hotel operating revenue increased million  or 
approximately million of the increase relates to retail revenue generated from four new boutiques that opened in late  cancellation fees  commissions related to the villa rental program and spa revenue at the four seasons punta mita resort 
other hotel operating revenue increased million at the intercontinental chicago primarily due to cancellation fees and million at the marriott lincolnshire primarily due to theatre revenue 
lease revenue 
for the total portfolio and same store assets  lease revenue increased 
the increase in lease revenue was driven by a increase in adr at the paris marriott 
the strong performance at the paris marriott resulted in higher lease revenue because  in accordance with our lease agreements  we earn an annual base rent plus additional rent contingent on the hotel meeting performance thresholds

during the third quarter  we determined that we would terminate this sublease arrangement and enter into a management agreement directly with marriott beginning january  therefore  effective in january  we will consolidate the hotel operating revenues and expenses in our consolidated statements of operations

the significant increase in equity in earnings losses is primarily due to the sale of residential condominium hotel units that were completed by the north beach venture  a development adjacent to the hotel del coronado  during foreign currency exchange loss gain 
foreign currency exchange loss gain was a million loss for the year ended december  compared to a million gain for the year ended december  the decrease is primarily related to a million loss on a euro denominated mortgage loan applicable to the intercontinental prague hotel  which became a consolidated entity in august  partially offset by a million gain on a loan related to the marriott london grosvenor square hotel 
other expenses income  net 
other expenses income  net includes asset management fees  non income related state  local and franchise taxes  as well as other miscellaneous income and expenses

income tax expense 
income tax expense increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the increase is primarily due to income tax expense related to residential sales at the north beach venture  a development adjacent to the hotel del coronado  and an increase in current tax expense as a result of consolidating intercontinental prague for the entire year in compared to five months in due to our purchase of our joint venture partner s interest in the entity that owns the intercontinental prague in august this increase in income tax expense was partially offset by an increase in the deferred tax benefit at the intercontinental prague due to the enactment of lower tax rates effective after january  minority interests 
we record minority interest income or expense based on the percentage of sh funding we do not own 
in addition  we record minority interest for the non ownership interests in hotels that are partially owned by us 
minority interest excluding discontinued operations in sh funding decreased to a to million expense for the year ended december  from a million expense for the year ended december  minority interest in consolidated affiliates increased to a million expense for the year ended december  from a million expense for the year ended december  the change reflects the effect of the sale of minority interests in the intercontinental chicago and hyatt regency la jolla hotels in  offset by a reduction due to the acquisition of the remaining minority interest in the intercontinental miami hotel in gain on sale of minority interests in hotel properties 
on august   we sold a interest in each of the intercontinental chicago and hyatt regency la jolla hotels

we sold the hyatt regency phoenix hotel during the third quarter of  the hyatt regency new orleans hotel during the fourth quarter of and the marriott rancho las palmas resort and hilton burbank airport hotel during the third quarter of we reclassified the results of operations for these hotels as discontinued operations for the years ended december  and loss income from discontinued operations amounted to million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the income from discontinued operations in includes the gain of million recognized from the sale of the two hotels 
the loss from discontinued operations in primarily consisted of the operating results at the hyatt regency phoenix and hyatt regency new orleans hotels  which included million of losses on the early extinguishment of debt related to the defeasance of fixed rate mortgage loans secured by these two hotels and a million impairment loss on the hyatt regency new orleans hotel due to a change in our anticipated holding period of the property and our updated estimates of fair value of the property 
liquidity and capital resources our short term liquidity requirements consist primarily of funds necessary to pay for operating expenses and other expenditures  including recurring maintenance and capital expenditures necessary to maintain  improve and expand our properties properly  interest expense and scheduled principal payments on outstanding indebtedness  acquisitions  future distributions paid to our common stockholders to maintain our reit status  future distributions paid to our preferred stockholders  and future distributions to minority interests 
historically  we have satisfied our short term liquidity requirements through our existing working capital  cash provided by our operations  and our bank credit facility 
we believe that our existing working capital  our bank credit facility described below and cash provided by operations will continue to be sufficient to meet our short term liquidity requirements for at least the next months 
in february  shr s board of directors elected to suspend the quarterly dividend to holders of series a  b and c cumulative redeemable preferred stock as a measure to preserve liquidity 
factors contributing to this decision were the declining economic environment for hotel operations  no projected taxable distribution requirement for under the reit rules  and uncertainty regarding operating cash flows in elimination of preferred dividends equates to approximately million in cash flow savings each quarter 
in november  shr s board of directors elected to suspend the quarterly dividend to holders of shares of shr common stock beginning in the fourth quarter of  which was estimated to save approximately million each quarter 
capital expenditures for the years ended december   and amounted to million  million and million  respectively 
included in the  and amounts were million  million and million of capitalized interest  respectively  which include amounts related to continuing and discontinued operations 
capital expenditures for the years ended december  and included approximately million and million  respectively  to redevelop the hyatt regency new orleans hotel 
for the year ended december   we expect to fund hotel ff e reserve projects of approximately million and owner funded projects of up to approximately million 
during and the first month of  we completed significant renovations at our fairmont chicago  four seasons washington  dc  marriott london grosvenor square hotel and fairmont scottsdale hotels 
consistent with the company s efforts to preserve liquidity  capital expenditures have been cancelled or deferred to a minimum spending level in bank credit facility 
in february   we entered into the third amendment to our bank credit facility  which among other things provides us with additional flexibility with respect to our financial covenants and related financial calculations 
the following summarizes key financial terms and conditions of the amended line of credit agreement the maximum facility size was reduced to million  interest rate on the facility is libor plus a margin of and a commitment fee of per annum based on the unused revolver balance  lenders received additional collateral in the form of mortgages over the five borrowing base properties which mortgages supplement the existing pledges of the company s interest in sh funding and sh funding s interest in certain subsidiaries and guarantees of the loan from the company and certain of its subsidiaries  all of which continue to secure the bank credit facility  maximum availability is determined by the lesser of a times debt service coverage on the borrowing base assets or a advance rate against the appraised value of the borrowing base assets  minimum corporate fixed charge coverage of times  which may be reduced at sh funding s option to times for up to four consecutive quarters with a quarterly fee of paid on outstanding balances during each quarter that the coverage ratio is reduced  maximum corporate leverage of as defined in the agreement  minimum tangible net worth of  million excluding goodwill and currency translation adjustments  default under and acceleration of the prague loan  or any property located in europe  would not constitute an event of default  maturity date of march   with a one year extension option conditioned upon compliance with a corporate fixed charge coverage ratio for the year ending december  of times  restrictions on the company and sh funding s ability to pay dividends 
such restrictions include a prohibition on each of the company and sh funding s ability to pay any amount of preferred dividends in cash or in kind if sh funding has elected to reduce its fixed charge coverage to as discussed above  prohibitions on the company and sh funding and their respective subsidiaries ability to pay any dividends unless certain ratios and other conditions are met  and prohibitions on the company and sh funding s ability to issue dividends in cash or in kind at any time an event of default shall have occurred 
notwithstanding the dividend restrictions described above  for so long as the company qualifies  or has taken all other actions necessary to qualify as a reit  sh funding may authorize  declare and pay quarterly cash dividends to the company when and to the extent necessary for the company to distribute cash dividends to its shareholders generally in an aggregate amount not to exceed the minimum amount necessary for the company to maintain its tax status as a reit  unless certain events of default exist 
other terms and conditions exist including provisions to release assets from the borrowing base and limitations on the company s ability to incur costs for discretionary capital programs 
at february   there was million outstanding under this facility and outstanding letters of credit of million 
as discussed above  the amended bank credit facility contains financial covenants that must be met  including the maintenance of stipulated minimum levels of tangible net worth and fixed charge coverage  and maximum levels of leverage and borrowing base availability 
our ability to borrow under the amended bank credit facility is subject to compliance with these financial and other covenants 
we are in compliance with the financial covenants set forth in our bank credit facility 
based upon our current outlook for  we expect to remain in compliance with the financial covenants set forth in the bank credit facility for at least the next months 
our compliance with these covenants in future periods  and our ability to borrow under the bank credit facility  will depend substantially on the financial results of our hotels 
our compliance with the financial covenants  and our ability to borrow under the bank credit facility  may be negatively impacted by any deterioration in our operations brought on by the current economic downturn  potential further declines in the hotel property values  and additional borrowings necessary to maintain our liquidity and meet our capital and financing obligations 
the amended bank credit facility provides increased operating cushion with respect to our financial covenants against a prolonged downturn 
however  if current financial market conditions persist and our business deteriorates  we may breach one or more of our financial covenants 
if we breach our financial covenants  we would be in default under the related bank credit facility  which could allow the lenders to declare all amounts outstanding under the facility to become due and payable 
additionally  such an acceleration event would allow for acceleration of our interest rate swaps and exchangeable notes 
if this happens  there would be a material adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations 
mortgages and other debt payable 
the following table summarizes our outstanding debt and scheduled maturities  including extensions  which can be exercised at our option  related to mortgages and other debt payable as of december  in thousands balance as of december  thereafter mortgage loans fairmont chicago  libor plus loews santa monica beach hotel  libor plus ritz carlton half moon bay  libor plus hyatt regency la jolla  libor plus intercontinental chicago  libor plus intercontinental miami  libor plus intercontinental prague  month euribor plus westin st 
francis  libor plus marriott london grosvenor square  month gbp libor plus fairmont scottsdale princess  libor plus total mortgage loans other debt total mortgages and other debt payable these mortgage loans contained a provision which required that we maintain a minimum market capitalization at a level which we no longer maintain 
in october  the lender agreed to substitute this requirement with a minimum tangible net worth requirement as defined in  and consistent with  the bank credit facility agreement 
at december   due to the impairment of goodwill discussed above we did not meet the minimum tangible net worth covenant as it was defined 
on february   the lender consented to modify the tangible net worth covenant to be consistent with the amended covenant in the bank credit facility as described above  which is calculated without regard to goodwill 
we met the requirements of this amended tangible net worth calculation as of december  under the loan  the lender has the right but not the requirement to request that the loan be repaid to maintain no greater than a loan to value as determined by an appraisal commissioned by the lender 
an appraisal was commissioned by us as a supporting document to the amendment process on the line of credit agreement 
that appraisal suggests that if the lender to the prague loan orders an appraisal the loan may not meet the loan to value requirement  and  if the lender elects to seek a reduction in the loan amount  we would then have days to repay approximately million in loan principal in order to avoid an event of default 
failure of us then complying with the lenders request would cause an event of default and the loan would be subject to acceleration and potentially foreclosure 
as of december   the intercontinental prague had a net investment in hotel property of million and goodwill of million 
management has assessed that  in amending the bank credit facility  in the worst case a failure to maintain the financial covenants in the prague loan and foreclosure by the lender would not have a material impact to our liquidity 
under the amended bank credit facility  a default under and acceleration of this loan  or any other property located in europe  would not constitute an event of default under the amended bank credit facility 
in connection with the acquisition of a acre oceanfront land parcel in punta mita  nayarit  mexico  we executed two million non interest bearing promissory notes 
we recorded these notes at their present value based on an imputed interest rate of and will amortize the resulting discount over the life of the promissory notes 
on september   we paid the first of the million non interest bearing promissory notes 
the second note is due august  our long term liquidity requirements consist primarily of funds necessary to pay for scheduled debt maturities  renovations  expansions and other non recurring capital expenditures that need to be made periodically to our properties and the costs associated with acquisitions of properties 
in addition  we may use cash to buy back common or preferred securities from time to time when market conditions are favorable through open market purchases  privately negotiated transactions  or a tender offer  although the terms of our amended bank credit facility prohibit us from buying back common or preferred shares unless certain conditions are met 
historically  we have satisfied our long term liquidity requirements through various sources of capital  including our existing working capital  cash provided by operations  sales of properties  long term property mortgage indebtedness  bank credit facilities  issuance of senior unsecured debt instruments and through the issuance of additional equity securities 
the recent crisis in the credit markets has resulted in a challenging credit environment and our ability to raise capital through various debt markets is uncertain 
our ability to raise funds through the issuance of equity securities is dependent upon  among other things  general market conditions for both reits in general and us specifically and market perceptions about us 
we will continue to analyze which source of capital is most advantageous to us at any particular point in time  but equity and debt financing may not be consistently available to us on terms that are attractive or at all
