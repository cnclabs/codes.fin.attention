item business overview included elsewhere in this annual report 

table of contents our strategy our goal is to advance our position as a leading helicopter services provider to the offshore energy industry 
we intend to employ the following strategies to achieve this goal grow our business 
we plan to continue to grow our business globally and increase our revenue and profitability  subject to managing through cyclical downturns in the energy industry 
we have a footprint in most major oil and gas producing regions of the world  and we expect to have the opportunity to expand and deepen our presence in many of these markets 
we anticipate this growth will result primarily from the deployment of new aircraft into markets where we expect they will be most profitably employed  as well as by executing opportunistic acquisitions and investments 
through our relationships with our existing customers  we are aware of future business opportunities in the markets we currently serve that would allow us to grow through fleet additions 
our acquisition related growth may include increasing our role and participation with existing unconsolidated affiliates or investing in new companies  and may include increasing our position in existing markets or expanding into new markets 
be the preferred provider of helicopter services 
we position our business as the preferred provider of helicopter services by maintaining strong relationships with our customers and providing safe and high quality service 
we focus on maintaining relationships with our customers field operations and corporate management 
we believe that this focus helps us better anticipate customer needs and provide our customers with the right aircraft in the right place at the right time  which in turn allows us to better manage our existing fleet and capital investment program 
we also leverage our close relationships with our customers to establish mutually beneficial operating practices and safety standards worldwide 
by applying standard operating and safety practices across our global operations  we seek to provide our customers with consistent  high quality service in each of their areas of operation 
by better understanding our customers needs and by virtue of our global operations and safety standards  we have effectively competed against other helicopter service providers based on aircraft availability  customer service  safety and reliability  and not just price 
integrate our global operations 
we are an integrated global operator  and we intend to continue to identify and implement further opportunities to integrate our global organization 
we have integrated our operations among previously independently managed businesses  created a global flight and maintenance standards group  improved our global asset allocation and made other changes in our corporate and field operations 

table of contents market outlook our core business is providing helicopter services to the worldwide oil and gas industry 
our customers operating expenditures in the production sector are the principal source of our revenue approximately two thirds for fiscal year  while their exploration and development capital expenditures provide around a third of our revenue 
our customers typically base their capital expenditure budgets on their long term commodity price expectations and not exclusively on the current spot price 
commodity prices fell substantially in the past twelve months  including an approximate decline in the spot price of crude oil at one point during fiscal year most of our oil company customers have reduced capital spending plans  including in many cases deferral of projects  typically by to months 
accordingly  we have begun to see a reduction in demand for exploration based flying and shift to lower cost aircraft in certain of our markets 
in addition  a number of our north sea customers are reassessing their short to medium term plans which has resulted in a reduction in activity in comparison to the first half of fiscal year levels 
we have successfully resisted any rate reductions in the north sea and continue to work with our clients to improve the efficiency of their operations 
although our small independent oil company customers are not the largest portion of our business  they are more vulnerable to commodity price shifts and the global financial crisis discussed below 
in several cases  such customers have slowed their payments for our services  and in one case  a small customer went into receivership 
finally  there has been a softening in the aftermarket for sales of our older aircraft  reflecting fewer buyers with available capital  and sale prices have also declined  but to a lesser extent 
although some of the global demand for our services has softened  the fundamental long term challenge for our industry is the limitation on supply of new aircraft and the need to retire many of the older aircraft in the industry s fleet 
although manufacturers currently have some availability for aircraft  we expect constraints on supply of new aircraft to resume 
in addition  we have not reduced our customer pricing 
we have and expect to continue to respond to customer rate reduction requests by demonstrating our modest pricing during robust commodity price markets over the past few years relative to other oil service sectors and our continued requirement to achieve appropriate returns on capital 
our global operations and critical mass of helicopters provide us with diversity of geographic and customer focus to help mitigate risks associated with single markets or customers 
accordingly  we continue to expect to grow our business through the delivery of aircraft on order and potentially through acquisitions and investments  subject to managing through cyclical downturns in the energy industry 
since the middle of  the global financial markets have experienced severe disruption resulting in the failure  consolidation or government support of a number of financial institutions  the reduction or elimination of credit in certain markets or substantial increase in cost of credit and significant declines in equity prices for publicly traded companies 
many of these events have been related to actual or perceived lack of liquidity in the credit markets 
over the past three years  we have raised approximately billion of capital in a mix of debt and equity with both public and private financings 
during this same period we have spent billion on capital expenditures to grow our business 
we expect that our cash on deposit as of march  of million and million borrowing capacity under our revolving credit facility will be sufficient to satisfy our remaining aircraft purchase commitments of million as of march  the cash we expect to generate from future operations and sales of aircraft provide us with additional liquidity 
we plan to continue to be disciplined in our capital commitment program  including preserving liquidity and continuing to pre finance capital expenditures 
therefore  we do not foresee an immediate need to raise capital through new financings 
see items a 
risk factors in part ii of this annual report for a discussion of some of the risks associated with the continuing financial and credit crisis and worldwide economic downturn 
in order to prudently manage our business during this period  we are taking the following actions capital expenditures are being carefully evaluated and prioritized  management salaries have been frozen  and staffing levels and compensation structures are being reviewed to properly position the company to continue meeting customers needs while maintaining operational safety 
we have made some staffing reductions in the us gulf of mexico  west africa and australia business units 
we began consultations with uk union representatives and employees in our europe and eh centralized operations business units regarding potential staffing reductions in fiscal year similar actions are expected in other business units as part of an overall plan to reduce our work force by to to meet changing market conditions 
in april and may  a voluntary resignation process was offered to certain employee groups across a number of our business units and involuntary layoffs began for certain employees within our us gulf of mexico  wh centralized operations  europe and eh centralized operations business units as a part of this workforce reduction plan 

table of contents we conduct business in various foreign countries  and as such  our cash flows and earnings are subject to fluctuations and related risks from changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
throughout fiscal year  our primary foreign currency exposure has related to the euro  the british pound sterling and the australian dollar 
the value of each of these currencies has deteriorated relative to the us dollar causing a substantial reduction in our operating income during the fiscal year for additional details  see item a

table of contents fiscal year compared to fiscal year set forth below is a discussion of the results of operations of our business units 
our consolidated results are discussed under executive overview overview of operating results above 
us gulf of mexico gross revenue for us gulf of mexico increased to million for fiscal year from million for fiscal year the increase in gross revenue is primarily due to an increase in billings to our customers for fuel costs and a favorable shift in the mix of aircraft type utilized towards more medium and large aircraft in fiscal year partially driven by the sale of small aircraft in the gom asset sale on october  as medium and large aircraft earn higher rates than small aircraft 
this increase was partially offset by the negative impact of hurricanes in the gulf of mexico during fiscal year as well as a decrease in flight hours resulting from the sale of the aircraft included in the gom asset sale 
in connection with the gom asset sale  we entered into a transition services agreement tsa with the buyer under which we agreed to operate the aircraft included in the gom asset sale until operational control was transferred to the buyer s faa operating certificate 
we generated million in revenue from the tsa during fiscal year  which also partially offset the loss of revenue from the sale of the aircraft 
operating expense for us gulf of mexico increased to million for fiscal year from million for fiscal year due to the fact that some of our bases were damaged by hurricanes in fiscal year  we incurred higher than normal operating costs  such as unreimbursed property expenses and evacuation and redeployment expenses 
also contributing to increases in operating expenses were increases in salaries and fuel costs during fiscal year fuel costs are mostly recovered from our customers 
primarily as a result of the hurricanes in fiscal year  the operating margin for this business unit decreased to for fiscal year from for fiscal year we essentially recovered our costs under the tsa  which was completed in the march quarter 
excluding the impact of the hurricanes  our operating margin would have been in fiscal year the gom asset sale resulted in a pre tax gain of million  or per diluted share after tax  which is recorded in gain on gom asset sale in our consolidated statement of income 
we employ approximately active pilots in our us gulf of mexico and arctic operations who are represented by the opeiu under a collective bargaining agreement 
we and the pilots represented by the opeiu ratified an amended collective bargaining agreement on october  with an october  effective date 
the two and a half year agreement includes annual pilot wage increases of beginning on october  and improvements to other benefits 
we are seeking to increase the rates we charge customers to recover these and other cost increases 
arctic gross revenue for arctic increased to million for fiscal year from million for fiscal year  primarily due to new contract work during fiscal year flight hours increased in fiscal year from fiscal year as a result of this new work 
operating expense for arctic increased to million for fiscal year from million for fiscal year  primarily due to increased salaries  maintenance and other costs resulting from the increase in flight activity 
the operating margin for this business unit increased to for fiscal year versus for fiscal year as a result of the new contract work 
latin america gross revenue for latin america increased to million for fiscal year from million for fiscal year  primarily due to the million impact on gross revenue from the consolidation of rlr effective april   recognition of revenue on an accrual basis and additional contracts in mexico that commenced in september as discussed below 
as discussed in note in the notes to consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report  we previously recognized revenue on a cash basis from our owned unconsolidated affiliate in mexico  hemisco helicopters international  inc together with heliservicio hc 
this increase was partially offset by lower revenue in trinidad as a result of reduced flight hours driven by lower demand by three major customers in trinidad 

table of contents operating expense for latin america increased to million for fiscal year from million for fiscal year  primarily due to the million effect of the consolidation of rlr effective april  this was partially offset by lower operating expense in trinidad due to the reduction in flight activity and in brazil due to the operation of fewer aircraft 
primarily as a result of the impact of the reorganization of our mexico operations  the operating margin for this business unit increased to for fiscal year from for fiscal year in september  our owned unconsolidated affiliate in mexico  heliservicio  began a five year contract to provide ten medium helicopters to pemex 
the total revenue over the term of the contract is estimated at million 
this new contract replaced a previous contract for three helicopters 
additionally  in april  heliservicio began a five year contract to provide five medium and two small helicopters to pemex and  in january  began a three year contract extension to lease and operate eight medium helicopters for the comision federal de electricidad  the national power supplier of mexico 
twenty one of the aircraft operated by heliservicio are leased from us 
as a result of working capital and other cash requirements to commence operations on these contracts  heliservicio s payment of billings for aircraft leased from rlr and other consolidated subsidiaries has been delayed 
we have recorded a provision for bad debt for million relating to mexico receivables due to the uncertainty as to their collectibility 
we will continue to monitor the cash flow for heliservicio in order to evaluate the collectibility of our billings 
during the september quarter  we purchased two medium aircraft for million which were leased to heliservicio for use in their operations 
in january  we sold these aircraft for the same price to a third party leasing company that leases these aircraft to heliservicio 
with respect to four aircraft we lease to customers in three latin america countries  we have re evaluated our aircraft leasing arrangements and do not intend to renew these leases upon expiration 
we do not expect the termination of this work to result in a material impact on our consolidated results of operations 
wh centralized operations our wh centralized operations business unit is comprised of our technical services business  other non flight services business eg  provision of maintenance and supply chain parts and services to other western hemisphere business units and division level expenses 
operating expense reflects costs associated with other non flight services net of the related charges to the other western hemisphere business units 
gross revenue for wh centralized operations  which consists entirely of technical services revenue  increased to million for fiscal year from million for fiscal year as a result of increased part sales activity 
operating expense increased to million for fiscal year from million for fiscal year  primarily due to increases in costs of part sales and other costs that are managed centrally by wh centralized operations and not allocated to the other western hemisphere business units including management salaries and information technology costs 
the increase in costs resulted in a million decrease in operating income from this business unit compared to fiscal year europe gross revenue for europe increased to million for fiscal year from million for fiscal year  primarily as a result of the consolidation of bristow norway effective october  million  increases in out of pocket costs rebilled to our customers reimbursable revenue  additional aircraft in this market  billings to our customers for fuel costs and increased rates under new and existing contracts  partially offset by the impact of exchange rate changes as the us dollar strengthened against the british pound sterling during fiscal year and by reduced search and rescue work 
we previously provided search and rescue services for the uk maritime coastguard agency mca 
the four bases under the contract were transitioned to another operator during the period from july  until april  we had million and million in revenue and million and million in operating expense associated with the mca contract  for fiscal years and  respectively 
we sold one of the search and rescue aircraft in january and three additional aircraft during fiscal year two of the remaining aircraft are employed in den helder  netherlands in support of another search and rescue contract 
additionally  fiscal year included million in revenue related to contractual rate escalations and retroactive rate adjustments applicable to services performed in prior periods and million in other revenue adjustments related to prior periods 
fiscal year included revenue associated with contractual rate escalations for services performed in prior periods totaling million 

table of contents operating expense for europe increased to million for fiscal year from million for fiscal year  primarily due to the consolidation of bristow norway million  increases in reimbursable costs  a bad debt provision of million for a customer that went into receivership  a million impairment charge for obsolete inventory  fuel costs which are generally rebilled to our customers  allocations of overhead costs  depreciation resulting from changes in the mix of aircraft  pension costs and other costs including training  freight and travel  partially offset by the impact of exchange rate changes  reduced third party lease expense and search and rescue work costs 
additionally during fiscal year  costs for europe benefited from a shift of certain costs to eh centralized operations 
as a result of the loss of the higher margin search and rescue contract and the consolidation of bristow norway which earned lower operating margins than the remainder of the europe business unit  operating margin for europe decreased to for fiscal year from for fiscal year on october   we acquired the remaining interest in bristow norway from the other bristow norway shareholders in exchange for our ownership interest in bristow norway s subsidiary  lufttransport as  plus million of cash 
simultaneously with the acquisition  we recapitalized bristow norway by contributing million in equity which bristow norway used to repay a portion of its debt 
we now own of bristow norway  and we consolidate this entity effective october   including million of remaining debt as of march  bristow norway generated million of revenue and million of operating income in excess of that earned under what are now intercompany leases during the period from october  to march  revenue from intercompany leasing has been eliminated in consolidation beginning october  under our contract in the north sea with integrated aviation consortium for the provision of helicopter transportation services to offshore facilities both east and west of the shetland islands six new sikorsky s helicopters replaced six asl super puma helicopters 
these aircraft were delivered in fiscal year  five went into service in fiscal year and the sixth went into service in early fiscal year in july  bristow norway was awarded a new contract by statoilhydro asa and eni norge as that we expect to commence on june  the total value of the contract is approximately billion norwegian kroner million  including option periods 
the contract has a duration of six years plus three one year options and requires two new  large helicopters which will perform crew change services and hour search and rescue services 
during fiscal year  we completed negotiations with unions representing our pilots and engineers in the uk new labor rates were effective for ground staff retroactive to july  and expire june  annual labor rates for ground staff will increase in the first year and in each of the second and third years 
new labor rates for pilots were effective on september  and expire august  pilots will receive annual labor rate escalations of in the first year and the higher of or the retail price index in each of the second and third years 
through our agreed escalation clauses in our commercial contracts  we anticipate increasing the rates we charge customers to recover this and other cost increases 
we have begun to integrate bristow norway into our europe business unit  including administrative and operating activities 
the future operating results and operating margins for europe  including bristow norway  are expected to improve from this integration as well as a result of the new contract discussed above  partially offset by increased labor costs under the three union agreements 
west africa gross revenue for west africa increased to million for fiscal year from million for fiscal year  primarily as a result of increased rates under our contracts with major customers in nigeria and a general increase in flight activity in this market over fiscal year resulting from new contracts and additional ad hoc flying 
operating expense for west africa increased to million for fiscal year from million for fiscal year the increase was primarily a result of increases in various operating expenses  including freight  training and travel  and increased local taxes in fiscal year  partially offset by decreases in maintenance costs and salaries and benefits 
during fiscal year  we reversed million in accruals for sales tax contingency items in nigeria 
the tax contingency items reversed included million associated with sales taxes and million associated with employee taxes 
compensation in fiscal year included approximately million in costs incurred for staff redundancies 
operating margin for west africa increased to for fiscal year from for fiscal year  primarily as a result of the increase in rates 
excluding the reversal of the accrual for the tax contingency items  our operating margin for fiscal year would have been 
additionally  changes in exchange rates in fiscal year resulted in a decrease in operating expense 
excluding the impact of exchange rate changes  operating margin would have been for fiscal year 
table of contents the annual contract negotiations with the unions in nigeria were concluded in december we came to an agreement with the junior and senior staff union on a pay increase from april  to march  we experience periodic disruption to our operations related to civil unrest and violence 
these factors have made and are expected to continue to make our operating results from nigeria unpredictable 
southeast asia gross revenue for southeast asia increased to million in fiscal year from million for fiscal year  due to higher revenue in both australia and malaysia  partially offset by the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
australia s flight activity and revenue increased and  respectively  from fiscal year  primarily due to the addition of aircraft to this market and rate increases since fiscal year malaysia s revenue increased by million as a result of the addition of aircraft since fiscal year although higher than fiscal year  revenue in australia was lower than expected  as a portion of our fleet did not generate revenue during fiscal year  due to delays in planned contracts  unscheduled maintenance and re positioning of aircraft 
operating expense increased to million for fiscal year from million for fiscal year as a result of costs associated with the increase in activity from fiscal year  partially offset by the impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
operating expense increased more than revenue during fiscal year as a result of salary  maintenance and other costs incurred in connection with aircraft that were not fully operational during fiscal year as a result of delays in planned contracts  unscheduled maintenance and re positioning of aircraft 
increased compensation costs resulting from compensation increases beginning in may under a new collective bargaining agreement with the pilot s union in australia 
increased fuel prices 
additionally  fiscal year included million in costs associated with local tax matters  retroactive compensation increases and one time costs associated with introducing new aircraft into australia and re positioning of aircraft within this business unit 
as a result of the increase in costs coupled with a portion of our fleet not generating revenue during fiscal year  the operating margin in southeast asia decreased to for fiscal year from for fiscal year excluding the additional million in non recurring costs discussed above  operating margin would have been in fiscal year other international gross revenue for other international increased to million for fiscal year from million for fiscal year  primarily due to increased revenue in russia which primarily resulted from million in escalation charges agreed to by a customer in russia in fiscal year and increased rates  ghana as a result of a new short term contract  libya re entry into the market  turkmenistan as a result of a new short term contract and mauritania increased flight hours  partially offset by decreased revenue from aircraft leases to our unconsolidated affiliate in egypt which resulted from the operation of two less aircraft by the end of fiscal year 
operating expense decreased to million for fiscal year from million for fiscal year the decrease in operating expense is due to a reduction in activities in egypt and the impact of changes in exchange rates in fiscal year additionally  fiscal year included million in costs related to a claim by a former agent whom we terminated in connection with the internal review and million in additional expense related to amortization of an intangible asset related to an acquisition in russia

proposals have recently been put forth in the us which  if enacted into law  would significantly reform the us taxation of us based multinational businesses such as ours 
these proposals include  but are not limited to  reforming the foreign tax credit rules which would have the likely effect of reducing the foreign tax credit available to offset us income tax and increase the double taxation of foreign earnings  limiting the deductibility of expenses to the extent the deductions are deemed related to the production of certain non us income and restricting some of the flexibility of structuring foreign operations that is part of the current us tax regulations

table of contents liquidity and capital resources financial condition and sources of liquidity cash and cash equivalents were million and million as of march  and  respectively 
working capital as of march  and was million and million  respectively 
working capital  as well as cash and cash equivalents  remained relatively flat when comparing march  to march  however  during fiscal year  we generated cash primarily as a result of an increase in cash and cash equivalents resulting from operating cash flows  proceeds from the sale of assets  the issuance of the convertible senior notes and the common stock in june  which were offset by capital expenditures for aircraft and other equipment 
march  in thousands capital structure senior notes due senior notes due convertible senior notes due other debt total debt stockholders investment total capital liquidity cash undrawn borrowing capacity on revolving credit facility we assess our liquidity in terms of our ability to generate cash from operations to fund our investing and financing activities 
while our principal source of liquidity for the past three years has been financing cash flows which we have used to fund our fleet renewal program  we have also generated significant operating cash flows 
we maintain a conservative capital structure to provide financial flexibility 
accordingly  over the past three years we have raised billion of capital in a mix of debt and equity with both public and private financings 
during this same period we have spent billion on capital expenditures to grow our business 
in addition  other significant factors that affect our overall management of liquidity include capital expenditure commitments  pension funding  operating leases  adequacy of available bank lines of credit and ability to attract long term capital at satisfactory terms 
recent distress in the financial markets has had an adverse impact on financial market activities including  among other things  extreme volatility in security prices  severely diminished liquidity and credit availability  rating downgrades of certain investments and declining valuations of others 
one of our unconsolidated affiliates has been unable to secure financing and we have seen a decline in the demand for helicopter services  primarily in the exploration and development sector  with more limited declines in the production sector 
we have assessed the implications of these factors on our current business and are continuing to closely monitor the impact on our customers and suppliers 
our pension plans have not experienced any significant impact on liquidity or counterparty exposure due to the volatility in the credit markets 
however  the volatility and downturn in the financial markets has caused an approximate decline in the market value of the uk pension plan assets from march  to march  we are monitoring and evaluating the uk and bristow norway pension plans investments  obligation and funding rate to determine if any changes are appropriate 
we issued million of convertible senior notes and  shares of common stock in a public offering and private placement in june we expect that our cash on deposit as of march  of million and million borrowing capacity under our revolving credit facility will be sufficient to satisfy our remaining aircraft purchase commitments of million as of march  additionally  we expect such available liquidity will be sufficient to fund acquisition opportunities currently be considered in the near term  although we cannot predict the likelihood of completing  or the timing of  any such transactions 
the cash we expect to generate from future operations and sales of aircraft provide us with additional liquidity 
we plan to continue to be disciplined in our capital commitment program  including preserving liquidity and continuing to pre finance capital expenditures which includes an estimate of future cash flow 
therefore  we do not foresee an immediate need to raise capital through new financings 
nevertheless  we cannot predict the continued effects of market volatility  and we could experience a significant impact to our liquidity  financial position or results of operations as a result of the global financial crisis and economic downturn in the future

see further discussion of outstanding debt as of march  and our debt issuances and redemptions in note in the notes to consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report 
preferred stock annual cumulative cash dividends of per share of preferred stock are payable quarterly on the fifteenth day of each march  june  september and december 
if declared  dividends on the  shares of preferred stock would be million on each quarterly payment date through the conversion date on september  unless converted earlier pursuant to their terms  on september   the preferred stock will convert into common stock based on specified conversion rates 
for further discussion of the terms and conditions of the preferred stock  see note in the notes to consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report 
future cash requirements debt obligations total debt as of march  was million  of which million was classified as current 
our significant debt maturities relate to our million of senior notes  million of senior notes and million of convertible senior notes  which mature in  and  respectively 
see further discussion of outstanding debt as of march  and our debt issuances and our debt redemptions in note in the notes to consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report 
other obligations pension plan as of march   we had recorded on our balance sheet a million pension liability related to the bristow helicopters group limited bristow helicopters  a wholly owned subsidiary of bristow aviation pension plan 
the liability represents the excess of the present value of the defined benefit pension plan liabilities over the fair value of plan assets that existed at that date 
the minimum funding rules of the uk require us to make scheduled contributions in amounts sufficient to bring the plan up to funded as defined by uk legislation within three years and funded within years 
in order to meet our funding requirements  we increased the contributions to the plans to million million per year beginning in fiscal year and continuing in fiscal year we pre funded the fiscal year employee contributions for the uk pension plan in march for million 
nevertheless  regulatory agencies in the uk may require us to further increase the contributions 

table of contents contractual obligations  commercial commitments and off balance sheet arrangements we have various contractual obligations which are recorded as liabilities in our consolidated financial statements 
other items  such as certain purchase commitments  interest payments and other executory contracts are not recognized as liabilities in our consolidated financial statements but are included in the table below 
for example  we are contractually committed to make certain minimum lease payments for the use of property and equipment under operating lease agreements 
the following tables summarize our significant contractual obligations and other commercial commitments on an undiscounted basis as of march  and the future periods in which such obligations are expected to be settled in cash 
in addition  the table reflects the timing of principal and interest payments on outstanding borrowings 
additional details regarding these obligations are provided in the notes to consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report payments due by period fiscal year ending march  total and beyond other in thousands contractual obligations long term debt and short term borrowings principal interest aircraft operating leases other operating leases pension obligations aircraft purchase obligations other purchase obligations tax reserves total contractual cash obligations other commercial commitments debt guarantees other guarantees letters of credit other commitments total commercial commitments excludes unamortized premium on the senior notes of million 
primarily represents separate operating leases for nine aircraft with a subsidiary of general electric capital corporation with terms of fifteen years expiring in august see note in the notes to consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report 
represents minimum rental payments required under operating leases that have initial or remaining non cancelable lease terms in excess of one year 

table of contents represents expected funding for pension benefits in future periods 
these amounts are undiscounted and are based on the expectation that both the uk and norway pensions will be fully funded in approximately ten years 
as of march   we had recorded on our balance sheet a million pension liability associated with these obligations 
also  the timing of the funding is dependent on actuarial valuations and resulting negotiations with the plan trustees 
for further details on our aircraft purchase obligations  see note in the notes to consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report 
other purchase obligations primarily represent unfilled purchase orders for aircraft parts  commitments associated with upgrading facilities at our bases and amounts committed under a supply agreement 
see note in the notes to consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report 
represents gross unrecognized benefits in connection with uncertain tax positions that may result in cash payments being made to certain tax authorities 
we are not able to reasonably estimate in which future periods this amount will ultimately be settled and paid 
we have guaranteed the repayment of up to million million of the debt of fbs  an unconsolidated affiliates 
relates to an indemnity agreement between us and afianzadora sofimex  sa to support issuance of surety bonds on behalf of heliservicio from time to time 
as of march   surety bonds denominated in mexican pesos with an aggregate value of million mexican pesos million and surety bonds denominated in us dollars with an aggregate value of million were outstanding 
furthermore  we have received a counter guarantee from cic  our partner in heliservicio  for million of the surety bonds outstanding 
in connection with the bristow norway acquisition see part i 
item i 
business overview included elsewhere in this annual report  we granted the former partner in this joint venture an option that if exercised would require us to acquire up to five aircraft from them at fair value upon the expiration of the lease terms for such aircraft 
two of these aircraft are not currently operated by bristow norway  but our former partner has agreed to purchase the aircraft and lease the aircraft to bristow norway for an initial period of five years  with three one year options for extension  as soon as practicable 
the existing three aircraft leases expire in june  december and august we do not expect the guarantees shown in the table above to become obligations that we will have to fund 
exposure to currency fluctuations see our discussion of the impact of market risk  including our exposure to currency fluctuations  on our financial position and results of operations discussed under item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk included elsewhere in this annual report 
critical accounting policies and estimates our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the us in many cases  the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by generally accepted accounting principles  whereas  in other circumstances  generally accepted accounting principles require us to make estimates  judgments and assumptions that we believe are reasonable based upon information available 
we base our estimates and judgments on historical experience  professional advice and various other sources that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions and conditions 
we believe that of our significant accounting policies  as discussed in note in the notes to consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report  the following involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity 
our management has discussed the development and selection of critical accounting policies and estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors and the audit committee has reviewed our disclosure 
taxes our annual tax provision is based on expected taxable income  statutory rates and tax planning opportunities available to us in the various jurisdictions in which we operate 
the determination and evaluation of our annual tax provision and tax positions involves the interpretation of the tax laws in the various jurisdictions in which we operate and requires significant judgment and the use of estimates and assumptions regarding significant future events such as the amount  timing and character of income  deductions and tax credits 
changes in tax laws  regulations  agreements  and treaties  foreign currency exchange restrictions or our level of operations or profitability in each jurisdiction would impact our tax liability in any given year 
we also operate in many jurisdictions where the tax laws relating to the offshore oilfield service industry are not well developed 
while our annual tax provision is based on the best information available at the time  a number of years may elapse before the ultimate tax liabilities in the various jurisdictions are determined 

table of contents we recognize foreign tax credits available to us to offset the us income taxes due on income earned from foreign sources 
these credits are limited by the total income tax on the us income tax return as well as by the ratio of foreign source income in each statutory category to total income 
in estimating the amount of foreign tax credits that are realizable  we estimate future taxable income in each statutory category 
these estimates are subject to change based on changes in the market conditions in each statutory category and the timing of certain deductions available to us in each statutory category 
we periodically reassess these estimates and record changes to the amount of realizable foreign tax credits based on these revised estimates 
changes to the amount of realizable foreign tax credits can be significant given any material change to our estimates on which the realizability of foreign tax credits is based 
we maintain reserves for estimated tax exposures in jurisdictions of operation  including reserves for income  value added  sales and payroll taxes 
the expenses reported for these taxes  including our annual tax provision  include the effect of reserve provisions and changes to reserves that we consider appropriate  as well as related interest 
tax exposure items primarily include potential challenges to intercompany pricing  disposition transactions and the applicability or rate of various withholding taxes 
these exposures are resolved primarily through the settlement of audits within these tax jurisdictions or by judicial means  but can also be affected by changes in applicable tax law or other factors  which could cause us to conclude that a revision of past estimates is appropriate 
we believe that an appropriate liability has been established for estimated exposures 
however  actual results may differ materially from these estimates 
we review these liabilities quarterly 
during fiscal year  we had net accruals of reserves for estimated income tax exposures of million 
during fiscal years and  we had net reversals of reserves for estimated income tax exposures of million and million  respectively 
these reversals were made in the periods in which the statute of limitations for the related exposures expired 
we recognize interest and penalties accrued related to unrecognized tax benefits as a component of income tax expense 
as of march  and  we had million and million  respectively  of unrecognized tax benefits  all of which would have an impact on our effective tax rate  if recognized 
we do not believe it is possible to reasonably estimate the potential effect of changes to the assumptions and estimates identified because the resulting change to our tax liability  if any  is dependent on numerous factors which cannot be reasonably estimated 
these include  among others  the amount and nature of additional taxes potentially asserted by local tax authorities  the willingness of local tax authorities to negotiate a fair settlement through an administrative process  the impartiality of the local courts  and the potential for changes in the tax paid to one country to either produce  or fail to produce  an offsetting tax change in other countries 
our experience has been that the estimates and assumptions we have used to provide for future tax assessments have proven to be appropriate 
however  past experience is only a guide and the potential exists that the tax resulting from the resolution of current and potential future tax controversies may differ materially from the amounts accrued 
judgment is required in determining whether deferred tax assets will be realized in full or in part 
when it is estimated to be more likely than not that all or some portion of specific deferred tax assets  such as foreign tax credit carryovers or net operating loss carry forwards  will not be realized  a valuation allowance must be established for the amount of the deferred tax assets that are estimated to not be realizable 
as of march   our valuation allowance against certain deferred tax assets  primarily us foreign tax credit carry forwards  was million 
we decreased the valuation allowance as of march  to million 
if our facts or financial results were to change  thereby impacting the likelihood of realizing the deferred tax assets  judgment would have to be applied to determine changes to the amount of the valuation allowance in any given period 
such changes could result in either a decrease or an increase in our provision for income taxes  depending on whether the change in judgment resulted in an increase or a decrease to the valuation allowance 
we continually evaluate strategies that could allow for the future utilization of our deferred tax assets 
we have not provided for us deferred taxes on the unremitted earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries as of march  that are indefinitely reinvested abroad of million 
should we make a distribution from the unremitted earnings of these subsidiaries  we could be required to record additional taxes 
at the current time  a determination of the amount of unrecognized deferred tax liability is not practical 
we have not provided for deferred taxes in circumstances where we expect that  due to the structure of operations and applicable law  the operations in such jurisdictions will not give rise to future tax consequences 
should our expectations change regarding the expected future tax consequences  we may be required to record additional deferred taxes that could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position  results of operations and cash flows 

table of contents property and equipment our net property and equipment represents percent of our total assets as of march  we determine the carrying value of these assets based on our property and equipment accounting policies  which incorporate our estimates  assumptions  and judgments relative to capitalized costs  useful lives and salvage values of our assets 
our property and equipment accounting policies are also designed to depreciate our assets over their estimated useful lives 
the assumptions and judgments we use in determining the estimated useful lives and residual values of our aircraft reflect both historical experience and expectations regarding future operations  utilization and performance of our assets 
the use of different estimates  assumptions and judgments in the establishment of property and equipment accounting policies  especially those involving the useful lives and residual values of our aircraft  would likely result in materially different net book values of our assets and results of operations 
useful lives of aircraft and residual values are difficult to estimate due to a variety of factors  including changes in operating conditions or environment  the introduction of technological advances in aviation equipment  changes in market or economic conditions including changes in demand for certain types of aircraft and changes in laws or regulations affecting the aviation or offshore oil and gas industry 
we evaluate the remaining useful lives of our aircraft when certain events occur that directly impact our assessment of the remaining useful lives of the aircraft 
we review our property and equipment for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of such assets or asset groups may be impaired or when reclassifications are made between property and equipment and assets held for sale 
asset impairment evaluations are based on estimated undiscounted cash flows for the assets being evaluated 
if the sum of the expected future cash flows is less than the carrying amount of the asset  we would be required to recognize an impairment loss 
when determining fair value  we utilize various assumptions  including projections of future cash flows 
a change in these underlying assumptions will cause a change in the results of the tests and  as such  could cause fair value to be less than the carrying amounts 
in such event  we would then be required to record a corresponding charge  which would reduce our earnings 
we continue to evaluate our estimates and assumptions and believe that our assumptions  which include an estimate of future cash flows based upon the anticipated performance of the underlying business units  are appropriate 
supply and demand are the key drivers of aircraft idle time and our ability to contract our aircraft at economical rates 
during periods of oversupply  it is not uncommon for us to have aircraft idled for extended periods of time  which could be an indication that an asset group may be impaired 
in most instances our aircraft could be used interchangeably 
in addition  our aircraft are generally equipped to operate throughout the world 
because our aircraft are mobile  we may move aircraft from a weak geographic market to a stronger geographic market if an adequate opportunity arises to do so 
as such  our aircraft are considered to be interchangeable within classes or asset groups and accordingly  our impairment evaluation is made by asset group 
additionally  our management periodically makes strategic decisions related to our fleet that involve the possible removal of all or a substantial portion of specific aircraft types from our fleet  at which time these aircraft are reclassified to held for sale and subsequently sold or otherwise disposed of 
an impairment loss is recorded in the period in which it is determined that the aggregate carrying amount of assets within an asset group is not recoverable 
this requires us to make judgments regarding long term forecasts of future revenue and cost related to the assets subject to review 
in turn  these forecasts are uncertain in that they require assumptions about demand for our services  future market conditions and technological developments 
significant and unanticipated changes to these assumptions could require a provision for impairment in a future period 
given the nature of these evaluations and their application to specific asset groups and specific times  it is not possible to reasonably quantify the impact of changes in these assumptions 
pension benefits pension obligations are actuarially determined and are affected by assumptions including expected return on plan assets  discount rates  compensation increases and employee turnover rates 
we evaluate our assumptions periodically and make adjustments to these assumptions and the recorded liabilities as necessary 
three of the most critical assumptions are the expected long term rate of return on plan assets  the assumed discount rate and the mortality rate 
we evaluate our assumptions regarding the estimated long term rate of return on plan assets based on historical experience and future expectations on investment returns  which are calculated by our third party investment advisor utilizing the asset allocation classes held by the plan s portfolios 
we utilize a british pound sterling denominated aa corporate bond index as a basis for determining the discount rate for our uk plans 
we base mortality rates utilized on actuarial research on these rates  which are adjusted to allow for expected mortality within our industry segment 
changes in these and other assumptions used in the actuarial computations could impact our projected benefit obligations  pension liabilities  pension expense and other comprehensive income 
we base our determination of pension expense on a market related valuation of assets that reduces year to year volatility 
this market related valuation recognizes investment gains or losses over the average remaining lifetime of the plan members 
investment gains or losses for this purpose are the difference between the expected return calculated using the market related value of assets and the actual return based on the market related value of assets 

table of contents allowance for doubtful accounts we establish reserves for doubtful accounts on a case by case basis when we believe the payment of amounts owed to us is unlikely to occur 
in establishing these reserves  we consider a number of factors  including our historical experience  changes in our customer s financial position and restrictions placed on the conversion of local currency to us dollars  as well as disputes with customers regarding the application of contract provisions to our services 
we derive a significant portion of our revenue from services to major integrated oil and gas companies and government owned or government controlled oil and gas companies 
our receivables are concentrated in certain oil producing countries 
we generally do not require collateral or other security to support client receivables 
if the financial condition of our clients was to deteriorate or their access to freely convertible currency was restricted  resulting in impairment of their ability to make the required payments  additional allowances may be required 
inventory reserve we maintain inventory that primarily consists of spare parts to service our aircraft 
we periodically review the condition and continuing usefulness of the parts to determine whether the realizable value of this inventory is lower than its book value 
parts related to aircraft types that our management has determined will no longer be included in our fleet or will be substantially reduced in our fleet in future periods are specifically reviewed 
if our valuation of these parts is significantly lower than the book value of the parts  an additional provision may be required 
contingent liabilities we establish reserves for estimated loss contingencies when we believe a loss is probable and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated 
our contingent liability reserves relate primarily to potential tax assessments  litigation  personal injury claims and environmental liabilities 
income for each reporting period includes revisions to contingent liability reserves resulting from different facts or information which becomes known or circumstances which change and affect our previous assumptions with respect to the likelihood or amount of loss 
such revisions are based on information which becomes known or circumstances that change after the reporting date for the previous period through the reporting date of the current period 
reserves for contingent liabilities are based upon our assumptions and estimates regarding the probable outcome of the matter 
should the outcome differ from our assumptions and estimates or other events result in a material adjustment to the accrued estimated reserves  revisions to the estimated reserves for contingent liabilities would be required to be recognized 
goodwill impairment we perform a test for impairment of our goodwill annually as of march and whenever events or circumstances indicate impairment may have occurred 
because our business is cyclical in nature  goodwill could be significantly impaired depending on when the assessment is performed in the business cycle 
the fair value of our reporting units is based on a blend of estimated discounted cash flows  publicly traded company multiples and acquisition multiples 
the assessments are based in part on assumptions regarding the demand for helicopter services  the necessity for training of new pilots bristow academy only and current market values for similar business and involve the use of a discounted cash flow model utilizing estimated future earnings and cash flows and the company s weighted average cost of capital 
publicly traded company multiples and acquisition multiples are derived from information on traded shares and analysis of recent acquisitions in the marketplace  respectively  for companies with operations similar to ours 
changes in the assumptions used in the fair value calculation could result in an estimated reporting unit fair value that is below the carrying value  which may give rise to an impairment of goodwill 

table of contents stock based compensation we have historically compensated our directors  executives and certain employees by awarding stock based compensation  including stock options and restricted stock units 
we use a black scholes option pricing model to estimate the fair value of share based awards 
the black scholes option pricing model incorporates various assumptions  including the risk free interest rate  volatility  dividend yield and the expected term of the options  in order to determine the fair value of the options on the date of grant 
judgment is also required in estimating the amount of stock based awards that are expected to be forfeited 
additionally  the service period over which compensation expense associated with awards of restricted stock units are recorded in our consolidated statements of income involve certain assumptions as to the expected vesting of the restricted stock units  which is based on factors relating to the future performance of our stock 
as the determination of these various assumptions is subject to significant management judgment and different assumptions could result in material differences in amounts recorded in our consolidated financial statements  management believes that accounting estimates related to the valuation of stock options and the service period for restricted stock units are critical estimates 
the risk free interest rate is based on the us treasury yield curve in effect at the time of grant for a period equal to the expected term of the option 
expected volatilities are based on historical volatility of shares of our common stock  which has not been adjusted for any expectation of future volatility given uncertainty related to the future performance of our common stock at this time 
we also use historical data to estimate the expected term of the options within the option pricing model  separate groups of employees that have similar historical exercise behavior are considered separately for valuation purposes 
the expected term of the options represents the period of time that the options granted are expected to be outstanding

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are subject to certain market risks arising from the use of financial instruments in the ordinary course of business 
this risk arises primarily as a result of potential changes in the fair market value of financial instruments that would result from adverse fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates  credit risk and interest rates as discussed below 
the sensitivity analyses presented do not consider the effects that such adverse changes may have on overall economic activity  nor do they consider additional actions we may take to mitigate our exposure to such changes 
actual results may differ 
see the notes to our consolidated financial statements included in item of this annual report for a description of our accounting policies and other information related to these financial instruments 
foreign currency risk through our foreign operations  we are exposed to currency fluctuations and exchange rate risks 
the majority of our revenue and expense from our north sea operations are in british pound sterling 
approximately of our gross revenue for fiscal year was translated for financial reporting purposes from british pound sterling into us dollars 
in addition  some of our contracts to provide services internationally provide for payment in foreign currencies  such as australian dollars  euros  norwegian kroner  and trinidad and tobago dollars 
our foreign exchange rate risk is even greater when our revenue is denominated in a currency different from the associated costs 
we attempt to minimize our foreign exchange rate exposure by contracting the majority of our services other than our north sea operations in us dollars 
as a result  a strong us dollar may increase the local cost of our services that are provided under us dollar denominated contracts  which may reduce the demand for our services in foreign countries 
except as described below  we do not enter into hedging transactions to protect against foreign exchange risks related to our gross revenue 

table of contents throughout fiscal years  and  our primary foreign currency exposure has been to the euro  the british pound sterling and the australian dollar 
the value of these currencies has fluctuated relative to the us dollar as indicated in the following table fiscal year ended march  one british pound sterling into us dollars high average low at period end one euro into us dollars high average low at period end one australian dollar into us dollars high average low at period end source bank of england we estimate that the deterioration of these currencies had the following affect on our financial condition and results of operations  net of the effect of the derivative contracts discussed below in thousands fiscal year ended march  revenue operating expense non operating expense income from continuing operations before provision for income taxes and minority interest provision for income taxes net income cumulative translation adjustment total stockholders investment a hypothetical strengthening or weakening in the average us dollar relative to other currencies would have affected our revenue  operating income and income from continuing operations before provision for income taxes for fiscal year as follows euro british pound sterling australian dollar revenue operating expenses income from continuing operations before provision for income taxes and minority interest 
table of contents the effect of the hypothetical change in exchange rates ignores the effect this movement may have on other variables  including competitive risk 
if it were possible to quantify this competitive impact  the results would probably be different from the sensitivity effects shown above 
in addition  all currencies may not uniformly strengthen or weaken relative to the us dollar 
in reality  some currencies may weaken while others may strengthen 
in addition  certain of our contractual commitments  including aircraft purchase commitments  are payable in currencies other than the us dollar  which exposes us to cash flow risk during periods when the us dollar weakens against those currencies 
we entered into forward contracts in fiscal years and to mitigate our exposure to exchange rate fluctuations on our euro denominated aircraft purchase commitments  which have been designated as cash flow hedges for accounting purposes 
the open contracts as of march  have rates ranging from us dollars per euro to us dollars per euro 
the eight open contracts have an underlying nominal value of between  and  for a total of  with the first contract expiring in april and the last in january as of march   the fair value of the open forward contracts was a liability of million included in accrued liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet 
as of march   an unrecognized loss of million  net of tax  on the open foreign currency forward contracts is included as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss 
in the past three fiscal years  our stockholders investment has decreased by million as a result of translation adjustments 
changes in exchange rates could cause significant changes in our financial position and results of operations in the future 
as a result of the changes in exchange rates  we recorded foreign currency gains of approximately million and million  respectively  during fiscal years and compared to foreign currency transaction losses of approximately million during fiscal year  primarily related to the british pound sterling 
see fiscal year compared to fiscal year other income expense  net and fiscal year compared to fiscal year other income expense  net included elsewhere in this annual report for discussion of transaction gains and losses 
during fiscal year  we entered into participating forward derivative contracts to mitigate our exposure to exchange rate fluctuations on our euro denominated  third party maintenance contracts 
during the same period  we exercised six contracts for a total of  and we realized a total gain of million  which is included in direct costs on our consolidated statement of income 
we had no open participating forward derivative contracts as of march  a hypothetical decrease in the value of the foreign currencies in which our business is denominated relative to the us dollar as of march  would result in a million decrease in the fair value of our net monetary assets denominated in currencies other than us dollars 
credit risk the market for our services and products is primarily the offshore oil and gas industry  and our customers consist primarily of major integrated  international and independent oil and gas producers 
we perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers and have not historically required material collateral 
we maintain reserves for potential credit losses  and such losses have been within management s expectations 
cash equivalents  which consist of funds invested in highly liquid debt instruments with original maturities of days or less  are held by major banks or investment firms  and we believe that credit risk in these instruments is minimal 
we also manage our credit risk by not entering into complex financial transactions or those with a perceived high level of credit risk 
for more information on the impact of the global recession see executive overview market outlook and liquidity and capital resources financial condition and sources of liquidity included elsewhere in this annual report 
interest rate risk as of march   we have million of debt outstanding  million of which carries a variable rate of interest 
however  the market value of our fixed rate debt fluctuates with changes in interest rates 
the fair value of our fixed rate long term debt is estimated based on quoted market prices or prices quoted from third party financial institutions 
the estimated fair value of our total debt as of march  and was million and million  respectively  based on quoted market prices for the publicly listed senior notes  senior notes  convertible senior notes and the carrying value for all of our other debt  which approximates fair value 
if prevailing market interest rates had been higher as of march   and all other factors effecting our debt remained the same  the fair value of the senior notes  the senior notes and convertible senior notes would have decreased by million or 
under comparable sensitivity analysis as of march   the fair value of the senior notes and the senior notes would have decreased by million or
