overview paetec is a competitive communications services and solutions provider guided by the principle that delivering superior customer service is the key to competing successfully with other communications services providers 
paetec s primary business is providing large  medium sized and  to a lesser extent  small business end user customers in metropolitan areas with a package of integrated communications services that includes local and long distance voice  data  and broadband internet access services 
paetec holding had approximately  employees as of march  as of march   paetec holding had in service  digital t transmission lines  which represented the equivalent of  access lines  for approximately  business customers in a service area encompassing of the top metropolitan statistical areas 
to supplement its internal growth  paetec has pursued an acquisition strategy that has sought acquisition candidates that fulfill one or more of the following objectives to increase its penetration of existing markets  to expand into new markets  to augment the geographic scope of its network fiber based assets  primarily in high density markets  and to enhance its ability to sell and deliver value added services 
on february   paetec completed its business combination by merger with mcleodusa  which became a wholly owned subsidiary of paetec upon completion of the merger 
mcleodusa provides integrated communications services to small and medium sized enterprises  and  to a lesser extent  traditional telephone and internet access services to small business and residential customers 
in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards  or sfas  no 
 business combinations  the purchase price of the mcleodusa merger was allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their fair values as of the merger closing date  with the amounts exceeding the fair value being recorded as goodwill 
the process to identify and record the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed 
table of contents included an analysis of the acquired fixed assets  including real and personal property  various leases  contractual commitments and other business contracts  customer relationships  investments and contingencies 
the amounts allocated to property and equipment and intangible assets are preliminary as of december  and will be finalized in the first quarter of as a result  depreciation and amortization expense may differ significantly from amounts historically reported 
to fund its recent expansion through acquisitions  which began in february with the us lec merger and most recently included the acquisition of mcleodusa in february  paetec has increased its borrowings under a variety of debt arrangements 
in connection with its acquisition of us lec in  paetec obtained million principal amount of new senior secured credit facilities on february  and applied the proceeds of the facilities primarily to refinance or retire substantially all of the indebtedness of the two companies and to repurchase us lec s outstanding preferred stock 
in july  paetec amended its senior secured credit facilities and prepaid million principal amount of borrowings under those facilities with the proceeds of an offering of principal amount of its senior notes due and cash on hand 
in january  paetec obtained million principal amount of additional term loans under an incremental facility extended pursuant to its existing credit facilities agreement and applied a portion of the borrowings under that facility toward the redemption of all of mcleodusa s outstanding senior secured notes in connection with paetec s acquisition of mcleodusa 
in consideration of  among other matters  the adverse conditions in the credit markets and uncertainties concerning the timetable for a recovery of those markets  in october  paetec obtained million principal amount of revolving loans by a drawdown under its existing revolving credit facility 
paetec will use the proceeds of the revolving loans for capital expenditures  working capital and other general corporate purposes  including potential repurchases of common stock under its program to repurchase up to million of common stock through august trends affecting our business general economic slowdown 
adverse conditions in the economy  which have significantly reduced the availability of corporate credit  are increasingly affecting the global financial system and equity markets 
these conditions and other factors have contributed to a slowdown of business activity across a broad range of industries 
paetec believes that the financial and economic pressures faced by its business customers in this environment of diminished consumer spending  corporate downsizing and tightened credit have had  and may continue to have  an adverse effect on billable minutes of use and on customer attrition rates  and have resulted in and may continue to result in increased customer demands for price reductions in connection with contract renewals 
in addition  as a result of the current conditions  paetec s ability to access the debt and equity markets may be restricted at a time when it would like  or need  to access such markets  which could have an adverse effect on paetec s flexibility to react to changing economic and business conditions 
the disruptions in the financial markets have had  and may continue to have  an adverse effect on the market value of paetec s common stock  which could make it more difficult or costly for the company to raise capital through an offering of its equity securities 
shifting patterns of use and convergence of technology 
as telecommunications customers increasingly use wireless forms of communication  such as hand held internet access devices and cell phones  the volume of traffic carried by traditional wireline telecommunications networks has declined and is expected to continue to decline 
although we believe this trend is most pronounced in the residential marketplace  wireless substitution also has had an adverse effect on the wireline usage patterns of the medium sized and large businesses and institutions we target 
we believe wireless substitution has led to a decrease in the average minutes of use generated by our customers 
to date  we have been able to offset this loss of revenue from existing customers through sales of services to new customers 
we believe that the transition to wireless based forms of communication will continue in the foreseeable future 
we seek to respond to this trend by offering service levels and product packages that are not currently available using wireless alternatives 

table of contents additionally  voice and data traffic historically have traveled over telecommunications networks using incompatible transmission formats 
this means that a telecommunications transmission circuit had to be designated to carry either data traffic or voice traffic 
as a result  excess capacity on a voice circuit could not be made available to reduce demand on a data circuit 
recent technologies that allow voice and data traffic to travel interchangeably over the same network  commonly known as voice over internet protocol  or voip  technology  enables more efficient use of the telecommunications networks 
because we lease the majority of our transmission capacity  this increased efficiency has the potential to reduce significantly our cost of providing services to our customers 
we continue to install equipment and transition our network to take advantage of these new technologies 
we believe that  in operating a network using both traditional voice and newer voip technology  paetec is one of the leading competitive carriers in pursuing the benefits of technological convergence 
the combination of shifting patterns of use and increasing convergence of voice and data traffic could make it harder for us to sustain and improve our operating margins over the next several years 
we believe that the challenges these trends may present will be offset in part by the efficiencies of operating a data network to which we will increasingly transition our traditional voice services 
recent growth of paetec 
paetec primarily targets large  medium sized and  to a lesser extent  small business end user customers in providing a package of integrated communications services 
over the course of its recent merger transactions  paetec has acquired some customers and products that would not be considered consistent with paetec s traditional operating focus 
as paetec looks to increase its operating leverage  we anticipate that we may choose not to enhance offerings to some customers or renew some customer relationships 
such actions may impact the rate of our future revenue growth compared to historical trends 
competition  evolving regulatory environment  industry consolidation 
the telecommunications industry has remained highly competitive in an environment marked by increased deregulation 
market forces and changes in government regulations have required  and may continue to require  us to reduce rates for some of the services we provide 
these trends may reduce our historical rate of revenue growth and continue to exert pressure on our operating margins 
we believe that the relatively long term nature of our agreements with customers of our network services  which have an average initial term of months  should reduce the likelihood that we will experience significant  rapid decreases in the rates we charge for our services 
mergers involving the rbocs and deregulatory activity favoring rbocs at both federal and state levels over the past several years have made it more difficult to compete against these larger  financially stronger competitors 
new regulatory changes that would permit incumbent carriers to materially increase rates charged for accessing last mile connections or reduce paetec s rates for certain network services could make it more difficult for the company to remain competitive 
our industry has experienced a significant amount of consolidation in recent periods 
merger and acquisition transactions have created more significant competitors for paetec and have reduced the number of vendors from which paetec may purchase network elements it leverages to operate its business 
we expect this trend to continue in the near future 
to compete more effectively in our industry  we plan to continue pursuing our historical acquisition strategy to increase our operating leverage  achieve economies of scale and broaden our name recognition 
financial difficulties faced by many competitive communications carriers 
over the last five years  many competitive communications services providers have experienced financial difficulties 
these difficulties have led to the general perception that the competitive carrier sector of our industry is marred by instability and financial weakness 
this perception makes it harder for us to gain new customers  raise additional capital and negotiate with our vendors 
we have addressed this perception by maintaining cash balances that are generally in excess of our current needs and by limiting our growth activities so that we do not impair our short term cash flow 

table of contents revenue paetec derives revenue from sales of its network services  carrier services and integrated solutions services 
paetec derives most of its revenue from monthly recurring fees and usage based fees that are generated principally by sales of its network services 
monthly recurring fees include the fees paid by paetec s customers for lines in service and additional features on those lines 
paetec primarily bills monthly recurring fees in advance 
usage based fees consist of fees paid by paetec s network services customers for each call made  fees paid by the incumbent carriers in paetec s markets as reciprocal compensation when paetec terminates local calls made by their customers  and access fees paid by other carriers for long distance calls paetec originates or terminates for those carriers 
the monthly recurring fees and usage based fees generated by sales of paetec s network services to end users and carrier services to any customer tend to be relatively consistent from month to month  subject to changes in the calling patterns of the customer s business 
these fees generally are based on the number of digital t transmission lines used by the customer 
because paetec believes that the cumulative number of digital t transmission lines in service provides accurate information with respect to its future revenue  the company uses data with respect to the cumulative number of digital t transmission lines paetec has in service from period to period to assist it in evaluating revenue trends related to its network services and carrier services businesses 
network services 
paetec delivers integrated communications services  including local services  long distance services and data and internet services  to end users on a retail basis  which the company refers to as its network services 
revenue from network services represented approximately of paetec s total revenue for  of paetec s total revenue for and of paetec s total revenue for paetec s network services revenue consists primarily of monthly recurring fees and usage based fees 
in addition to usage based fees invoiced directly to the end user customers  usage based fees for paetec s network services include the interstate and intrastate access fees the company receives from other communications providers when it originates or terminates long distance calls for those other providers to or from paetec s network services customers  and the reciprocal compensation fees paetec receives from some other local carriers when it terminates local calls made by the customers of the other local carriers 
paetec recognizes revenue during the period in which the revenue is earned 
paetec s network services also generate non recurring service activation and installation fee revenues  which it receives upon initiation of service 
paetec defers recognition of these revenues and amortizes them over the average contractual life  which is primarily three years 
carrier services 
paetec generates revenue from wholesale sales of communications services to other communications businesses  which the company refers to as its carrier services 
revenue from carrier services represented approximately of paetec s total revenue for  of paetec s total revenue for and of paetec s total revenue for paetec s carrier services revenue consists primarily of monthly recurring fees and usage based fees 
usage based fees for paetec s carrier services consist primarily of the interstate and intrastate access fees the company receives from other communications providers when it originates or terminates long distance calls for those other providers to or from paetec s carrier services customers  and the reciprocal compensation fees paetec receives from some other local carriers when it terminates to its carrier services customers local calls made by customers of other local carriers 
access fee and reciprocal compensation revenue generated by network services and carrier services 
paetec generates access fees when paetec s switching facilities provide a connection between a long distance carrier and an end user 
in accordance with a may order by the fcc  paetec has designed its interstate access rates to equal the interstate access rates charged by the competing incumbent carrier for functionally equivalent access services  including all applicable fixed and traffic sensitive charges 
in the may 
table of contents order  the fcc announced a new rule that limits the interstate access fees competitive carriers like paetec are able to collect from a long distance carrier in situations where the competitive carriers do not provide service directly to the end user 
this rule specifically targeted traffic that competitive carriers handle for wireless carriers and provided that competitive carriers could charge no more than incumbent carriers for these services 
state regulatory commissions historically have regulated the intrastate access rates imposed by incumbent carriers  but many states had subjected the intrastate access rates of competitive carriers to significantly less regulation 
some states in paetec s geographic markets also require a competitive carrier to mirror the intrastate access rates of the incumbent carrier in that state or interstate rate levels 
california and virginia recently adopted requirements requiring competitive carriers progressively to reduce their intrastate access rates over a limited period 
other state regulatory commissions have begun proceedings to investigate intrastate access rates of competitive carriers 
those proceedings may result in a change to the rates paetec assesses long distance carriers for use of the company s in state networks 
further  if enacted  legislation pending in some states would require state agencies to order reductions in competitive carrier access charges 
both the fcc and state regulatory commissions continue to review rules regarding the compensation local carriers pay to other local carriers for termination of local telephone calls as reciprocal compensation 
rates and terms for reciprocal compensation are based on agreements between paetec and other local carriers and are supported by federal and state regulatory and judicial rulings 
the company is engaged in continuing discussions with large incumbent carriers  among others  to perpetuate its contractual arrangements for reciprocal compensation in relevant service territories 
paetec has agreements in place with an increasing number of other local providers  including qwest in its region  that require such termination services to be provided on a bill and keep basis in which neither carrier charges the other for terminating local calls 
reciprocal compensation constituted of paetec s total revenue for  of paetec s total revenue for and of paetec s total revenue for most of paetec s reciprocal compensation for these periods was generated by paetec s carrier services 
as described in business regulation  all forms of intercarrier compensation  including exchange access and reciprocal compensation  currently are the subject of a generic proceeding at the fcc designed to reform the way carriers and providers pay other carriers and providers for use of their respective networks 
total access fee revenue and reciprocal compensation attributable to both network services and carrier services customers represented approximately of paetec s total revenue for  of paetec s total revenue for and of paetec s total revenue for access fee revenue and reciprocal compensation  as a percentage of carrier services revenue  decreased to in and to in from in access fee revenue and reciprocal compensation accounted for of paetec s network services revenue for  and the decreasing contribution of access fee revenue and reciprocal compensation to paetec s operating results over this three year period was principally due to a shift in product mix 
integrated solutions 
paetec derives revenue from sales to retail end user customers of telecommunications equipment and software and related services  which the company refers to as its integrated solutions 
revenue from these integrated solutions represented approximately of paetec s total revenue for  of paetec s total revenue for and of paetec s total revenue for a portion of paetec s integrated solutions revenue consists of fees its customers pay for equipment and for paetec s system design and installation services 
paetec recognizes revenue for equipment sales and system design and installation services upon delivery and acceptance of the underlying equipment 
paetec derives an additional component of its integrated solutions revenue by selling and supporting its proprietary telecommunications software 
paetec recognizes revenue related to software sales upon delivery of the software 
support fees include fees for maintenance of paetec s telecommunications software and fees for 
table of contents training the end user in the proper use of that software 
paetec recognizes maintenance fees on a pro rata basis over the length of the underlying maintenance contract and training fees after it fulfills the training obligation 
cost of sales paetec provides its network services and carrier services by using electronic network components that it owns and telephone and data transmission lines that it leases from other telecommunications carriers 
paetec s cost of sales for these services consists primarily of leased transport charges and usage costs for local and long distance calls 
paetec s leased transport charges are the payments it makes to lease the telephone and data transmission lines  which the company uses to connect its customers to its network and to connect its network to the networks of other carriers 
usage costs for local and long distance are the costs that paetec incurs for calls made by its customers 
cost of sales for paetec s integrated solutions includes the costs it incurs in designing systems and purchasing and installing equipment 
selling  general and administrative expenses paetec s selling  general and administrative expenses include selling and marketing  customer service  billing  corporate administration  engineering personnel and other personnel costs 
impairment charge paetec performs its annual assessment of the carrying value of its goodwill as of july or as events or circumstances change 
in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  paetec applies a fair value based impairment test to the net book value of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets at a reporting unit level 
the analysis of potential impairment of goodwill requires a two step process 
the first step is the estimation of fair value 
if step one indicates that impairment potentially exists  the second step is performed to measure the amount of impairment  if any 
goodwill impairment potentially exists when the estimated fair value of a reporting unit s goodwill is less than its carrying value 
during the third quarter of  paetec experienced a significant decline in market capitalization as a result of a decrease in the market price of its common stock as reported on the nasdaq global select market 
the decline in market capitalization occurred after paetec s announcement in august that its operating results for the second quarter of would be lower than expected 
some factors contributing to this performance below expectations included less robust billable minutes of use  an increase in customer attrition rates  and continued pricing pressures resulting from competitive product offerings and customer demands for price reductions in connection with contract renewals 
paetec determined that these factors combined with the overall general decline in the economy and financial markets were an indicator that a goodwill impairment test was required pursuant to sfas no 
as a result  paetec completed step one of the impairment process by estimating the fair value of its reporting units based on a discounted projection of future cash flows  supported with a market based valuation  and concluded that the fair values of some of its reporting units were less than the carrying values 
for those reporting units whose fair values were less than the carrying values  paetec conducted step two of the impairment process and determined that the fair value of each reporting unit s goodwill was less than the carrying value and concluded that goodwill was impaired 
paetec recorded a non cash charge of million based on a preliminary assessment in the third quarter of based on finalization of the original assessment in connection with the preparation of paetec s audited financial statements included in this report  paetec recorded an additional non cash charge of million in the fourth quarter of the impairment test is highly judgmental and involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions 
these estimates and assumptions have a significant impact on the amount of any impairment charge recorded 
discounted cash flow methods are dependent upon assumptions concerning future sales trends  market conditions 
table of contents and cash flows of each reporting unit over several years 
actual cash flows in the future may differ significantly from those previously forecasted 
other significant assumptions used to estimate discounted cash flows include growth rates and the discount rate applicable to future cash flows 
leveraged recapitalization related costs in june  paetec completed a leveraged recapitalization to eliminate all outstanding shares of its series a convertible redeemable preferred stock before the optional redemption rights of the holders of those shares became effective in february  as well as the associated approval rights of the holders of those shares and the additional approval rights of the former stockholders of campuslink communications systems  inc among other recapitalization transactions  paetec repurchased all outstanding shares of its series a convertible redeemable preferred stock and specified outstanding shares of its class a common stock for a purchase price payable in cash 
the cash paid in excess of the fair market value of those shares on the repurchase date of million was charged against income as inducement expense and included in leveraged recapitalization related costs during the leveraged recapitalization also included paetec s cash repurchase of specified options to purchase class a common stock issued in connection with paetec s acquisition by merger of campuslink communications 
the excess of the repurchase price over the fair value of the options immediately before the repurchase of million was recognized as additional compensation expense and included in leveraged recapitalization related costs in paetec s consolidated statement of operations and comprehensive income for to induce specified initial stockholders of paetec to provide the consents  approvals  waivers  releases and other agreements necessary to complete the other leveraged recapitalization transactions  paetec issued and sold shares of class a common stock for no additional consideration to these initial stockholders

depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization include depreciation of paetec s telecommunications network and equipment  computer hardware and purchased software  office equipment  furniture and fixtures  leasehold improvements  and buildings  as well as amortization of intangible assets 
interest expense interest expense includes interest due on borrowings under paetec s senior secured credit facilities and senior notes  amortization of debt issuance costs  debt discounts  interest due on paetec s capital lease obligations and other debt  and the ineffective portion of the gain or loss associated with the company s interest rate swap derivatives that are accounted for as hedges

the change in fair value of series a convertible redeemable preferred stock conversion right represents the change in fair value of this embedded derivative during the applicable period 
all outstanding shares of the series a convertible redeemable preferred stock were repurchased or converted into paetec class a common stock pursuant to the june recapitalization 
accounting for income taxes paetec recognizes deferred income tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of transactions and events 
under this method  paetec determines deferred income tax assets and liabilities based on the difference between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which it expects the differences to reverse 
if necessary  paetec reduces deferred income tax assets by a valuation allowance to an amount that it determines is more likely than not to be recoverable 
paetec makes significant estimates and assumptions about future taxable income and future tax consequences to determine the amount of the valuation allowance 
stock based compensation paetec s employees participate in a variety of equity incentive plans

r  share based payment  using the modified prospective method and  therefore  has not restated prior periods results

adjusted ebitda presentation adjusted ebitda  as defined by paetec for the periods presented in this management s discussion and analysis  represents net loss income before depreciation and amortization  interest expense  provision for benefit from income taxes  stock based compensation  impairment charge  integration and separation costs  loss on extinguishment of debt  leveraged recapitalization related costs  and change in fair value of series a convertible redeemable preferred stock conversion right 
paetec s adjusted ebitda is a non gaap financial measure used by paetec s management  together with financial measurements prepared in accordance with gaap such as revenue and cash flows from operations  to assess paetec s historical and prospective operating performance 
management believes that trends in paetec s adjusted ebitda are a valuable indicator of paetec s ability to produce operating cash flow to fund working capital needs  to service debt obligations and to fund capital expenditures 
management uses adjusted ebitda to enhance its understanding of paetec s core operating performance  which represents management s views concerning paetec s performance in the ordinary  ongoing and customary course of its operations 
paetec s calculation of adjusted ebitda excludes the following costs  none of which management views as expenses relevant to its assessment of paetec s core operating performance stock based compensation expense  impairment charge  
table of contents integration and separation costs  loss on extinguishment of debt  costs paetec incurred in connection with the leveraged recapitalization it completed in june  and change in fair value of series a convertible redeemable preferred stock conversion rights 
paetec s management also uses adjusted ebitda to evaluate paetec s performance relative to that of its competitors 
this financial measure permits a comparative assessment of paetec s operating performance relative to the company s performance based on its gaap results  while isolating the effects of certain items that vary from period to period without any correlation to core operating performance or that vary widely among similar companies 
management believes that adjusted ebitda is a particularly useful comparative measure within paetec s industry 
the communications industry has experienced recent trends of increased merger and acquisition activity and financial restructurings 
these activities have led to significant non operating charges to earnings  such as those resulting from debt restructurings  and to significant variations among companies with respect to capital structures and cost of capital which affect interest expense and differences in taxation and book depreciation of facilities and equipment which affect relative depreciation expense  including significant differences in the depreciable lives of similar assets among various companies 
adjusted ebitda facilitates company to company comparisons in the communications industry by eliminating some of the foregoing variations 
paetec provides information relating to its adjusted ebitda so that analysts  investors and other interested persons have the same data that management uses to assess paetec s core operating performance 
management believes that providing this information permits the foregoing persons to obtain a better understanding of paetec s core operating performance and to evaluate the efficacy of the methodology and information used by management to evaluate and measure such performance on a standalone and a comparative basis 
paetec s adjusted ebitda may not be directly comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies due to differences in accounting policies and items excluded or included in the adjustments  which limits its usefulness as a comparative measure 
in addition  adjusted ebitda has other limitations as an analytical financial measure 
these limitations include the following adjusted ebitda does not reflect paetec s capital expenditures  future requirements for capital expenditures or contractual commitments to purchase capital equipment  adjusted ebitda does not reflect the interest expense  or the cash requirements necessary to service interest or principal payments  associated with paetec s indebtedness  although depreciation and amortization are non cash charges  the assets being depreciated and amortized will likely have to be replaced in the future  and adjusted ebitda does not reflect any cash requirements for such replacements  adjusted ebitda does not reflect the effect of earnings or charges resulting from matters that paetec s management considers not indicative of paetec s ongoing operations  and to the extent that paetec changes its accounting of certain transactions or other items from period to period  paetec s adjusted ebitda may not be directly comparable from period to period 
paetec s management compensates for these limitations by relying primarily on paetec s gaap results to evaluate its operating performance and by considering independently the economic effects of the foregoing items that are or are not reflected in adjusted ebitda 
as a result of these limitations  adjusted ebitda should not be considered as an alternative to net loss income  as calculated in accordance with gaap  as a measure of operating performance  nor should it be considered as an alternative to cash flows  as calculated in accordance with gaap  as a measure of liquidity

paetec s network services  carrier services and integrated solutions services each experienced revenue growth in  largely as a result of the addition of mcleodusa s results beginning on february  paetec s operating results  however  were affected by a number of factors that limited the growth in revenue and that contributed to cost increases which outpaced revenue growth in revenue generated by long distance services and carrier access revenue in was constrained by less robust billable minutes of use  an increase in customer attrition rates  and continued pricing pressures resulting from competitive product offerings and customer demands for price reductions in connection with contract renewals 
paetec believes that the foregoing effects on the company s network services revenue reflected weaker economic conditions in paetec s markets and the effects of continued migration of customers to ip based and other offerings which tend to generate less minutes of use 
growth in paetec s revenue from data services  particularly from its virtual private network services  continued in  offsetting in part the negative revenue impact of the usage based pressure 
carrier services revenue increased as a percentage of total revenue in largely due to the addition of operations of mcleodusa  which derived a higher percentage of revenue from carrier customers than paetec before it acquired mcleodusa 
growth in paetec s carrier services revenue  however  was somewhat constrained by a loss of customers due in part to ongoing consolidation of wireless services companies  which has resulted in the transfer by larger carriers of wireless origination traffic and wireless transport onto their own networks 
paetec experienced higher cost of sales as a percentage of revenue in compared to due in part to some lower margin offerings of acquired businesses 
cost of sales also reflected the effects of network investments in  which anticipated a higher level of revenue than paetec achieved  and higher selling  general and administrative expenses resulting from acquired businesses 
paetec recorded a significant increase in depreciation and amortization expense in resulting from the growth in its depreciable asset base  as well as the recognition of increased intangibles primarily due to the mcleodusa acquisition 
in light of adverse conditions in the economy and other operating trends that contributed to its results in  paetec has continued to seek costs savings and enhance operational efficiencies through a number of 
table of contents measures 
these include reducing employee headcount  pursuing a strategy to disconnect unused facilities  and decelerating capital expenditures to better align these costs to the slower revenue growth paetec is currently experiencing  while continuing to invest for long term expansion 
paetec s efforts to reduce employee headcount began in august with the elimination of full time equivalent positions  which paetec anticipates will generate annualized cost savings of approximately million in and thereafter  excluding amounts related to termination benefits 
in december  paetec terminated the employment of an additional full time employees  as a result of which paetec expects to incur total charges of approximately million through the end of  the majority of which relate to cash severance costs 
paetec is also pursuing other expense management initiatives 
after giving effect to these initiatives and to some anticipated offsetting increases in selling  general and administrative expenses  we expect that selling  general and administrative expenses  as a percentage of total revenues  will remain stable or improve slightly for compared with revenue 
total revenue increased million  or  to  million for from  million for  principally because of the inclusion of mcleodusa s results for the majority of the period 
of total revenue for  revenue from network services  carrier services and integrated solutions services accounted for  and  respectively  compared to  and  respectively  for revenue from network services increased million  or  to  million for from million for for  revenue from monthly recurring fees and usage based fees accounted for and  respectively  of revenue from network services  compared to and  respectively  of such revenue for the increase in network services revenue primarily resulted from an increase in the number of digital t transmission lines in service from  lines as of december  to  lines as of december   of which mcleodusa accounted for  lines  as well as from increased revenue from application services and network security products 
growth of the network services business was constrained by fewer than expected billable minutes of use  increased pricing pressure  and an increase in customer attrition rates 
paetec anticipates that these factors will adversely affect its rate of network services revenue growth for revenue from carrier services increased million  or  to million for from million for the increase in carrier services revenue primarily resulted from an increase in the number of digital t transmission lines in service  as well as growth of new integrated t services and multi site vpn sales 
for  revenue from monthly recurring fees and usage based fees accounted for and  respectively  of revenue from carrier services  compared to and  respectively  of such revenue for the increase in monthly recurring fees as a percentage of total carrier services revenue was primarily attributable to the inclusion of mcleodusa s results for a majority of  as monthly recurring fees historically have represented a higher percentage of total carrier services revenue of mcleodusa s business than of paetec s business 
access fee revenue represented of carrier services usage based fees for and of carrier services usage based fees for reciprocal compensation constituted of carrier services usage based fees for and of carrier services usage based fees for the decrease in access fees and reciprocal compensation as a percentage of carrier services usage based fees was principally attributable to a shift in product mix toward ip based and other services that do not generate as much or any access fee revenue or reciprocal compensation for paetec 
paetec believes that the decrease also reflected in part adverse economic conditions in paetec s markets that have contributed to usage related pressure experienced by the carrier services business 
the carrier services business also experienced a loss of some wireless customers  which paetec believes is primarily due to consolidation in the wireless communications industry 
revenue from integrated solutions services increased million  or  to million for from million for the increase in revenue generated by the integrated solutions business  which has a 
table of contents longer revenue cycle causing irregular trends on a quarterly basis  is partly attributable to paetec s acquisition of allworx during the fourth quarter of the operations of allworx contributed million to integrated solutions revenue for cost of sales 
cost of sales increased to million for from million for  in part because of the inclusion of mcleodusa s results for a majority of in each period  cost of sales consisted primarily of leased transport charges and usage costs for local and long distance calls 
leased transport charges increased to million  or of cost of sales  for from million  or of cost of sales  for the decrease as a percentage of cost of sales was primarily attributable to the inclusion of mcleodusa s results  which reflect changes based on a broader facilities based owned network  for the majority of usage costs for local and long distance calls increased to million  or of cost of sales  for from million  or of cost of sales  for the increase was partially offset by a decrease in the average usage rates paetec is charged by network providers 
cost of sales as a percentage of total revenue increased from for to for this increase was primarily attributable to the inclusion of the results of us lec and allworx for the full period and the inclusion of mcleodusa s results for a majority of cost of sales as a percentage of revenue historically has been higher for the acquired companies than for paetec 
the increase in cost of sales also reflected the costs associated with an increase in equipment sales  an upgrade in paetec s southeast data network  and an increase in lower margin wholesale traffic 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased to million for from million for the increase was primarily attributable to paetec s acquisition of mcleodusa 
the acquisition contributed to an increase in salaries  wages  commissions and benefits of million  of which million was due to an increase in the total number of employees from approximately  at december  to approximately  at december   and million was due to an increase in sales commissions paid to paetec s sales force for their contribution to the increase in total revenue 
an increase in facilities expense necessary to support the broader network infrastructure after the mcleodusa acquisition also contributed to the total increase in selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of total revenue increased to for from for as of december   there was approximately million of total unrecognized compensation expense related to unvested stock options granted under paetec s equity incentive plans 
paetec expects to recognize the expense over a weighted average period of approximately years 
as of december   paetec had approximately million of unrecognized stock based compensation expense related to unvested restricted stock unit awards  which it expects to recognize over a weighted average period of approximately years 
impairment charge 
as discussed above under overview  paetec determined that goodwill was impaired and recorded a non cash charge of million in the third quarter of based on a preliminary assessment 
in the fourth quarter of  management finalized the assessment and recorded an additional non cash charge of million 
integration and separation costs 
paetec recorded million of integration and separation costs in in connection with the mcleodusa merger  the company incurred integration costs of approximately million in  primarily related to costs associated with employee separations 
paetec also incurred approximately million of separation costs as a result of the involuntary employee separations announced in the fourth quarter of substantially all of the recognized amounts are expected to be paid by december 
table of contents depreciation and amortization 
depreciation and amortization expense increased to million for from million for the increase was primarily attributable to increased depreciation expense resulting from an increase of million in gross property and equipment since december   largely as a result of property and equipment obtained in the acquisition of mcleodusa and as part of paetec s network deployment and maintenance 
the increase was also partly attributable to the write up of intangible assets associated with the us lec  mcleodusa  and allworx acquisitions 
the increase in depreciation and amortization expense was offset in part as we ceased to record depreciation on some of our older equipment that had reached the end of its useful life 
interest expense 
interest expense increased to million for from million for  due to the higher average outstanding debt balances during that resulted from the million principal amount of senior notes we issued in july  the million incremental term loan facility we obtained in january  and the million principal amount of revolving loans we obtained in october the average outstanding debt balances were million for and million for as of december  and  borrowing rates under the senior credit facility agreement and senior notes averaged and  respectively 
income taxes 
paetec recorded a tax provision of million for  which represented an effective tax rate of 
the difference between the statutory rate and paetec s effective tax rate for the tax year ended december  was primarily attributable to the million non deductible goodwill impairment charge discussed above  a million tax charge to establish the valuation allowance described below  and the effect of non deductible stock based compensation 
deferred income tax assets or liabilities reflect temporary differences between amounts of assets and liabilities  including net operating loss  or nol  carryforwards  for financial and tax reporting 
such amounts are adjusted as appropriate to reflect changes in the tax rates expected to be in effect when the temporary differences reverse 
a valuation allowance is established for any deferred income tax asset for which realization is uncertain 
paetec considers all available positive and negative evidence  including future reversals of existing temporary differences  projected future taxable income and recent financial operations  to determine whether  based on the weight of that evidence  a valuation allowance is needed for some portion or all of a net deferred income tax asset 
judgment is used in considering the relative impact of negative and positive evidence 
in arriving at these judgments  the weight given to the potential effect of negative and positive evidence is commensurate with the extent to which such evidence can be objectively verified 
in evaluating the objective evidence provided by historical results  paetec considered the past three years of combined results on a pro forma basis that included the results of mcleodusa and of us lec beginning on january  based on an assessment of the available positive and negative evidence  including the historical pro forma combined results  paetec determined that there are uncertainties relative to its ability to utilize the net deferred tax assets 
in recognition of these uncertainties  paetec has provided a valuation allowance of million on the net deferred income tax assets as of december  a valuation allowance of million existed on the net deferred income tax assets as of december   resulting in an increase of million in  of which million represents a charge to income tax expense and million represents a charge to goodwill or equity as it relates primarily to purchase accounting for the mcleodusa acquisition 
if paetec were to determine that it could realize its deferred tax assets in the future in excess of their net recorded amount  it would make an adjustment to the valuation allowance 
upon the january  adoption of sfas no 
revised  business combinations  or sfas no 
r  changes in deferred tax asset valuation allowances and income tax uncertainties after an acquisition date  including charges and uncertainties associated with acquisitions that closed prior to the effective date of sfas no 
r  generally will affect income tax expense 

table of contents paetec acquired approximately billion of nols pursuant to the mcleodusa acquisition 
section of the internal revenue code  or irc section  places annual limitations on the use of some tax attributes such as net operating losses and tax credit carryovers in existence at the time of an ownership change 
as a result of the acquisition  mcleodusa experienced an ownership change within the meaning of irc section paetec has determined that the acquired nols will be subject to substantial limitations under irc section as a result of the ownership change 
paetec continues to assess its ability to utilize these nols  but currently estimates that approximately million of the nols would be available when taking into consideration the limitations under irc section as of december   paetec had a deferred tax asset for federal nol carryforwards of approximately million  including the approximately million of nol carryforwards acquired as part of the mcleodusa acquisition 
paetec has recorded a deferred income tax asset of approximately million that reflects the benefit of federal and state loss carryforwards 
all but approximately million of the million of nols is subject to annual limitations under irc section if unused  the nol carryforwards would expire on various dates from through included in the nol carryforward deferred tax asset above is approximately million of deferred tax assets attributable to state nols 
approximately million of this deferred tax asset relates to nols acquired pursuant to the mcleodusa acquisition 
management believes that it is more likely than not that the benefit from some state nol carryforwards will not be realized before their expiration 
in recognition of this risk  paetec has provided a valuation allowance of million on the deferred tax assets related to the state nol carryforwards 
as a result of some realization requirements of sfas no 
r  paetec s deferred tax assets at december  do not include approximately million of excess tax benefits from employee stock option exercises that are a component of the company s nol carryovers 
paetec s equity accounts will be increased by approximately million if and when such deferred tax assets are ultimately realized for federal income tax purposes 
paetec uses ordering pursuant to sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  for purposes of determining when excess tax benefits have been realized 
in july  the federal accounting standards board  or fasb  issued fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement  or fin among other things  fin provides guidance to address uncertainty in tax positions and clarifies the accounting for income taxes by prescribing a minimum recognition threshold  which income tax positions must achieve before being recognized in the financial statements 
in addition  fin requires expanded annual disclosures  including a rollforward of the beginning and ending aggregate unrecognized tax benefits as well as specific detail related to tax uncertainties for which it is reasonably possible the amount of unrecognized tax benefit will significantly increase or decrease within twelve months 
paetec adopted fin on january   and recorded a reduction of retained earnings of million effective january  the amount of unrecognized tax benefits from uncertain tax positions at december  was million  the majority of which  if recognized  would affect the effective tax rate 
compared with revenue 
total revenue increased million  or  to  million for from million for the increase in total revenue was substantially attributable to the inclusion of us lec s results for excluding us lec s results  total revenue increased million  or  over revenue from network services increased million  or  to million for from million for revenue from carrier services increased million  or  to million for from million for revenue from integrated solutions increased million  or  to million for from million for

access revenue and reciprocal compensation constituted of the total carrier services revenue for  which represented a decrease from of total carrier services revenue for excluding us lec s results  access revenue and reciprocal compensation accounted for of total revenue 
access revenue and reciprocal compensation  as a percentage of network services revenue  was for  or excluding us lec s results  and for the decrease in access fee revenue and reciprocal compensation as a percentage of total revenue was principally attributable to a continuing shift in product mix toward services that do not generate as much or any access fee revenue or reciprocal compensation for paetec 
cost of sales 
cost of sales increased to million for from million for  principally because of the inclusion of us lec s results in excluding us lec s results  cost of sales increased to million 
the higher cost of sales in principally reflected the increase in the number of digital t transmission lines in service discussed above 
leased transport charges increased to million  or of cost of sales  for from million  or of cost of sales  for the increase in leased transport charges was primarily attributable to the inclusion of us lec s results of million  or of us lec s portion of cost of sales  in the increase in leased transport charges for also resulted from increases in the amount of network services sold 
the increase in leased transport charges as a percentage of cost of sales was principally attributable to the shift in product mix referred to above  as well as the mix of leased transport charges to usage costs with respect to the customers acquired in connection with the us lec merger 
usage costs for local and long distance calls increased to million  or of cost of sales  for from million  or of cost of sales  for the increase in usage costs was primarily attributable to the inclusion of us lec s results of million  or of us lec s portion of cost of sales  in the increase in usage costs for local and long distance calls for was also due to increases in the amount of network services and carrier services sold 
the increase was partially offset by a decrease in the average usage rates paetec is charged by network providers 
the decrease in usage costs as a percentage of cost of sales was principally attributable to fluctuations in the mix of products sold during cost of sales as a percentage of total revenue decreased from for to for the decrease was primarily attributable to the inclusion of us lec s results in and to the amount of voice and data services provided by paetec using its own network and facilities  as well as to network efficiencies which paetec achieved by aggregating network traffic using points of presence located near clusters of its customers 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased to million for from million for the increase was primarily attributable to the acquisition 
table of contents of us lec  which contributed to an increase in salaries  wages  and benefits of million principally due to an increase in the total number of employees from approximately  at december  to approximately  at december   to an increase of million in sales commissions related to increased total revenue  and to an increase in stock based compensation of approximately million related to stock based equity grants made during excluding the effect of stock based compensation  selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of total revenue decreased to for from for  primarily because the rate at which paetec increased its total revenue exceeded the rate at which it incurred increased compensation costs from hiring new employees 
litigation settlement 
paetec s results for included a million litigation settlement charge for a ruling in favor of mci worldcom network services  inc  which had brought suit against paetec to recover previously disputed access charges 
the million litigation settlement charge reflected the incremental amount of the ruling not previously recorded 
integration and separation costs 
in connection with the us lec merger  paetec has incurred integration and separation costs 
paetec recognized approximately million of such costs in  most of which were incurred in connection with employee separations and lease termination agreements for duplicative facilities 
depreciation and amortization 
depreciation and amortization expense increased to million for from million for the increase was primarily attributable to higher depreciation expense resulting from an increase of million in gross property and equipment since december   principally as a result of property and equipment paetec acquired in the us lec merger and as part of its network deployment and maintenance 
in addition  million of amortization expense recognized for related to the acquired fair value of us lec s customer relationships intangible asset with a weighted average useful life of eleven years 
loss on extinguishment of debt 
for  paetec recognized a million loss on debt extinguishment  which represented the elimination of million of debt issuance costs related to the senior secured indebtedness refinanced in connection with the us lec merger and million of debt issuance costs as a result of the senior secured credit facility amendment entered into in connection with paetec s july offering of senior notes 
for  the leveraged recapitalization completed in june resulted in a loss on debt extinguishment of approximately million  which was attributable to the write off of million of unamortized debt issuance costs related to the extinguishment of paetec s existing senior secured credit facility and to lease termination fees of million related to the termination of paetec s capital leases 
change in fair value of series a convertible redeemable preferred stock conversion right 
the series a convertible redeemable preferred stock conversion right was eliminated as a result of paetec s leveraged recapitalization in june interest expense 
interest expense increased to million for from million for  primarily due to higher average outstanding debt balances during as a result of merger related borrowings under paetec s senior secured credit facilities and paetec s issuance of million principal amount of senior notes 
paetec s average outstanding debt balances were million for compared to million for as of december   borrowing rates under the senior credit facility agreement and senior notes averaged 
as of december   borrowing rates were and under paetec s first and second lien credit agreements  respectively 
other income  net 
other income  net increased to million for from million for  primarily as a result of an increase in dividend and interest income 
income taxes 
the provision for income taxes for the tax years ended december  and includes a provision for federal and state taxes based on the annual effective tax rate applicable to paetec for these 
table of contents periods 
the difference between the statutory rate and paetec s effective tax rate for the tax year ended december  was primarily attributable to the effect of non deductible stock based compensation 
as of december   paetec had federal nol carryforwards of approximately million  including approximately million of net operating loss carryforwards acquired as part of the us lec merger 
paetec has recorded a deferred tax asset of approximately million reflecting the benefit of these loss carryforwards 
if unused  the nols would expire on various dates from through in addition  paetec acquired approximately million of nols pursuant to its acquisition of allworx in october paetec has recorded a deferred tax asset of approximately million reflecting the benefit of these loss carryforwards 
as a result of certain realization requirements of sfas r  the deferred tax assets relating to nol carryforwards above does not include certain deferred tax assets at december  that arose directly from or the use of which was postponed by tax deductions related to equity compensation in excess of compensation recognized for financial reporting 
included in the net operating loss deferred tax asset above is approximately million of deferred tax asset attributable to state net operating losses 
approximately million of the deferred tax asset relates to net operating losses acquired pursuant to the us lec merger and paetec s acquisition of allworx 
paetec believes that it is more likely than not that the benefit from certain state net operating loss carryforwards will not be realized prior to their expiration 
in recognition of this risk  as of december   paetec provided a valuation allowance of million on the deferred tax assets related to the state net operating loss carryforwards 
the amount of unrecognized tax benefits from uncertain tax positions at december   as determined in accordance with fin  was million  the majority of which  if recognized  would affect the effective tax rate 
critical accounting policies paetec s consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  which require paetec to make estimates and assumptions 
of paetec s significant accounting policies described in note to the consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in this report  paetec believes that the following policies may involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity 
revenue recognition 
paetec generates recurring operating revenue pursuant to contracts with paetec s customers and non recurring revenue pursuant to non recurring agreements 
paetec recognizes revenue in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  which require satisfaction of the following four basic criteria before revenue can be recognized there is persuasive evidence that an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  the fee is fixed or determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
paetec bases its determination of the third and fourth criteria above on the company s judgment regarding the fixed nature of the fee it has charged for the services rendered and products delivered  and the prospects that those fees will be collected 
if changes in conditions should cause it to determine that these criteria likely will not be met for some future transactions  revenue recognized for any reporting period could be materially adversely affected 

table of contents management makes estimates of future customer credits through the analysis of historical trends and known events 
the provisions for revenue adjustments are recorded as a reduction of revenue when incurred 
since any revenue allowances are recorded as an offset to revenue  any future increases or decreases in the allowances will positively or negatively affect revenue by the same amount 
network services and carrier services revenue 
paetec derives revenue primarily from its sale of communications services 
paetec s service revenue consists principally of usage fees and monthly recurring fees 
usage fees consist of fees paid by paetec s customers for each call made  fees paid by the incumbent carriers in paetec s markets as reciprocal compensation when the company terminates local calls made by their customers  and access fees paid by carriers for long distance calls that paetec originates and terminates 
paetec recognizes revenue related to usage fees when the service is provided 
paetec bills usage fees in arrears and uses estimates to recognize revenue for unbilled usage fees 
paetec s ability to generate reciprocal compensation revenue and access revenue is subject to numerous regulatory and legal proceedings 
until these proceedings are ultimately resolved  paetec s policy is to recognize reciprocal compensation and access revenue only when it concludes that its realization of that revenue is reasonably assured 
monthly recurring fees include the fees paid by paetec s customers for lines in service and additional features on those lines 
monthly recurring fees are paid by paetec s end user customers and are billed in advance 
paetec recognizes this revenue during the period in which it is earned 
paetec has arrangements where it recognizes revenue in accordance with sec staff accounting bulletin  or sab  no 
 revenue recognition  which requires some non recurring service activation and installation fee revenues that are payable in advance of the provision of services to be deferred over the average customer life 
in accordance with those guidelines  paetec defers service activation and installation fee revenues and related costs and amortizes them over the average customer life  which is primarily three years 
the revenue from indefeasible rights to use fiber optic telecommunications network facilities is recognized over the term of the related lease unless it qualifies as a sales type lease  on which revenue is recognized at the time the sale criteria in sfas  accounting for sales of real estate  are met 
base annual revenue for telecommunications network maintenance is recognized on a straight line basis over the term of the contract 
additional services provided under these contracts are recognized as the services are performed 
integrated solutions revenue 
paetec also derives revenue from sales of telecommunications equipment and software 
equipment revenue consists of fees paetec s customers pay for equipment and for paetec s system design and installation services 
paetec recognizes equipment revenue upon delivery and acceptance of the equipment 
paetec derives software revenue through selling and supporting its proprietary telecommunications software 
paetec recognizes revenue related to software sales upon delivery and acceptance of the software in accordance with statement of position  software revenue recognition  issued by the american institute of certified public accountants and related interpretations 
support fees include fees for maintenance of paetec s telecommunications software and fees for training the end user in the proper use of paetec s telecommunications software 
paetec recognizes maintenance fees pro rata over the length of the underlying maintenance contract 
paetec recognizes training fees after the training obligation has been fulfilled 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
to determine its allowance for bad debts  paetec uses estimates based on the company s historical collection experience  its assessment of current industry and economic trends  customer concentrations and its credit policies 
as of december   paetec had reserved for million of bad debts 
paetec has reserved for expected bad debt losses based on the factors referred to above  and believes that its reserves are adequate 
it is possible  however  that the sufficiency of paetec s estimates could become 
table of contents materially inadequate as the composition of paetec s receivables changes over time 
paetec continually reviews and refines the estimation process to take account of these changes  but from time to time the company may need to adjust its estimate to reflect actual experience 
cost of sales 
costs of sales are composed primarily of network costs  which are costs incurred for leased transport charges and for transmission of voice and data services over other carriers networks 
these costs consist of both fixed payments and variable amounts based on actual usage and negotiated or regulated contract rates 
paetec expenses network costs as incurred 
these costs include paetec s estimate of charges for which it has not yet received bills  and are based upon the estimated number of transmission lines and facilities paetec has in service and its estimated minutes of use based on internal reports 
once paetec receives an invoice from a carrier  the company begins a process of reconciling that carrier s invoice to paetec s internal reports 
once the reconciliation is complete  paetec follows contractual terms to dispute any erroneous billing and  ultimately  agrees with the carrier on the final amount due 
in some cases  this reconciliation process can take several months to complete 
paetec may make subsequent adjustments to its estimates after it receives bills for the actual costs it incurs  but paetec generally does not expect that these adjustments will be material to its operating results 
accordingly  paetec s accrual for network costs includes estimates for which the reconciliation of the carriers invoices to paetec s internal reports has not been completed 
because of the significance of access costs  the complexity of the systems that capture accrual information  and the quantity of negotiated and regulated rates  paetec believes that the estimation of network cost accruals is a critical accounting policy 
as of december  and  paetec had million and million  respectively  of disputed network invoices and approximately million and million  respectively  of recorded reserves related to disputed balances recorded in accounts payable on the consolidated balance sheets 
impairment of long lived assets and finite lived intangible assets 
it is paetec s policy to review its long lived assets for possible impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
factors the company considers important  and which could trigger an impairment review  include the following significant under performance of paetec s assets relative to expected historical or projected future operating results  significant changes in the manner in which paetec uses its assets or significant changes in paetec s overall business strategy  significant negative industry or economic trends  and a significant decline in fair market value of paetec s common stock for a sustained period 
paetec determines whether the carrying value of its long lived assets  including property and equipment  and finite lived intangible assets may not be recoverable based upon the existence of one or more of the foregoing or other indicators of impairment 
paetec determines if impairment exists relating to long lived assets by comparing future undiscounted cash flows to the asset s carrying value 
if the carrying value is greater than the undiscounted cash flows  paetec measures the impairment as the amount by which the carrying value of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets 
in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  paetec does not amortize goodwill or other acquired intangible assets with indefinite useful lives 
paetec has identified four reporting units as defined in sfas no 
goodwill is assessed for impairment at least annually  based upon paetec s estimate of the fair value of each reporting unit 
as of december   paetec had million of intangible assets with indefinite lives representing acquired trade names from allworx 
as of december   paetec did not have any intangible assets with indefinite useful lives 

table of contents paetec assesses the carrying value of its goodwill during the third quarter of each fiscal year 
in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill of a reporting unit will also be tested for impairment between annual tests if a triggering event occurs  as defined by sfas no 
 that could potentially reduce the fair value of the reporting unit below its carrying value 
the annual assessment of the carrying value of paetec s reporting units undertaken with respect to  and indicated that the value of the remaining goodwill was not impaired as of july  and  respectively 
however  in the third quarter of  after paetec experienced a significant and sustained decline in market capitalization as a result of a decrease in the market price of its common stock as reported on the nasdaq global select market  it was determined that the value of recorded goodwill was impaired 
as discussed above under overview  paetec recorded a non cash goodwill impairment charge of million in the third quarter of based on a preliminary assessment 
in the fourth quarter of  management finalized the assessment in connection with the preparation of the company s audited financial statements included in this report and recorded an additional non cash charge of million 
during the fourth quarter of  paetec s market capitalization declined further as a result of a decrease in the market price of its common stock as reported on the nasdaq global select market from the market price at september  paetec determined that the continued decline in market capitalization and the continuation of the factors that were identified during the third quarter of were an indicator that a goodwill impairment test was again required pursuant to sfas no 
for the fourth quarter of as a result  the paetec completed step one of the impairment process by estimating the fair value of its reporting units based on a discounted projection of future cash flows  supported with a market based valuation 
paetec concluded that the fair values of its reporting units exceeded the carrying values and therefore recorded no impairment 
the changes in the carrying value of goodwill from january  through december  were as follows in thousands balance as of january  goodwill related to the acquisition of us lec corp goodwill related to the acquisition of allworx corp balance as of december  goodwill related to the acquisition of mcleodusa incorporated goodwill related to other acquisitions impairment charge balance as of december  paetec recorded the assets acquired and liabilities assumed from mcleodusa and allworx at their respective preliminary fair values as of the closing date of the acquisitions of those companies 
paetec recorded adjustments for these assets and liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet as of december  based on final valuations of these assets 
because of the significance of long lived assets and the judgments and estimates that go into the fair value analysis  paetec believes that its policies regarding impairment of long lived assets are critical 
share based payment 
employees of paetec participate in various equity incentive plans 
officers of paetec also participate in the paetec corp 
executive incentive plan 
on january   paetec adopted sfas no 
r  share based payment  which revised sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  and superseded accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  or apb no 
sfas no 
r requires the measurement of the cost of employee services received in exchange for an award of equity instruments based on the grant date fair value of the award 
the cost will be recognized over the period during which an employee is required to provide service in exchange for the award 
paetec adopted sfas no 
r using the modified prospective transition method and  therefore  has not restated results for prior periods 
under this transition method  stock based compensation expense is recorded for the unvested portion of previously issued awards that remain outstanding at january  using the same estimate 
table of contents of grant date fair value and the same attribution method used to determine the pro forma disclosure under sfas no 
stock based compensation expense for all stock based compensation awards granted on or after january  is based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with sfas no 
r 
paetec recognizes these compensation costs ratably over the requisite service period of the award 
the fair value of each option award is estimated on the date of grant using the black scholes option pricing model that uses assumptions regarding expected volatilities based on historical experience 
the expected term of options granted is derived from the vesting period of the award  as well as exercisability of the award  and represents the period of time that options granted are expected to be outstanding 
the risk free rate is calculated using the us treasury yield curve  and is based on the expected term of the option 
paetec uses historical data to estimate forfeitures 
the assumptions used in calculating the fair value of share based payment awards represent management s best estimates  but these estimates involve inherent uncertainties and the application of management judgment 
as a result  if factors change and paetec uses different assumptions  its stock based compensation expense could be materially different in the future 
in addition  paetec is required to estimate the expected forfeiture rate and only recognize expense for those shares expected to vest 
if paetec s actual forfeiture rate is materially different from its estimate  the stock based compensation expense could be significantly different from the amount recorded by paetec in the current period 
income taxes 
paetec accounts for income taxes in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
the asset and liability approach underlying sfas no 
requires the recognition of deferred income tax liabilities and assets for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse 
management provides valuation allowances against the net deferred income tax asset for amounts that are not considered more likely than not to be realized 
paetec must make significant estimates and assumptions about future taxable income and future tax consequences when determining the amount of the valuation allowance 
paetec considers all available evidence  both positive and negative  to determine whether  based on the weight of that evidence  a valuation allowance is needed for some portion or all of a net deferred income tax asset 
paetec uses judgment in considering the relative impact of negative and positive evidence 
in arriving at these judgments  the weight given to the potential effect of negative and positive evidence is commensurate with the extent to which such evidence can be objectively verified 
purchase accounting 
paetec accounts for the purchase of a business by allocating the purchase price to the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed in the transaction at their respective estimated fair values 
the most difficult estimations of individual fair values are those involving long lived assets  such as property and equipment and intangible assets 
paetec uses available information to make these fair value determinations and  when necessary  engages an independent valuation specialist to assist in the fair value determination of the acquired long lived assets 
because of the inherent subjectivity associated with estimating the fair value of long lived assets  paetec believes that the recording of assets and liabilities acquired in conjunction with the acquisition of a business is a critical accounting policy 
derivatives 
sfas 
no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  as amended by sfas no 
 accounting for certain derivative instruments and certain hedging activities  and sfas no 
 amendment of statement on derivative instruments and hedging activities  allows the gains and losses of a derivative to offset related results on the hedged item in the consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income  and requires paetec formally to document  designate and assess the effectiveness of transactions that receive hedge accounting 
derivatives are recognized on the consolidated balance sheet at fair value 
paetec s freestanding derivative instruments are designated as hedges at inception and evaluated for effectiveness at least quarterly throughout the hedge period 
these derivatives are designated as hedges of the variability of cash flows to be received or paid related to a recognized asset or liability cash flow hedge 
the effective portion of the 
table of contents derivative s gain or loss is initially reported as a component of comprehensive income and subsequently reclassified into earnings when the forecasted transaction affects earnings 
the ineffective portion of the gain or loss is reported in earnings immediately 
paetec formally documents all relationships between hedging instruments and hedged items  as well as the risk management objective and strategy for undertaking various hedge transactions 
this process includes linking all derivatives that are designated as cash flow hedges to specific assets and liabilities on the balance sheet 
paetec discontinues hedge accounting prospectively when it determines that the derivative is no longer effective in offsetting changes in cash flows of a hedged item  the derivative or hedged item expires or is sold  terminated  or exercised  or management determines that it is no longer appropriate to designate the derivative as a hedge instrument 
in connection with its senior secured credit facilities  paetec had interest rate swaps at december  and that qualified as cash flow hedges 
legal and contingency reserves 
paetec accounts for legal and other contingencies in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies 
loss contingencies are accrued by a charge to income if both of the following conditions are met information before issuance of the financial statements indicates that it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred at the date of the financial statements  and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated 
the foregoing list of critical accounting policies is not intended to be a comprehensive list of all of paetec s accounting policies 
in many cases  the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  with no need for paetec to judge their application 
there are also areas in which paetec s judgment in selecting any available alternative would not produce a materially different result 
in addition to reviewing the foregoing list  paetec encourages you to review carefully the notes to its consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in this report  where you will find a more comprehensive description of the company s accounting policies and additional disclosures that are required by generally accepted accounting principles

capital and cash requirements 
paetec expects that  to maintain and enhance its network and services and to generate planned revenue growth  it will continue to require significant capital expenditures 
paetec made capital expenditures  principally for the purchase of communications equipments  of approximately million in paetec funded all of its capital expenditures from cash flows from operations and proceeds from its senior secured term loan credit facility 
paetec plans to make capital expenditures primarily for the following purposes to continue to acquire and install equipment to enhance and maintain its network  to increase penetration of its existing markets  to expand its operations into additional geographic markets  and to make infrastructure enhancements  principally for its back office systems 
the actual amount and timing of paetec s capital requirements may differ materially from its estimates as a result of regulatory  technological and competitive developments in the company s industry 
as of december   paetec had entered into agreements with vendors to purchase approximately million of equipment and services  of which the company expects million to be delivered and payable in  million to be delivered and payable in  and million to be delivered and payable in paetec believes that cash on hand and cash flow from operations will provide sufficient cash to enable the company to fund its planned capital expenditures  make scheduled principal and interest payments on its debt  meet its other cash requirements  and maintain compliance with the terms of its financing agreements for at least the next months 
after the foregoing period  paetec may require additional capital for network enhancements to provide increased capacity to meet expected increased demand for its services 
the amount and timing of these additional network enhancements  if any  will depend on the anticipated demand for services  the availability of funds and other factors 
the actual amount and timing of paetec s future capital requirements may differ materially from the company s estimates depending on the demand for its services and new market developments and opportunities 
if plans or assumptions change or prove to be inaccurate  the foregoing sources of funds may prove to be insufficient 
in addition  if paetec successfully completes any acquisitions of other businesses or if it seeks to accelerate the expansion of its business  it may be required to seek additional capital 
additional sources may include equity and debt financing and other financing arrangements  such as vendor financing 
in addition  if paetec believes it can obtain additional debt financing on advantageous terms  paetec may seek such financing at any time  to the extent that market conditions and other factors permit it to do so 
the debt financing paetec may seek could be in the form of additional term loans under its senior secured credit facility or additional senior notes having substantially the same terms as  or different terms from  paetec s existing senior notes 
any inability of paetec to generate the sufficient funds that it may require or to obtain such funds under reasonable terms could limit its ability to increase revenue or operate profitably 
a prolonged economic slowdown  with impaired equity and credit markets could have an impact on paetec s ability to raise any required funds

fas item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk paetec is exposed to market risks in the normal course of business 
paetec manages the sensitivity of its results of operations to these risks by maintaining an investment portfolio consisting primarily of short term  interest bearing securities and by entering into long term debt obligations with appropriate pricing and terms 
paetec does not hold or issue derivative  derivative commodity or other financial instruments for trading purposes  although the company holds some derivative financial instruments to manage its exposure to fluctuations in interest rates 
paetec does not have any material foreign currency exposure 
paetec s major market risk exposure is to changing interest rates associated with borrowings the company used to fund the expansion of its business and to support its acquisition activities 
the interest rates that paetec is able to obtain on this debt financing depend on market conditions 
paetec s policy is to manage interest rates through a combination of fixed rate debt and the use of interest rate swap contracts to manage the company s exposure to fluctuations in interest rates on its variable rate debt 
as of december   million of paetec s long term debt consisted of variable rate instruments that accrue interest at floating rates 
the estimated fair market value of this debt was approximately million as of december  as of the same date  through three interest rate swap contracts  paetec had capped its interest rate exposure through june  at a rate of on million of floating rate debt  through june  at a rate of on million of floating rate debt  and through april  at a rate of on million of floating rate debt 
a change of one percentage point in the interest rates applicable to paetec s million of variable rate debt subject to an interest rate swap contract as of december  would result in a fluctuation of approximately million in the company s annual interest expense in the absence of the interest rate swap contracts
