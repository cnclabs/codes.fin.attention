item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general we are a marshall islands company incorporated in september to transport iron ore  coal  grain  steel products and other drybulk cargoes along worldwide shipping routes through the ownership and operation of drybulk carrier vessels 
as of february   our fleet consisted of six capesize  eight panamax  four supramax  six handymax and eight handysize drybulk carriers  with an aggregate carrying capacity of approximately  dwt  and the average age of our fleet was approximately years at december   as compared to the average age for the world fleet of approximately years for the drybulk shipping segments in which we compete 
most of the vessels in our fleet are on time charters to well known charterers  including lauritzen bulkers  cargill  nyk europe  pacbasin  stx  cosco  and hmmc 
as of february   of the vessels in our fleet are presently engaged under time charter contracts that expire assuming the option periods in the time charters are not exercised between march and october  and three of our vessels are currently operating in vessel pools 
see page for a table indicated the delivery dates of all vessels currently in our fleet 
we intend to acquire additional modern  high quality drybulk carriers through timely and selective acquisitions of vessels in a manner that is accretive to our cash flow 
we expect to fund acquisitions of additional vessels using cash reserves set aside for this purpose  additional borrowings and may consider additional debt and equity financing alternatives from time to time 
our management team and our other employees are responsible for the commercial and strategic management of our fleet 
commercial management includes the negotiation of charters for vessels  managing the mix of various types of charters  such as time charters and voyage charters  and monitoring the performance of our vessels under their charters 
strategic management includes locating  purchasing  financing and selling vessels 
we currently contract with three independent technical managers  to provide technical management of our fleet at a lower cost than we believe would be possible in house 
technical management involves the day to day management of vessels  including performing routine maintenance  attending to vessel operations and arranging for crews and supplies 
members of our new york city based management team oversee the activities of our independent technical managers 
the genco cavalier  a built supramax vessel  was on charter to samsun logix corporation  which the company understands has filed for the equivalent of bankruptcy protection in south korea  otherwise referred to as a rehabilitation application 
charter hire for the genco cavalier has been received up until january  the company is expecting the decision of the south korean courts regarding the acceptance or rejection of the rehabilitation application to be made on or about march  the company has commenced arbitration proceedings in the united kingdom for damages related to non performance of samsun under the time charter agreement 
as a result of the non payment of hire  the company may seek to withdraw the vessel from this contract 
also  on february   while the vessel was at safe anchorage in singapore  it was involved in a minor collision caused by another vessel in its vicinity 
no injuries or pollution from either vessel have been reported  but we expect the vessel will incur approximately days of offhire for repairs arising from the event 
the company is in the process of filing a claim for the full amount of the damages as well as any offhire time related to the collision against the other vessel s owner 
year ended december  compared to the year ended december  factors affecting our results of operations we believe that the following table reflects important measures for analyzing trends in our results of operations

ownership days are an indicator of the size of our fleet over a period and affect both the amount of revenues and the amount of expenses that we record during a period 
we define available days as the number of our ownership days less the aggregate number of days that our vessels are off hire due to scheduled repairs or repairs under guarantee  vessel upgrades or special surveys and the aggregate amount of time that we spend positioning our vessels 
companies in the shipping industry generally use available days to measure the number of days in a period during which vessels should be capable of generating revenues 
we define operating days as the number of our available days in a period less the aggregate number of days that our vessels are off hire due to unforeseen circumstances 
the shipping industry uses operating days to measure the aggregate number of days in a period during which vessels actually generate revenues 
we calculate fleet utilization by dividing the number of our operating days during a period by the number of our available days during the period 
the shipping industry uses fleet utilization to measure a company s efficiency in finding suitable employment for its vessels and minimizing the number of days that its vessels are off hire for reasons other than scheduled repairs or repairs under guarantee  vessel upgrades  special surveys or vessel positioning 
we define tce rates as net voyage revenue voyage revenues less voyage expenses divided by the number of our available days during the period  which is consistent with industry standards 
tce rate is a common shipping industry performance measure used primarily to compare daily earnings generated by vessels on time charters with daily earnings generated by vessels on voyage charters  because charterhire rates for vessels on voyage charters are generally not expressed in per day amounts while charterhire rates for vessels on time charters generally are expressed in such amounts 
for the years ended december  income statement data us dollars in thousands voyage revenues voyage expenses net voyage revenue we define daily vessel operating expenses to include crew wages and related costs  the cost of insurance  expenses relating to repairs and maintenance excluding drydocking  the costs of spares and consumable stores  tonnage taxes and other miscellaneous expenses 
daily vessel operating expenses are calculated by dividing vessel operating expenses by ownership days for the relevant period

ebitda is included because it is used by management and certain investors as a measure of operating performance 
ebitda is used by analysts in the shipping industry as a common performance measure to compare results across peers 
our management uses ebitda as a performance measure in our consolidating internal financial statements  and it is presented for review at our board meetings 
the company believes that ebitda is useful to investors as the shipping industry is capital  intensive which often results in significant depreciation and cost of financing 
ebitda presents investors with a measure in addition to net income to evaluate the company s performance prior to these costs 
ebitda is not an item recognized by us gaap and should not be considered as an alternative to net income  operating income or any other indicator of a company s operating performance required by us gaap 
ebitda is not a source of liquidity or cash flows as shown in our consolidated statement of cash flows 
the definition of ebitda used here may not be comparable to that used by other companies 
the following table demonstrates our calculation of ebitda and provides a reconciliation of ebitda to net income for each of the periods presented above for the years ended december  us dollars in thousands except for per share amounts net income net interest expense depreciation and amortization ebitda results of operations revenues our revenues are driven primarily by the number of vessels in our fleet  the number of days during which our vessels operate and the amount of daily charterhire that our vessels earn  that  in turn  are affected by a number of factors  including the duration of our charters  our decisions relating to vessel acquisitions and disposals  the amount of time that we spend positioning our vessels  the amount of time that our vessels spend in drydock undergoing repairs  maintenance and upgrade work  the age  condition and specifications of our vessels  levels of supply and demand in the drybulk shipping industry  and other factors affecting spot market charter rates for drybulk carriers 
for  revenues grew to million versus million for revenues in both periods consisted of charter payments for our vessels  including revenue realized from pools 
the increase in revenues during the twelve months ended december  was primarily due to the growth of our fleet and favorable market conditions at the time we entered into time charter agreements  as evidenced by the increase in the average tce rate as discussed below 
the average tce rate of our fleet increased to  a day for from  a day for the increase in tce rates was primarily due to higher time charter rates achieved in versus the prior year for three of the panamax vessels  the six handymax vessels  as well as six of the handysize vessels in our current fleet 
furthermore  higher tce rates were achieved during versus due to the operation of one of the capesize vessels acquired as part of the metrostar acquisition and the two panamax and one supramax vessel acquired as part of the bocimar acquisition 
charterhire rates are volatile  as evidenced by the historical high rates during may which have since declined to very low rates in december during the first two months of  rates have recovered slightly from the lows experienced in december but remain significantly below the highs 
for and  we had ownership days of  days and  days  respectively 
our fleet utilization for and was and  respectively 
the utilization was higher during the year ended december  due to additional unscheduled offhire days during as compared to during  we experienced unscheduled offhire of approximately days in aggregate for the genco trader  genco glory and genco sugar associated with maintenance and other delays  as compared to unscheduled offhire days during related to the repair of the genco hunter 
please see page for table that sets forth information about the current employment of the vessels currently in our fleet as of february voyage expenses voyage expenses include port and canal charges  fuel bunker expenses and brokerage commissions payable to unaffiliated third parties 
port and canal charges and bunker expenses primarily increase in periods during which vessels are employed on voyage charters because these expenses are for the account of the vessel owner 
for the years ended and  we did not incur port and canal charges or any significant expenses related to the consumption of bunkers as part of our vessels overall expenses  because all of our vessels were employed under time charters or pool arrangements that required the charterer to bear all of those expenses 
for both and  voyage expenses were million and consisted primarily of brokerage commissions paid to third parties 
vessel operating expenses vessel operating expenses increased to million from million for and  respectively

the increase in was due mostly to increased costs for crewing  repairs and maintenance and insurance  as well as the operation of larger  capesize vessels for all of as compared to we believe daily vessel operating expenses are best measured for comparative purposes over a month period in order to take into account all of the expenses that each vessel in our fleet will incur over a full year of operation 
our vessel operating expenses  which generally represent fixed costs  will increase as a result of the expansion of our fleet 
other factors beyond our control  some of which may affect the shipping industry in general  including  for instance  developments relating to market prices for insurance  may also cause these expenses to increase

management fees we incur management fees to third party technical management companies for the day to day management of our vessels  including performing routine maintenance  attending to vessel operations and arranging for crews and supplies 
for and  management fees were million and million  respectively 
the increase was due primarily to increased rates charged by the management companies we use as well to as the operation of a larger fleet 
depreciation and amortization we depreciate the cost of our vessels on a straight line basis over the expected useful life of each vessel 
depreciation is based on the cost of the vessel less its estimated residual value 
we estimate the useful life of our vessels to be years 
furthermore  we estimate the residual values of our vessels to be based upon per lightweight ton  which we believe to be the anticipated scrap value of our vessels 
for years ended december  and  depreciation and amortization charges were million and million  respectively  an increase of million 
the increase primarily was due to the growth in our fleet during as compared to loss on forfeiture of vessel deposits for year ended december  and  the loss on forfeiture of vessel deposits was million and million  respectively

on june   the company entered into an amendment to the credit facility allowing the company to prepay vessel deposits to give the company flexibility in refinancing potential vessel acquisitions 
due to refinancing of the company s previous facilities  the company incurred a non cash write off of the unamortized deferred financing cost in the amount of million associated with the company s previous facilities and this charge was reflected in interest expense in the third quarter of due to refinancing of the credit facility as a result of entering into the amendment  the company incurred a non cash write off of unamortized deferred financing cost in the amount of million associated with capitalized costs related to prior amendments  and this charge was reflected in interest expense in the fourth quarter of short term line refinanced by the credit facility on may   the company entered into a short term line of credit facility under which dnb nor bank asa  grand cayman branch and nordea bank norge asa  grand cayman branch are serving as lenders the short term line

under the terms of the short term line  we were allowed to borrow up to million for such acquisitions  and we had borrowed a total of million under the short term line prior to its refinancing 
the term of the short term line was for days  and the interest on amounts drawn was payable at the rate of libor plus a margin of per annum for the first six month period and libor plus a margin of for the remaining term 
we were obligated to pay certain commitment and administrative fees in connection with the short term line 
the company  as required  pledged all of the jinhui shares it has purchased as collateral against the short term line 
the short term line incorporated by reference certain covenants from our credit facility 
the short term line was refinanced in july by the credit facility 
credit facility refinanced by the credit facility the company s credit facility  initially for million  was with a syndicate of commercial lenders consisting of nordea bank finland plc  new york branch  dnb nor bank asa  new york branch and citigroup global markets limited 
the credit facility was used to refinance our indebtedness under our original credit facility  and was used to acquire vessels 
under the terms of our credit facility  borrowings in the amount of million were used to repay indebtedness under our original credit facility  and additional net borrowings of million were obtained to fund vessel acquisitions 
in july  the company increased the line of credit by million to a total facility of million 
additionally  on february   we reached an agreement with our lenders to allow us to increase the amount of the credit facility by million  for a total maximum availability of million 
we had the option to increase the facility amount by million increments up to the additional million  so long as at least one bank within the syndicate agreed to fund such increase 
any increase associated with this agreement was generally governed by the existing terms of the credit facility  although we and any banks providing the increase may agree to vary the upfront fees  unutilized commitment fees  or other fees payable by us in connection with the increase 
the credit facility was refinanced in july with the credit facility 
interest rate swap agreements and forward freight agreements and currency swap agreements as of december   the company has entered into nine interest rate swap agreements with dnb nor bank to manage interest costs and the risk associated with changing interest rates 
the total notional principal amount of the swaps is million and the swaps have specified rates and durations 
during january  the company entered into a million dollar interest rate swap at a fixed interest rate of  plus the applicable margin and is effective january  and ends on january  the company has elected to utilize hedge accounting for this interest rate swap 
during february  the company entered into a million dollar interest rate swap at a fixed interest rate of  plus the applicable margin and is effective february  and ends on february  the company has elected to utilize hedge accounting for this interest rate swap 
refer to the table in note of our financial statements  which summarizes the interest rate swaps in place as of december  and the company considered the creditworthiness of both the company and the counterparty in determining the fair value of the interest rate derivatives  and such consideration resulted in an immaterial adjustment to the fair value of derivatives on the balance sheet 
valuations prior to any adjustments for credit risk are validated by comparison with counterparty valuations 
amounts are not and should not be identical due to the different modeling assumptions 
any material differences are investigated 
the company had entered into a number of short term forward currency contracts to protect the company from the risk associated with the fluctuation in the exchange rate associated with the cost basis of the jinhui shares as described above under the heading investments in note of our financial statements 
as forward contracts expired  the company continued to enter into new forward currency contracts for the cost basis of the investment  excluding commissions 
however  hedge accounting is limited to the lower of the cost basis or the market value at time of designation 
the company has elected to discontinue the forward currency contracts as of october  due to the declining underlying market value of jinhui 
as part of our business strategy  we may enter into arrangements commonly known as forward freight agreements  or ffas  to hedge and manage market risks relating to the deployment of our existing fleet of vessels 
these arrangements may include future contracts  or commitments to perform in the future a shipping service between ship owners  charters and traders 
generally  these arrangements would bind us and each counterparty in the arrangement to buy or sell a specified tonnage freighting commitment forward at an agreed time and price and for a particular route 
although ffas can be entered into for a variety of purposes  including for hedging  as an option  for trading or for arbitrage  if we decided to enter into ffas  our objective would be to hedge and manage market risks as part of our commercial management 
it is not currently our intention to enter into ffas to generate a stream of income independent of the revenues we derive from the operation of our fleet of vessels 
if we determine to enter into ffas  we may reduce our exposure to any declines in our results from operations due to weak market conditions or downturns  but may also limit our ability to benefit economically during periods of strong demand in the market 
we have not entered into any ffas as of december interest rates the effective interest rate associated with the interest expense for the term facility and the credit facility  as amended  including the rate differential between the pay fixed receive variable rate on the swaps that were in effect  combined  including the cost associated with unused commitment fees with these facilities for was

the interest rate on the debt  excluding the unused commitment fees  ranged from to and from to for and  respectively 
contractual obligations the following table sets forth our contractual obligations and their maturity dates that are reflective of the subsequent events as described in note subsequent events to our financial statements 
the table incorporates the agreement to acquire three remaining capesize vessels for approximately million  inclusive of commissions for these acquisitions  and the employment agreement entered into in september with the chief financial officer  john wobensmith 
the company plans to fund the remaining acquisitions with the remaining availability under the credit facility and cash generated from operations 
the interest and fees are also reflective of the credit facility  included the amendment  and the interest rate swap agreements as discussed above under interest rate swap agreements and forward freight agreements and currency swap agreements 
total within one year one to three years three to five years more than five years us dollars in thousands credit facility remainder of purchase price of acquisitions interest and borrowing fees executive employment agreement office lease represents the twelve month period ending december  the timing of these obligations are based on estimated delivery dates for the remaining three capesize vessels which are currently being constructed  and the obligation is inclusive of the commission due to brokers upon purchase of the vessels 
interest expense has been estimated using the fixed hedge rate for the effective period and notional amount of the debt which is effectively hedged and for the portion of the debt that has no designated swap against it  plus the applicable bank margin of 
effective january   due to the amendment  the applicable margin increased to irrespective of the total debt to total capitalization ratio 
the company is obligated to pay certain commitment fees in connection with the credit facility 
capital expenditures we make capital expenditures from time to time in connection with our vessel acquisitions 
our fleet currently consists of six capesize drybulk carriers  eight panamax drybulk carriers  four supramax drybulk carriers  six handymax drybulk carriers and eight handysize drybulk carriers 
in addition to acquisitions that we may undertake in future periods  we will incur additional capital expenditures due to special surveys and drydockings 
we estimate our drydocking costs and scheduled off hire days for our fleet through to be estimated drydocking cost estimated offhire days us dollars in millions year the costs reflected are estimates based on drydocking our vessels in china 
we estimate that each drydock will result in days of offhire 
actual costs will vary based on various factors  including where the drydockings are actually performed 
we expect to fund these costs with cash from operations 
during  we completed drydockings for the genco challenger  the genco sugar  the genco acheron  the genco leader  the genco progress  and the genco knight at a combined cost of million 
during  we completed drydockings for the genco surprise  the genco wisdom  the genco prosperity  the genco reliance and genco success at a combined cost of million 
we estimate that seven of our vessels will be drydocked during and an additional three vessels in off balance sheet arrangements we do not have any off balance sheet arrangements 
inflation inflation has only a moderate effect on our expenses given current economic conditions 
in the event that significant global inflationary pressures appear  these pressures would increase our operating  voyage  general and administrative  and financing costs 
however  the company expects its budget to increase based on the anticipated increased cost for crewing  insurance and lubes 
critical accounting policies the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with us gaap 
the preparation of those financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our financial statements 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions and conditions 
critical accounting policies are those that reflect significant judgments of uncertainties and potentially result in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions 
we have described below what we believe are our most critical accounting policies  because they generally involve a comparatively higher degree of judgment in their application 
for an additional description of our significant accounting policies  see note to our consolidated financial statements included in this k 
vessel acquisitions when we enter into an acquisition transaction  we determine whether the acquisition transaction was the purchase of an asset or a business based on the facts and circumstances of the transaction 
as is customary in the shipping industry  the purchase of a vessel is normally treated as a purchase of an asset as the historical operating data for the vessel is not reviewed nor is material to our decision to make such acquisition 
when a vessel is acquired with an existing time charter  we allocate the purchase price of the vessel and the time charter based on  among other things  vessel market valuations and the present value using an interest rate which reflects the risks associated with the acquired charters of the difference between i the contractual amounts to be paid pursuant to the charter terms and ii management s estimate of the fair market charter rate  measured over a period equal to the remaining term of the charter 
the capitalized above market assets and below market liabilities charters are amortized as a reduction or increase  respectively  to voyage revenues over the remaining term of the charter 
revenue and voyage expense recognition revenues are generated from time charter agreements and pool agreements 
a time charter involves placing a vessel at the charterer s disposal for a set period of time during which the charterer may use the vessel in return for the payment by the charterer of a specified daily hire rate 
in time charters  operating costs including crews  maintenance and insurance are typically paid by the owner of the vessel and specified voyage costs such as fuel and port charges are paid by the charterer 
there are certain other non specified voyage expenses such as commissions which are borne by the company 
we record time charter revenues over the term of the charter as service is provided 
revenues are recognized on a straight line basis as the average revenue over the term of the respective time charter agreement 
we recognize vessel operating expenses when incurred 
the  genco thunder and genco leader entered into the baumarine panamax pool during november and december  respectively 
additionally  the genco predator entered into the bulkhandling handymax pool during november vessel pools  such as the baumarine panamax pool and the bulkhandling handymax pool  provide cost effective commercial management activities for a group of similar class vessels 
the pool arrangement provides the benefits of a large scale operation  and chartering efficiencies that might not be available to smaller fleets 
under the pool arrangement  the vessels operate under a time charter agreement whereby the cost of bunkers and port expenses are borne by the pool and operating costs including crews  maintenance and insurance are typically paid by the owner of the vessel 
since the members of the pool share in the revenue generated by the entire group of vessels in the pool  and the pool operates in the spot market  the revenue earned by these three vessels was subject to the fluctuations of the spot market 
the company recognizes revenue from these pool arrangements based on the distributions reported by the applicable pool 
due from charterers  net due from charterers  net includes accounts receivable from charters net of the provision for doubtful accounts 
at each balance sheet date  we provide for the provision based on a review of all outstanding charter receivables 
included in the standard time charter contracts with our customers are certain performance parameters  which if not met can result in customer claims 
as of december   we had a reserve of million against due from charterers balance and an additional reserve of million in deferred revenue  each of which is associated with estimated customer claims against us including vessel performance issues under time charter agreements 
as of december   we had no reserve against due from charterers balance and an additional reserve of million in deferred revenue  each of which is associated with estimated customer claims against us  including time charter performance issues 
revenue is based on contracted charterparties 
however  there is always the possibility of dispute over terms and payment of hires and freights 
in particular  disagreements may arise as to the responsibility of lost time and revenue due to us as a result 
accordingly  we periodically assess the recoverability of amounts outstanding and estimates a provision if there is a possibility of non recoverability 
although we believe its provisions to be reasonable at the time they are made  it is possible that an amount under dispute is not ultimately recovered and the estimated provision for doubtful accounts is inadequate 
depreciation we record the value of our vessels at their cost which includes acquisition costs directly attributable to the vessel and expenditures made to prepare the vessel for its initial voyage less accumulated depreciation 
we depreciate our drybulk vessels on a straight line basis over their estimated useful lives  estimated to be years from the date of initial delivery from the shipyard 
depreciation is based on cost less the estimated residual scrap value 
we estimate the residual values of our vessels to be based upon per lightweight ton 
an increase in the useful life of a drybulk vessel or in its residual value would have the effect of decreasing the annual depreciation charge and extending it into later periods 
a decrease in the useful life of a drybulk vessel or in its residual value would have the effect of increasing the annual depreciation charge 
however  when regulations place limitations over the ability of a vessel to trade on a worldwide basis  we will adjust the vessel s useful life to end at the date such regulations preclude such vessel s further commercial use 
deferred drydocking costs our vessels are required to be drydocked approximately every to months for major repairs and maintenance that cannot be performed while the vessels are operating 
we capitalize the costs associated with drydockings as they occur and amortize these costs on a straight line basis over the period between drydockings 
capitalized drydocking costs include actual costs incurred at the drydock yard  cost of travel  lodging and subsistence of our personnel sent to the drydocking site to supervise  and the cost of hiring a third party to oversee the drydocking 
we believe that these criteria are consistent with us gaap guidelines and industry practice and that our policy of capitalization reflects the economics and market values of the vessels 
costs that are not related to drydocking are expensed as incurred 
impairment of long lived assets we follow the financial accounting standards board fasb statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  which requires impairment losses to be recorded on long lived assets used in operations when indicators of impairment are present and the undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by those assets are less than their carrying amounts 
in the evaluation of the fair value and future benefits of long lived assets  we perform an analysis of the anticipated undiscounted future net cash flows of the related long lived assets 
if the carrying value of the related asset exceeds the undiscounted cash flows  the carrying value is reduced to its fair value 
various factors including anticipated future charter rates  estimated scrap values  future drydocking costs and estimated vessel operating costs  are included in this analysis 
investments the company holds an investment in the capital stock of jinhui shipping and transportation limited jinhui 
jinhui is a drybulk shipping owner and operator focused on the supramax segment of drybulk shipping 
this investment is designated as available for sale and is reported at fair value  with unrealized gains and losses recorded in shareholders equity as a component of oci 
the company classifies the investment as a current or noncurrent asset based on the company s intent to hold the investment at each reporting date 
effective august   the company elected hedge accounting for forward currency contracts in place associated with the cost basis of the jinhui shares and therefore the unrealized currency gain or loss associated with jinhui cost basis is reflected in the income statement as a component of income or loss from derivative instruments to off set the gain or loss associated with these forward currency contracts 
on october   the company elected to discontinue the purchase of forward currency contracts associated with jinhui by entering into an offsetting trade that closed the previously oopened currency contract  thereby eliminating the hedge on jinhui 
the cost of securities when sold is based on the specific identification method 
realized gains and losses on the sale of these securities will be reflected in the consolidated statement of operations in other expense income 
additionally  the realized gain or loss on the forward currency contracts is reflected in the consolidated statement of cash flows as an investing activity and is reflected in the caption payments on forward currency contracts  net 
investments are reviewed quarterly to identify possible other than temporary impairment in accordance with fasb staff position sfas  the meaning of other than temporary impairment and its application to certain investments fsp 
when evaluating the investments  the company reviews factors such as the length of time and extent to which fair value has been below the cost basis  the financial condition of the issuer  the underlying net asset value of the issuers assets and liabilities  and the company s ability and intent to hold the investment for a period of time which may be sufficient for anticipated recovery in market value 
should the decline in the value of any investment be deemed to be other than temporary  the investment basis would be written down to fair market value  and the write down would be reclassified from the statement of equity and recorded as a loss in the income statement for the amount of the impairment 
investments that are not expected to be sold within the next year are classified as noncurrent 
the company s investment in jinhui was deemed to be other than temporarily impaired due to the severity of the decline in its market value versus our cost basis 
the company recorded a million impairment loss which was at december   reclassified from the statement of equity and recorded as a loss in the income statement 
we will continue to evaluate the investment on a quarterly basis to determine the likelihood of any further significant adverse effects on the fair value and amount of any additional impairments 
in the event we determine that the jinhui investment is subject to any additional other than temporary impairment  the amount of the impairment would be reclassified from the statement of equity and recorded as a loss in the income statement for the amount of the impairment 
income taxes pursuant to section of the us internal revenue code of as amended the code  qualified income derived from the international operations of ships is excluded from gross income and exempt from us federal income tax if a company engaged in the international operation of ships meets certain requirements 
among other things  in order to qualify  the company must be incorporated in a country which grants an equivalent exemption to us corporations and must satisfy certain qualified ownership requirements 
we are incorporated in the marshall islands 
pursuant to the income tax laws of the marshall islands  we are not subject to marshall islands income tax 
the marshall islands has been officially recognized by the internal revenue service as a qualified foreign country that currently grants the requisite equivalent exemption from tax 
based on the publicly traded requirement of the section regulations as described in the next paragraph  we believe that we qualified for exemption from income tax for  and based on the ownership of our common stock prior to our initial public offering on july  as discussed in note  we qualified for exemption from income tax for under section  since we were a controlled foreign corporation cfc and satisfied certain other criteria in the section regulations 
we were a cfc  as defined in the code  since through the initial public offering on july   over of our stock was owned by united states holders each of whom owned ten percent or more of our voting stock us owners 
during that time  approximately of our common stock was held by us owners 
based on the publicly traded requirement of the section regulations  we believe that we are qualified for exemption from income tax for  and in order to meet the publicly traded requirement  our stock must be treated as being primarily and regularly traded for more than half the days of any such year 
under the section regulations  our qualification for the publicly traded requirement may be jeopardized if shareholders of our common stock that own five percent or more of our stock shareholders own  in the aggregate  or more of our common stock for more than half the days of the year 
we believe that during  and  the combined ownership of our shareholders did not equal or more of our common stock for more than half the days of  and however if our shareholders were to increase their ownership to or more of our common stock for more than half the days of or any future taxable year  we would not be eligible to claim exemption from tax under section for that taxable year 
we can therefore give no assurance that changes and shifts in the ownership of our stock by shareholders will not preclude us from qualifying for exemption from tax in or in future years 
if the company does not qualify for the exemption from tax under section  it would be subject to a tax on the gross shipping income without the allowance for any deductions that is treated as derived from sources within the united states or united states source shipping income 
for these purposes  shipping income means any income that is derived from the use of vessels  from the hiring or leasing of vessels for use  or from the performance of services directly related to those uses  and united states source shipping income includes of shipping income that is attributable to transportation that begins or ends  but that does not both begin and end  in the united states 
fair value of financial instruments the estimated fair values of our financial instruments such as amounts due to due from charterers  accounts payable and long term debt approximate their individual carrying amounts as of december  and december  due to their short term maturity or the variable rate nature of the respective borrowings under the credit facility 
the fair value of the interest rate swaps and forward currency contracts used for purposes other than trading is the estimated amount we would receive to terminate these agreements at the reporting date  taking into account current interest rates and the creditworthiness of the counterparty for assets and creditworthiness of us for liabilities

derivative financial instruments interest rate risk management we are exposed to the impact of interest rate changes 
our objective is to manage the impact of interest rate changes on its earnings and cash flow in relation to borrowings primarily for the purpose of acquiring drybulk vessels 
these borrowings are subject to a variable borrowing rate 
we use pay fixed receive variable interest rate swaps to manage future interest costs and the risk associated with changing interest rate obligations 
these swaps are designated as cash flow hedges of future variable rate interest payments and are tested for effectiveness on a quarterly basis 
the differential to be paid or received for the effectively hedged portion of any swap agreement is recognized as an adjustment to interest expense as incurred 
additionally  the changes in value for the portion of the swaps that are effectively hedging future interest payments are reflected as a component of oci 
for the portion of the forward interest rate swaps that are not effectively hedged  the change in the value and the rate differential to be paid or received is recognized as income or expense from derivative instruments and is listed as a component of other expense income until such time we have obligations against which the swap is designated and is an effective hedge 
currency risk management we currently hold an investment in jinhui shares that are traded on the oslo stock exchange located in norway  and as such  the company is exposed to the impact of exchange rate changes on this available for sale security denominated in norwegian kroner 
our objective is to manage the impact of exchange rate changes on its earnings and cash flows in relation to its cost basis associated with its investments 
we utilized foreign currency forward contracts to protect its original investment from changing exchange rates through october  when the use of these contracts was discontinued due to the underlying value of jinhui 
the change in the value of the forward currency contracts is recognized as income or expense from derivative instruments and is listed as a component of other expense income 
effective august   we elected to utilize fair value hedge accounting for these instruments whereby the change in the value in the forward contracts continues to be recognized as income or expense from derivative instruments and is listed as a component of other expense income 
fair value hedge accounting then accelerates the recognition of the effective portion of the currency translation gain or loss on the available for sale security from august  from oci into income or expense from derivative instruments and is listed as a component of other expense income 
time value of the forward contracts is excluded from effectiveness testing and recognized currently in income 
on october   we elected to discontinue the purchase of forward currency contracts associated with jinhui by entering into an offsetting trade that closed the previously opened currency contract  thereby eliminating the hedge on jinhui
