during fiscal  and  we incurred million  million and million  respectively  of legal and accounting costs in connection with the company s stock options investigation that was initiated during the fourth quarter of fiscal during the second quarter of fiscal  we recorded a million charge for certain prepaid wafer costs that had been included in other assets in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet 
this charge was recorded due to changes in the company s product plans 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  we recorded a charge of million relating to a percent reduction in force to improve our operating results 
approximately positions were eliminated 
during the fourth quarter of  we recognized a valuation allowance of million against a portion of the company s deferred tax assets 
the increase in the valuation allowance results from uncertainties surrounding the nature and timing of the taxable income required to realize certain tax credits and net operating loss carryforwards

we undertake no obligation to revise or update publicly any forward looking statements for any reason 

table of contents overview the purpose of this overview is to provide context for the discussion and analysis of our financial statements that follows by briefly summarizing the most important known trends and uncertainties  as well as the key performance indicators  on which our executives are primarily focused for both the short and long term 
actel corporation is the leading supplier of low power fpgas  mixed signal fpgas  and system critical fpgas 
attacking power consumption from both the chip and the system levels  the company s innovative programmable logic solutions enable power efficient design 
in support of our nonvolatile flash and antifuse based fpgas  we offer design and development software and tools to optimize power consumption  power smart ip cores  including industry standard processor technologies  small footprint packaging  programming hardware and starter kits  and a variety of design services 
we target a wide range of applications in the aerospace  automotive  avionics  communications  consumer  industrial  medical  and military markets that require low power or other attributes of our nonvolatile flash and antifuse based technologies that have an inherent competitive advantage 
semiconductor industry according to the semiconductor industry association sia  global sales of semiconductors were severely impacted by the world wide economic turmoil in resulting in the first year on year drop in sales since total sales for were billion compared with billion reported for weakening demand for the major drivers of semiconductor sales including automotive products  personal computers  cell phones and corporate information technology products resulted in a sharp drop in industry sales that affected nearly all product lines 
sia projects that sales will decline by percent to billion before resuming growth in logic market the logic market is highly fragmented and includes asics and plds 
fpgas are one type of pld 
price  performance  reliability  power consumption  security  density  features  ease of use  and time to market determine the degree to which plds compete for specific applications 
unlike asics  which are customized for use in a specific application at the time of manufacture  plds are manufactured as standard components and customized in the field  allowing the same device type to be used for many different applications 
using software tools  users program their design into a pld  resulting in lower development costs and inventory risks  shorter design cycles  and faster time to market 
technology to a great extent  the characteristics of an fpga are dictated by the technology used to make the device programmable 
devices based on nonvolatile flash or antifuse programming elements offer significant power  single chip  live at power up  security  and neutron immunity advantages over volatile fpgas based on sram technology 
flash we believe that our long term future lies with flash technology  which permits us to make fpgas that are both nonvolatile and reprogrammable 
perhaps the single biggest benefit of a nonvolatile flash based fpga array is significantly reduced power consumption 
even though our flash technology is unique  the process is very similar to the standard embedded flash memory process  so we are able to share with others most of the burden of developing and proving the process 
while we were the first company to sell flash based fpgas  several suppliers of sram based fpgas claim to offer single chip  flash based solutions 
however  these hybrid solutions are merely combinations of flash memory components with the underlying sram fpga technology either integrated with the fpga die into a single package or  alternatively  stacked or placed side by side 
the fpga array is still sram  so it is still subject to drawbacks associated with that technology 
these hybrid approaches mitigate some of the limitations of traditional sram based solutions by providing a smaller footprint  a minor reduction in power consumption  and small advances in power up time and security  but they are only incremental improvements over pure sram based fpgas 
since the embedded flash memory controls only the initial configuration of hybrid devices during power up  these solutions cannot offer the full advantages of flash 
table of contents technology provided by our nonvolatile flash based fpgas exponentially lower power consumption  faster response times  unparalleled reliability  and uncompromising security 
antifuse the one time programmability of our antifuse based fpgas is desirable in certain system critical military and aerospace applications  but commercial customers generally prefer reprogrammable solutions  such as sram or flash based fpgas 
in addition  we are the only sizeable company that uses antifuse technology  which means we bear the entire burden of developing and proving antifuse processes including yields and reliability and products including switching elements and architectures 
it also means that our fpgas using antifuse technology are typically one or two generations behind competitive sram based solutions manufactured on standard processes 
strategy our strategy is to offer fpgas to markets in which our nonvolatile flash and antifuse based technologies have an inherent competitive advantage 
our strategy involves considerable risk as unique technologies and products can take years to develop  if at all  and markets that we target may fail to emerge 
however  in addition to single chip  live at power up  security  and neutron immunity benefits  we believe that our nonvolatile fpga solutions offer substantial low power advantages over volatile devices based on sram technology and we plan to exploit those advantages 
key indicators although we measure the condition and performance of our business in numerous ways  the key quantitative indicators that we generally use to manage the business are bookings  design wins  margins  yields  and backlog 
we also carefully monitor the progress of our product development efforts 
of these  we think that bookings and backlog are the best indicators of short term performance and that design wins and product development progress are the best indicators of long term performance 
our design wins were lower in when compared with flash design wins were up slightly but this was more than offset by decreases in design wins for our antifuse products 
our bookings measured as end customer orders placed on us and our distributors were higher during than during contributing to higher revenues in however our backlog which may be cancelled or rescheduled by the customer on short notice without significant penalty was lower at the end of than at the end of 
table of contents results of operations the following table sets forth certain financial data from the consolidated statements of operations expressed as a percentage of net revenues years ended jan

 net revenues cost of revenues gross margin research and development selling  general  and administrative restructuring charge amortization of acquisition related intangibles income loss from operations interest income and other  net of expense income loss before tax provision benefit tax provision benefit net income loss net revenues we derive our revenues primarily from the sale of fpgas  which accounted for over of net revenues in  and non fpga revenues are derived from our protocol design services organization  royalties  and the licensing of software and sale of hardware used to design and program our fpgas 
we believe that we derived at least of our revenues in from sales of fpgas to customers serving the military and aerospace and the communications markets  compared with at least and in and  respectively 
we have experienced  and may again in the future experience  substantial period to period fluctuations in operating results due to conditions in each of these markets as well as in the general economy 
net revenues in were million  an increase of over this increase was due primarily to a increase in the number of units shipped that was partially off set by a decrease of in the overall average selling price asp 
the overall asp decreased primarily due to a change in our product mix the sales of mature products  which usually have higher asps  decreased by approximately from the previous year while sales of new products  particularly our flash products  which usually have lower asps  have increased by approximately from the previous year 
flash products sales increased by to of our net revenue for in  flash product sales accounted for of our net revenue 
net revenues in were also favorably impacted by royalty revenue of million compared with million in royalties in included million associated with the settlement of certain prior year claims 
net revenues in were million  an increase of over this increase was due primarily to a increase in the number of units shipped that was partially off set by a decrease of in the overall average selling price asp 
the overall asp decreased primarily due to a change in our product mix the sales of mature products  which usually have higher asps  decreased by approximately from the previous year while sales of new products  particularly our flash products  which usually have lower asps  have increased by approximately from the previous year 
we shipped approximately of our net revenues through the distribution sales channel in compared with in and in we generally do not recognize revenue on product shipped to a distributor until the distributor resells the product to its customer 

table of contents sales to customers outside the united states accounted for of net revenues in  in and in with european customers representing of net revenues in compared with of net revenues for and for gross margin gross margin was of revenues in compared with in and in gross margin in was favorably impacted by higher sales of radiation tolerant products which are associated with higher gross margins 
this was partially offset by increased sales of lower margin flash products 
in addition  as noted above  royalty revenue was million for compared with million in we seek to reduce costs and improve gross margins by improving wafer yields  negotiating price reductions with suppliers  increasing the level and efficiency of our testing and packaging operations  achieving economies of scale by means of higher production levels  and increasing the number of die produced per wafer  principally by shrinking the die size of our products 
no assurance can be given that these efforts will be successful 
our capability to shrink the die size of our fpgas is dependent on the availability of more advanced manufacturing processes 
due to the custom steps involved in manufacturing antifuse and to a lesser extent flash fpgas  we typically obtain access to new manufacturing processes later than our competitors using standard manufacturing processes 
research and development r d r d expenditures were million  or of net revenues  in compared with million  or of net revenues  in and million  or of net revenues  in r d spending in increased due to increased spending on mask revisions  wafer development costs  and outside services and higher costs associated with increased headcount coupled with increased operating costs associated with pigeon point systems which was acquired during the third quarter of r d spending in included a million charge during the second quarter to write off certain wafer prepayments combined with a charge of million during the first quarter of fiscal for re work of certain products under development 
in addition  included generally higher costs associated with expanded r d efforts and increased headcount 
stock based compensation expenses under sfas r were million in compared with million in and million in our r d consists of circuit design  software development  and process technology activities 
we believe that continued substantial investment in r d is critical to maintaining a strong technological position in the industry 
since our antifuse and to a lesser extent flash fpgas are manufactured using customized processes that require a substantial time to develop  our r d expenditures will probably always be higher as a percentage of net revenues than that of our major competitors using standard manufacturing processes 
selling  general  and administrative sg a sg a expenses in were million  or of net revenues  compared with million  or of net revenues  in and million  or of net revenues  in costs associated with the company s stock option investigation were million in  million in and million in excluding the impact of the stock option investigation costs  sg a costs increased in due to higher selling costs  commissions and incentive compensation associated with the increase in net revenue 
sg a expenses in included million in legal settlements resulting from the btr and zilog patent infringement claims 
stock based compensation expenses under sfas r were million in compared with million in and million in restructuring charges restructuring charges of million were primarily related to employee compensation and related charges  including stock compensation expenses 
million in restructuring charges remain on our consolidated balance sheet as of january  and are included in accounts payable and accrued compensation and employee benefits 

table of contents on february  the company announced a longer term corporate wide restructuring plan designed to significantly reduce operating expenses during fiscal and continuing into the middle of we announced our intention to reduce operating expenses by approximately million per quarter by the third quarter of when compared with the third quarter of we implemented the first step of reductions during the fourth quarter of fiscal as discussed in note in the notes to the consolidated financials statements and expect to announce a second round of staff reductions during the first quarter of we currently expect to record charges of between million and million during the first quarter of fiscal for severance and other costs related to the next phase of our restructuring plans 
amortization of other acquisition related intangibles amortization of other acquisition related intangibles was million in  in and  in during the third quarter of fiscal  the company acquired million of identified intangible assets in connection with the acquisition of pigeon point systems 
as a result of this  we recorded million in amortization of identified intangible assets for fiscal the  cost in was attributable to intangible assets related to an acquisition completed in the year  which were fully amortized during the second quarter of interest income and other  net of expense interest income and other  net of expense  was million  million and million in  and  respectively 
our average investment portfolio balance was million in compared with million in and million in for  our average investment portfolio return on investment was compared with in and in  resulting in lower interest income during fiscal as compared with prior years 
during  in light of the bankruptcy filing by lehman brothers  we concluded that our investment in lehman brothers corporate bonds was other than temporarily impaired and therefore wrote down the investment to its fair market value 
the impairment charge of approximately million was included in interest income and other  net  on our consolidated statement of operations for the year ended january  we invest excess liquidity in investment portfolios consisting primarily of corporate bonds  floating rate notes  and federal and municipal obligations 
in periods where market interest rates are falling  and for some time after rates stabilize  we typically experience declines in interest income and other as our older debt investments at higher interest rates mature and are replaced by new investments at the lower rates available in the market 
tax provision benefit significant components affecting the effective tax rate include pre tax net income or loss  federal r d tax credits  non deductible stock based compensation  the state composite tax rate  and recognition of a valuation allowance against certain deferred tax assets 
our tax provision for was million based on income before income taxes of million 
the difference between the effective tax rate and the statutory tax rate is primarily due to recognition of a valuation allowance of million against a portion of the company s deferred tax assets  non deductible stock based compensation partially offset by research tax credits and state tax benefits 
the increase in the valuation allowance results from uncertainties surrounding the nature and timing of the taxable income required to realize certain tax credits and net operating loss carryforwards 
our tax benefit for was representing an effective tax rate of 
the difference between the effective tax rate and the statutory tax rate is primarily due to non deductible stock based compensation partially offset by research tax credits and state tax benefits 
our tax provision for was million despite a pre tax loss of million 
this tax charge is primarily due to non deductible stock based compensation 

table of contents financial condition  liquidity  and capital resources our total assets were million at the end of compared with million at the end of the decrease in total assets was attributable principally to decreases in cash  cash equivalents  accounts receivable  and deferred tax assets  partially offset by an increase in inventory 
the following table sets forth certain financial data from the consolidated balance sheets expressed as the percentage change from january  to january  as of as of jan

 change change in thousands cash and cash equivalents  short and long term investments accounts receivable  net inventories year ended jan 
 jan 
 in thousands net cash provided by operating activities net cash provided by used in investing activities net cash used in financing activities cash  cash equivalents  and investments our cash  cash equivalents  and short term investments were million at the end of compared with million at the end of this decrease of million from the end of was due primarily to expenditures of million to purchase property and equipment  million used to repurchase common stock and million used for the acquisition of pigeon point systems 
this was partially offset by million of net cash provided by operating activities 
cash provided by operating activities for included adjustments for non cash charges of million for depreciation and amortization  million for non cash stock compensation  decreases in accounts receivable of million  decreases in deferred tax assets of million  and an increase in accounts payable and other liabilities of million 
these were partially off set by a net loss of million  increases in inventory of million  increases in other assets  net  of million  and decreases in deferred income of million 
the increase in inventory relates to the build up of the flash products as discussed more fully below 
cash provided by operating activities for included non cash charges of million for depreciation and amortization  million for non cash stock compensation  a charge of million against certain wafer prepayments  decreases in accounts receivable of million  and decreases in inventory of million 
these were partially off set by a net loss of million  decreases in accounts payable and other liabilities of million  increases in license agreements of million  and decreases in deferred income of million 
the decreases in accounts payable and other liabilities is primarily due to payments made under accrued license agreements and payments of accruals for legal settlements recorded in spending on property and equipment amounted to million in cash proceeds from the issuance of common stock under employee stock plans amounted to million in and none in we meet all of our funding needs for ongoing operations with internally generated cash flows from operations and with existing cash and short term investment balances 
we believe that existing cash  cash equivalents  and short term investments  together with cash generated from operations  will be sufficient to meet our cash requirements for the following twelve months 
a portion of available cash may be used for investment in or acquisition of complementary businesses  products  or technologies 
wafer manufacturers have at times demanded financial support from customers in the form of equity investments and advance purchase price deposits  which in 
table of contents some cases have been substantial 
should we require additional capacity  we may be required to incur significant expenditures to secure such capacity 
the following represents contractual commitments associated with operating leases and capital leases million relates to capital lease and the related interest portion is immaterial as of january  payments due by period total and later in thousands operating and capital leases purchase orders or contracts for the purchase of raw materials and other goods and services are not included in the table above 
we are not able to determine the aggregate amount of such purchase orders that represent contractual obligations as purchase orders may represent authorizations to purchase rather than binding agreements 
for the purposes of this table  contractual obligations for purchase of goods or services are defined as agreements that are enforceable and legally binding on us and that specify all significant terms  including fixed or minimum quantities to be purchased  fixed  minimum or variable price provisions  and the approximate timing of the transaction 
our purchase orders are based on our current manufacturing needs and fulfilled by our vendors within short time horizons 
we do not have significant agreements for the purchase of raw materials or other goods specifying minimum quantities or set prices that exceed our expected requirements for three months 
we also enter into contracts for outsourced services  however  the obligations under these contracts were not significant and the contracts generally contain clauses allowing for cancellation without significant penalty 
we believe that the availability of adequate financial resources is a substantial competitive factor 
to take advantage of opportunities as they arise  or to withstand adverse business conditions when they occur  it may become prudent or necessary for us to raise additional capital 
no assurance can be given that additional capital would become available on acceptable terms if needed 
accounts receivable our net accounts receivable was million at the end of compared with million at the end of typically  shipments are higher in the last month of the quarter but in december  shipments were lower due to the company having a two week shutdown 
the shutdown in december was longer than the shutdown in december total shipments in the quarter were also lower compared with the fourth quarter of largely as a result of the current worldwide economic conditions 
the decrease in net accounts receivable was also due to improved collection efforts during the fiscal year 
net accounts receivable represented days of sales outstanding at the end of fiscal compared with days at the end of fiscal we sell our products to distributors who resell our products to oems or their contract manufacturers 
our payment terms generally require the distributor to settle amounts owed to us based on list price  which typically may be in excess of their ultimate cost as a result of agreements with the distributors allowing for price adjustments and credits 
accordingly  when a distributors resale is priced at a discount from list price  we credit back to the distributor a portion of their original purchase price  usually within days after the resale transaction has been reported to the company 
this practice has an adverse impact on the working capital of our distributors since they are required to pay the full list price to actel and receive a subsequent discount only after the product has been sold to a third party 
as a consequence  beginning in the third quarter of fiscal  we have entered into written business arrangements with certain distributors whereby we issue advance credits to the distributors to minimize the adverse impact on the distributor s working capital 
the advance credits are updated and settled on a quarterly basis 
the advance credits have no impact on our revenue recognition since revenue from distributors is not recognized until the distributor sells the product but the advance credits do reduce our accounts receivable and our deferred income on shipments to distributors as reflected in our consolidated balance sheet 
the amount of the advance credits was million as of january  and million as of january  
table of contents inventories our net inventories were million at the end of compared with million at the end of the third quarter of  million at the end of the second quarter of and million at the end of net inventory increased by million from the second quarter of to the third quarter of and by million from the third quarter of to the fourth quarter of these sequential increases were due to an inventory build up of new flash products  including fusion  igloo  and proasic the company has historically built up inventories of new products early in their life cycles  but the recent build up in inventory for the new flash products was particularly pronounced due to a conscious effort to support increased turns business and shorter lead times for the consumer products at which the new flash products are targeted 
we experienced very strong booking for these products in the first quarter of and accordingly initiated a ramp up of manufacturing 
however  a significant amount of these orders were cancelled in the second and third quarter of as a result of the worldwide economic crisis 
nonetheless  sales of our flash products have grown  and we currently expect that they will continue to grow  but at a much slower pace than we had expected early in beginning august  we reduced our wafer starts for flash products to the lowest levels practicable and will continue to restrict flash wafer starts based on inventory levels and forecast sales of flash products 
however  in order to preserve our relationships with our foundries  the company must continue to build certain minimum levels of flash products during and thereafter  so an extended period of time will probably be necessary in order to draw down inventory levels closer to historical norms 
we believe our flash products are still attractive to our targeted customer base 
we continue to focus our efforts on growing the flash business and are aggressively marketing our flash products in an effort to reduce our inventory 
this may include certain promotional pricing for large volume orders  which may negatively impact our gross margins 
we are also monitoring market trends and significant events that may have an adverse impact on the carrying value of our inventory  but based on the information available at this time  we do not believe that any lower of cost or market or excess inventory writedowns were required as of january  however  if our business outlook changes in the future or if the current economic downturn continues or worsens  the company may be required to establish reserves for a portion of the flash inventory which could have a materially adverse affect on our business  financial condition  and or results of operations 
we continue to hold material from last time buy inventory purchases made in  and from two wafer manufacturers for some of our mature product families 
last time buys occur when a wafer supplier is about to shut down the manufacturing line used to make a product and we believe that our then current inventories are insufficient to meet foreseeable future demand 
inventory purchased in last time buy transactions is evaluated on an ongoing basis for indications of excess or obsolescence based on rates of actual sell through  expected future demand for those products  and any other qualitative factors that may indicate the existence of excess or obsolete inventory 
inventory at january  and january   included million and million  respectively  of inventory purchased in last time buy 
during  we recorded a write down against last time buy inventory of million 
during  we recorded a write down against last time buy inventory of million 
our fpgas are manufactured using customized steps that are added to the standard manufacturing processes of our independent wafer suppliers  so our manufacturing cycle is generally longer and more difficult to adjust in response to changing demands or delivery schedules than our competitors using standard processes 
accordingly  our inventory levels will probably always be higher than that of our major competitors using standard processes 
property and equipment our net property and equipment was million at the end of compared with million at the end of we invested million in property and equipment in compared with million in the increase in capital expenditures for was primarily due to purchases of additional offshore testing and manufacturing equipment and the installation of solar panels at the company s headquarters in mountain view  california 
capital expenditures during the past two years have been primarily for engineering  manufacturing  and office equipment 
depreciation of property and equipment was million in compared with million in we currently expect to incur capital expenditures of approximately million in 
table of contents goodwill and other intangible assets  net our net goodwill and other intangible assets were million at the end of and million at the end of net goodwill and other intangible assets increased by million due to our acquisition of pigeon point systems in the third quarter of  which was partially offset by a slight decrease due to the realization of certain net operating loss carryforwards associated with our acquisition of gatefield corporation in we had originally established a valuation allowance for a portion of the net operating loss carryforwards acquired in connection with the acquisition of gatefield 
to the extent such valuation allowance is subsequently reversed as a result of the realization of the deferred tax asset  sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes sfas  requires that the offsetting credit is recognized first as a reduction of goodwill 
during the third quarter of fiscal  the company acquired million of identified intangible assets in connection with the acquisition of pigeon point systems 
as a result of this  we recorded million in amortization of identified intangible assets for goodwill is recorded when consideration paid in an acquisition exceeds the fair value of the net tangible and intangible assets acquired 
we account for goodwill in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas  which addresses the financial accounting and reporting standards for goodwill and other intangible assets subsequent to their acquisition 
under sfas  we do not amortize goodwill  but instead test for impairment annually or more frequently if certain events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
we completed our annual goodwill impairment tests during the fourth quarters of and  and noted no indicators of impairment 
we start with our market capitalization as the initial basis for the analysis and due to the current economic environment  we performed a detailed review of our stock price and book value per share for the fourth quarter 
although current economic conditions have had a negative impact on the company s stock price  as well as a significant number of other companies  our average stock price in december and the stock price at the end of our fiscal year were above our book value 
in addition to our market capitalization  we also consider other factors in determining our enterprise fair value including control premiums from observable transactions involving controlling interests in comparable companies as well as overall market conditions 
although there has been volatility in our stock and at times  our stock has fallen below our book value  we believe these declines in our stock price to be temporary and this temporary decline does not reflect an impairment in the carrying value of our goodwill as of january  our stock price has declined during the first quarter of  consistent with the decline in the overall market 
we will closely monitor this trend and consider whether an event has occurred or there has been a change in circumstances that would more likely than not reduce our enterprise fair value to be below our book value and  if necessary  we will adjust our book value of goodwill 
other assets  net our other assets  net  were million at the end of compared with million at the end of the increase was due primarily to an increase of million in license agreements partially off set by million decrease in deferred compensation plan assets 
current liabilities our total current liabilities were million at the end of compared with million at the end of the increase was due primarily to an increase in accrued compensation and employee benefits of million and an increase in other accrued liabilities of million which was partially offset by decreases in accounts payable of million and a decrease in accrued license agreements of million  and a decrease in deferred income on shipments to distributors of million 
shareholders equity shareholders equity was million at the end of compared with million at the end of the decrease in was due mostly to the net loss of million combined with the repurchases of our common stock of million 
these were partially off set by stock based compensation charges of million and 
table of contents issuances of common stock under our employee stock plans of million  net of tax withholding on restricted stock

this fsp clarifies the application of sfas no 
 fair value measurements sfas  in a market that is not active and provides an example to illustrate key considerations in determining the fair value of a financial asset when the market for that financial asset is not active 
this fsp was effective upon issuance  including prior periods for which financial statements have not been issued 
the adoption of this fsp did not have an impact on our consolidated financial statements 
critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states gaap 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues  and expenses and the related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
the us securities and exchange commission has defined critical accounting policies as those that are most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results and also require us to make the most difficult  complex and subjective judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
based upon this definition  our most critical policies include revenue recognition  inventories  stock based compensation  legal matters  goodwill and long lived asset impairment and income taxes 
these policies  as well as the estimates and judgments involved  are discussed below 
we also have other key accounting policies that either do not generally require us to make estimates and judgments that are as difficult or as subjective or they are less likely to have a material impact on our reported results of operations for a given period 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ materially from these estimates 
in addition  if these estimates or their related assumptions change in the future  it could result in material expenses being recognized on the consolidated statements of operations 
revenues we sell our products to oems and to distributors who resell our products to oems or their contract manufacturers 
we recognize revenue on products sold to our oems upon shipment 
revenues generated by the protocol design services organization are recognized as the services are performed 
because sales to our distributors are generally made under agreements allowing for price adjustments  credits  and right of return under certain circumstances  we generally defer recognition of revenue on products sold to distributors until the products are resold by the distributor and price adjustments are determined at which time our final net sales price is fixed 
deferred revenue net of the corresponding deferred cost of sales are recorded in the caption deferred income 
table of contents on shipments to distributors in the liability section of the consolidated balance sheet 
deferred income effectively represents the gross margin on the sale to the distributor  however  the amount of gross margin we recognize in future periods will be less than the originally recorded deferred income as a result of negotiated price concessions 
distributors resell our products to end customers at various negotiated price points which vary by end customer  product  quantity  geography and competitive pricing environments 
when a distributor s resale is priced at a discount from list price  we credit back to the distributor a portion of their original purchase price after the resale transaction is complete 
thus  a portion of the deferred income on shipments to distributors balance will be credited back to the distributor in the future 
based upon historical trends and inventory levels on hand at each of our distributors as of january   we currently estimate that approximately million of the deferred income on shipments to distributors on the company s consolidated balance sheet as of january   will be credited back to the distributors in the future 
these amounts will not be recognized as revenue and gross margin in our consolidated statement of operations 
since we expect our distributors to turn their inventory balances five to six times a year  we expect that a majority of the inventory held by our distributors at the end of any quarter will be resold to end customers over the next two quarters 
revenue recognition depends on notification from the distributor that product has been resold 
this reported information includes product resale price  quantity  and end customer information as well as inventory balances on hand 
our revenue reporting is dependent on us receiving timely and accurate data from our distributors 
in determining the appropriate amount of revenue to recognize  we use this data from our distributors and apply judgment in reconciling differences between their reported inventory and sell through activities 
because of the time involved in collecting  assimilating and analyzing the data provided by our distributors  we receive actual sell through revenue one month in arrears 
this practice requires us to make an estimate of one month s distributor sell through activity at the end of each fiscal quarter 
this estimate is adjusted the following month to reflect actual sell through activity reported by our distributors 
we record a provision for price adjustments on unsold merchandise shipped to distributors in the same period as the related revenues are recorded 
if market conditions were to decline  we may need to take action with our distributors to ensure the sell through of inventory already in the channel 
these actions during a market downturn could result in incrementally greater reductions to net revenues than otherwise would be expected 
we also record a provision for estimated sales returns on products shipped directly to end customers in the same period as the related revenues are recorded 
the provision for sales returns is based on historical sales returns  analysis of credit memo data  and other factors 
if our calculation of these estimates does not properly reflect future return patterns  future net revenues could be materially different 
inventories we believe that a certain level of inventory must be carried to maintain an adequate supply of product for customers 
this inventory level may vary based upon orders received from customers or internal forecasts of demand for these products 
other considerations in determining inventory levels include the stage of products in the product life cycle  design win activity  manufacturing lead times  customer demands  strategic relationships with foundries  and competitive situations in the marketplace 
should any of these factors develop other than anticipated  inventory levels may be materially and adversely affected 
we write down our inventory for estimated obsolescence or unmarketability equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated realizable value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
to address this difficult  subjective  and complex area of judgment  we apply a methodology that includes assumptions and estimates to arrive at the net realizable value 
first  we identify any inventory that has been previously written down in prior periods 
this inventory remains written down until sold  destroyed  or otherwise dispositioned 
second  we examine inventory line items that may have some form of non conformance with electrical and mechanical standards 
third  we assess the inventory not otherwise identified to be written down against product history and forecasted demand typically for the next six months 
finally  we analyze the result of this methodology in light of the product life cycle  design win activity  and competitive situation in the marketplace to derive an outlook for consumption of the inventory and the appropriateness of the resulting inventory levels 
if actual future demand or market conditions are less favorable than those we have projected  additional inventory write downs may be required 

table of contents the company will typically build up inventories of new products early in their life cycles in order to support anticipated demand and to provide stock inventory to distributors to support initial sales of the product 
the company will also establish sufficient inventory levels of new products to respond quickly to new customer orders 
accordingly  we typically do not establish excess inventory reserves for newer products until we have developed sufficient trend information to support reasonable assumptions regarding acceptance of the product and future demand trends 
once the product has been available on the market for a sufficient period of time  generally two years or more  the company will begin to assess the need for excess inventory reserves based on history and forecasted demand as noted above 
our inventory valuation policies also take into consideration last time buy inventory purchases 
last time buys occur when a wafer supplier is about to shut down the manufacturing line used to make a product and we believe that our then current inventories are insufficient to meet foreseeable future demand 
we made last time buys of certain products from our wafer suppliers in  and since this inventory was not acquired to meet current demand  we apply a discrete write down policy for inventory purchased in last time buy transactions and the related inventory are excluded from the standard excess and obsolescence write down policy 
inventory purchased in last time buy transactions will be evaluated on an ongoing basis for indications of excess or obsolescence based on rates of actual sell through  expected future demand for those products over a longer time horizon  and any other qualitative factors that may indicate the existence of excess or obsolete inventory 
evaluations of last time buy inventory in resulted in write downs of million 
evaluations of last time buy inventory in resulted in write downs of million 
these write downs were taken because actual sell through results did not meet expectations or estimations of expected future demand 
legal matters and loss contingencies from time to time we are notified of claims  including claims that we may be infringing patents owned by others  or otherwise become aware of conditions  situations  or circumstances involving uncertainty as to the existence of a liability or the amount of a loss 
when probable and reasonably estimable  we make provisions for estimated liabilities 
as we sometimes have in the past  we may settle disputes and or obtain licenses under patents that we are alleged to infringe 
we can offer no assurance that any pending or threatened claim or other loss contingency will be resolved or that the resolution of any such claim or contingency will not have a materially adverse effect on our business  financial condition  and or results of operations 
our failure to resolve a claim could result in litigation or arbitration  which can result in significant expense and divert the efforts of our technical and management personnel  whether or not determined in our favor 
our evaluation of the impact of these claims and contingencies could change based upon new information 
subject to the foregoing  we do not believe that the resolution of any pending or threatened legal claim or loss contingency is likely to have a materially adverse effect on our financial position  or results of operations or cash flows 
actel was a nominal defendant in a consolidated shareholder derivative action filed in the united states district court for the northern district of california the court against certain current and former officers and directors 
under the terms and conditions of a settlement agreement submitted to the court for approval  actel and its insurer paid plaintiffs counsel attorneys fees and reimbursement of expenses in the aggregate amount of million  of which the company paid  on july   the court signed an order granting final approval of the settlement agreement 
the order reduced the plaintiffs attorney fees from million to approximately million  as a result of which the company received a refund of approximately  income taxes we account for income taxes in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes sfas  which requires that deferred tax assets and liabilities be recognized using enacted tax rates for the effect of temporary differences between the book and tax bases of recorded assets and liabilities 
sfas also requires that deferred tax assets be reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
we evaluate annually the realizability of our deferred tax assets by assessing our valuation allowance and  if necessary  we adjust the amount of such allowance 
the factors used to assess the likelihood of realization include our forecast of future taxable income and available tax planning strategies that could be implemented to realize the net deferred tax assets 
we assessed our deferred tax assets at the end of 
table of contents and determined that it was more likely than not that we would not be able to realize approximately million of net deferred tax assets based upon our forecast of future taxable income and other relevant factors 
should factors change impacting our forecast of future taxable income in determining the realizability of our net deferred tax assets  we may be required to recognize additional valuation allowance in future periods 
stock based compensation expense we account for stock based compensation in accordance with sfas no 
revised  share based payment  sfas r 
under the fair value recognition provisions of sfas r  we estimate the fair value of our employee stock awards at the date of grant using the black scholes merton option pricing model  which requires the use of certain subjective assumptions 
the most significant of these assumptions are our estimates of expected volatility of the market price of our stock and the expected term of the stock award 
we have determined that historical volatility is the best predictor of expected volatility and the expected term of our awards was determined taking into consideration the vesting period of the award  the contractual term and our historical experience of employee stock option exercise behavior 
as required under the accounting rules  we review our valuation assumptions at each grant date and  as a result  we could change our assumptions used to value employee stock based awards granted in future periods 
in addition  we are required to estimate the expected forfeiture rate and only recognize expense for those awards expected to vest 
if our actual forfeiture rate were materially different from our estimate  the stock based compensation expense would be different from what we have recorded in the current period 
the fair value of restricted stock units was calculated based upon the fair value of our common stock at the date of grant 
further  sfas r requires that employee stock based compensation costs be recognized over the vesting period of the award and we have elected the straight line method as the basis for recording our expense 
the company recorded million  million  and million of stock based compensation expense for the years ended january   january   and december   respectively 
as required by sfas r  management made an estimate of expected forfeitures and is recognizing compensation costs only for those equity awards expected to vest 
as of january   the total compensation cost related to options and nonvested stock granted to employees under the company s stock option plans but not yet recognized was approximately million  net of estimated forfeitures of approximately million 
this cost will be amortized over a weighted average period of years and will be adjusted for subsequent changes in estimated forfeitures 
as of january   the total compensation cost related to options to purchase shares of the company s common stock under the espp but not yet recognized was approximately million 
this cost will be amortized over a weighted average period of years 
long lived assets impairment we review property and equipment and intangible assets  excluding goodwill  for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
if property and equipment and intangible assets are considered to be impaired  the impairment to be recognized equals the amount by which the carrying value of the asset exceeds its fair market value 
no material adjustments were made to our long lived assets in any of the years presented 
we account for goodwill and other intangible assets under sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas 
under this standard  goodwill is tested for impairment annually or more frequently if certain events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value 
the two step impairment test identifies potential goodwill impairment and measures the amount of a goodwill impairment loss to be recognized if any 
the first step of the goodwill impairment test  used to identify potential impairment  compares the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount  including goodwill 
we are a single reporting unit under sfas and we use an enterprise approach to determine our total fair value 
since the best evidence of fair value is quoted market prices in active markets  we start with our market capitalization as the initial basis for the analysis 
we also consider other factors including control premiums from observable transactions involving controlling interests in comparable companies as well as overall market conditions 
as long as we determine our total enterprise fair value is greater than our book value and we remain a single reporting unit  our goodwill will be considered not impaired  and the second step of the impairment test under sfas will be 
table of contents unnecessary 
if our total enterprise fair value were to fall below our book value  we would proceed to the second step of the goodwill impairment test  which measures the amount of impairment loss by comparing the implied fair value of our goodwill with the carrying amount of our goodwill 
as a result of this analysis we may be required to write down our goodwill  and recognize a goodwill impairment loss  equal to the difference between the book value of goodwill and its implied fair value 
sfas also requires that intangible assets with definite lives be amortized over their estimated useful lives and reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate an asset s carrying value may not be recoverable in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of sfas 
currently we amortize our acquired intangible assets with definite lives over periods ranging primarily from one to seven years 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk as of january   our investment portfolio consisted primarily of asset backed obligations  corporate bonds  floating rate notes  and federal and municipal obligations 
the principal objectives of our investment activities are to preserve principal  meet liquidity needs  and maximize yields 
to meet these objectives  we invest excess liquidity only in high credit quality debt securities with average maturities of less than two years 
we also limit the percentage of total investments that may be invested in any one issuer 
corporate investments as a group are also limited to a maximum percentage of our investment portfolio 
our investments in debt securities  which totaled million at january   are subject to interest rate risk 
an increase in interest rates could subject us to a decline in the market value of our investments 
these risks are mitigated by our ability to hold these investments for a period of time sufficient to recover the carrying value of the investment which may not be until maturity 
a hypothetical basis point increase in interest rates compared with interest rates at january   and january   would result in a reduction of approximately million and million  respectively  in the fair value of our available for sale debt securities held at january   and january   respectively 
the potential changes noted above are based upon sensitivity analyses performed on our financial position at january  actual results may differ materially 
in addition to interest rate risk  we are subject to market risk on our investments 
we monitor all of our investments for impairment on a periodic basis 
in the event that the carrying value of the investment exceeds its fair value and the decline in value is determined to be other than temporary  the carrying value is reduced to its current fair market value 
in the absence of other overriding factors  we consider a decline in market value to be other than temporary when a publicly traded stock or a debt security has traded below book value for a consecutive six month period 
if an investment continues to trade below book value for more than six months  and mitigating factors such as general economic and industry specific trends including the creditworthiness of the issuer are not present this investment would be evaluated for impairment and written down to a balance equal to the estimated fair value at the time of impairment  with the amount of the write down recorded in interest income and other  net  on the consolidated statements of operations 
if management concludes it has the intent and ability as necessary  to hold such securities for a period of time sufficient to allow for an anticipated recovery of fair value up to the cost of the investment  and the issuers of the securities are creditworthy  no other than temporary impairment is deemed to exist and the investment may be classified as long term 
in light of the bankruptcy filing by lehman brothers during  we concluded that our investment in lehman brother s corporate bonds was other than temporarily impaired and therefore wrote down the investment to its fair market value during the third quarter of the total impairment charge of million is included in interest income and other  net on our consolidated statement of operations for the year ended january  no impairment charges were recorded for or see note to our consolidated financial statements in
