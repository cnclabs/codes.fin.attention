item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation in addition to historical information  the following discussion contains forward looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties 
actual results may differ substantially from those referred to herein due to a number of factors  including but not limited to risks described in the part i  item a risks factors and elsewhere in this annual report 
overview we are a biopharmaceutical company dedicated to the development and commercialization of products targeting the extracellular matrix for the endocrinology  oncology  dermatology and drug delivery markets 
our existing products and our products under development are based on intellectual property covering the family of human enzymes known as hyaluronidases 
hyaluronidases are enzymes proteins that break down hyaluronan  or ha  which is a naturally occurring space filling  gel like substance that is a major component of tissues throughout the body  such as skin and bone 
our technology is based on our proprietary recombinant human ph enzyme  or rhuph  a human synthetic version of hyaluronidase 
the ph enzyme is a naturally occurring enzyme that digests ha to temporarily break down the gel  thereby facilitating the penetration and diffusion of other drugs and fluids that are injected under the skin or in the muscle 
our proprietary technology is applicable to multiple therapeutic areas and may be used to both expand existing markets and create new ones 
our technology may be utilized for the development of our own proprietary products and it may also be applied to existing and developmental products of third parties through key partnerships 

table of contents our operations to date have been limited to organizing and staffing our operating subsidiary  halozyme  inc  acquiring  developing and securing our technology and undertaking product development for our existing products and a limited number of product candidates 
over the last year  we increased our focus on our proprietary product pipeline and have expanded investments in our proprietary product candidates 
we currently have five programs in various stages of research and development  including three programs in clinical development 
we also have three partnered programs 
our key partnerships are with f 
hoffmann la roche  ltd and hoffmann la roche  inc  or roche  to apply enhanze tm technology to roche s biological therapeutic compounds for up to targets and with baxter healthcare corporation  or baxter  to apply enhanze technology to baxter s biological therapeutic compound  gammagard liquid tm 
we have two marketed products hylenex  a registered trademark of baxter international  inc  a product used as an adjuvant to increase the absorption and dispersion of other injected drugs and fluids  and cumulase  a product used for in vitro fertilization  or ivf 
currently  we have only limited revenue from the sales of hylenex and cumulase  in addition to revenues from our partnerships with baxter and roche 
we have product candidates in the research  preclinical and clinical stages  but future revenues from the sales of these product candidates will depend on our ability to develop  manufacture  obtain regulatory approvals for and successfully commercialize product candidates 
it may be years  if ever  before we are able to obtain regulatory approvals for these product candidates 
we have incurred net operating losses each year since inception  with an accumulated deficit of approximately million as of december  we currently have an effective universal shelf registration statement which allows us to offer and sell up to million of equity or debt securities and we may utilize this universal shelf in the future to raise capital to fund the continued development of our product candidates  the commercialization of our products or for other general corporate purposes 
collaborative partnerships roche partnership in december  halozyme and roche entered into an enhanze technology partnership  or roche partnership 
under the terms of the roche partnership  roche obtained a worldwide  exclusive license to develop and commercialize product combinations of rhuph and up to thirteen roche target compounds resulting from the collaboration 
under the terms of the roche partnership  we were obligated to scale up the production of rhuph and to identify a second source manufacturer that would help meet anticipated production obligations arising from the partnership 
to that end  during  we entered into a technology transfer agreement and a clinical supply agreement with a second rhuph manufacturer 
this manufacturer has the capacity to produce the quantities we are required to deliver under the terms of the roche partnership 
the technology transfer was completed in with scale up and clinical supply manufacturing planned for roche initially had the exclusive right to apply rhuph to only three pre defined roche biologic targets with the option to exclusively develop and commercialize rhuph with an additional ten targets 
pending the successful completion of various clinical  regulatory and sales events  roche will be obligated to make milestone payments to us as well as royalty payments on the sales of products that result from the partnership 
in december  we announced that roche elected to add a fourth exclusive target to the three original exclusive targets  and we previously announced the commencement of phase i clinical trials for products directed at two of these four exclusive targets 
roche retains the option to exclusively develop and commercialize rhuph with an additional nine targets through the payment of annual license maintenance fees 
baxter gammagard partnership gammagard liquid is a current baxter product that is indicated for the treatment of primary immunodeficiency disorders associated with defects in the immune system 
in september  halozyme and baxter entered into an enhanze technology partnership  or the gammagard partnership 
under the terms of this partnership  baxter obtained a worldwide  exclusive license to develop and commercialize product combinations of rhuph with gammagard liquid 
pending the successful completion of various regulatory and sales milestones  baxter will be obligated to make milestone payments to us as well as royalty payments on the sales of 
table of contents products that result from the partnership 
baxter is responsible for all development  manufacturing  clinical  regulatory  sales and marketing costs under the gammagard partnership  while we will be responsible for the supply of the rhuph enzyme 
in addition  baxter has certain product development and commercialization obligations in major markets identified in the gammagard license 
in january of we announced the commencement of a phase iii clinical trial for gammagard liquid with rhuph hylenex partnership hylenex is a human recombinant formulation of rhuph that  when injected under the skin  facilitates the absorption and dispersion of other injected drugs or fluids 
in february  halozyme and baxter amended certain existing agreements relating to hylenex and entered into a new agreement for kits and formulations with rhuph  or the hylenex partnership 
pending the successful completion of a series of regulatory and sales events  baxter will be obligated to make milestone payments to us as well as royalty payments on the sales of products that result from the partnership 
baxter is responsible for development  manufacturing  clinical  regulatory  sales and marketing costs of the products covered by the hylenex partnership 
we will continue to supply baxter with the active pharmaceutical ingredient for hylenex  and baxter will prepare  fill  finish and package hylenex and hold it for subsequent distribution 
in addition  under the hylenex partnership  baxter has a worldwide  exclusive license to develop and commercialize product combinations of rhuph with baxter hydration fluids and generic small molecule drugs  with the exception of combinations with i bisphosphonates  as well as ii cytostatic and cytotoxic chemotherapeutic agents  the rights to which have been retained by halozyme 
revenues revenues from product sales depend on our ability to develop  manufacture  obtain regulatory approvals for and successfully commercialize our products and product candidates 
revenues from license and collaboration agreements are recognized based on the performance requirements of the underlying agreements 
revenue is deferred for fees received before they are earned 
nonrefundable upfront payment and license fees  where we have an ongoing involvement or performance obligation  are recorded as deferred revenue and recognized as revenue over the contract or development period 
milestone payments are generally recognized as revenue upon the achievement of the milestones as specified in the underlying agreement  assuming we meet certain criteria 
royalty revenues from the sale of licensed products are recognized upon the sale of such products 
during and  we entered into the roche partnership  the hylenex partnership and the gammagard partnership 
elements of these partnerships include nonrefundable license fees  reimbursements of research and development services  various clinical  regulatory or sales milestones and future product based or royalty payments  as applicable 
due to our ongoing involvement obligations under these partnerships  we recorded the nonrefundable license fees as deferred revenues 
such revenues are being recognized over the terms of the underlying agreements that define the terms of the partnerships 
costs and expenses cost of sales 
cost of sales consists primarily of raw materials  third party manufacturing costs  fill and finish costs  and freight costs associated with the sales of cumulase  and the api for hylenex 
research and development 
our research and development expenses consist primarily of costs associated with the development and manufacturing of our product candidates  compensation and other expenses for research and development personnel  supplies and materials  costs for consultants and related contract research  clinical trials  facility costs and depreciation 
we charge all research and development expenses to operations as they are incurred 
our research and development activities are primarily focused on the development of our various product candidates 
since our inception in through  we have incurred research and development expenses of million 
from through  approximately of our research and development expenses were associated with the research and development of our recombinant human ph enzyme used in our hylenex 
table of contents product  and approximately and of our research and development expenses were associated with the development of our pegph and insulin ph product candidates  respectively 
due to the uncertainty in obtaining fda approval  our reliance on third parties and competitive pressures  we are unable to estimate with any certainty the additional costs we will incur in the continued development of our proprietary product candidates for commercialization 
however  we expect our research and development expenses to increase substantially if we are able to advance our product candidates into later stages of clinical development 
clinical development timelines  likelihood of success and total costs vary widely 
we anticipate that we will make ongoing determinations as to which research and development projects to pursue and how much funding to direct to each project on an ongoing basis in response to the scientific and clinical progress of each product candidate and other market and regulatory developments 
we plan on focusing our resources on those proprietary and partnered product candidates that represent the most valuable economic and strategic opportunities 
product candidate completion dates and costs vary significantly for each product candidate and are difficult to estimate 
the lengthy process of seeking regulatory approvals and the subsequent compliance with applicable regulations require the expenditure of substantial resources 
any failure by us to obtain  or any delay in obtaining  regulatory approvals could cause our research and development expenditures to increase and  in turn  have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
we cannot be certain when  or if  our product candidates will receive regulatory approval or whether any net cash inflow from our other product candidates  or development projects  will commence 
selling  general and administrative 
selling  general and administrative  or sg a  expenses consist primarily of compensation and other expenses related to our corporate operations and administrative employees  accounting and legal fees  other professional services expenses  marketing expenses  as well as other expenses associated with operating as a publicly traded company 
we anticipate continued increases in sg a expenses as our operations continue to expand 
critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial position and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles  or us gaap 
the preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
we review our estimates on an ongoing basis 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following accounting policies to be critical to the judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition we generate revenues from product sales and collaborative agreements 
payments received under collaborative agreements may include nonrefundable fees at the inception of the agreements  license fees  milestone payments for specific achievements designated in the collaborative agreements  reimbursements of research and development services and or royalties on sales of products resulting from collaborative arrangements 
we recognize revenue in accordance with sec staff accounting bulletin  or sab  no 
 revenue recognition  and emerging issues task force  or eitf  issue no 
 revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables 
revenue is recognized when all of the following criteria are met persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  the seller s price to the buyer is fixed and determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
product sales revenues from the sale of cumulase are recognized when the transfer of ownership occurs  which is upon shipment to the distributors 
we are obligated to accept returns for product that does not meet product 
table of contents specifications 
historically  we have not had any product returns  therefore  no allowance for product returns has been established 
under the terms of the hylenex partnership  we supply baxter the api for hylenex at our fully burdened cost plus a margin 
baxter fills and finishes hylenex and holds it for subsequent distribution  at which time we ensure it meets product specifications and release it as available for sale 
because of our continued involvement in the development and production process of hylenex  the earnings process is not considered to be complete 
accordingly  we defer the revenue and related product costs on the api for hylenex until the product is filled  finished  packaged and released 
baxter may only return the api for hylenex to us if it does not conform to certain specified criteria set forth in the hylenex partnership or upon termination of such agreement 
we have historically demonstrated that the api shipped to baxter has consistently met the specified criteria 
therefore  no allowance for product returns has been established 
in addition  we receive product based payments upon the sale of hylenex by baxter  in accordance with the terms of the hylenex partnership 
product sales revenues are recognized as we earn such revenues based on baxter s shipments of hylenex to its distributors when such amounts can be reasonably estimated 
through february  baxter has prepaid million of product based payments which has been deferred and is being recognized as earned 
revenues under collaborative agreements revenues from collaborative and licensing agreements are recognized based on the performance requirements of the underlying agreements 
revenue is deferred for fees received before they are earned 
nonrefundable upfront payments and license fees  in which we have an ongoing involvement or performance obligation  are recorded as deferred revenue and recognized as revenue over the contract or development period 
we recognize milestone payments upon the achievement of specified milestones if the milestone is substantive in nature and the achievement of the milestone was not reasonably assured at the inception of the agreement  the fees are nonrefundable and our performance obligations after the milestone achievement will continue to be funded by our collaborator at a level comparable to the level before the milestone achievement 
any milestone payments received prior to satisfying these revenue recognition criteria are recorded as deferred revenue 
reimbursements of research and development services are recognized as revenue during the period in which the services are performed 
royalties to be received based on sales of licensed products by our collaborators incorporating our products are recognized as earned in accordance with the terms of the underlying agreements 
share based payments we account for share based awards exchanged for employee services in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards  or sfas  no 
r  share based payment  which we adopted effective january   including the provisions of the sab no 
and we use the fair value method to account for share based payments with a modified prospective application which provides for certain changes to the method for valuing share based compensation 
the valuation provisions of sfas no 
r apply to new awards and awards that are outstanding on the effective date and subsequently modified or cancelled 
under the modified prospective application  prior periods were not revised for comparative purposes 
the fair value of each option award is estimated on the date of grant using a black scholes merton option pricing model  or black scholes model  that uses assumptions regarding a number of complex and subjective variables 
these variables include  but are not limited to  our expected stock price volatility  actual and projected employee stock option exercise behaviors  risk free interest rate and expected dividends 
expected volatilities are based on the historical volatility of our common stock and our peer group 
the expected term of options granted is based on analyses of historical employee termination rates and option exercises 
the risk free interest rates are based on the us treasury yield in effect at the time of the grant 
since we do not expect to pay dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future  we estimated the dividend yield to be 
sfas no 
r requires forfeitures to be estimated at the time of grant and revised  if necessary  in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates 
we estimate pre vesting forfeitures based on our historical experience and those of our peer group 

table of contents if factors change and we employ different assumptions in the application of sfas no 
r in future periods  the share based compensation expense that we record under sfas no 
r may differ significantly from what we have recorded in the current period 
there is a high degree of subjectivity involved when using option pricing models to estimate share based compensation under sfas no 
r 
certain share based payments  such as employee stock options  may expire worthless or otherwise result in zero intrinsic value as compared to the fair values originally estimated on the grant date and reported in our consolidated financial statements 
alternatively  values may be realized from these instruments that are significantly in excess of the fair values originally estimated on the grant date and reported in our consolidated financial statements 
there is currently no market based mechanism or other practical application to verify the reliability and accuracy of the estimates stemming from these valuation models  nor is there a means to compare and adjust the estimates to actual values 
although the fair value of employee share based awards is determined in accordance with sfas no 
r and sab no 
and using an option pricing model  that value may not be indicative of the fair value observed in a willing buyer willing seller market transaction 
research and development expenses research and development expenses include salaries and benefits  facilities and other overhead expenses  clinical trials  research related manufacturing services  contract services and other outside expenses 
research and development expenses are charged to operations as they are incurred 
advance payments  including nonrefundable amounts  for goods or services that will be used or rendered for future research and development activities are deferred and capitalized 
such amounts will be recognized as an expense as the related goods are delivered or the related services are performed 
if the goods will not be delivered  or services will not be rendered  then the capitalized advance payment is charged to expense 
milestone payments that we make in connection with in licensed technology or product candidates are expensed as incurred when there is uncertainty in receiving future economic benefits from the licensed technology or product candidates 
we consider the future economic benefits from the licensed technology or product candidates to be uncertain until such licensed technology or product candidates are approved for marketing by the us food and drug administration or when other significant risk factors are abated 
for expense accounting purposes  management has viewed future economic benefits for all of our licensed technology or product candidates to be uncertain 
payments in connection with our clinical trials are often made under contracts with multiple contract research organizations that conduct and manage clinical trials on our behalf 
the financial terms of these agreements are subject to negotiation and vary from contract to contract and may result in uneven payment flows 
generally  these agreements set forth the scope of work to be performed at a fixed fee  unit price or on a time and material basis 
payments under these contracts depend on factors such as the successful enrollment or treatment of patients or the completion of other clinical trial milestones 
expenses related to clinical trials are accrued based on our estimates and or representations from service providers regarding work performed  including actual level of patient enrollment  completion of patient studies and clinical trials progress 
other incidental costs related to patient enrollment or treatment are accrued when reasonably certain 
if the contracted amounts are modified for instance  as a result of changes in the clinical trial protocol or scope of work to be performed  we modify our accruals accordingly on a prospective basis 
revisions in scope of contract are charged to expense in the period in which the facts that give rise to the revision become reasonably certain 
because of the uncertainty of possible future changes to the scope of work in clinical trials contracts  we are unable to quantify an estimate of the reasonably likely effect of any such changes on our consolidated results of operations or financial position 
historically  we have had no material changes in our clinical trial expense accruals that would have had a material impact on our consolidated results of operations or financial position 
inventory inventory consists of our cumulase product and our api for hylenex 
inventory primarily represents raw materials used in production  work in process and finished goods inventory on hand  valued at actual cost 
inventory is reviewed periodically for slow moving or obsolete items 
if a launch of a new product is delayed  inventory may 
table of contents not be fully utilized and could be subject to impairment  at which point we would record a reserve to adjust inventory to its net realizable value 
fair value measurements effective january   we adopted sfas no 
 fair value measurements  and fasb staff position  or fsp  no 
fas  determining the fair value of a financial asset when the market for that asset is not active 
sfas no 
defines fair value  establishes a framework for measuring fair value under us gaap and enhances disclosures about fair value measurements 
fsp no 
fas clarifies the application of sfas no 
in a market that is not active and provides an example to illustrate key considerations in determining the fair value of a financial asset when the market for that financial asset is not active 
the adoption of sfas no 
and fsp no 
fas did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations 
sfas prioritizes the inputs used in measuring fair value into the following hierarchy level quoted prices unadjusted in active markets for identical assets or liabilities  level inputs other than quoted prices included within level that are either directly or indirectly observable  and level unobservable inputs in which little or no market activity exists  therefore requiring an entity to develop its own assumptions about the assumptions that market participants would use in pricing 
cash and cash equivalents of approximately million at december  are carried at fair value based on quoted market prices for identical securities level inputs 
effective january   we adopted sfas no 
 the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities 
sfas no 
allows an entity the irrevocable option to elect to measure specified financial assets and liabilities in their entirety at fair value on a contract by contract basis 
if an entity elects the fair value option for an eligible item  changes in the item s fair value must be reported as unrealized gains and losses in earnings at each subsequent reporting date 
in adopting sfas no 
 we did not elect the fair value option for any of our financial assets or financial liabilities 
the above listing is not intended to be a comprehensive list of all of our accounting policies 
in many cases  the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by us gaap 
there are also areas in which our management s judgment in selecting any available alternative would not produce a materially different result 
please see our audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in part ii item of this report  which contain accounting policies and other disclosures required by us gaap 
results of operations comparison of years ended december  and revenues under collaborative agreements revenues under collaborative agreements were approximately million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  revenues under collaborative agreements primarily consisted of the amortization of license fees and milestone payments received from baxter and roche of approximately million and million in and  respectively 
revenues under collaborative agreements also included reimbursements for research and development services from baxter of million and  and roche of million and  in and  respectively 
such reimbursements are for research and development services rendered by us at the request of baxter and roche and the amount of future revenues related to reimbursable research and development services is uncertain 
we expect the non reimbursement revenues under our collaborative agreements to continue to increase in future periods provided that we meet various clinical and regulatory milestones set forth in such agreements 
product sales product sales were  for the year ended december  compared to  for the year ended december  the increase of  or  was primarily due to the increase in sales 
table of contents of hylenex and the api for hylenex 
based upon representations made to us by baxter regarding the launch of hylenex  we expect product sales to increase in future periods due to increased hylenex sales 
cost of sales cost of sales were  for the year ended december  compared to  for the year ended december  the increase of  or  was due to the increase in sales of the api for hylenex and an increase in the cost of cumulase sales in research and development research and development expenses were million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  the increase of million  or  was primarily due to the increase in outsourced research and development costs of million  related to our various preclinical programs and the manufacturing scale up of our rhuph enzyme  and increased compensation costs of million  of which  related to increased share based compensation  primarily due to the increase in our research and development headcount 
at december   our headcount for research and development functions totaled employees  compared with employees at december  additionally  our clinical trial expenses increased by million  research supplies expenses increased by million and facilities expenses increased by million resulting from leasing larger facilities effective july to accommodate the increase in headcount in as compared to we expect certain research and development costs to increase in future periods as we increase our research efforts and headcount  expand our clinical trials and continue to develop and manufacture our product candidates

as of december   million of total unrecognized compensation costs related to non vested stock options and restricted stock awards is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of years 
interest income interest income was million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  the decrease in interest income was primarily due to lower interest rates and lower average cash and cash equivalent balances in as compared to the same period in net loss net loss for the year ended december  was million  or per common share  compared to million  or per common share for the year ended december  the increase in net loss was primarily due to an increase in operating expenses  partially offset by increases in revenues

liquidity and capital resources our principal sources of liquidity are our existing cash and cash equivalents 
as of december   we had cash and cash equivalents of approximately million 
we expect our cash requirements to increase as we continue to increase our research and development for  seek regulatory approvals of  and develop and manufacture our current product candidates 
as we expand our research and development efforts and pursue additional product opportunities  we anticipate additional cash requirements for hiring of personnel  capital expenditures and investment in additional internal systems and infrastructure 
the amount and timing of cash requirements will depend on the research  development  manufacture  regulatory and market acceptance of our product candidates  if any  and the resources we devote to researching  developing  manufacturing  commercializing and supporting our product candidates 
we believe that our current cash and cash equivalents will be sufficient to fund our operations for at least the next twelve months 
currently  we anticipate net cash burn of approximately to million for the year ending december   depending on the progress of various preclinical and clinical programs  the timing of our manufacturing scale up and the achievement of various milestones under our existing collaborative agreements 
we do not expect our revenues to be sufficient to fund operations for at least several years 
we expect to fund our operations going forward with existing cash resources  anticipated revenues from our existing collaborations and 
table of contents cash that we will raise through future transactions 
we may finance future cash needs through any one of the following financing vehicles i the public offering of securities  ii new collaborative agreements  iii expansions or revisions to existing collaborative relationships  iv private financings and or v other equity or debt financings 
in november  we filed a shelf registration statement on form s registration no 
which initially allowed us  from time to time  to offer and sell up to million of equity or debt securities 
we cannot be certain that our existing cash and cash equivalents will be adequate for our anticipated needs or that additional financing will be available when needed or that  if available  financing will be obtained on terms favorable to us or our stockholders 
having insufficient funds will require us to delay  scale back or eliminate some or all of our research and development programs or delay the launch of our product candidates 
if we raise additional funds by issuing equity securities  substantial dilution to existing stockholders could result 
if we raise additional funds by incurring debt financing  the terms of the debt may involve significant cash payment obligations as well as covenants and specific financial ratios that may restrict our ability to operate our business 
operating activities net cash used in operations was million during the year ended december  compared to  of net cash used in operations during the year ended december  this change was primarily due to increased operating expenses of approximately million as well as reduced receipts from partnership payments of approximately million during as compared to net cash used in operations was  during the year ended december  compared to million of cash provided by operations during the year ended december  this change was primarily due to the million increase in the total net loss for as compared to investing activities net cash used in investing activities was million during the year ended december  compared to million during the year ended december  this was primarily due to a decrease in purchases of property and equipment during net cash used in investing activities was million during the year ended december  compared to  during the year ended december  this was due to an increase in purchases of property and equipment during financing activities net cash provided by financing activities was million during the year ended december  compared to million during the year ended december  net cash provided by financing activities during primarily consisted of proceeds from warrant and stock option exercises 
net cash provided by financing activities during primarily consisted of approximately million in proceeds  net of issuance costs  from sales of our common stock and approximately million in proceeds from warrant and stock option exercises 
net cash provided by financing activities was million during the year ended december  versus million during the year ended december  net cash provided by financing activities during primarily consisted of approximately million in proceeds  net of issuance costs  from sales of our common stock and approximately million in proceeds from warrant and stock option exercises 
off balance sheet arrangements as of december   we did not have any relationships with unconsolidated entities or financial partnerships  such as entities often referred to as structured finance or special purpose entities  which would have been established for the purpose of facilitating off balance sheet arrangements or other contractually narrow or limited purposes 
in addition  we did not engage in trading activities involving non exchange traded contracts 
as such  we are not materially exposed to any financing  liquidity  market or credit risk that could arise if we had engaged in these relationships 

table of contents contractual obligations as of december   future minimum payments due under our contractual obligations are as follows payments due by period less than more than contractual obligations total year years years years operating leases license payments purchase obligations total purchase obligations include outstanding purchase orders for outsourced research and development services for our various preclinical and clinical programs  for the manufacturing of our products for clinical and commercial use and other recurring purchases and services made in the normal course of business 
as of december   we had no long term debt or capital lease obligations 
our future capital uses and requirements depend on numerous forward looking factors 
these factors may include  but are not limited to  the following the rate of progress and cost of research and development activities  the number and scope of our research activities  the costs of filing  prosecuting  defending and enforcing any patent claims and other intellectual property rights  our ability to establish and maintain product discovery and development collaborations  the effect of competing technological and market developments  the terms and timing of any collaborative  licensing and other arrangements that we may establish  and the extent to which we acquire or in license new products  technologies or businesses

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our primary exposure to market risk is interest income sensitivity  which is affected by changes in the general level of us interest rates  particularly because the majority of our investments are in short term marketable securities 
the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while at the same time maximizing the income we receive from our investments without significantly increasing risk 
some of the securities that we invest in may be subject to market risk 
this means that a change in prevailing interest rates may cause the value of the investment to fluctuate 
for example  if we purchase a security that was issued with a fixed interest rate and the prevailing interest rate later rises  the value of our investment will probably decline 
to minimize this risk  we intend to continue to maintain our portfolio of cash equivalents and short term investments in a variety of securities including commercial paper  money market funds and government and non government debt securities 
in general  money market funds are not subject to market risk because the interest paid on such funds fluctuates with the prevailing interest rate 
as of december   we did not have any holdings of derivative financial or commodity instruments  or any foreign currency denominated transactions  and all of our cash and cash equivalents were in money market mutual funds and other investments that we believe to be highly liquid
