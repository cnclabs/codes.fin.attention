item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
while a dealer partner can assign any legally compliant consumer loan to us  the decision whether to provide funding to the dealer partner and the amount of any funding is made solely by us 
we perform all significant functions relating to the processing of the consumer loan applications and bear certain costs of consumer loan acceptances  including the cost of assessing the adequacy of consumer loan documentation  compliance with underwriting guidelines and the cost of verifying employment  residence and other information provided by the dealer partner 
if we discover a misrepresentation by the dealer partner relating to a consumer loan assigned to us  we can demand that the consumer loan be repurchased for the current balance of the consumer loan less the amount of any unearned finance charge plus the applicable termination fee  which is generally upon receipt of such amount in full  we will reassign the consumer loan and our security interest in the financed vehicle to the dealer partner 
the dealer partner can also opt to repurchase their consumer loan portfolio assigned under the portfolio program  at their discretion  for a fee 
in the majority of states  consumer loan contracts are written on a contract form provided by us 
the consumer loan transaction is not funded by the company until we have received and approved all the related stipulations for funding 
the acceptance of the consumer loan from the dealer partner occurs after both the consumer and dealer partner sign the contract and the original contract and supporting documentation are received and approved by us 
although the dealer partner is named in the consumer loan contract  the dealer partner generally does not have legal ownership of the consumer loan for more than a moment and the company  not the dealer partner  is listed as lien holder on the vehicle title 
consumers are obligated to make payments on the consumer loan directly to us  and any failure to make such payments will result in us pursuing payment through collection efforts 
our business model allows us to share the risk and reward of collecting on the consumer loans with the dealer partners 
such sharing is intended to motivate the dealer partner to assign better quality consumer loans  follow our underwriting guidelines  comply with various legal regulations  meet our credit compliance requirements  and provide appropriate service and support to the consumer after the sale 
in order to assist the dealer partner in these  and other areas  we offer the services of our dealer partner service center dpsc 
we believe this arrangement  along with the support of the dpsc  aligns the interests of the company  the dealer partner and the consumer 
during the third quarter of  we began to outsource dpsc functions related to legal regulation compliance and credit compliance to a company in india 
in the second quarter of  we discontinued the outsourcing of our credit compliance functions 
as of december   only legal regulation compliance validation functions remain outsourced to india 
we measure various criteria for each dealer partner against other dealer partners in their area as well as the top performing dealer partners 
dealer partners are assigned a dealer rating based upon the performance of their consumer loans in both the portfolio and purchase programs as well as other criteria 
the dealer rating is one of the factors used to determine the amount paid to dealer partners as an advance or to acquire a purchased loan 
sales representatives regularly review the performance of each dealer partner and  together with the dealer partner  create an action plan to improve the dealer partner s dealer rating and overall success with our program 
information on our consumer loans is presented in the following table years ended december  average consumer loan data average size of consumer loan accepted percentage growth decline in average size of consumer loan average initial term in months collections 
our largest group of collectors work loans that are in the early stages of delinquency 
these collectors are organized into three primary groups the first payment missed teams  the delinquency teams  and the specialized teams 
the first payment missed teams service consumer loans of consumers who have failed to make one of their first three payments on time 
collection efforts for these teams typically consist of placing a call to the consumer within one day of the missed due date for any of the first three payments 
after a consumer has made their initial three payments  collection efforts on the consumer loan are serviced by either our delinquency teams or our specialized teams 
members of the delinquency teams are assigned consumer loans that are segmented into dialing pools by various phone contact profiles in an effort to maximize contact with the consumer 
our specialized teams include collectors with higher skill levels and access to additional tools 
these teams locate consumers by finding new contact information to assist in their collection efforts or to return the consumer loan to the delinquency teams 
the specialized teams service consumer loans with the following characteristics no valid phone contact information  valid contact information without any contact in seven days  or various specialty segments such as military personnel  abandoned vehicles  voluntary surrenders  and accounts requiring investigation 
the decision to repossess a vehicle is based on statistical models or policy based criteria 
when a consumer loan is approved for repossession  the account is transferred to our repossession team 
repossession personnel continue to service the consumer loan as it is being assigned to a third party repossession contractor  who works on a contingency fee basis 
once a vehicle has been repossessed  the consumer can negotiate a redemption  whereby the vehicle is returned to the consumer in exchange for a payment which reduces or eliminates the past due balance  or where appropriate or  if required by law  the vehicle is returned to the consumer and the consumer loan is reinstated in exchange for paying off the consumer loan balance 
if the redemption process is not successful  the vehicle is sold at a wholesale automobile auction 
prior to sale  the vehicle is usually inspected by our remarketing representatives who authorize repair and reconditioning work in order to maximize the net sale proceeds at auction 
if the vehicle sale proceeds are not sufficient to satisfy the balance owing on the consumer loan  the consumer loan is serviced by either our senior collection team  in the event the consumer is willing to make payments on the deficiency balance  or where permitted by law  our legal team  if it is believed that legal action is required to reduce the deficiency balance owing on the consumer loan 
our legal team generally assigns consumer loans to third party collection attorneys who work on a contingency fee basis 
the third party collection attorneys then file a claim  and upon obtaining a judgment  garnish wages or other assets 
additionally  we may sell or assign consumer loans to a third party collection company 
collectors rely on two systems  the collection system cs and the loan servicing system lss 
the cs and the lss are connected through a batch interface 
the present cs has been in service since june the cs interfaces with a predictive dialer and records all activity on a consumer loan  including details of past phone conversations with the consumer  collection letters sent  promises to pay  broken promises  repossession orders and collection attorney activity 
the lss maintains a record of all transactions relating to consumer loans assigned after july and is a primary source of data utilized to evaluate our proprietary credit scoring system  forecast future collections  establish the amount of revenue recognized by us  and analyze the profitability of our program 
during the third quarter of  we began an initiative to outsource a portion of our collection function to a company in india 
in the second quarter of  we entered into another outsourcing arrangement with a company in costa rica 
these outsourced collectors service accounts using the cs and typically work accounts that are less than sixty days past due 
outsourcing reduces the geographic risk of having two collection centers in the united states  provides additional flexibility to scale our operation  comparable performance at a lower wage rate and the opportunity to share best practices with outside collection companies 
ancillary products we provide dealer partners the ability to offer vehicle service contracts to consumers 
buyers vehicle protection plan  inc bvpp  a wholly owned subsidiary of the company  has relationships with third party administrators tpas whereby the tpas process claims on vehicle service contracts that are underwritten by third party insurers 
bvpp receives a commission for all vehicle service contracts sold by our dealer partners when the vehicle is financed by us 
the commission is included in the retail price of the vehicle service contract which is added to the consumer loan 
we provide dealer partners with an additional advance based on the retail price of the vehicle service contract 
we recognize our commission from the vehicle service contracts as part of finance charges on a level yield basis based upon forecasted cash flows 
during the fourth quarter of  we formed vsc re  a wholly owned subsidiary that is engaged in the business of reinsuring coverage under vehicle service contracts sold to consumers by dealer partners on vehicles financed by us 
vsc re currently reinsures vehicle service contracts that are underwritten by two of our three third party insurers 
vehicle service contract premiums  which represent the selling price of the vehicle service contract to the consumer less commissions and certain administrative costs  are contributed to trust accounts controlled by vsc re 
these premiums are used to fund claims covered under the vehicle service contracts 
the company has entered into arrangements with third party insurance companies that limit our exposure to fund claims to the amount of premium dollars contributed  less amounts earned and withdrawn  plus million of equity contributed 
with the reinsurance structure  we will be able to access projected excess trust assets monthly and will record revenue and expense on an accrual basis 
premiums are earned over the life of the vehicle service contract using an average of the pro rata and rule of methods 
claims are expensed in the period the claim was incurred 
our financial results for the year ended december  reflect two months of vsc re activity  including million in premiums earned and million in provision for claims 
under financial accounting standards board fasb interpretation no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities fin  we are considered the primary beneficiary of the trusts and as a result  the trust assets have been consolidated on our balance sheet as restricted cash and cash equivalents 
prior to the formation of vsc re  our agreements with two of our tpas allowed us to receive profit sharing payments depending upon the performance of the vehicle service contract programs 
the agreements also required that vehicle service contract premiums be placed in trust accounts 
funds in the trust accounts were utilized by the tpa to pay claims on the vehicle service contracts 
upon the formation of vsc re during the fourth quarter of  the unearned premiums on the majority of the vehicle service contracts that had been written through these two tpas were ceded to vsc re along with any related trust assets 
as the trust assets transferred to vsc re exceeded the ceded unearned premiums  we recorded a deferred gain of million upon the formation of vsc re 
the deferred gain will be recognized as premiums earned revenue over a month period average remaining life of the ceded vehicle service contracts using an average of the pro rata and rule of methods 
vehicle service contracts written prior to through one of the tpas remain under this profit sharing arrangement 
profit sharing payments  if any  on the vehicle service contracts are distributed to us periodically after the term of the vehicle service contracts have substantially expired provided certain loss rates are met 
under fin  we are considered the primary beneficiary of the trusts 
as a result  the assets and liabilities of the remaining trust have been consolidated on our balance sheet 
we formed vsc re in order to enhance our control and the security of the trust assets that will be used to pay future vehicle service contract claims 
the income we expect to earn from vehicle service contracts over time will likely not be impacted as  both before and after the formation of vsc re  the income we receive is based on the amount by which vehicle service contract premiums exceed claims 
the only change in our risk associated with adverse claims experience relates to the million equity contribution that was required as part of this new structure  which is now at risk in the event claims exceed premiums 
under the prior structure  our risk was limited to the amount of premiums contributed to the trusts 
bvpp also has a relationship with a tpa that allows dealer partners to offer a gap product to consumers whereby the tpa processes claims that are underwritten by a third party insurer 
gap provides the consumer protection by paying the difference between the loan balance and the amount covered by the consumer s insurance policy in the event the vehicle is totaled or stolen 
we receive a commission for all gap contracts sold by our dealer partners when the vehicle is financed by us  and do not bear any risk of loss for claims 
the commission is included in the retail price of the gap contract which is added to the consumer loan 
we provide dealer partners with an additional advance based on the retail price of the gap contract 
we recognize our commission from the gap contracts as part of finance charges on a level yield basis based upon forecasted cash flows 
we are eligible to receive profit sharing payments depending on the performance of the gap program 
profit sharing payments from the third party are received once a year  if eligible 
during the second quarter of  we began to provide dealer partners in certain states the ability to purchase global positioning systems gps with starter interrupt devices sid 
through this program  dealer partners can install a gps based sid gps sid on vehicles financed by us that can be activated if the consumer fails to make payments on their account  and can result in the prompt repossession of the vehicle 
installation of the gps sid will allow for increased collections and an opportunity for the dealer partner to increase their initial advance 
dealer partners purchase the gps sid directly from the third party and ownership of the gps sid device resides with the dealer partner 
the third party pays us a marketing fee for each device sold and installed  at which time the marketing fee revenue is recognized in other income within our consolidated statements of income 
businesses in liquidation effective june   we decided to stop originating consumer loans in the united kingdom and we sold the remainder of the portfolio on december  over the last three years we have had minimal activity as we have been liquidating our united kingdom subsidiary 
competition the market for consumers who do not qualify for conventional automobile financing is large and highly competitive 
the market is currently served by buy here  pay here dealerships  banks  captive finance affiliates of automobile manufacturers  credit unions and independent finance companies both publicly and privately owned 
many of these companies are much larger and have greater resources than us 
these companies typically target higher credit tier customers within our market 
we compete by offering a profitable and efficient method for dealer partners to finance customers who would be more difficult or less profitable to finance through other methods 
in addition  we compete on the basis of the level of service provided by our origination and sales personnel 
customer and geographic concentrations no single dealer partner accounted for more than of total revenues during any of the last three years 
additionally  no single dealer partner s loan receivable balance accounted for more than of total loans receivable balance as of december  or the following table provides information regarding the five states that are responsible for the largest dollar amount of consumer loans accepted or purchased and the number of active dealer partners in the united states during consumer loans active dealer partners dollars in thousands amount of total number of total texas michigan alabama ohio new york all other states total active dealer partners are dealer partners who have received funding for at least one loan during the year

regulation our businesses are subject to various state  federal and foreign laws and regulations  which require licensing and qualification  regulate interest rates  fees and other charges  require specified disclosures to consumers  govern the sale and terms of ancillary products  and define our rights to collect consumer loans and repossess and sell collateral 
failure to comply with  or an adverse change in  these laws or regulations could have a material adverse effect on us by  among other things  limiting the jurisdictions in which we may operate  restricting our ability to realize the value of the collateral securing the consumer loans  or resulting in potential liability related to our collection of consumer loans 
in addition  governmental regulations depleting the supply of used vehicles  such as environmental protection regulations governing emissions or fuel consumption  could have a material adverse effect on us 
we are not aware of any such legislation currently pending that could have a material adverse effect on us 
the sale of insurance products in connection with consumer loans assigned to or purchased by us from dealer partners is also subject to state laws and regulations 
however  as we do not deal directly with consumers in the sale of insurance products  we do not believe that such laws and regulations significantly affect our business 
nevertheless  there can be no assurance that insurance regulatory authorities in the jurisdictions in which such products are offered by dealer partners will not seek to regulate us or restrict the operation of our business in such jurisdictions 
any such action could materially adversely affect the income received from such products 
we believe that we maintain all material licenses and permits required for our current operations and are in substantial compliance with all applicable laws and regulations 
our agreements with dealer partners provide that the dealer partner shall indemnify us with respect to any loss or expense we incur as a result of the dealer partner s failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations 
team members as of december   we had  full and part time team members

item a 
risk factors our inability to accurately forecast and estimate the amount and timing of future collections could have a material adverse effect on results of operations 
substantially all of the consumer loans assigned to us are made to individuals with impaired or limited credit histories  or higher debt to income ratios than are permitted by traditional lenders 
consumer loans made to these individuals generally entail a higher risk of delinquency  default and repossession  and higher losses than loans made to consumers with better credit 
since cash flows available to repay the loans are generated  in most cases  from the underlying consumer loans  the ability to accurately forecast consumer loan performance is critical to our success 
at the time of consumer loan acceptance or purchase  we forecast future expected cash flows from the consumer loan 
based on these forecasts  which include estimates for wholesale vehicle prices in the event of vehicle repossession and sale  we make an advance or cash payment to the related dealer partner at a level designed to achieve an acceptable return on capital 
if consumer loan performance equals or exceeds original expectations  it is likely the target return on capital will be achieved 
however  actual cash flows from any individual consumer loan are often different than cash flows estimated at consumer loan inception 
there can be no assurance that our estimates will be accurate or that consumer loan performance will be as expected 
in the event that we underestimate the default risk or under price products  the financial position  liquidity and results of operations could be adversely affected  possibly to a material degree 
we may be unable to continue to access or renew funding sources and obtain capital on favorable terms needed to maintain and grow the business 
we currently use four primary sources of debt financing a revolving secured line of credit with a commercial bank syndicate  revolving secured warehouse facilities with institutional investors  sec rule a asset backed secured borrowings term abs a with qualified institutional investors  and a residual credit facility with an institutional investor 
in august  our million warehouse facility and our million residual credit facility mature 
there can be no assurance that new or additional financing can be obtained  or that it will be available on acceptable terms 
if our various financing alternatives were to become limited or unavailable  we may be unable to accept consumer loans in the volume that we anticipate  and operations could be materially adversely affected 
requirements under credit facilities to meet financial and portfolio performance covenants 
our credit facilities contain various covenants requiring certain levels of financial performance and asset quality 
failure to meet any of these covenants could result in an event of default under these agreements 
if we cannot comply with the requirements in our credit facilities  then the lenders may increase our borrowing costs  require us to repay immediately all of the outstanding debt  enforce their interests against collateral pledged under these agreements or restrict our ability to obtain additional borrowings under these facilities 
if our debt were accelerated  our assets might not be sufficient to fully repay the debt 
these lenders may require us to use all of our available cash to repay our debt or foreclose upon their collateral 
in such case  our financial condition  liquidity and results of operations would suffer 
the conditions of the us and international capital markets may adversely affect lenders the company has relationships with  causing us to incur additional cost and reducing our sources of liquidity  which may adversely affect our financial position  liquidity and results of operations 
turbulence in the global capital markets and economic slowdown or recession may result in disruptions in the financial sector and potentially affect lenders the company has relationships with 
although the company continues to utilize low levels of financial leverage and has not suffered any significant liquidity issues as a result of recent events  the cost and availability of funds may be adversely affected by illiquid credit markets as our lenders realize the impact of adverse conditions in the capital markets 
in addition  the severity and duration of adverse conditions is unknown and may increase the company s exposure to credit risk and adversely affect the ability of lenders to perform under the terms of their lending arrangements with us 
failure by our lenders to perform under the terms of our lending agreements could cause the company to incur additional costs that may adversely affect our liquidity  financial condition  results of operations and profitability 
due to competition from traditional financing sources and non traditional lenders  we may not be able to compete successfully 
the automobile finance market for consumers who do not qualify for conventional automobile financing is large and highly competitive 
the market is served by a variety of companies including buy here  pay here dealerships 
the market is also currently served by banks  captive finance affiliates of automobile manufacturers  credit unions and independent finance companies both publicly and privately owned 
many of these companies are much larger and have greater financial resources than are available to us  and many have long standing relationships with automobile dealerships 
providers of automobile financing have traditionally competed based on the interest rate charged  the quality of credit accepted  the flexibility of loan terms offered and the quality of service provided to dealers and consumers 
there is potential that significant direct competition could emerge and that we may be unable to compete successfully 
additionally  if we are unsuccessful in maintaining and expanding our relationships with dealer partners  we may be unable to accept consumer loans in the volume and on the terms that we anticipate 
we may not be able to generate sufficient cash flow to service our outstanding debt and fund operations 
we currently have substantial outstanding indebtedness and our credit facilities allow us to incur significant amounts of additional debt 
the ability to make payments of principal or interest on indebtedness will depend in part on our future operating performance  which to a certain extent is subject to economic  financial  competitive and other factors beyond our control 
if we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow in the future to service our debt  we may be required to refinance all or a portion of our existing debt or obtain additional financing 
there can be no assurance that any such refinancing will be possible or that any additional financing can be obtained on acceptable terms 
interest rate fluctuations may adversely affect our borrowing costs  profitability and liquidity 
our profitability may be directly affected by the level of and fluctuations in interest rates  which affects our borrowing costs 
our profitability and liquidity could be adversely affected during any period of higher interest rates  possibly to a material degree 
we monitor the interest rate environment and employ hedging strategies designed to mitigate the impact of increases in interest rates 
we can provide no assurance  however  that hedging strategies will mitigate the impact of increases in interest rates 
the regulation to which we are subject could result in a material adverse affect on our business 
our business is subject to various laws and regulations which require licensing and qualification  limit interest rates  fees and other charges associated with the consumer loans assigned to us  require specified disclosures by dealer partners to consumers  govern the sale and terms of ancillary products  and define the rights to repossess and sell collateral 
failure to comply with  or an adverse change in  these laws or regulations could have a material adverse effect on us by  among other things  limiting the jurisdictions in which we may operate  restricting the ability to realize the value of the collateral securing the consumer loans  making it more costly or burdensome to do business  or resulting in potential liability 
in addition  governmental regulations which would deplete the supply of used vehicles  such as environmental protection regulations governing emissions or fuel consumption  could have a material adverse effect on us 
the sale of insurance products in connection with consumer loans assigned to us by dealer partners is also subject to state laws and regulations 
as the holder of the consumer loans that contain these products  some of these state laws and regulations may apply to our servicing and collection of the consumer loans 
although we do not believe that such laws and regulations significantly affect our business because we do not deal directly with consumers in the sale of insurance products  there can be no assurance that insurance regulatory authorities in the jurisdictions in which such products are offered by dealer partners will not seek to regulate or restrict the operation of the business in such jurisdictions 
any such action could materially adversely affect the income received from such products 
adverse changes in economic conditions  the automobile or finance industries  or the non prime consumer market  could adversely affect our financial position  liquidity and results of operations  the ability of key vendors that we depend on to supply us with certain services  and our ability to enter into future financing transactions 
we are subject to general economic conditions which are beyond our control 
during periods of economic slowdown or recession  delinquencies  defaults  repossessions and losses may increase 
these periods may also be accompanied by decreased consumer demand for automobiles and declining values of automobiles securing outstanding consumer loans  which weakens collateral coverage and increases the amount of a loss in the event of default 
significant increases in the inventory of used automobiles during periods of economic recession may also depress the prices at which repossessed automobiles may be sold or delay the timing of these sales 
because our business is focused on consumers who do not qualify for conventional automobile financing  the actual rates of delinquencies  defaults  repossessions and losses on these consumer loans could be higher than that of those experienced in the general automobile finance industry  and could be more dramatically affected by a general economic downturn 
in addition  we rely on vendors to provide us with services we need to operate our business 
any disruption in our operations due to the untimely or discontinued supply of these services could substantially adversely affect our operations 
finally  during an economic slowdown or recession  our servicing costs may increase without a corresponding increase in service fee income 
any sustained period of increased delinquencies  defaults  repossessions or losses or increased servicing costs could also materially adversely affect our financial position  liquidity and results of operations and our ability to enter into future financing transactions 
litigation we are involved in from time to time may adversely affect our financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
as a result of the consumer oriented nature of the industry in which we operate and uncertainties with respect to the application of various laws and regulations in some circumstances  we are subject to various consumer claims and litigation seeking damages and statutory penalties  based upon  among other things  usury  disclosure inaccuracies  wrongful repossession  violations of bankruptcy stay provisions  certificate of title disputes  fraud and breach of contract 
some litigation against us could take the form of class action complaints by consumers 
as the assignee of consumer loans originated by dealer partners  we may also be named as a co defendant in lawsuits filed by consumers principally against dealer partners 
the company may also have disputes and litigation with dealer partners 
the claims may allege  among other theories of liability  that the company breached its dealer servicing agreement 
the damages and penalties that may be claimed by consumers or dealer partners in these types of matters can be substantial 
the relief requested by the plaintiffs varies but includes requests for compensatory  statutory and punitive damages 
a significant judgment against us in connection with any litigation could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
we are dependent on our senior management and the loss of any of these individuals or an inability to hire additional team members could adversely affect our ability to operate profitably 
our senior management average over years of experience with the company 
our success is dependent upon the management and the leadership skills of this team 
in addition  competition from other companies to hire our team members possessing the necessary skills and experience required could contribute to an increase in team member turnover 
the loss of any of these individuals or an inability to attract and retain additional qualified team members could adversely affect us 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to retain our existing senior management or attract additional qualified team members 
our inability to properly safeguard confidential consumer information 
if third parties or our employees are able to breach our network security or otherwise misappropriate our customers personal information or loan information  or if we give third parties or our employees improper access to our customers personal information or loan information  we could be subject to liability 
this liability could include identity theft or other similar fraud related claims 
this liability could also include claims for other misuses or losses of personal information  including for unauthorized marketing purposes 
other liabilities could include claims alleging misrepresentation of our privacy and data security practices 
we rely on encryption and authentication technology licensed from third parties to provide the security and authentication necessary to effect secure online transmission of confidential consumer information 
advances in computer capabilities  new discoveries in the field of cryptography or other events or developments may result in a compromise or breach of the algorithms that we use to protect sensitive customer transaction data 
a party who is able to circumvent our security measures could misappropriate proprietary information or cause interruptions in our operations 
we may be required to expend capital and other resources to protect against such security breaches or to alleviate problems caused by such breaches 
our security measures are designed to protect against security breaches  but our failure to prevent such security breaches could subject us to liability  decrease our profitability  and damage our reputation 
our operations could suffer from telecommunications or technology downtime or increased costs 
the temporary or permanent loss of our computer and telecommunications equipment  software systems and internet access  through system conversions or operating malfunction  could disrupt our operations 
in the normal course of our business  we must record and process significant amounts of data quickly and accurately to access  maintain and expand the databases we use for our origination and collection activities 
any failure of our information systems or software and our backup systems could interrupt our business operations and harm our business 
our ability to integrate computer and telecommunications technologies into our business is essential to our competitive position and our success 
computer and telecommunications technologies are evolving rapidly and are characterized by short product life cycles 
we may not be successful in anticipating  managing or adopting technological changes on a timely basis 
while we believe that our existing information systems are sufficient to meet our current demands and continued expansion  our future growth may require additional investment in these systems 
we cannot ensure that adequate capital resources will be available to us at the appropriate time 
natural disasters  acts of war  terrorist attacks and threats or the escalation of military activity in response to such attacks or otherwise may negatively affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
natural disasters  acts of war  terrorist attacks and the escalation of military activity in response to such attacks or otherwise may have negative and significant effects  such as imposition of increased security measures  changes in applicable laws  market disruptions and job losses 
such events may have an adverse effect on the economy in general 
moreover  the potential for future terrorist attacks and the national and international responses to such threats could affect the business in ways that cannot be predicted 
the effect of any of these events or threats could have an adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations
