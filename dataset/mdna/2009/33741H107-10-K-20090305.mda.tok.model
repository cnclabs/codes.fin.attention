item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations this discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and notes thereto for the year ended december   which appear in item of part ii of this annual report 
recent developments capital purchase program as discussed above  on january  the corporation participated in the tarp cpp by issuing  shares of series a preferred stock  having a liquidation amount of  per share  and the warrant covering  shares of common stock to the treasury for a total sales price of million 
the warrant may be exercised at any time until january  at an exercise price of per share  or an aggregate exercise price of approximately million 
the series a preferred stock qualifies as tier capital and pays cumulative dividends at a rate of per annum until february  the warrant counts as tangible common equity 
holders of the series a preferred stock are entitled to receive if  as and when declared by the board of directors  out of assets legally available for payment  cumulative cash dividends at a rate per annum of per share on a liquidation amount of  per share of series a preferred stock with respect to each dividend period from january  to  but excluding  february  from and after february   holders of series a preferred stock are entitled to receive cumulative cash dividends at a rate per annum of per share on a liquidation amount of  per share with respect to each dividend period thereafter 
under the terms of the series a preferred stock  on and after february   the corporation may  at its option  redeem shares of series a preferred stock  in whole or in part  at any time and from time to time  for cash at a per share amount equal to the sum of the liquidation preference per share plus any accrued and unpaid dividends to but excluding the redemption date 
the terms of the series a preferred stock further provide that  prior to february   the corporation may redeem shares of series a preferred stock only if it has received aggregate gross proceeds of not less than million from one or more qualified equity offerings  and the aggregate redemption price may not exceed the net proceeds received by the company from such offerings 
the redemption of the series a preferred stock requires prior regulatory approval 
until the earlier of i january  or ii the date on which the series a preferred stock has been redeemed in full or treasury has transferred all of the series a preferred stock to non affiliates  the terms of the series a preferred securities prohibit the corporation from increasing its quarterly cash dividend paid on common stock above per share or repurchasing any shares of common stock or other capital stock or equity securities or trust preferred securities without the consent of the treasury 
accordingly  the corporation s previously announced common stock repurchase plan has been suspended effective january  on february   president obama signed the recovery act into law 
the recovery act permits any institution that receives assistance under tarp including pursuant to the cpp  after consultation with the appropriate banking regulators  to repay any such assistance at any time notwithstanding any repayment restrictions contained in the instruments defining such assistance 
recent guidance issued by treasury states that  as a general rule  any partial repayment must equal at least of the outstanding assistance 
treasury may waive this minimum repayment amount 
accordingly  the corporation may  at any time and notwithstanding the restrictions on redemption discussed above  and assuming its regulators do not object  repay all of or a portion of in increments  unless waived by treasury the million it received as consideration for the series a preferred stock and the warrant 
if the corporation were to repay any assistance  it could also repurchase any or all of the portion of the warrant that relates to the repayment 
any portion of the warrant that relates to the repayment that the corporation chooses not to repurchase must be liquidated by treasury  at the current market price 
fdic deposit insurance fund restoration plan announced on february   the fdic announced a proposed rule outlining its plan to implement an emergency special assessment of basis points on all insured depository institutions in order to restore the deposit insurance fund to an acceptable level 
the assessment  which would be payable on september   would be in addition to a planned increase in premiums and a change in the way regular premiums are assessed which the fdic also approved on february  in addition  the proposed rule provides that  after june   if the reserve ratio of the deposit insurance fund is estimated to fall to a level that that the fdic believes would adversely affect public confidence or to a level which is close to or less than zero at the end of a calendar quarter  then an additional emergency special assessment of up to basis points may be imposed on all insured depository institutions 
if this rule is adopted as proposed  it could increase the bank s fdic premiums in by approximately million 
overview the corporation is a financial holding company which  through the bank and its non bank subsidiaries  provides an array of financial products and services primarily to customers in four western maryland counties and four northeastern west virginia counties 
its principal operating subsidiary is the bank  which consists of a community banking network of branch offices located throughout its market areas 
our primary sources of revenue are interest income earned from our loan and investment securities portfolios and fees earned from financial services provided to customers 
consolidated net income for totaled million or per share  compared to million or per share for the decrease in net income resulted primarily from an increase in the provision for loan losses to million in  compared to million for and a million non cash other than temporary impairment charge on the investment portfolio 
the increase in the provision in is due to increased net charge offs  an increase in the level of non accrual loans  loan growth during  specific allocations for impaired loans and changes in the qualitative factors used in the overall assessment of the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses 
specific allocations have been provided in instances where losses may occur 
approximately million of the recorded expense is attributable to a real estate and development loan in hardy county  west virginia and deterioration in a group of loan relationships outside of the corporation s market area 
additional provision expense was also recorded because the company that services a loan in which the bank holds a participation interest failed to remit million in principal payments made by the borrower 
the bank is reviewing its rights with respect to its insurance carriers and the servicing company s insurance carriers and bonding companies  but there can be no assurance that the bank will ultimately recover any of this loss 
during  earnings on interest earning assets increased primarily as a result of an investment portfolio restructuring and an overall increase in average earning assets 
interest expense on interest bearing liabilities decreased million due to the decline in interest rates during as well as the enhanced efforts of an internal treasury committee 
as a result  the net interest margin increased to in from in operations in were impacted by the following factors and strategic initiatives increased loan and deposit growth impact on net interest margin we experienced a significant increase of million in loans in when compared to the residential mortgage portfolio grew million and the commercial portfolio increased million as a result of in house production and commercial participations with other financial institutions 
we experienced growth in both fixed rate and adjustable rate products 
these increases were offset by a decline of million in the installment loan portfolio 
interest income on loans in decreased from the amount generated in by million on a fully taxable equivalent basis due to the decrease in interest rates 
interest income on investment securities increased by million on a fully taxable equivalent basis due to a million increase in the portfolio 
additional information on the composition of interest income is available in table that appears on page 
funding costs in decreased as a result of the declining interest rate environment and the enhanced efforts of the internal treasury committee 
deposits at december  increased million when compared to deposits at december   primarily from an million increase in our ira products and brokered products 
the decline in the interest rate environment decreased deposit interest expense by million when compared to although net borrowings increased by million in when compared to  we realized a minimal increase in interest expense on these borrowings 
the combination of increased loan and deposit growth  declining interest rates on our assets and liabilities  and the increased level of debt resulted in an increase in net interest income on a tax equivalent basis of million in when compared to the overall net interest margin increased during to from in on a fully taxable equivalent basis 
other operating income other operating expense other operating income decreased million in when compared to service charge income increased 
million  due primarily to increased customer usage of an account overdraft product 
this increase was offset by decreases in trust department income  insurance commission income  and realized losses on our investment portfolio 
trust department income is directly affected by the performance of the equity and bond markets and by the amount of assets under management 
although we have experienced favorable sales production in our trust department  unfavorable market conditions have reduced the fees and commissions on our existing accounts under management resulting in slightly lower income when compared to declining market values negatively impacted the value of assets under management at year end 
assets under management were million  million and million for years  and  respectively 
insurance commissions also decreased in when compared to due to a soft insurance market resulting in lower premium income and a reduction in the amount of contingency income received in contingency income is received from the insurance carriers based upon claims histories and varies from year to year 
in december  the insurance agency acquired substantially all of the assets of three insurance agencies  which should enable the agency to expand its business into central west virginia 
information about these acquisitions may be found in note to the consolidated financial statements included in item of part ii of this annual report under the heading goodwill and other intangible assets 
the increase in as compared to was due to the acquisition of two books of business during securities gains losses are the most variable component of other operating income 
during  we recorded a non cash charge of approximately million as a result of an other than temporary impairment analysis performed on our investment portfolio at year end 
this process is described more fully in the investment securities section of the consolidated balance sheet review 
this charge was offset by gains realized from sales of investment securities and calls on fixed income bonds 
other operating expenses increased million in when compared to this increase is attributable to an increase of 
million in salaries and wages in when compared to other expenses such as marketing  membership fees and licenses  and information system conversion costs increased by 
million in when compared to dividends the corporation continued its tradition of paying dividends to shareholders during  increasing them to per share  a increase from per share in the corporation has paid quarterly cash dividends consistently since  the year in which it was formed 
however  as noted above  the corporation is generally prohibited from increasing this dividend  unless prior consent from treasury is given or until the earlier of i january  or ii the date on which the series a preferred stock has been redeemed in full or treasury has transferred all of the series a preferred stock to non affiliates 
looking forward we will continue to face risks and challenges in the future  including changes in local economic conditions in our core geographic markets  potential yield compression on loan and deposit products from existing competitors and potential new entrants in our markets  fluctuations in interest rates and changes to existing federal and state legislation and regulations over banks and financial holding companies 
for a more complete discussion of these and other risk factors  see item a of part i of this annual report 
critical accounting policies and estimates this discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent liabilities 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in item of part ii of this annual report 
on an on going basis  management evaluates estimates  including those related to loan losses and intangible assets 
management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
management believes the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
allowance for loan losses one of our most important accounting policies is that related to the monitoring of the loan portfolio 
a variety of estimates impact the carrying value of the loan portfolio  including the calculation of the allowance for loan losses  the valuation of underlying collateral  the timing of loan charge offs and the placement of loans on non accrual status 
the allowance is established and maintained at a level that management believes is adequate to cover losses resulting from the inability of borrowers to make required payment on loans 
estimates for loan losses are arrived at by analyzing risks associated with the specific loans and the loan portfolio  current and historical trends in delinquencies and charge offs  and changes in the size and composition of the loan portfolio 
the analysis also requires consideration of the economic climate and direction  changes in lending rates  political conditions  legislation impacting the banking industry and economic conditions specific to western maryland and northeastern west virginia 
because the calculation of the allowance for loan losses relies on management s estimates and judgments relating to inherently uncertain events  actual results may differ from management s estimates 
the allowance for loan losses is also discussed below in this item under the caption allowance for loan losses and in note to consolidated financial statements contained in item of part ii of this annual report 
goodwill and other intangible assets statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for goodwill and other intangible assets  establishes standards for the amortization of acquired intangible assets and the non amortization and impairment assessment of goodwill 
we have million of core deposit intangible assets and million related to acquisitions of insurance books of business which are subject to amortization 
the million in recorded goodwill is primarily related to the acquisition of huntington national bank branches that occurred in  which is not subject to periodic amortization 
goodwill arising from business combinations represents the value attributable to unidentifiable intangible elements in the business acquired 
our goodwill relates to value inherent in the banking business and the value is dependent upon our ability to provide quality  cost effective services in a highly competitive local market 
this ability relies upon continuing investments in processing systems  the development of value added service features and the ease of use of our services 
as such  goodwill value is supported ultimately by revenue that is driven by the volume of business transacted 
a decline in earnings as a result of a lack of growth or the inability to deliver cost effective services over sustained periods can lead to impairment of goodwill  which could adversely impact earnings in future periods 
sfas no 
requires an annual evaluation of goodwill for impairment 
the determination of whether or not these assets are impaired involves significant judgments 
management has completed its annual evaluation for impairment and concluded that the recorded value of goodwill was not impaired 
however  future changes in strategy and or market conditions could significantly impact these judgments and require adjustments to recorded asset balances 
other than temporary impairment of investment securities securities available for sale securities available for sale are stated at fair value  with the unrealized gains and losses  net of tax  reported as a separate component of accumulated other comprehensive income loss in shareholders equity 
the amortized cost of debt securities classified as available for sale is adjusted for amortization of premiums to the first call date  if applicable  or to maturity  and for accretion of discounts to maturity  or in the case of mortgage backed securities  over the estimated life of the security 
such amortization and accretion  plus interest and dividends  are included in interest income from investments 
management systematically evaluates investment securities for impairment on a quarterly basis 
declines in the fair value of available for sale securities below their cost that are considered other than temporary declines are recognized in earnings as realized losses in the period in which the impairment determination is made 
in estimating other than temporary impairment losses  management considers the length of time and the extent to which the fair value has been less than cost  the financial condition and near term prospects of the issuer  and the intent and ability of the corporation to retain its investment in the issuer for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in fair value 
this process is described more fully in the investment securities section of the consolidated balance sheet review 
gains and losses on the sale of securities are recorded using the specific identification method 
fair value of investments our entire investment portfolio is classified as available for sale and is therefore carried at fair value 
we have determined the fair value of our investment securities in accordance with the requirements of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 fair value instruments 
sfas no 
defines fair value and establishes a framework for measuring fair value under gaap and expands the disclosures about fair value measurements 
the corporation measures the fair market values of its investments based on the fair value hierarchy established in sfas no 
the determination of fair value of investments and other assets is discussed further in note to consolidated financial statements contained in item of part ii of this annual report 
pension plan assumptions our pension plan costs are calculated using actuarial concepts  as discussed within the requirements of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 employers accounting for pensions  sfas no 
r and as amended by sfas no 
 employers accounting for deferred benefit pension and other post retirement plans 
pension expense and the determination of our projected pension liability are based upon two critical assumptions the discount rate and the expected return on plan assets 
we evaluate each of these critical assumptions annually 
other assumptions impact the determination of pension expense and the projected liability including the primary employee demographics  such as retirement patterns  employee turnover  mortality rates  and estimated employer compensation increases 
these factors  along with the critical assumptions  are carefully reviewed by management each year in consultation with our pension plan consultants and actuaries 
further information about our pension plan assumptions  the plan s funded status  and other plan information is included in note to the consolidated financial statements  which is included in item of part ii of this annual report 
recent accounting pronouncements and developments note to the consolidated financial statements included in item  part ii of this annual report discusses new accounting pronouncements that when adopted  may have an effect on our consolidated financial statements 
consolidated statement of income review net interest income net interest income is our largest source of operating revenue 
net interest income is the difference between the interest earned on interest earning assets and the interest expense incurred on interest bearing liabilities 
for analytical and discussion purposes  net interest income is adjusted to a taxable equivalent basis to facilitate performance comparisons between taxable and tax exempt assets by increasing tax exempt income by an amount equal to the federal income taxes that would have been paid if this income were taxable at the statutorily applicable rate 
the table below summarizes net interest income on a taxable equivalent basis for the years dollars in thousands 
interest income interest expense net interest income net interest margin net interest income increased million in over the same period in  due to a million increase in interest income coupled with a million decrease in interest expense 
the increase in interest income resulted from an increase in average interest earning assets of million during when compared to the increased level of interest earning assets is attributable to the growth that we experienced in our loan and investment portfolios during the declines in the interest rates throughout contributed to the decrease in the average yield on our average earning assets of basis points  from in to in on a fully tax equivalent basis 
the average yield on loans decreased by basis points and the yield on investment securities as a percentage of interest earning assets was stable in although we experienced an increase in average interest bearing liabilities of million in  interest expense decreased million due to the decline in interest rates and the enhanced efforts of the internal treasury committee 
average deposits increased in by approximately million 
effective management of both retail and wholesale interest rates resulted in a basis point decrease in the average rate paid on our average interest bearing liabilities from for to for the net result of the aforementioned factors was a basis point increase in the net interest margin at december  to from at december comparing to  net interest income increased million due to a million increase in interest income offset by a million increase in interest expense 
the increase in interest income resulted from an increase in average interest earning assets of million during when compared to the increased level of interest earning assets is attributable to the growth that we experienced in our loan and investment portfolios during emphasis on adjustable rate loan products and the investment portfolio restructuring contributed to the increase in the average yield on our average earning assets of basis points  from in to in on a fully tax equivalent basis 
the average yield on loans increased by basis points and the yield on investment securities as a percentage of interest earning assets increased basis points from to interest expense increased during when compared to due to the higher interest rate environment  and an overall increase in average interest bearing liabilities of million 
deposits increased in by approximately million due to successful retail growth in money market products and the purchase of million in brokered money market funds 
the combined effect of the competitive retail rate environment and the volume increases in our average interest bearing liabilities resulted in a basis point increase in the average rate paid on our average interest bearing liabilities from for to for the net result of the aforementioned factors was a basis point decline in the net interest margin at december  to from at december as shown below  the composition of total interest income over the three year period from to shows a gradual increase in interest on investments and a corresponding decline in interest and fees on loans 
this shift is attributable to the leverage strategies implemented throughout and leverage strategies are the purchase of investment securities funded by borrowings of matched terms and durations 
the difference between the rate earned and the rate paid has resulted in additional earnings 
management has more control over the rates  duration and structure of the investment portfolio as compared to the loan portfolio which is customized to the individual needs of each borrower 
as such  the investment portfolio is used as a supplement to our asset liability management process

we have closely reviewed and applied sensitivity analysis to the collateral values related to our loan portfolio to adequately measure potential future losses 
specific allocations have been provided in instances where loans have been considered impaired and collateral analysis indicates that losses may occur 
approximately million of the recorded expense is attributable to a real estate and development loan in hardy county  west virginia and deterioration in a group of loan relationships outside of the corporation s market area 
additional provision expense was also recorded because the company that services a commercial loan in which the bank holds a participation interest failed to remit million in principal payments made by the borrower that were due to the bank

this sale of securities was part of our overall restructuring of the investment portfolio designed to improve overall earnings from the portfolio 
we experienced a decline in other income during primarily due to reduced secondary market fees as a result of a shift to in house portfolio loans

we have policies and procedures designed to mitigate credit risk and to maintain the quality of our loan portfolio 
these policies include underwriting standards for new credits as well as continuous monitoring and reporting policies for asset quality and the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses 
these policies  coupled with ongoing training efforts  have provided effective checks and balances for the risk associated with the lending process 
lending authority is based on the type of the loan  and the experience of the lending officer 
commercial loans are collateralized primarily by real estate and  to a lesser extent  equipment and vehicles 
unsecured commercial loans represent an insignificant portion of total commercial loans 
residential mortgage loans are collateralized by the related property 
any residential mortgage loan exceeding a specified internal loan to value ratio requires private mortgage insurance 
installment loans are typically collateralized  with loan to value ratios which are established based on the financial condition of the borrower 
we will also make unsecured consumer loans to qualified borrowers meeting our underwriting standards 
additional information about our loans and underwriting policies can be found in item of part i of this annual report under the caption banking products and services 
table sets forth the composition of our loan portfolio 
historically  our policy has been to make the majority of our loan commitments in our market areas 
we had no foreign loans in our portfolio as of december for all of the periods presented 
summary of loan portfolio dollars in thousands table loans outstanding as of december commercial real estate mortgage consumer installment real estate construction lease financing total loans during  gross loans increased by million  or  over this growth was focused in our commercial million and residential mortgage million loan portfolios  offset by a decline in installment million and remains consistent with management s objectives over the past several years 
continued efforts were made to increase the percentage of loans in the portfolio with adjustable interest rates 
at december   adjustable interest rate loans maturing within one to five years were of total loans  compared to at december  commercial loans increased in  following a increase in the growth in the commercial portfolio is a result of both in house production and participations with other institutions 
commercial loans secured by real estate were of total commercial loans at december   compared to and at december  and  respectively 
residential mortgage loans increased by million  or  in when compared to this follows a increase in over the growth in the residential portfolio consists of both adjustable and fixed rate products 
fixed interest rate loans made up of the total loan portfolio at december   compared to and of total loans at december  and  respectively 
consumer installment loans in decreased by million  or  when compared to this decrease reflects management s continued shift toward more commercial loans with less emphasis on the highly competitive consumer loan market and indirect car dealer loans 
indirect auto loans comprise the largest percentage of installment loans  at december   and at december  and the following table sets forth the remaining maturities  based upon contractual dates  for selected loan categories as of december  in thousands maturities of loan portfolio at december  table maturing within one year after one but within five years maturing after five years total commercial real estate mortgage installment real estate construction total loans classified by sensitivity to change in interest rates fixed interest rate loans adjustable interest rate loans total loans our policy is to place loans on non accrual status  except for consumer loans  whenever there is substantial doubt about the ability of a borrower to pay principal or interest on the outstanding credit 
management considers such factors as payment history  the nature of the collateral securing the loan  and the overall economic situation of the borrower when making a non accrual decision 
management closely monitors the status of all non accrual loans 
a non accruing loan is restored to accrual status when principal and interest payments have been brought current  it becomes well secured  or is in the process of collection and the prospects of future contractual payments are no longer in doubt 
generally  consumer installment loans are not placed on non accrual status  but are charged off after they are days contractually past due

million during and 
million during and allowance for loan losses an allowance for loan losses is maintained to absorb losses from the loan portfolio 
the allowance for loan losses is based on management s continuing evaluation of the quality of the loan portfolio  assessment of current economic conditions  diversification and size of the portfolio  adequacy of collateral  past and anticipated loss experience  and the amount of non performing loans 
we use the methodology outlined in fdic statement of policy on allowance for loan losses 
the starting point for this methodology is to segregate the loan portfolio into two pools  non homogeneous ie  commercial and homogeneous ie  consumer and residential mortgage loans 
each loan pool is analyzed with general allowances and specific allocations being made as appropriate 
for general allowances  the previous eight quarters of loss activity are used in the estimation of losses in the current portfolio 
these historical loss amounts are modified by the following qualitative factors levels of and trends in delinquency rates and non accrual loans  trends in volumes and terms of loans  effects of changes in lending policies  experience  ability  and depth of management  national and local economic trends and conditions  and concentrations of credit in the determination of the general allowance 
the qualitative factors are updated each quarter by information obtained from internal  regulatory  and governmental sources 
specific allocations of the allowance for loan losses are made for those loans on the watchlist in which the collateral value is less than the outstanding loan balance with the allocation being the dollar difference between the two 
the watchlist represents loans  identified and closely monitored by management  which possess certain qualities or characteristics that may lead to collection and loss issues 
allocations are not made for loans that are cash secured  for the small business administration and farm service agency guaranteed portion of loans  or for loans that are sufficiently collateralized 
the allowance for loan losses is based on estimates  and actual losses will vary from current estimates 
these estimates are reviewed quarterly  and as adjustments  either positive or negative  become necessary  a corresponding increase or decrease is made in the allowance for loan losses 
the methodology used to determine the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses is consistent with prior years 
an estimate for probable losses related to unfunded lending commitments  such as letters of credit and binding but unfunded loan commitments is also prepared 
this estimate is computed in a manner similar to the methodology described above  adjusted for the probability of actually funding the commitment 
the balance of the allowance for loan losses increased to million at december   from million at december  several factors contributed to the million increase in the balance of the allowance in  including a significant increase in the balance of non accrual loans  from million in to million in  changes to the qualitative factors which are reviewed quarterly  an increase in impaired loans from million in to million in  and an increase in the percentage of net charge offs to average outstanding loans from 
in to 
in non accrual loans and impaired loans consist primarily of real estate development loans and commercial real estate that have experienced a slowdown in the level of sales activity during the current year 
all of these types of credit facilities were thoroughly reviewed by management during the fourth quarter of as to the adequacy of the collateral  the valuation of collateral  secondary sources of repayment  and other credit quality attributes 
collateral valuations were also subject to a sensitivity and shock analysis in order to identify loans that may not have sufficient collateral in the event of a significant decline in the market value of the collateral 
as a result of this extensive review  some specific allocations of the allowance were made to several of these loans 
at december   the balance of the allowance was equal to of total loans  which was times the amount of net charge offs for the year 
performing loans considered impaired loans  as defined and identified by management  amounted to million at december  loans are identified as impaired when the loan is classified as substandard and management determines that it is probable that the borrower will not be able to pay principal and interest according to the contractual terms of the loan 
these loans consist primarily of acquisition and development loans 
the fair values are generally determined based upon independent third party appraisals of the collateral or discounted cash flows based upon the expected proceeds 
specific allocations have been made where management believes there is insufficient collateral and no secondary source of repayment is available 
during  there was significant coverage in the media regarding the topic of sub prime loans and the resulting increase in loan delinquencies and foreclosures 
a sub prime loan is defined generally as a loan to a borrower with a weak credit record or a reduced repayment capacity 
these borrowers typically pose a higher risk of default and foreclosure 
we generally do not make sub prime loans 
if credit is extended to a sub prime borrower  the decision to lend is based on the presence of facts and circumstances that management believes mitigate the risks inherent in this type of loan 
as of december   management believes that our exposure to sub prime loans is very minimal 
the balance of the allowance for loan losses increased to million at december   from million at december  several factors contributed to the 
million increase in the balance of the allowance in  including a increase in the balance of non accrual loans from million in to million in  changes to the qualitative factors which are reviewed quarterly  an increase in impaired loans from 
million in to million in  and an increase in the percentage of net charge offs to average outstanding loans from 
in to 
in non accrual loans and impaired loans consist primarily of real estate acquisition and development loans that have experienced a slowdown in the level of sales activity during the current year 
all of these types of credit facilities were thoroughly reviewed by management during the fourth quarter of as to the adequacy of the collateral  the valuation of collateral  and other credit quality attributes 
collateral valuations were also subject to a sensitivity and shock analysis in order to identify loans that may not have sufficient collateral in the event of a significant decline in the market value of the collateral 
as a result of this extensive review  some specific allocations of the allowance were made to several a d loans 
at december   the balance of the allowance was equal to 
of total loans  which was five times the amount of net charge offs for the year 
as a result of management s evaluation of the loan portfolio using the factors and methodology described above  management believes the allowance for loan losses is adequate as of december  table presents the activity in the allowance for loan losses by major loan category for the past five years

changes in the allocation over time reflect changes in the composition of the loan portfolio risk profile and refinements to the methodology of determining the allowance

accordingly  the entire allowance is considered available to absorb losses in any category

investment securities classified as available for sale are held for an indefinite period of time and may be sold in response to changing market and interest rate conditions or for liquidity purposes as part of our overall asset liability management strategy 
available for sale securities are reported at market value  with unrealized gains and losses excluded from earnings and reported as a separate component of other comprehensive income included in shareholders equity  net of applicable income taxes 
we do not currently purchase securities with the intent to resell and  therefore  do not own any securities classified as trading securities

the following sets forth the composition of our securities portfolio  reported at fair value  by major category as of the indicated dates in thousands december fair value as of total as of total as of total securities available for sale us government and agencies mortgage backed securities obligation of states and political subdivisions corporate and other debt total total investment securities increased million in when compared to mortgage backed securities increased by million and us government agencies increased by million while corporate and other debt decreased million 
the corporate portfolio consists primarily of preferred term securities which are pools of debt issued by various banks 
the decrease in this sector is due to a decline in the market value of these securities directly attributable to the current economic and financial environment 
total investment securities increased million in when compared to the year end balance 
the increase in our investment portfolio since year end is primarily due to the purchase of million in corporate bonds during the first quarter of as part of a leverage strategy originally implemented during the fourth quarter of and the purchase of additional securities in september mortgage backed securities increased by million and tax exempt municipal bonds increased by million while us government agencies decreased million 
at december   the securities available for sale balance included a net unrealized loss of million  which represents the difference between fair value and amortized cost 
the comparable amount at december  was a net unrealized loss of million 
the fair values of securities available for sale will generally decrease whenever interest rates increase  and the fair values will typically increase in a declining rate environment 
however  fair values have been largely affected in by factors such as marketability  liquidity and the current economic environment 
as more fully discussed in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in item of part ii of this annual report  effective january   we began measuring fair market values based on the fair value hierarchy established in sfas no 
and in financial accounting standards board staff position fsp no 
fsp the hierarchy gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities level measurements and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs level measurements 
level prices or valuation techniques require inputs that are both significant to the valuation assumptions and are not readily observable in the market ie supported with little or no market activity 
these level instruments are valued based on both observable and unobservable inputs derived from the best available data  some of which is internally developed  and considers risk premiums that a market participant would require 
approximately million of our securities available for sale were classified using significant unobservable inputs level assets 
these securities were preferred term securities classified as corporate securities and contributed approximately million to the unrealized loss reported in our accumulated other comprehensive income loss on the statement of financial condition 
the underlying issuers for these securities are primarily financial institutions and insurance companies 
preferred term securities contractually allow an issuer to defer interest payments for up to twenty quarters 
although there have been deferrals and defaults of some of the underlying issuers  the structured securities held in our portfolio are generally secured by over collateralization or default protection provided by subordinated tranches 
management evaluates on a quarterly basis each security in an unrealized loss position for other than temporary impairment 
in its evaluation  management considers such factors as the length of time and the extent to which the market value has been below cost  the financial condition and near term prospects of the issuer  including specific events which may have influenced the operations of the issuer  and our intent and ability to hold the security to an expected recovery in market value 
due to the duration and the significant market value decline in our preferred term securities  we performed more extensive testing on these securities for purposes of evaluating whether an other than temporary impairment has occurred 
length of time and extent that market value is less than cost twenty one of the preferred term securities in our portfolio have been in an unrealized loss position for over months and three have been in an unrealized loss position for less than months 
although some of the securities have been in a loss position for over one year  this is not an automatic indication of an other than temporary impairment 
rather  individual facts and circumstances may indicate that a decline in fair value longer than months may be temporary 
given the extraordinary market conditions prevalent during  particularly during the third and fourth quarters  additional consideration has been given to the length of time the securities have been in a loss position and the likelihood that a market recovery will be longer than an otherwise orderly market would dictate 
factors to be considered in an impairment judgment may be both subjective and objective and include knowledge and experience about past and current events as well as assumptions about future events 
in the case of the preferred term securities  the decline in fair value is attributable to adverse conditions in the market  adverse conditions in the financial industry  as well as adverse conditions related to the underlying issuers of the securities all of whom operate in the financial industry 
financial condition and near term prospects of the issuers the current economic and financial environment  driven primarily by the significant delinquencies and foreclosures of subprime loans and the banking crisis  has led to unprecedented events in the financial industry 
during  we have witnessed a significant decline in housing prices  the collapse of bear stearns  lehman brothers  washington mutual and indymac bank  a federal takeover of fannie mae and freddie mac  and the acquisitions of countrywide and merrill lynch by bank of america  just to mention a few headline events 
all of these events have contributed to a national and worldwide liquidity and credit crisis 
during this same time period  the federal reserve bank cut interest rates by basis points and the us government announced a billion bailout plan for financial institutions 
the underlying issuers of the preferred term securities in our portfolio all operate in some realm of the financial industry  most of them community banks 
due to the factors previously discussed  the current market for preferred term securities is virtually non existent 
there were no new pooled trust preferred issuances during and trading activity for this class of securities buy side shows total quarterly trades in at   and trades  respectively 
the volume has declined from a high of million in the first quarter of to just million in the quarter ended december  this is clearly indicative of an inactive and inefficient market leading to the depressed pricing on these securities 
all of the above mentioned issues sub prime housing  lack of liquidity and credit in the banking industry  coupled with the general interest rate environment have a direct  and in some cases indirect  affect on the underlying banks and insurance company issuers in the preferred term securities 
a few of the underlying institutions have deferred payment of the interest as described above on their securities and some have defaulted 
generally accepted accounting principles gaap require management to consider all available evidence in its evaluation of the realizable value of its investment 
judgment is required to determine whether factors exist that indicate an impairment loss has been incurred at the end of a reporting period 
the judgment may be based on both subjective and objective factors 
in its analysis  management considered the credit ratings along with all other available information to evaluate the credit quality of the underlying collateral 
several shocks of the collateral were performed in order to determine how much stress the security could withstand before a break in principal would be experienced 
in addition  the securities subject to emerging issues task force eitf issue no 
 recognition of interest income and impairment on purchased and retained beneficial interests in securitized financial assets eitf  are monitored for significant adverse changes in cash flow projections 
on january   the financial accounting standards board issued fsp eitf  amendments to the impairment guidance of eitf  effective for interim and annual reporting periods ending after december  the purpose of this guidance is to better align the impairment guidance and assessment of an other than temporary impairment with the related guidance in fasb statement no 
 accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities 
the primary change in the new guidance is the removal of the requirement to estimate cash flows from the views of a market participant but rather to base the estimate of cash flows on current information and events 
further  in making the other than temporary assessment  the holder should consider all relevant information about past events  current conditions  and reasonable and supportable forecasts when estimating future cash flows 
this information should include remaining payment terms of the security  prepayment speeds  the financial condition of the issuer s  expected defaults  and the value of any underlying collateral 
eitf requires that the present value of the current estimated cash flows be compared to the present value of cash flows at the last reporting date 
if the present value of the original cash flows estimated at the initial transaction date or at the last date previously revised is greater than the present value of the current estimated cash flows  the change is considered adverse that is an other than temporary impairment should be considered to have occurred under the consensus in this issue 
as of december   there was no adverse change in the estimated cash flows noted for the securities in an unrealized loss position held subject to eitf on october   as part of the government s economic stabilization plan  the treasury announced two plans  the cpp and the tlgp 
the regulators highly encouraged participation in the programs in order to build capital levels  supply additional liquidity to the banking industry  and improve financial ratios for the large regional and national banks and the community banks 
many of the banks who issued the preferred term securities have announced participation in the cpp 
management believes that these programs should help to bolster confidence in the industry 
however  due to the early stages of both programs  a long recovery is still anticipated as the liquidity works its way through the banking system 
intent and ability to retain investment the risk based capital ratios require that banks set aside additional capital for securities that are rated below investment grade 
two of our preferred term securities have been downgraded and management feels that additional downgrades may be possible 
however  based upon models and testing performed on our investment portfolio  management feels that the company has adequate capital to sustain future downgrades 
we maintain sufficient capital and liquidity to cover operating expenses and we do not anticipate any material commitments or expected outlays of capital in the near term 
the decline in fair market value of these securities does not have a material impact on the operations  liquidity or the capital resources of the company 
other than temporary impairment charge based upon our review of credit quality and the cash flow tests performed  management determined that two of our preferred term securities were other than temporarily impaired 
as a result of this assessment  we recorded a million loss on these securities as of december  we have both the intent and ability to hold the remaining securities in our portfolio for the period of time necessary to recover their amortized cost or until maturity and do not believe that those securities are other than temporarily impaired 
during  we restructured our investment portfolio by replacing certain securities with securities having a longer duration 
we determined that the securities earmarked for sale would  if retained  have subjected our earnings to higher volatility in a declining interest rate environment 
the restructure resulted in a pre tax loss of approximately million in earnings 
the securities sold had an average book yield of 
the proceeds from the sale of these securities were reinvested in securities having an average book yield of approximately 
the restructuring of our investment portfolio enabled us to rebalance the portfolio and restructure the maturity schedule of the portfolio to mitigate the effects of premium and call risk and to manage our future interest rate risk and effective tax yield 
there continues to be ongoing media attention regarding sub prime mortgage investments 
sub prime mortgages with similar characteristics can be packaged together and sold as investments 
we believe that we do not have significant exposure to these types of securities 
we manage our investment portfolio utilizing policies which seek to achieve desired levels of liquidity  manage interest rate sensitivity  meet earnings objectives  and provide required collateral support for deposit activities and treasury management overnight investment products

management will continue to closely monitor interest rates within the context of its overall asset liability management process 
see the interest rate sensitivity section of this item for further discussion on this topic 
at december   we had additional borrowing capacity with the fhlb totaling million  an additional million of unused lines of credit with various financial institutions and million through wholesale money market funds 
see note to consolidated financial statements  included in item of part ii of this annual report  for further details about our borrowings and additional borrowing capacity  which is incorporated herein by reference 
capital resources the bank and the corporation are subject to risk based capital regulations  which were adopted and monitored by federal banking regulators 
these guidelines are used to evaluate capital adequacy and are based on an institution s asset risk profile and off balance sheet exposures  such as unused loan commitments and stand by letters of credit 
the regulatory guidelines require that a portion of total capital be tier capital  consisting of common shareholders equity  qualifying portion of trust issued preferred securities  and perpetual preferred stock  less goodwill and certain other deductions 
the remaining capital  or tier capital  consists of elements such as subordinated debt  mandatory convertible debt  remaining portion of trust issued preferred securities  and grandfathered senior debt  plus the allowance for loan losses  subject to certain limitations 
under the risk based capital regulations  banking organizations are required to maintain a minimum for well capitalized banks total risk based capital ratio total qualifying capital divided by risk weighted assets  including a tier ratio of for well capitalized banks 
the risk based capital rules have been further supplemented by a leverage ratio  defined as tier i capital divided by average assets  after certain adjustments 
the minimum leverage ratio is for well capitalized banks for banking organizations that do not anticipate significant growth and have well diversified risk including no undue interest rate risk exposure  excellent asset quality  high liquidity and good earnings 
other banking organizations not in this category are expected to have ratios of at least  depending on their particular condition and growth plans 
higher capital ratios could be required if warranted by the particular circumstances or risk profile of a given banking organization 
in the current regulatory environment  banking organizations must stay well capitalized in order to receive favorable regulatory treatment on acquisition and other expansion activities and favorable risk based deposit insurance assessments 
the corporation s capital policy establishes guidelines meeting these regulatory requirements  and takes into consideration current or anticipated risks as well as potential future growth opportunities 
at december   the corporation s total risk based capital ratio was  which was well above the regulatory minimum of 
the corporation s total risk based capital ratio for year end was 
as of december   the most recent notification from the regulators categorizes the corporation as well capitalized under the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action 
see note to consolidated financial statements  included in item of part ii of this annual report  for additional information regarding regulatory capital ratios

as discussed above  the corporation participated in the cpp by issuing million in series a preferred stock together with a related warrant to purchase  shares of common stock on january  the proceeds of the sale will count as tier capital and the warrant will qualify as tangible common equity 
liquidity the asset and liability management committee of the corporation seeks to assess and manage the risks associated with fluctuating interest rates while maintaining adequate liquidity 
this is accomplished by formulating and implementing policies that take into account the sources and uses of funds  maturity and repricing distributions of assets and liabilities  pricing strategies  and marketability of assets 
the objective of liquidity management is to maintain sufficient funds to satisfy the needs of depositors and borrowers 
the principal sources of asset liquidity are cash and due from banks  interest bearing deposits in banks  federal funds and investment securities available for sale that are not pledged 
at december   such liquid assets totaled million 
while much more difficult to quantify  liability liquidity is enhanced by a stable core deposit base  access to credit lines at other financial institutions  and the corporation s ability to renew maturing deposits 
the corporation s ability to attract deposits and borrow funds depends primarily on continued rate competitiveness  profitability  capitalization and overall financial condition 
when appropriate  we take advantage of external sources of funds  such as advances from the fhlb  lines of credit at other financial institutions and brokered funds 
these external sources often provide attractive interest rates and flexible maturity dates that better enable us to match funding dates and pricing characteristics with contractual maturity dates and pricing parameters of earning assets 
at december   our available borrowing capacity through the fhlb and other financial institutions was approximately million 
in addition  we had approximately million available funding through brokered money market funds 
we actively manage our liquidity position under the direction of the asset and liability management committee of the corporation s board of directors 
monthly reviews by management and quarterly reviews by this committee under prescribed policies and procedures are intended to ensure that we will maintain adequate levels of available funds 
management believes that we have adequate liquidity available to respond to current and anticipated liquidity demands  which could include future branch expansion 
management anticipates opening additional branches or expanding current facilities in its existing market footprint annually or bi annually for the next several years 
at the holding company level  the corporation uses cash to pay dividends to shareholders and to service its junior subordinated debt 
the main sources of funding for the holding company include dividends from the bank and access to the capital markets 
as discussed in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements  included in item of part ii of this annual report  the bank is subject to significant regulation and  among other things  may be limited in its ability to pay dividends or transfer funds to the holding company 
accordingly  consolidated cash flows as presented in the consolidated statements of cash flows may not represent cash immediately available to the holding company 
during  the bank declared and paid dividends of million 
as of december   the amount of additional dividends that the bank could have paid to the corporation without regulatory approval was million 
interest rate sensitivity our primary market risk is interest rate fluctuation 
interest rate risk results primarily from the traditional banking activities that we engage in  such as gathering deposits and extending loans 
many factors  including economic and financial conditions  movements in interest rates and consumer preferences affect the difference between the interest earned on our assets and the interest paid on our liabilities 
interest rate sensitivity refers to the degree that earnings will be impacted by changes in the prevailing level of interest rates 
interest rate risk arises from mismatches in the repricing or maturity characteristics between interest bearing assets and liabilities 
management seeks to minimize fluctuating net interest margins  and to enhance consistent growth of net interest income through periods of changing interest rates 
management uses interest sensitivity gap analysis and simulation models to measure and manage these risks 
the interest rate sensitivity gap analysis assigns each interest earning asset and interest bearing liability to a time frame reflecting its next repricing or maturity date 
the differences between total interest sensitive assets and liabilities at each time interval represent the interest sensitivity gap for that interval 
a positive gap generally indicates that rising interest rates during a given interval will increase net interest income  as more assets than liabilities will reprice 
a negative gap position would benefit us during a period of declining interest rates 
during  we remained negatively gapped although our focus was shifted to begin moving to a more neutral position in anticipation of rising interest rates 
in order to manage interest sensitivity risk  management formulates guidelines regarding asset generation and pricing  funding sources and pricing  and off balance sheet commitments 
these guidelines are based on management s outlook regarding future interest rate movements  the state of the regional and national economy  and other financial and business risk factors 
management uses computer simulations to measure the effect on net interest income of various interest rate scenarios 
key assumptions used in the computer simulations include cash flows and maturities of interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities  changes in asset volumes and pricing  and management s capital plans 
this modeling reflects interest rate changes and the related impact on net interest income over specified periods 
management has not historically used derivative financial instruments to manage its interest rate sensitivity 
at december   the static gap analysis prepared by management indicated that we remained slightly liability sensitive over the next year 
in computing the effect on net interest income of changes in interest rates  management has assumed that any changes would immediately affect earnings 
normally  when an organization is liability sensitive there is a negative impact to net interest income when interest rates increase 
based on the simulation analysis performed at december  and  management estimated the following changes in net interest income  assuming the indicated rate changes dollars in thousands basis point increase basis point increase basis point decrease this estimate is based on assumptions that may be affected by unforeseeable changes in the general interest rate environment and any number of unforeseeable factors 
rates on different assets and liabilities within a single maturity category adjust to changes in interest rates to varying degrees and over varying periods of time 
the relationships between lending rates and rates paid on purchased funds are not constant over time 
management can respond to current or anticipated market conditions by lengthening or shortening the corporation s sensitivity through loan repricings or changing its funding mix 
the rate of growth in interest free sources of funds will influence the level of interest sensitive funding sources 
in addition  the absolute level of interest rates will affect the volume of earning assets and funding sources 
as a result of these limitations  the interest sensitive gap is only one factor to be considered in estimating the net interest margin 
impact of inflation our assets and liabilities are primarily monetary in nature  and as such  future changes in prices do not affect the obligations to pay or receive fixed and determinable amounts of money 
during inflationary periods  monetary assets lose value in terms of purchasing power and monetary liabilities have corresponding purchasing power gains 
the concept of purchasing power is not an adequate indicator of the impact of inflation on financial institutions because it does not incorporate changes in interest rates  which are an important determination of the corporation s earnings 
contractual obligations  commitments and off balance sheet arrangements the following table presents  as of december   significant fixed and determinable contractual obligations to third parties by payment date and amounts and expected maturities of significant commitments 
commitments to extend credit and letters of credit are legally binding  conditional agreements generally having fixed expiration or termination dates 
these commitments generally require customers to maintain certain credit standards and are established based on management s credit assessment of the customer 
the commitments may expire without being drawn upon 
therefore  the total commitment does not necessarily represent future funding requirements 
further discussion of the nature of certain obligations and commitments is included in the notes to the consolidated financial statements referenced in the table below  which are included in item of part ii of this annual report
