store operations all fred s stores are open six days a week monday through saturday  and most stores are open seven days a week excluding the pharmacy 
store hours are generally from am to am  however  certain stores are open only until pm each fred s store is managed by a full time store manager and those stores with a pharmacy employ a full time pharmacist 
the company s district managers and regional vice presidents supervise the management and operation of fred s stores 
fred s operates pharmacies as of january   which offer brand name and generic pharmaceuticals and are staffed by licensed pharmacists and are managed by healthcare managers equivalent to district managers at the store level 
the addition of acquired pharmacies in the company s stores has resulted in increased store sales and sales per selling square foot 
management believes that the pharmacy department  in addition to the other merchandise departments  increases customer traffic and repeat visits and is an integral part of the store s operation 
the company has an incentive compensation plan for store managers  pharmacists and district managers based on meeting or exceeding targeted profit percentage contributions 
various factors included in determining profit percentage contribution are gross profits and controllable expenses at the store level 
these factors of operating performance are reviewed regularly by executive management to pinpoint developments in key performance areas

seasonality our business is somewhat seasonal in that the company s sales volume is heavier around the first of the calendar month 
many of the customers who shop at fred s stores rely on government aid  social security  and other means that are typically paid at the first of the month 
these governmental payment cycles coupled with the distribution of our newspaper advertising circular are major factors in concentrating sales earlier in the calendar month

our competitors range from smaller  growing companies to considerably larger retail businesses that have greater financial  distribution  marketing and other resources than we do

risk factors investors are encouraged to carefully consider the risks described below and other information contained in this document when considering an investment decision with respect to fred s securities 
additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to management  or that management currently deems immaterial  may also impair the company s business operations 
any of the events discussed in the risk factors below may occur 
if one or more of these events do occur  business  results of operations or financial condition could be materially adversely affected 
in that instance  the trading price of fred s securities could decline  and investors might lose all or part of their investment 
our business is somewhat seasonal 
we typically realize a significant portion of our net sales and net income during the christmas selling season in the fourth quarter 
our inventories and short term borrowings increase in anticipation of this holiday season 
a seasonal merchandise inventory imbalance could result if for any reason our net sales during the christmas selling season were to fall below seasonal norms 
if for any reason our fourth quarter results were substantially below expectations  our profitability and operating results could be adversely affected by unanticipated markdowns  especially in seasonal merchandise 
we operate in a competitive industry 
we are in a highly competitive sector of the discount retail merchandise business 
this competitive environment subjects us to the risk of reduced profitability because of lower prices  and lower margins  required to maintain our competitive position 
we compete with discount stores and with many other retailers  including department stores  variety stores  dollar stores  discount clothing stores  drug stores  grocery stores  outlet stores  convenience stores  warehouse stores and other stores  some of whom may have greater resources than we do 
this competitive environment subjects us to various risks  including the ability to continue to provide competitively priced merchandise to our customers that will allow us to maintain profitability and continue store growth 
some of our competitors utilize aggressive promotional activities  advertising programs  and pricing discounts and our results of operations could be adversely affected if we do not respond effectively to these efforts 
changes in third party reimbursements  including government programs  could adversely affect our business 
a significant portion of our sales are funded by federal and state governments and private insurance plans 
for the years ended january  and february   of our sales were derived from pharmaceutical sales 
the health care industry is experiencing a trend toward cost containment with governments and private insurance plans seeking to impose lower reimbursements and utilization restrictions 
payments made under such programs may not remain at levels comparable to the present levels or be sufficient to cover our cost 
private insurance plans may base their reimbursement rates on the government rates 
accordingly  reimbursements may be limited or reduced  thereby adversely affecting our revenues and cash flows 
additionally  and in light of a worsening economy  government or private insurance plans may adjust scheduled reimbursement payments to us in amounts that could have a material adverse effect on our cash flows and financial condition 
changes in consumer demand and product mix and changes in overall economic conditions could adversely affect our business 
our success depends on our ability to anticipate and respond in a timely manner to changing customer demands and preferences for product mix 
a general slowdown in the united states economy  rising personal debt levels  rising foreclosure rates  rising fuel prices  or changes in government aid  social security  and other means that many of our customers rely upon may adversely affect the spending of our consumers  which would likely result in lower net sales than expected on a quarterly or annual basis 
in addition  changes in the types of products available for sale and the selection of products by our customers affect sales  product mix and margins 
future economic conditions affecting disposable consumer income  such as employment levels  business conditions  fuel and energy costs  inflation  interest rates  and tax rates  could also adversely affect our business by reducing consumer spending or causing consumers to shift their spending to other products 
we might be unable to anticipate these buying patterns and implement appropriate inventory strategies  which would adversely affect our sales and gross profit performance 
in addition  increases in fuel and continued increases in energy costs would increase our transportation costs and overall cost of doing business and could adversely affect the our financial statements as a whole 
natural disasters or unusually adverse weather conditions could affect our business 
unusually adverse weather conditions  natural disasters or similar disruptions  could significantly reduce our net sales 
in addition  these disruptions could also adversely affect our supply chain efficiency and make it more difficult for us to obtain sufficient quantities of merchandise from suppliers 
a number of our stores are located in areas that are susceptible to hurricanes and tornadoes 

table of contents merchandise supply and pricing and the interruption of and dependence on imports could adversely affect our business 
we have maintained good relations with our vendors and believe that we are generally able to obtain attractive pricing and other terms from vendors 
we purchase a significant portion of our inventory from foreign suppliers  principally in the far east 
as a result  political instability or other events resulting in the disruption of trade from other countries or the imposition of additional regulations relating to duties on imports could cause significant delays or interruptions in the supply of our merchandise or increase our costs 
also  our cost of goods is affected by the fluctuation of local currencies against the dollar in countries where these goods are produced 
accordingly  changes in the value of the dollar relative to foreign currencies may increase our cost of goods sold and  if we are unable to pass such cost increases on to our customers  decrease our gross margins and ultimately our earnings 
we purchase a significant amount of goods from procter and gamble and several large import vendors and any disruption in that supply and or pricing of such merchandise could negatively impact our operations and results 
delays and costs of operating new stores and distribution facilities could have an adverse impact on our business 
we maintain two distribution facilities in our geographic territory  and plan on constructing new facilities as needed to support our growth 
one of our key business strategies is to expand our base of retail stores 
we plan on expanding and refreshing our network of stores through new store openings and remodeling existing stores each year 
delays in opening stores or delays in opening distribution facilities to service those new stores could adversely affect our future operations by slowing growth  which may in turn reduce revenue growth 
adverse changes in the cost to operate distribution facilities and stores  such as changes in labor  utilities  fuel and transportation  and other operating costs  could have an adverse impact on us 
operational difficulties could disrupt our business 
our stores are managed through a network of geographically dispersed management personnel 
our inability to effectively and efficiently operate our stores  including the ability to control losses resulting from inventory shrinkage  may negatively impact our sales and or margin 
in addition  we rely upon our distribution and logistics network to provide goods to stores in a timely and cost effective manner  any disruption  unanticipated expense or operational failure related to this process could negatively impact store operations 
our operation depends on a variety of information technology systems for the efficient functioning of its business 
we rely on certain software vendors to maintain and upgrade these systems as needed 
we rely on telecommunications carriers to gather and disseminate our operations information 
the disruption or failure of these systems or carriers could negatively impact our operations 
use of a single supplier of pharmaceutical products and our ability to negotiate satisfactory terms could adversely affect our business 
we have a long term supply contract from a single supplier  amerisourcebergen  for our pharmaceutical operations 
any significant disruption in our relationship with this supplier  deterioration in their financial condition  changes in terms  or an industry wide change in wholesale business practices  including those of our supplier  could have a material adverse effect on our operations 
higher than expected costs and not achieving our targeted results associated with the implementation of new programs  systems and technology could adversely affect our business 
we are undertaking a variety of operating initiatives as well as infrastructure initiatives 
the failure to properly execute any of these initiatives could have an adverse impact on our future operating results 
changes in state or federal legislation or regulations  including the effects of legislation and regulations on wage levels and entitlement programs  trade restrictions  tariffs  quotas and freight rates could adversely affect our business 
unanticipated changes in federal or state wage requirements or other changes in workplace regulation could adversely impact our ability to achieve our financial targets 
changes in trade restrictions  new tariffs and quotas  and higher shipping costs for goods could also adversely impact our ability to achieve anticipated operating results 
we depend on the success of our new store opening program for a portion of our growth 
our growth is dependent on both increases in sales in existing stores and the ability to open new stores 
unavailability of store locations that we deem attractive  delays in the acquisition or opening of new stores  difficulties in staffing and operating new store locations and lack of customer acceptance of stores in expanded market areas all may negatively impact our new store growth  the costs associated with new stores and or the profitability of new stores 
our ability to renew or enter into new leases on favorable terms could affect costs of operations or slow store expansions 

table of contents changes in our ability to attract and retain employees  and changes in health care and other insurance costs could adversely affect our business 
our growth could be adversely impacted by our inability to attract and retain employees at the store operations level  in distribution facilities  and at the corporate level  including our senior management team 
adverse changes in health care costs could also adversely impact our ability to achieve our operational and financial goals and to offer attractive benefit programs to our employees 
adverse impacts associated with legal proceedings and claims could affect our business 
we are a party to a variety of legal proceedings and claims  including those described elsewhere in this annual report 
operating results could be adversely impacted if legal proceedings and claims against us are made  requiring the payment of cash in connection with those proceedings or changes to the operation of the business 
our ability to achieve the results of our strategic plan initiatives could adversely affect our business 
as part of our continuing operations  we perform research and analysis to discover potential underperforming stores 
we use such research and analysis to identify potential store closures 
the estimated costs and charges associated with these initiatives may vary materially and adversely based upon various factors  including the timing of execution  the outcome of negotiations with landlords and other third parties  or unexpected costs  any of which could result in our not realizing the anticipated benefits from the strategic plan 
increases in our insurance related costs could significantly affect our business 
the costs of many types of insurance and self insurance  especially workers compensation  employee health care and others  have been increasing in recent years due to rising health care costs  legislative changes  economic conditions  terrorism and heightened scrutiny of insurance brokers and insurance providers 
our pharmacy departments are also exposed to risks inherent in the packaging and distribution of pharmaceuticals and other healthcare products  including with respect to improper filling of prescriptions  labeling of prescriptions and adequacy of warnings  and are significantly dependent upon suppliers to provide safe  government approved and non counterfeit products 
we also sell a variety of products that we purchase from a large number of suppliers  including some who operate in foreign countries  which could become subject to contamination  product tampering  mislabeling or other damage 
while we maintain reasonable quality assurance practices  no program can provide complete assurance that a product liability issue will not arise 
should a product liability issue arise  the coverage limits under our insurance programs may not be adequate to protect us against future claims 
in addition  we may not be able to maintain this insurance on acceptable terms in the future 
damage to our reputation in the event of a product liability issue could have an adverse affect on our business 
if our insurance related costs increase significantly  or we are unable to renew our insurance policies or protect against all the business risks facing us  our financial position and results of operations could be adversely affected 
adverse impacts associated with the current economic and financial crisis could affect our business 
the current economic and financial crisis could have an adverse impact of our business and profitability 
many consumers have fallen prey to the current crisis either as a result of job losses  foreclosures  or their inability to obtain short term financing  all of which could negatively affect their ability to shop in our stores and buy our products 
additionally  decreased consumer demand resulting from a pronounced negative consumer sentiment and an increasing personal savings rate could also negatively affect our sales and profits 
also  our ability to obtain financing  should the need arise outside of our current contractual credit facility  could be at risk due to the ongoing liquidity crisis in the united states financial system

executive summary during  the company continued with the execution of its previously announced strategic plan to improve profitability and operating margin 
management believes that the plan  which included the closing of underperforming stores and underperforming pharmacies  coupled with slowing growth in  will have a continued positive impact on the company s cash flow and operating margin in and beyond 
during  we closed a total of stores and pharmacies and have opened stores and pharmacies 
the one remaining going out of business sale and the resulting store closure will be substantially completed in the first half of our new store and pharmacy openings during the year were primarily in mississippi  alabama  georgia and south carolina 
we did not enter into any new states during the year 
another key area of concentration during the year was our initiative to improve service level and in stock positions 
our we got it program focuses on our highest demand consumable items items 
these are items that we have promised  through our we got it campaign  to always have on our shelves and available for our customers 
we continued in to implement supply chain and distribution procedures to ensure that our we got it pledge is fulfilled 
in the second quarter of  we introduced to our customers a new pricing strategy and marketing campaign entitled price alert 
this campaign focuses the customer s attention on particular items in our stores that are value priced and attractive to any budget  especially during current economic conditions 
this marketing campaign is chain wide and is delivered to the customer via print and media advertising in addition to specifically designed in store signage 
we will continue to use the price alert campaign to deliver value priced products to our customers 
our battleship store program  which was developed late in and became fully operational in the first quarter of  is intended to sharpen focus on our upper tier of profit producing stores 
this program is designed to reward our customers with additional benefits such as expanded selections of products  one time or one of a kind type items  or special events such as treasure hunts or outdoor activities 
customer and employee appreciation are key tenets of the battleship store program 
as this program is in its infancy  we continued in the third and fourth quarters to refine our understanding of our customers needs in our battleship stores markets 
we also continued to hone our delivery and execution of this strategy so that our battleship stores will help drive increased operating profit in line with the company s overall profit improvement strategies 
also during  we continued to focus on building our private label line of products which should build and solidify customer loyalty while simultaneously increasing gross margin 
we are currently developing additional private label brand names that we believe the customer will find appealing and will become synonymous with fred s promise to deliver quality products at low prices 
as a result of our focus in this area  we continue to increase our market penetration in our private label products 
we continued in with capital improvements in infrastructure  including existing store expansions and remodels  distribution center upgrades and further development of our information technology capabilities 
technology upgrades are being made in the areas of direct store delivery systems  stores point of sale systems  and pharmacy systems 
during  the company will continue to execute its strategic plan to improve profitability and operating margin 
particular emphasis will be placed on improving the customers shopping experience by improving the store format and layout 
we will also be focusing on our real estate strategy in order to choose the best locations for our customers 
these initiatives  in conjunction with our traffic driving strategies and our planned inventory productivity improvements  will help improve profitability and operating margin 
our private label or own brand products will continue to be a focus in and beyond 
by increasing market presentation of our own brand products  we will build customer loyalty and subsequent traffic and simultaneously increase gross margin 
our own brand products cross multiple product lines and include household cleaning supplies  health and beauty aids  disposable diapers  pet foods  paper products and a variety of beverage and other products 

table of contents we will continue in with technology upgrades in our direct store delivery systems nex dex  stores point of sale systems  pharmacy systems  as well as capital investments in infrastructure  distribution center upgrades and stores  including new stores and remodels 
key factors that will be critical to the company s future success include managing the strategy for opening new stores and pharmacies  including the ability to open and operate efficiently  maintaining high standards of customer service  maximizing efficiencies in the supply chain  controlling working capital needs through improved inventory turnover  controlling the effects of inflation  especially in regard to occupancy costs  controlling product mix  increasing operating margin through improved gross margin and leveraging operating costs  and generating adequate cash flow to fund the company s future needs 
additionally  managing the store closing process effectively and efficiently will be a key factor in delivering projected benefits in and beyond 
other factors that will affect company performance in include the continuing management of the impacts of the changing regulatory environment in which our pharmacy department operates  especially the anticipated implementation of the federally approved change in pricing of generic pharmaceuticals to average manufacturer s price amp  which could negatively affect gross margin 
we also believe that the economic and financial crisis has had and will continue to have an impact on the disposable income of our customers 
however  we believe falling fuel prices late in have been the one economic bright spot and have  to some extent  eased the enormous economic pressures being felt by consumers 
we also believe that we have experienced some down shopping in due to economic pressures being felt by consumers that might not normally shop in our stores  and expect this trend to continue into our business is subject to seasonal influences  but has tended to experience less seasonal fluctuation than many other retailers due to the mix of everyday basic merchandise and pharmacy business 
our fiscal fourth quarter is typically the most profitable quarter because it includes the christmas selling season 
the overall strength of the fourth quarter is partially mitigated  however  by the inclusion of the month of january  which is generally the least profitable month of the year 
critical accounting policies the preparation of fred s financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments in the reporting of assets  liabilities  revenues  expenses and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities 
our estimates are based on historical experience and on other assumptions that we believe are applicable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
while we believe that the historical experience and other factors considered provide a meaningful basis for the accounting policies applied in the consolidated financial statements  the company cannot guarantee that the estimates and assumptions will be accurate under different conditions and or assumptions 
a summary of our critical accounting policies and related estimates and judgments can be found in note to the consolidated financial statements 
our most critical accounting policies are as follows revenue recognition 
the company markets goods and services through company owned stores and franchised stores as of january  net sales include sales of merchandise from company owned stores  net of returns and exclusive of sales taxes 
sales to franchised stores are recorded when the merchandise is shipped from the company s warehouse 
revenues resulting from layaway sales are recorded upon delivery of the merchandise to the customer 
the company also sells gift cards for which the revenue is recognized at time of redemption 
the company records a gift card liability on the date the gift card is issued to the customer 
revenue is recognized and the gift card liability is reduced as the customer redeems the gift card 
the company will recognize aged liabilities as revenue when the likelihood of the gift card being redeemed is remote gift card breakage 
the company has not recognized any revenue from gift card breakage since the inception of the program in may and does not expect to record any gift card breakage revenue until there is more certainty regarding our ability to retain such amounts in light of current consumer protection and state escheatment laws 
in addition  the company charges the franchised stores a fee based on a percentage of their purchases from the company 
these fees represent a reimbursement for use of the fred s name and other administrative costs incurred on behalf of the franchised stores and are therefore netted against selling  general and administrative expenses 
total franchise income for   and was   and  respectively 
inventories 
merchandise inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market using the retail first in  first out fifo method for goods in our stores and the cost first in  first out fifo method for goods in our distribution centers 
the retail inventory method is a reverse mark up  averaging method which has been widely used in the retail industry for many years 
this method calculates a cost to retail ratio that is applied to the retail value of inventory to determine the cost value of inventory and the resulting cost of goods sold and gross margin 
the assumption that the retail inventory method provides for valuation at lower of cost or market and the inherent uncertainties therein are discussed in the following paragraphs 

table of contents in order to assure valuation at the lower of cost or market  the retail value of our inventory is adjusted on a consistent basis to reflect current market conditions 
these adjustments include increases to the retail value of inventory for initial markups to set the selling price of goods or additional markups to adjust pricing for inflation and decreases to the retail value of inventory for markdowns associated with promotional  seasonal or other declines in the market value 
because these adjustments are made on a consistent basis and are based on current prevailing market conditions  they approximate the carrying value of the inventory at net realizable value market value 
therefore  after applying the cost to retail ratio  the cost value of our inventory is stated at the lower of cost or market as is prescribed by generally accepted accounting principles in the us gaap 
because the approximation of net realizable value market value under the retail inventory method is based on estimates such as markups  markdowns and inventory losses shrink  there exists an inherent uncertainty in the final determination of inventory cost and gross margin 
in order to mitigate that uncertainty  the company has a formal review by product class which considers such variables as current market trends  seasonality  weather patterns and age of merchandise to ensure that markdowns are taken currently  or a markdown reserve is established to cover future anticipated markdowns 
this review also considers current pricing trends and inflation to ensure that markups are taken if necessary 
the estimation of inventory losses shrink is a significant element in approximating the carrying value of inventory at net realizable value  and as such the following paragraph describes our estimation method as well as the steps we take to mitigate the risk of this estimate in the determination of the cost value of inventory 
the company calculates inventory losses shrink based on actual inventory losses occurring as a result of physical inventory counts during each fiscal period and estimated inventory losses occurring between yearly physical inventory counts 
the estimate for shrink occurring in the interim period between physical counts is calculated on a store specific basis and is based on history  as well as performance on the most recent physical count 
it is calculated by multiplying each store s shrink rate  which is based on the previously mentioned factors  by the interim period s sales for each store 
additionally  the overall estimate for shrink is adjusted at the corporate level to a three year historical average to ensure that the overall shrink estimate is the most accurate approximation of shrink based on the company s overall history of shrink 
the three year historical estimate is calculated by dividing the book to physical inventory adjustments for the trailing months by the related sales for the same period 
in order to reduce the uncertainty inherent in the shrink calculation  the company first performs the calculation at the lowest practical level by store using the most current performance indicators 
this ensures a more reliable number  as opposed to using a higher level aggregation or percentage method 
the second portion of the calculation ensures that the extreme negative or positive performance of any particular store or group of stores does not skew the overall estimation of shrink 
this portion of the calculation removes additional uncertainty by eliminating short term peaks and valleys that could otherwise cause the underlying carrying cost of inventory to fluctuate unnecessarily 
the company has not experienced any significant change in shrink as a percentage of sales from year to year during the subject reporting periods 
management believes that the company s retail inventory method provides an inventory valuation which reasonably approximates cost and results in carrying inventory at the lower of cost or market 
for pharmacy inventories  which were approximately million  and million at january  and february   respectively  cost was determined using the retail lifo last in  first out method in which inventory cost is maintained using the retail inventory method  then adjusted by application of the producer price index published by the us department of labor for the cumulative annual periods 
the current cost of inventories exceeded the lifo cost by approximately million at january  and million at february  the lifo reserve increased by approximately million and million during and  respectively 
the company has historically included an estimate of inbound freight and certain general and administrative costs in merchandise inventory as prescribed by gaap 
these costs include activities surrounding the procurement and storage of merchandise inventory such as buying  warehousing  and accounting  as well as inbound freight 
during the second quarter of fy  we revised our estimate to include certain costs internally captured within our merchandise planning  information technology and human resources departments as they relate to the inventory functions and support of procurement and storage 
this revision follows growth in the role of these departments in support of the procurement and warehousing functions  including additional personnel hired over the previous few quarters 
further  our merchandise planning department has evolved from being previously included within the buying function to a stand alone function with responsibility for inbound logistics and commodity procurement 
the total amount of procurement and storage costs and inbound freight included in merchandise inventory at january  is million  with the corresponding amount of million at february  impairment 
the company s policy is to review the carrying value of all long lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable 
in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas  accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  we review for impairment all stores opened at least years or remodeled more than years 
impairment results when the carrying value of the assets exceeds the undiscounted future cash flows over the life of the lease or years for owned stores 
our estimate of undiscounted future cash flows over the lease term is based upon historical operations of the stores and estimates of future store profitability which encompasses many factors that are subject to management s judgment and are difficult to predict 
if a long lived asset is found to be impaired  the amount recognized for impairment is equal to the difference between the carrying value and the asset s fair value 
the 
table of contents fair value is based on estimated market values for similar assets or other reasonable estimates of fair market value based upon management s judgment 
exit and disposal activities 
during fiscal  the company closed underperforming stores 
during the course of  the company has closed stores and pharmacies 
the closures took place during the first three quarters of pursuant to our restructuring plan announced february  and were the result of an in depth study conducted by the company of its operations over the last quarters 
the study revealed that fred s has a strong and healthy store base  and that by closing these underperforming stores the company would improve its cash flow and operating margin  both of which are core goals of the company s overall strategic plan 
as a result of the successful execution of this plan  the company is stronger and is in a better position to respond to fluctuations in the economy and to take advantage of opportunities to further improve our business 
the one remaining store closure is scheduled for the first half of fiscal  bringing the total number of store closures to inventory impairment during fiscal  which ended february   we recorded a below cost inventory adjustment of approximately million to reduce the value of inventory to lower of cost or market in the stores that were planned for closure in fiscal  of which were closed 
the entire impairment was utilized in fiscal during fiscal  which ended february   we recorded a below cost inventory adjustment of approximately million to reduce the value of inventory to lower of cost or market in stores that were planned for closure as part of the company s strategic plan to improve profitability and operating margin 
the adjustment was recorded in cost of goods sold in the consolidated statement of income for the year ended february  in fiscal  we recorded an additional below cost inventory adjustment of million to reduce the value of inventory to lower of cost or market associated with stores closed in the third quarter and utilized the entire million impairment 
lease termination for store closures where a lease obligation still exists  we record the estimated future liability associated with the rental obligation on the cease use date when the store is closed in accordance with sfas  accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities 
liabilities are established at the cease use date for the present value of any remaining operating lease obligations  net of estimated sublease income  and at the communication date for severance and other exit costs  as prescribed by sfas key assumptions in calculating the liability include the timeframe expected to terminate lease agreements  estimates related to the sublease potential of closed locations  and estimation of other related exit costs 
if actual timing and potential termination costs or realization of sublease income differ from our estimates  the resulting liabilities could vary from recorded amounts 
these liabilities are reviewed periodically and adjusted when necessary 
during fiscal  which ended february   we closed under performing stores and recorded lease contract termination costs of million in rent expense in conjunction with those closings  of which million was utilized during fiscal  leaving 
million in the reserve at the beginning of fiscal year during fiscal  which ended january   we closed under performing stores and recorded lease contract termination costs of million  of which million was charged to rent expense and 
million reduced the liability for deferred rent 
we utilized million during the period  leaving million in the reserve at january  during the first half of fiscal  the company expects to incur 
million in lease contract termination costs related to the remaining store closure

there were no other fixed asset impairment charges incurred during property and equipment and intangibles 
property and equipment are carried at cost 
depreciation is calculated using the straight line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets and recorded in selling  general and administrative expenses 
improvements to leased premises are depreciated using the straight line method over the shorter of the initial term of the lease or the useful life of the improvement 
leasehold improvements added late in the lease term are depreciated over the shorter of the remaining term of the lease including the upcoming renewal option  if the renewal is reasonably assured or the useful life of the improvement  whichever is lesser 
gains or losses on the sale of assets are recorded at disposal as a component of operating income 
the following average estimated useful lives are generally applied estimated useful lives building and building improvements years furniture  fixtures and equipment years leasehold improvements years or term of lease  if shorter automobiles and vehicles years airplane years assets under capital lease are depreciated in accordance with the company s normal depreciation policy for owned assets or over the lease term regardless of renewal options  if shorter  and the charge to earnings is included in depreciation expense in the consolidated financial statements 
other identifiable intangible assets  which are included in other noncurrent assets  primarily represent customer lists associated with acquired pharmacies and are being amortized on a straight line basis over five years 
vendor rebates and allowances 
the company receives rebates for a variety of merchandising activities  such as volume commitment rebates  relief for temporary and permanent price reductions  cooperative advertising programs  and for the introduction of new products in our stores 
in accordance with the emerging issues task force issue no 
 accounting by a customer including a reseller for certain consideration received from a vendor eitf  rebates received from a vendor are recorded as a reduction of cost of sales when the product is sold or a reduction to selling  general and administrative expenses if the reimbursement represents a specific incremental and identifiable cost 
should the allowance received exceed the incremental cost  then the excess is recorded as a reduction of cost of sales when the product is sold 
any excess amounts for the periods reported are immaterial 
any rebates received subsequent to merchandise being sold are recorded as a reduction to cost of goods sold when received 
as of january   the company had approximately  vendors who participate in vendor rebate programs and the terms of the agreements with those vendors vary in length from short term arrangements to be completed within a month to longer term arrangements that could last up to three years

insurance reserves 
the company is largely self insured for workers compensation  general liability and employee medical insurance 
the company s liability for self insurance is determined based on claims known at the time of determination of the reserve and estimates for future payments against incurred losses and claims that have been incurred but not reported 
estimates for future claims costs include uncertainty because of the variability of the factors involved  such as the type of injury or claim  required services by the providers  healing time  age of claimant  case management costs  location of the claimant  and governmental regulations 
these uncertainties or a deviation in future claims trends from recent historical patterns could result in the company recording additional expenses or expense reductions that might be material to the company s results of operations 
the company carries additional coverage for excessive or catastrophic claims with stop loss limits of  for property and general liability and  for employee medical 
the company s insurance reserve was million and million on january  and february   respectively 
changes in the reserve over that time period were attributable to additional reserve requirements of million netted with reserve utilization of million 
income taxes 
the company reports income taxes in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
under sfas no 
 the asset and liability method is used for computing future income tax consequences of events  which have been recognized in the company s consolidated financial statements or income tax returns 
deferred income tax expense or benefit is the net change during the year in the company s deferred income tax assets and liabilities see note income taxes 
in june  the financial accounting standards board issued fasb interpretation no 
fin  accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
we adopted fin as of february   the first day of fiscal this interpretation clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprise s financial statements in accordance with sfas no 
and prescribes a minimum recognition threshold of more likely than not to be sustained upon examination that a tax position must meet before being recognized in the financial statements 
under fin  the impact of an uncertain income tax position on the income tax return must be recognized at the largest amount that is more likely than not to be sustained upon audit by the relevant taxing authority 
an uncertain income tax position will not be recognized if it has less than a likelihood of being sustained 
additionally  fin provides guidance on de recognition  measurement  classification  interest and penalties  accounting in interim periods  disclosure and transition see note income taxes 
fin further requires that interest and penalties required to be paid by the tax law on the underpayment of taxes should be accrued on the difference between the amount claimed or expected to be claimed on the tax return and the tax benefit recognized in the financial statements 
the company includes potential interest and penalties recognized in accordance with fin in the financial statements as a component of income tax expense 
as of january   accrued interest and penalties related to our unrecognized tax benefits totaled million and million  respectively  and are both recorded in the consolidated balance sheet within other non current liabilities 
stock based compensation 
effective january   the company adopted the fair value recognition provisions of sfas no

under this method  compensation expense recognized post adoption includes compensation expense for all share based payments granted prior to  but not yet vested as of  january   based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the original provisions of sfas no 
 and compensation cost for all share based payments granted subsequent to january   based on the grant date fair value estimated in accordance with the provisions of sfas no

results for prior periods have not been restated 
in november  fasb issued staff position no 
fas r  transition election related to accounting for tax effects of share based payment awards fsp fas r 
effective january   the company elected to adopt the alternative transition method provided in fsp fas r for calculating the income tax effects of stock based compensation pursuant to sfas r 
the alternative transition method includes simplified methods to establish the beginning balance of the additional paid in capital pool apic pool related to the income tax effects of stock based compensation  and for determining the subsequent impact on the apic pool and consolidated statements of cash flows of the income tax effects of stock based compensation awards that are outstanding upon adoption of sfas r 
sfas r also requires the benefits of income tax deductions in excess of recognized compensation cost to be reported as a financing cash flow  rather than as an operating cash flow as required prior to sfas r 
the impact of adopting sfas r on future results will depend on  among other things  levels of share based payments granted in the future  actual forfeiture rates and the timing of option exercises 

table of contents stock based compensation expense  post adoption of sfas r  is based on awards ultimately expected to vest  and therefore has been reduced for estimated forfeitures 
forfeitures are estimated at the time of grant based on the company s historical forfeiture experience and will be revised in subsequent periods if actual forfeitures differ from those estimates 
equity incentive plans

results include certain charges for the closing of stores in and the stores closed in see item  exit and disposal activities section 
comparable sales 
our policy regarding the calculation of comparable store sales represents the increase or decrease in net sales for stores that have been opened after the end of the th month following the store s grand opening month  including stores that have been remodeled or relocated during the reporting period 
the majority of our remodels and relocations do not include expansion 
the purpose of the remodel or the relocation is to change the store s layout  refresh the store with new fixtures  interiors or signage or to locate the store in a more desirable area 
this type of change to the store does not necessarily change the product mix or product departments  therefore  on a comparable store sales basis  the store is the same before and after the remodel or relocation 
in relation to remodels and relocations  expansions have been much more infrequent and consequently  any increase in the selling square footage is immaterial to the overall calculation of comparable store sales 
additionally  we do not exclude newly added hardline  softline or pharmacy departments from our comparable store sales calculation because we believe that all departments within a fred s store create a synergy supporting our overall goals for managing the store  servicing our customer and promoting traffic and sales growth 
therefore  the introduction of all new departments is included in same store sales in the year in which the department is introduced 
likewise  our same store sales calculation is not adjusted for the removal of a department from a location 
fiscal compared to fiscal sales net sales increased million in approximately million of the increase was attributable to a net addition of new stores  and a net addition of pharmacies during  together with the sales of store locations and pharmacies that were opened or upgraded during and contributed a full year of sales in comparable store sales  consisting of sales from stores that have been open for more than one year  increased in  which accounted for million in sales
