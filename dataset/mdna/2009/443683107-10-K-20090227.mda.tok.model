item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
this discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with hudson city bancorp s consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements in item  and the other statistical data provided elsewhere in this document 
executive summary we continue to focus on our traditional thrift business model by growing our franchise through the origination and purchase of one to four family mortgage loans and funding this loan production with borrowings and growth in deposit accounts 
our results of operations depend primarily on net interest income  which  in part  is a direct result of the market interest rate environment 
net interest income is the difference between the interest income we earn on our interest earning assets  primarily mortgage loans  mortgage backed securities and investment securities  and the interest we pay on our interest bearing liabilities  primarily time deposits  interest bearing transaction accounts and borrowed funds 
net interest income is affected by the shape of the market yield curve  the timing of the placement and repricing of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities on our balance sheet  the prepayment rate on our mortgage related assets and the calls of our borrowings 
our results of operations may also be affected significantly by general and local economic and competitive conditions  particularly those with respect to changes in market interest rates  credit quality  government policies and actions of regulatory authorities 
our results are also affected by the market price of our stock  as the expense of our employee stock ownership plan is related to the current price of our common stock 
during  the national economy continued to falter with particular emphasis on the deterioration of the housing and real estate markets 
during  it became widely accepted that the united states economy had entered a recession by the first quarter of the faltering economy has been marked by contractions in the availability of business and consumer credit  increases in borrowing rates  falling home prices and increasing levels of home foreclosures and unemployment 
in response  the fomc decreased the overnight lending rate by to basis points during to a target rate of to 
this unprecedented decrease in the overnight lending rate was in response to the continued liquidity crisis in the credit markets as well as an attempt to stimulate the housing markets and the overall economy 
as a result  short term market interest rates decreased during the sharp decline in short term interest rates during lowered our deposit and borrowing costs 
longer term market interest rates also decreased during  but at a slower pace than short term interest rates and  as a result  the yield curve continued to steepen 
notwithstanding the decrease in long term market interest rates noted above  mortgage rates maintained a wider credit spread relative to us treasury securities resulting in higher yields on our mortgage loans 
as a result  our net interest rate spread and net interest margin increased as compared to both the fourth quarter and full year recent actions by the federal reserve to purchase securities issued by fannie mae and freddie mac have resulted in a decrease in mortgage rates late in the fourth quarter of and continuing into january the disruption and volatility in the financial and capital markets over the past year has recently reached a crisis level as national and global credit markets ceased to function effectively 
financial entities across the spectrum have been affected by the lack of liquidity and continued credit deterioration 
the difficulties in the financial services market have been marked by the failure  near failure or sale at depressed valuations of some of the nation s largest institutions such as bear stearns  lehman brothers  merrill lynch and wachovia 
concern for the stability of the banking and financial systems reached a magnitude which has resulted in unprecedented government intervention on a global scale 
at a domestic level  on page 
table of contents october   the eesa was signed into law providing for  among other things  billion in funding to the us treasury to purchase troubled assets from financial institutions 
then  on october   the treasury  the frb  and the fdic issued a joint statement announcing additional steps aimed at stabilizing the financial markets 
first  the treasury announced the cpp which allows qualifying financial institutions to sell preferred shares to the treasury 
second  the fdic announced the tlgp  enabling the fdic to temporarily guarantee the senior debt of all fdic insured institutions and certain holding companies  as well as fully insure all deposits in non interest bearing transaction accounts 
third  to further increase access to funding for businesses in all sectors of the economy  the frb announced further details of the cpff  which provides a broad backstop for the commercial paper market 
these actions were intended to restore confidence in the banking system  ease liquidity concerns and stabilize the rapidly deteriorating economy 
eligible institutions were covered under the tlgp at no cost for the first days 
institutions that did not want to continue to participate in one or both parts of the tlgp had to notify the fdic of their election to opt out on or before december  institutions that did not opt out will be subject to a fee of to basis points per annum based on the length of maturity of senior unsecured debt issued and a basis point surcharge will be added to the institution s current insurance assessment for balances in non interest bearing transaction accounts that exceed the existing deposit insurance limit of  we participated in the tlgp to fully insure all non interest bearing transaction accounts 
we did not participate in any of the other tlgp programs 
congress has held hearings on implementation of the cpp and the use of funds and may adopt further legislation impacting financial institutions that obtain funding under the cpp or changing lending practices that legislators believe led to the current economic situation 
on january   the us house of representatives approved legislation amending the tarp provisions of eesa to include quarterly reporting requirements with respect to lending activities  examinations by an institution s primary federal regulator of use of funds and compliance with program requirements  restrictions on acquisitions by depository institutions receiving tarp funds  authorization for us treasury to have an observer at board meetings of recipient institutions  and stricter executive compensation limitations  among other things 
although it is unclear whether this legislation will be enacted into law  its provisions  or similar ones  may be imposed administratively by the us treasury 
such provisions could affect our lending or increase governmental oversight of our businesses and our corporate governance practices 
on february   treasury secretary timothy geithner in a statement to the senate banking committee hearing outlined a financial stability plan to restore stability to the us financial system 
in the address  secretary geithner discussed the obama administration s strategy to strengthen the us economy by getting credit flowing again to families and businesses  while imposing new measures and conditions to strengthen accountability  oversight and transparency in how taxpayer dollars are spent 
the financial stability plan includes i the creation of a public private partnership to purchase non performing  illiquid legacy assets from financial institutions  ii the creation of a forward looking supervisory regime  including a financial stress test to assist institutions in managing their balance sheets and ensuring adequate capitalization  iii the creation of a comprehensive housing program to forestall foreclosures and stabilize the residential mortgage market  iv the expansion of the term asset backed securities lending facility  and v the creation of a small business and community lending initiative 
however  many of the details of the financial stability plan still have to be developed 
on february   the ots urged ots regulated institutions to suspend foreclosures on owner occupied homes until the financial stability plan s home loan modification program is finalized in the next few weeks 
on january   the house judiciary committee approved the bankruptcy legislation 
the bankruptcy legislation would grant a judge the ability to modify the terms of a mortgage for a homeowner in chapter bankruptcy 
under the proposed bankruptcy legislation  borrowers would be eligible to have a bankruptcy judge reduce the principal balance on their home loan 
if any such borrower resells their home within five years  the borrower will have to share the proceeds with their lender

net income amounted to million for  as compared to million for for the year ended december   our return on average assets and average stockholders equity were and  respectively  as compared to and for the increases in our return on average equity and average assets are due primarily to the increase in our net income during as compared to net interest income increased million  or  to million for the as compared to million for during  our net interest rate spread increased basis points to and our net interest margin increased basis points to as compared to the increases in our net interest rate spread and net interest margin were due to a steeper yield curve which allowed us to reduce deposit costs while mortgage yields remained stable 
the provision for loan losses amounted to million for as compared to million for the increase in the provision for loan losses reflects the risks inherent in our loan portfolio due to decreases in real estate values in our lending markets  the increase in non performing loans  the increase in loan charge offs  increasing unemployment rates  the current economic conditions and the overall growth of our loan portfolio 
non performing loans were million or of total loans at december  as compared to million or of total loans at december  the increase in non performing loans reflects the economic recession coupled with the continued deterioration of the housing market 
the conditions in the housing market are evidenced by declining house prices  reduced levels of home sales  increasing inventories of houses on the market  and an increase in the length of time houses remain on the market 
total non interest expense increased million  or  to million for from million for the increase is primarily due to a million increase in compensation and employee benefits expense and a million increase in other non interest expense 
the increases in non interest expenses were due primarily to various operating expenses related to the growth of our branch network and our increased retail loan production 
at december  we had branches as compared to at december  we have been able to grow our assets by to billion at december  from billion at december   by originating and purchasing mortgage loans and purchasing mortgage backed securities 
loans increased billion to billion at december  from billion at december  while the residential real estate markets have weakened considerably during the past year  our competitive rates and the decreased lending competition have resulted in increased origination activity 
total securities increased billion to billion at december  from billion at december  the increase in securities was primarily due to purchases of mortgage backed and investment securities of billion and billion  respectively  partially offset by principal collections on mortgage backed securities of billion and calls of investment securities of billion 
the increase in our total assets was funded primarily by an increase in borrowings and customer deposits 
borrowed funds increased billion to billion at december  from billion at december  deposits increased billion to billion at december  from page 
table of contents billion at december  the additional borrowed funds were used primarily to fund our asset growth 
the increase in deposits was attributable to growth in our time deposits and money market accounts 
the increase in these accounts was a result of our competitive pricing strategies that focused on attracting these types of deposits as well as customer preferences for time deposits rather than other types of deposit accounts 
in addition  we believe the turmoil in the credit and equity markets has made deposit products in strong financial institutions desirable for many customers 
comparison of financial condition at december  and december  during  our total assets increased billion  or  to billion at december  from billion at december  loans increased billion  or  to billion at december  from billion at december  due primarily to the origination of one to four family first mortgage loans in new jersey  new york and connecticut and our continued loan purchase activity 
for  we originated billion and purchased billion of loans  compared to originations of billion and purchases of billion for the origination and purchases of loans were partially offset by principal repayments of billion in as compared to billion for while the residential real estate markets have deteriorated during the past year  our competitive rates and the decreased mortgage lending competition have resulted in increased retail origination activity for the overall decrease in the purchase of mortgage loans was due primarily to the continued reduction of activity in the secondary residential mortgage market as a result of the disruption and volatility in the financial and capital marketplaces 
our first mortgage loan originations and purchases during were substantially all in one to four family mortgage loans 
approximately of mortgage loan originations for were variable rate loans as compared to approximately for substantially all purchased mortgage loans during the year ended december  were fixed rate loans since variable rate loans available for purchase are typically outside of our defined geographic parameters and include features  such as option arm s  that do not meet our underwriting standards 
fixed rate mortgage loans accounted for of our first mortgage loan portfolio at december  and at december  total mortgage backed securities increased billion to billion at december  from billion at december  this increase in total mortgage backed securities resulted from the purchase of billion of mortgage backed securities  all of which were issued by us government sponsored enterprises 
the increase was partially offset by repayments of billion 
at december   variable rate mortgage backed securities accounted for of our portfolio compared with at december  the purchase of variable rate mortgage backed securities is a component of our interest rate risk management strategy 
since a substantial portion of our loan production consists of fixed rate mortgage loans  the purchase of variable rate mortgage backed securities provides us with an asset that reduces our exposure to interest rate fluctuations 
total investment securities decreased million to billion at december  as compared to billion at december  investment securities held to maturity decreased billion partially offset by a million increase in investment securities available for sale 
the decrease in total investment securities was the result of calls of held to maturity and available for sale investment securities of billion and billion  respectively 
the calls were partially offset by purchases of investment securities available for sale of billion for page 
table of contents total cash and cash equivalents increased million to million at december  as compared to million at december  accrued interest receivable increased million  primarily due to increased balances in loans and investments 
total liabilities increased billion  or  to billion at december  from billion at december  the increase in total liabilities primarily reflected a billion increase in borrowed funds and a billion increase in deposits 
total deposits amounted to billion at december  as compared to billion at december  the increase in total deposits reflected a billion increase in our time deposits and a billion increase in our money market checking accounts 
the increase in our time deposits and money market checking accounts reflects our competitive pricing  our branch expansion and customer preference for these types of deposits 
at december  we had branches as compared to at december  in addition  we believe that the turmoil in the credit and equity markets has made deposit products in strong financial institutions desirable for many customers 
borrowings amounted to billion at december  as compared to billion at december  the increase in borrowed funds was the result of billion of new borrowings at a weighted average rate of  partially offset by repayments of million with a weighted average rate of 
the new borrowings primarily have final maturities of ten years and initial reprice dates of one to three years 
in addition  we also borrowed million with maturities of less than one year 
the additional borrowed funds were used primarily to fund our asset growth 
borrowed funds at december  were comprised of billion of fhlb advances and billion of securities sold under agreements to repurchase 
substantially all of our borrowed funds are callable at the discretion of the issuer after an initial non call period 
as a result  if interest rates were to decrease  these borrowings would probably not be called and our average cost of existing borrowings would not decrease even as market interest rates decrease 
conversely  if interest rates increase above the market interest rate for similar borrowings  these borrowings would likely be called at their next call date and our cost to replace these borrowings would increase 
these call features are generally quarterly  after an initial non call period of three months to five years from the date of borrowing 
our callable borrowings typically have a final maturity of ten years and may not be called for an initial period of one to five years 
we use this type of borrowing primarily to fund our loan growth because they have a longer duration than shorter term non callable borrowings and have a slightly lower cost than a non callable borrowing with a maturity date similar to the first call date of the callable borrowing 
during the current period of credit instability we may not be able to borrow in this manner 
we believe that we will continue to be able to borrow from the same institutions as in the past  but structured callable borrowings may not be available 
in order to fund our growth and provide for our liquidity we may need to borrow short term  that is  borrowings with three to six month maturities 
these borrowings are typically at lower interest rates than longer term callable borrowings and  as a result  may decrease our borrowing costs 
however  using short term borrowings may increase our interest rate risk  especially if market interest rates were to increase 
while we will utilize these short term borrowings while the current conditions exist in the credit markets  we intend to use structured callable borrowings when these types of borrowings become available 
the company has two collateralized borrowings in the form of repurchase agreements totaling million with lehman brothers  inc lehman brothers  inc is currently in liquidation under the securities industry protection act 
mortgage backed securities with an amortized cost of approximately page 
table of contents million are pledged as collateral for these borrowings 
we intend to pursue full recovery of the pledged collateral in accordance with the contractual terms of the repurchase agreements 
if full recovery of the collateral does not occur  we will be pursuing a customer claim against the lehman brothers  inc estate for the million difference between the amortized cost of the securities and the amount of the underlying borrowings 
there can be no assurances that the final settlement of this transaction will result in the full recovery of the collateral or the full amount of the claim 
we have not recognized a loss in our financial statements related to these repurchase agreements 
due to brokers amounted to million at december  as compared to million at december  due to brokers at december  represents securities purchased in the fourth quarter of with settlement dates in the first quarter of other liabilities increased to million at december  as compared to million at december  the increase is primarily the result of an increase in accrued expenses of million and accrued interest payable on borrowings of million 
these increases were partially offset by a decrease in accrued taxes of million 
the increase in accrued expenses is due primarily to a million increase in accrued pension liabilities that resulted from a decrease in the plan s funded status primarily as a result of a decrease in the market value of the plan s assets 
total shareholders equity increased million to billion at december  from billion at december  the increase was primarily due to net income of million and a million increase in accumulated other comprehensive income  partially offset by cash dividends paid to common shareholders of million 
as of december    shares were available for repurchase under our existing stock repurchase programs 
during  we repurchased million shares of our outstanding common stock at a total cost of million as compared to million shares repurchased during at a total cost of million 
we repurchased fewer shares in because we were able to leverage our capital more effectively by growing our balance sheet as the yield curve became steeper 
the accumulated other comprehensive income of million at december  includes a million after tax net unrealized gain on securities available for sale million pre tax partially offset by a million after tax accumulated other comprehensive loss related to the funded status of our employee benefit plans 
we invest primarily in mortgage backed securities issued by ginnie mae  fannie mae and freddie mac  as well as other securities issued by us government sponsored enterprises 
we do not purchase unrated or private label mortgage backed securities or other higher risk securities such as those backed by sub prime loans 
in addition  we do not own any common or preferred stock issued by fannie mae or freddie mac 
there were no debt securities past due or securities for which the company currently believes it is not probable that it will collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the security 
at december   our stockholders equity to asset ratio was compared with at december  for  the ratio of average stockholders equity to average assets was compared with for the year the lower equity to assets ratios reflect our strategy to grow assets and pay dividends

table of contents average balance sheet 
the following table presents certain information regarding our financial condition and net interest income for   and the table presents the average yield on interest earning assets and the average cost of interest bearing liabilities for the periods indicated 
we derived the yields and costs by dividing income or expense by the average balance of interest earning assets or interest bearing liabilities  respectively  for the periods shown 
we derived average balances from daily balances over the periods indicated 
interest income includes fees that we considered adjustments to yields 
yields on tax exempt obligations were not computed on a tax equivalent basis 
non accrual loans were included in the computation of average balances and therefore have a zero yield

the increases in the average balances of mortgage backed securities were due to purchases of variable rate mortgage backed securities as part of our interest rate risk management strategy 
since a substantial portion of our loan production consists of fixed rate mortgage loans  the purchase of variable rate mortgage backed securities provides us with an asset that reduces our exposure to interest rate fluctuations while providing a source of cash flow from monthly principal and interest payments 
the increase in the weighted average yields for on mortgage backed securities is a result of the purchase of new securities during the second half of and the first half of when market interest rates were higher than the yield earned on the existing portfolio

we recorded our provision for loan losses during based on our allowance for loan losses methodology that considers a number of quantitative and qualitative factors  including the amount of non performing loans  which increased to million at december  as compared to million at december  the higher provision for loan losses during reflects the risks inherent in our loan portfolio due to weakening real estate markets  the increases in non performing loans and net charge offs and the overall growth in the loan portfolio 
see critical accounting policies allowance for loan losses 
due to the homogeneous nature of our loan portfolio  our evaluation of the adequacy of our allowance for loan losses is performed substantially on a pooled basis 
a component of our methodology includes assigning potential loss factors to the payment status of multiple residential loan categories with the objective of assessing the potential risk inherent in each loan type 
we also consider growth in the loan portfolio in our determination of the allowance for loan losses 
these factors are periodically reviewed for appropriateness giving consideration to charge off history  delinquency trends  the results of our foreclosed property transactions and market conditions 
we use this systematic methodology as a tool  together with qualitative analysis performed by our asset quality committee to estimate the allowance for loan losses 
other key factors we consider in this process are current real estate market conditions in geographic areas where our loans are located  changes in the trend of non performing loans  the current state of the local and national economy  changes in interest rates  the results of our foreclosed property transactions and loan portfolio growth 
any one or a combination of these events may adversely affect our loan portfolio resulting in increased delinquencies  loan losses and future levels of provisions 
our primary lending emphasis is the origination and purchase of one to four family first mortgage loans on residential properties and  to a lesser extent  second mortgage loans on one to four family residential properties 
our loan growth was primarily concentrated in one to four family mortgage loans with original loan to value ratios of less than 
the average loan to value ratio of our first mortgage loan originations and our total first mortgage loan portfolio was and  respectively using the appraised value at the time of origination 
the value of the property used as collateral for our loans is dependent upon local market conditions 
as part of our estimation of the allowance for loan losses  we monitor changes in the values of homes in each market using indices published by various organizations 
based on our analysis of the data for  we concluded that home values in the northeast quadrant of the united states  where most of our lending activity occurs  deteriorated during and as evidenced by reduced levels of sales  increasing inventories of houses on the market  declining house prices and an increase in the length of time houses remain on the market 
in addition  general economic conditions in the united states have also worsened and entered a recession by the first quarter of we considered these trends in economic and market conditions in determining the provision for loan losses also taking into account the continued growth of our loan portfolio 
we define the northeast quadrant of the country generally as those states that are east of the mississippi river and as far south as south carolina 
at december   approximately of our total loans are in the new york metropolitan area 
additionally  the states of virginia  illinois  maryland  massachusetts  minnesota  michigan and pennsylvania accounted for      and  respectively of total loans 
the remaining of the loan portfolio is secured by real estate primarily in the remainder of the northeast quadrant of the united states

the remaining of our non performing loans are secured by real estate primarily in the remainder of the northeast quadrant of the united states 
during  the fallout from the sub prime mortgage market continued and the national economy entered a recession with particular emphasis on the deterioration of the housing and real estate markets 
the faltering economy has been marked by contractions in the availability of business and consumer credit  increases in corporate borrowing rates  falling home prices  increasing home foreclosures and unemployment 
as a result  the financial  capital and credit markets are experiencing significant adverse conditions 
these conditions have caused significant deterioration in the activity of the secondary residential mortgage market and a lack of available liquidity 
the disruptions have been exacerbated by the acceleration of the decline of the real estate and housing market 
we continue to closely monitor the local and national real estate markets and other factors related to risks inherent in our loan portfolio 
we determined the provision for loan losses for based on our evaluation of the foregoing factors  the growth of the loan portfolio  the recent increases in non performing loans and net loan charge offs and expected growth in non performing loans 
as always  we continue to adhere to prudent underwriting standards 
at december   first mortgage loans secured by one to four family properties accounted for of total loans 
fixed rate mortgage loans represent of our first mortgage loans 
compared to adjustable rate loans  fixed rate loans possess less inherent credit risk since loan payments do not change in response to changes in interest rates 
in addition  we do not originate or purchase loans with payment options  negative amortization loans or sub prime loans 
non performing loans amounted to million at december  as compared to million at december  non performing loans at december  included million of one to four family first mortgage loans as compared to million at december  the ratio of non performing loans to total loans was at december  compared with at december  the allowance for loan losses as a percent of total loans and non performing loans was and  respectively at december  as compared to and  respectively at december  loans delinquent to days amounted to million at december  as compared to million at december  foreclosed real estate amounted to million at december  as compared to million at december  as a result of our underwriting policies  our borrowers typically have a significant amount of equity  at the time of origination  in the underlying real estate that we use as collateral for our loans 
at december   our non performing mortgage loans had an average loan to value ratio of approximately based on the appraised value at the time of origination 
due to the steady deterioration of real estate values  the loan to value ratios based on appraisals obtained at time of origination do not necessarily indicate the extent to which we may incur a loss on any given loan that may go into foreclosure 
in january  our non performing loans increased by million to million 
net charge offs amounted to million for as compared to net charge offs of  for the increase in charge offs was primarily related to non performing residential loans for which current appraised values indicated declines in the value of the underlying collateral 
our charge offs on non performing loans have historically been low due to the amount of underlying equity in the properties collateralizing our first mortgage loans 
typically  as a non performing loan approaches foreclosure  the borrower will sell the underlying property or  if there is a subordinated lien eliminating the borrower s equity  the subordinated lien holder would purchase the property to protect its interest resulting in the full payment of principal and interest to hudson city savings 
in normal markets this process takes to months 
however  due to the unprecedented level of foreclosures and the desire by most states to slow the foreclosure process  we are now experiencing a time frame to repayment or foreclosure ranging from to page

as real estate prices continue to decline  this extended time may result in further charge offs 
in addition  current conditions in the housing market have made it more difficult for borrowers to sell homes to satisfy the mortgage and second lien holders are less likely to repay our loan if the value of the property is not enough to satisfy their loan 
we continue to monitor closely the property values underlying our non performing loans during this timeframe and take appropriate charge offs when the loan balances exceed the underlying property values 
at december  and  commercial and construction loans evaluated for impairment in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting by creditors for impairment of a loan amounted to million and million  respectively 
based on this evaluation  we established an allowance for loan losses of  for loans classified as impaired at december  compared to  at december  although we believe that we have established and maintained the allowance for loan losses at adequate levels  additions may be necessary if future economic and other conditions differ substantially from the current operating environment 
however  the markets in which we lend have experienced significant declines in real estate values which we have taken into account in evaluating our allowance for loan losses 
no assurance can be given in any particular case that our loan to value ratios will provide full protection in the event of borrower default 
although we use the best information available  the level of the allowance for loan losses remains an estimate that is subject to significant judgment and short term change

non interest income 
total non interest income was million for compared with million for the increase in non interest income is primarily due to an increase in service charges on deposits as a result of deposit account growth 
non interest expense 
total non interest expense increased million  or  for the year ended december  to million compared with million during the increase is primarily due to a million increase in compensation and employee benefits expense  a million increase in federal deposit insurance expense and a million increase in other non interest expense 
the increase in compensation and employee benefits expense included an million increase in expense related to our employee stock ownership plan primarily as a result of increases in our stock price  a million increase in compensation costs  due primarily to normal increases in salary and additional full time employees for our new branches  and a million increase in stock option plan expense 
the increase in the federal deposit insurance expense is the result of an assessment credit that was used to offset of our deposit insurance assessment of million 
during  we used the remaining assessment credit of million to offset a portion of our deposit insurance 
included in other non interest expense for the year ended december  were write downs on foreclosed real estate and net losses on the sale of foreclosed real estate  of million as compared to  for the fdic has adopted a final rule increasing risk based assessment rates uniformly by basis points annualized for the first quarter of the fdic has also proposed changes to take effect beginning in the second quarter of  resulting is an insurance assessment at million for the first quarter of under the proposed plan the initial base assessment rates will range from to basis points depending on an institution s risk category  with adjustments resulting in increased assessment rates for institutions with a significant reliance on secured liabilities and brokered deposits 
for hudson city savings bank  our total assessment rate would be basis points based on the proposed rule 
the increased deposit insurance premiums will result in a significant increase in our non interest expense

interest and dividend income 
total interest and dividend income increased million  or  to billion for as compared to billion for the increase in total interest and dividend income was primarily due to a billion  or  increase in the average balance of total interest earning assets to billion for as compared to billion for the increase in interest and dividend income was also partially due to an increase of basis points in the weighted average yield on total interest earning assets to for from for the comparable period in interest and fees on first mortgage loans increased million to billion for as compared to million for this increase was primarily due to a billion increase in the average balance of first mortgage loans to billion for as compared to billion for  which reflected our continued emphasis on the growth of our mortgage loan portfolio 
the increase in mortgage loan income was also due to a nine basis point increase in the weighted average yield to  reflecting the origination and purchase of mortgage loans during the period of slightly rising intermediate and long term market interest rates during the first half of interest income on consumer and other loans increased million to million for as compared to million for  primarily due to a million increase in the average balance of consumer and other loans to million and an increase of basis points in the weighted average yield to

the increase in income was also due to a basis point increase in the weighted average yield to for as compared to for the increase in the average balance of mortgage backed securities was due to purchases of variable rate mortgage backed securities as part of our interest rate risk management strategy 
since our primary lending activities are the origination and purchase of fixed rate mortgage loans  the purchase of variable rate mortgage backed securities provides us with an asset that reduces our exposure to interest rate fluctuations while providing a source of cash flow from monthly principal and interest payments 
the increase in the weighted average yields on mortgage backed securities is a result of the purchase of new page 
table of contents securities at higher rates than the existing portfolio as well as the repricing of securities in the existing portfolio 
dividends on fhlb stock increased million to million for as compared to million for this increase was due to a million increase in the average balance of fhlb stock to million and a basis point increase in the average dividend yield to for as compared to for interest on investment securities decreased million to million during as compared to million for this decrease was due to a million decrease in the average balance of investment securities to billion 
the decrease in interest on investment securities was partially offset by a basis point increase in the weighted average yield to 
interest expense 
total interest expense increased million  or  to billion for from billion for this increase was due primarily to an billion  or  increase in the average balance of total interest bearing liabilities to billion for compared with billion for the increase in total interest expense was also due to a basis point increase in the weighted average cost of total interest bearing liabilities to for as compared to for this increase in total interest bearing liabilities was used to fund asset growth 
the increase in the average cost of interest bearing liabilities for the reflected a very competitive environment for deposits and a shift within our deposits to higher costing short term time deposits as well as the growth and re pricing of our deposits and borrowings during the higher short term interest rate environment experienced during the second half of and first half of interest expense on our time deposit accounts increased million to million for as compared to million for this increase was due to a basis point increase in the weighted average cost to and a billion increase in the average balance of time deposit accounts to billion as compared to billion for interest expense on money market accounts increased million due to a basis point increase in the weighted average cost to  reflecting increases in short term interest rates and the competitive pricing of this product  and a million increase in the average balance to billion 
the increases in the average balance of time deposits and money market accounts reflects our growth strategy and includes deposits from the branches added to our network during and as well as deposit growth in existing branches 
interest expense on our interest bearing transaction accounts decreased million to million for as compared to million for primarily due to a million decrease in the average balance to billion from billion 
this decrease was due primarily to customer preferences for short term time deposit products 
interest expense on borrowed funds increased million to million for as compared to million for this increase was primarily due to a billion increase in the average balance of borrowed funds to billion and a basis point increase in the weighted average cost of borrowed funds to for as compared to for we faced significant competition for time deposits from many of our competitors who  during the second half of  sought to raise liquidity by offering customers premium rates on deposits even as market interest rates decreased 
as a result  we increased our level of borrowed funds  which we believed to be a more cost effective alternative in the current interest rate environment 
the increase in borrowed funds was used to fund the growth in interest earning assets 
the increase in the average cost of borrowed funds reflected new borrowings with higher interest rates than existing borrowings that were called 
substantially all of our borrowings are callable at the discretion of the issuer 
as a result  as interest rates decrease  these borrowings will probably not be page 
table of contents called and therefore will not reprice until maturity or until market interest rates increase 
as interest rates increase  these borrowings would likely be called at their next call date and our cost to replace these borrowings would be at higher rates than the called borrowing 
these call features are generally quarterly  after an initial non call period of three months to five years from the date of borrowing 
net interest income 
net interest income increased million  or  to million for compared with million for our net interest rate spread decreased basis points to for from for our net interest margin decreased basis points to from for the same respective periods 
the decrease in our net interest rate margin and net interest rate spread was primarily due to the larger increase in the weighted average cost of interest bearing liabilities compared with the increase in the weighted average yield on interest earning assets 
changes in market interest rates during resulted in a return to a positively sloped yield curve 
however  competitive pricing pressures due in part to the liquidity crisis in the credit markets  prevented us from lowering our deposit costs to the same extent as the decreases in the yield curve and the shift within our deposits to higher costing short term time deposits also contributed to the increase in the average cost of deposits 
in addition  while market interest rates decreased  our callable borrowings were not called and therefore did not reprice to lower rates 
provision for loan losses 
the provision for loan losses amounted to million for the year we did not record a provision for loan losses for the allowance for loan losses amounted to million and million at december  and  respectively 
we recorded our provision for loan losses during based on our allowance for loan losses methodology that considers a number of quantitative and qualitative factors  including the amount of non performing loans  which increased to million at december  as compared to million at december  see critical accounting policies allowance for loan losses 
at december   first mortgage loans secured by one to four family properties accounted for of total loans 
fixed rate mortgage loans represent of our first mortgage loans 
fixed rate loans possess less inherent credit risk since loan payments do not change in response to changes in interest rates 
in addition  we do not originate or purchase loans with payment options  negative amortization loans or sub prime loans 
we determined that a provision for loan losses was not required for the fiscal year ended december  based on our allowance for loan losses methodology that considered a number of quantitative and qualitative factors  including low levels of charge offs 
see critical accounting policies allowance for loan losses for a description of this methodology 
net charge offs amounted to  during charge offs were at very low levels as a result of our lending practices and the concentration of one to four family first mortgage loans in our portfolio 
as a result of our underwriting policies  our borrowers typically have a significant amount of equity in the underlying real estate that we use as collateral for our loans 
when a loan becomes delinquent  the borrower will usually sell the property to satisfy the loan rather than go to foreclosure 
since substantially all of our non performing loans are secured by residential real estate with adequate collateral  we determined that the ratio of the allowance to non performing loans was appropriate 
at december   first mortgage loans secured by one to four family properties accounted for of total loans 
fixed rate mortgage loans represented of our first mortgage loans 
the value of the property used as collateral for our loans is dependent upon local market conditions 
during  we monitored changes in the values of homes in each market using indices published by various organizations 
based on our analysis of the data for  we concluded that the values of homes in our market areas were stable 
as a result  we believe that our loans were adequately collateralized  especially given the loan to value ratios that our underwriting guidelines require at origination

total non interest income was million for compared with million for the increase in non interest income is primarily due to an increase in service charges on deposits as a result of deposit account growth 
non interest expense 
total non interest expense increased million  or  to million for from million for the increase is primarily due to a million increase in net occupancy expense and a million increase in compensation and benefits expense 
the increase in compensation and benefits expense was due to an increase of million in salary expense  a million increase in stock benefit plan expense and an million decrease in expense related to the esop restoration plan 
the increase in salary expense was due primarily to an increase in the number of employees to staff our new branches as well as normal salary increases 
the increase in stock benefit plan expense was primarily due to stock option grants which were made during and the option grants which were made in july during  two former executives ceased to participate in the esop restoration plan  resulting in the decreased expense related to the plan 
the increase in net occupancy expense and other non interest expense is primarily the result of our branch expansion  including the addition of branches from the sound federal acquisition in july as well as growth in the existing franchise 
our efficiency ratio was for each of the years ended december  and our ratio of non interest expense to average total assets for was as compared to for income taxes 
income tax expense increased million to million for  from million for our effective tax rate for was compared with for the increase in the effective tax rate was due primarily to a change in the new jersey tax code that eliminated the dividends received deduction for dividends paid by our real estate investment trust subsidiary to its parent company 
liquidity and capital resources the term liquidity refers to our ability to generate adequate amounts of cash to fund loan originations  loan and security purchases  deposit withdrawals  repayment of borrowings and operating expenses 
our primary sources of funds are deposits  borrowings  the proceeds from principal and interest payments on loans and mortgage backed securities  the maturities and calls of investment securities and funds provided by our operations 
deposit flows  calls of investment securities and borrowed funds  and prepayments of page 
table of contents loans and mortgage backed securities are strongly influenced by interest rates  general and local economic conditions and competition in the marketplace 
these factors reduce the predictability of the receipt of these sources of funds 
our membership in the fhlb provides us access to additional sources of borrowed funds  which is generally limited to approximately twenty times the amount of fhlb stock owned 
we also have the ability to access the capital markets from time to time  depending on market conditions 
our primary investing activities are the origination and purchase of one to four family real estate loans and consumer and other loans  the purchase of mortgage backed securities  and the purchase of investment securities 
these activities are funded primarily by borrowings  deposit growth and principal and interest payments on loans  mortgage backed securities and investment securities 
we originated billion and purchased billion of loans during as compared to billion and billion during while the residential real estate markets have slowed during the past year  our competitive rates and the decreased mortgage lending competition have resulted in increased origination production for the decrease in the purchases of mortgage loans during was due primarily to the continued reduction of activity in the secondary residential mortgage market as a result of the disruption and volatility in the financial and capital marketplaces 
at december   commitments to originate and purchase mortgage loans amounted to million and million  respectively as compared to million and million  respectively at december  purchases of mortgage backed securities during were billion as compared to billion during the increase in the purchases of mortgage backed securities reflects the growth initiatives we have employed in recent periods as well as our interest rate risk management strategy 
we purchased billion of investment securities during as compared to billion during proceeds from the calls of investment securities amounted to billion during as compared to billion for in during  principal repayments on loans totaled billion as compared to billion for the principal payments on mortgage backed securities amounted to billion and billion for those same respective periods 
these increases in principal repayments were due primarily to the growth of the loan and mortgage backed securities portfolios 
as part of the membership requirements of the fhlb  we are required to hold a certain dollar amount of fhlb common stock based on our mortgage related assets and borrowings from the fhlb 
during  we purchased a net additional million of fhlb common stock compared with net purchases of million during our primary financing activities consist of gathering deposits  engaging in wholesale borrowings  repurchases of our common stock and the payment of dividends 
total deposits increased billion during as compared to an increase of billion for these increases reflect our growth strategy and competitive pricing 
deposit flows are typically affected by the level of market interest rates  the interest rates and products offered by competitors  the volatility of equity markets  and other factors 
we believe the turmoil in the credit and equity markets during has made deposit products in strong financial institutions desirable for many customers 
time deposits scheduled to mature within one year were billion at december  these time deposits have a weighted average rate of 
we anticipate that we will have sufficient resources to meet this current funding commitment 
based on our deposit retention experience and current pricing strategy  we anticipate that a significant portion of these time deposits will remain with us as renewed time deposits or as transfers to other deposit products at the prevailing interest rate 
page 
table of contents we also used wholesale borrowings to fund our investing and financing activities 
new borrowings totaled billion  partially offset by million in principal repayments of borrowed funds 
at december   we had billion of borrowed funds with a weighted average rate of and with call dates within one year 
we anticipate that none of these borrowings will be called assuming current market interest rates remain stable 
however  in the event borrowings are called  we anticipate that we will have sufficient resources to meet this funding commitment by borrowing new funds at the prevailing market interest rate  or using funds generated by deposit growth 
in addition  we had million of borrowings with a weighted average rate of that are scheduled to mature within one year 
our borrowings have traditionally consisted of structured callable borrowings with ten year final maturities and initial non call periods of one to five years 
during the current period of credit instability we may not be able to borrow in this manner 
we believe that we will continue to be able to borrow from the same institutions as in the past  but structured callable borrowings may not be available 
in order to fund our growth and provide for our liquidity we may need to borrow short term  that is  borrowings with three to six month maturities 
these borrowings are typically at lower interest rates than longer term callable borrowings and  as a result  may decrease our borrowing costs 
however  using short term borrowings may increase our interest rate risk  especially if market interest rates were to increase 
while we will utilize these short term borrowings while the current conditions exist in the credit markets  we intend to use structured callable borrowings when these types of borrowings become available

table of contents impact of inflation and changing prices the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements of hudson city bancorp have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles  commonly referred as gaap 
gaap generally requires the measurement of financial position and operating results in terms of historical dollars without consideration for changes in the relative purchasing power of money over time due to inflation 
the impact of inflation is reflected in the increased cost of our operations 
unlike industrial companies  our assets and liabilities are primarily monetary in nature 
as a result  changes in market interest rates have a greater impact on performance than do the effects of inflation 
critical accounting policies we have identified the accounting policies below as critical to understanding our financial results 
in addition  note to the audited consolidated financial statements in item of this report contains a summary of our significant accounting policies 
we believe our policies with respect to the methodology for our determination of the allowance for loan losses  the measurement of stock based compensation expense and the measurement of the funded status and cost of our pension and other post retirement benefit plans involve a higher degree of complexity and require management to make difficult and subjective judgments which often require assumptions or estimates about highly uncertain matters 
changes in these judgments  assumptions or estimates could causereported results to differ materially 
these critical policies and their application are continually reviewed by management  and are periodically reviewed with the audit committee and our board of directors 
allowance for loan losses the allowance for loan losses has been determined in accordance with gaap  under which we are required to maintain an adequate allowance for loan losses at december  we are responsible for the timely and periodic determination of the amount of the allowance required 
we believe that our allowance for loan losses is adequate to cover specifically identifiable loan losses  as well as estimated losses inherent in our portfolio for which certain losses are probable but not specifically identifiable 
our primary lending emphasis is the origination and purchase of one to four family first mortgage loans on residential properties and  to a lesser extent  second mortgage loans on one to four family residential properties resulting in a loan concentration in residential first mortgage loans at december  as a result of our lending practices  we also have a concentration of loans secured by real property located primarily in new jersey  new york and connecticut 
at december   approximately of our total loans are in the new york metropolitan area 
additionally  the states of virginia  illinois  maryland  massachusetts  minnesota  michigan and pennsylvania accounted for       and  respectively of total loans 
the remaining of the loan portfolio is secured by real estate primarily in the remainder of the northeast quadrant of the united states 
based on the composition of our loan portfolio and the growth in our loan portfolio  we believe the primary risks inherent in our portfolio are the depth of the us recession  unemployment  interest rates in the markets we lend and a continuing decline in real estate market values 
any one or a combination of these events may adversely affect our loan portfolio resulting in increased delinquencies  non performing assets  loan losses and future levels of loan loss provisions 
we consider these trends in market conditions in determining the allowance for loan losses

table of contents due to the nature of our loan portfolio  our evaluation of the adequacy of our allowance for loan losses is performed primarily on a pooled basis 
each month we prepare an analysis which categorizes the entire loan portfolio by certain risk characteristics such as loan type one to four family  multi family  commercial  construction  etc  loan source originated or purchased and payment status ie  current or number of days delinquent 
loans with known potential losses are categorized separately 
we assign potential loss factors to the payment status categories on the basis of our assessment of the potential risk inherent in each loan type 
these factors are periodically reviewed for appropriateness giving consideration to charge off history  delinquency trends  portfolio growth and the status of the regional economy and housing market  in order to ascertain that the loss factors cover probable and estimable losses inherent in the portfolio 
we use this analysis  as a tool  together with principal balances and delinquency reports  to evaluate the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses 
other key factors we consider in this process are current real estate market conditions in geographic areas where our loans are located  changes in the trend of non performing loans  the results of our foreclosed property transactions  the current state of the local and national economy  changes in interest rates and loan portfolio growth 
any one or a combination of these events may adversely affect our loan portfolio resulting in increased delinquencies  loan losses and future levels of provisions 
we maintain the allowance for loan losses through provisions for loan losses that we charge to income 
we charge losses on loans against the allowance for loan losses when we believe the collection of loan principal is unlikely 
we establish the provision for loan losses after considering the results of our review as described above 
we apply this process and methodology in a consistent manner and we reassess and modify the estimation methods and assumptions used in response to changing conditions 
such changes  if any  are approved by our asset quality committee each quarter 
hudson city savings defines the population of potential impaired loans to be all non accrual construction  commercial real estate and multi family loans 
impaired loans are individually assessed to determine that the loan s carrying value is not in excess of the fair value of the collateral or the present value of the loan s expected future cash flows 
smaller balance homogeneous loans that are collectively evaluated for impairment  such as residential mortgage loans and consumer loans  are specifically excluded from the impaired loan analysis 
we believe that we have established and maintained the allowance for loan losses at adequate levels 
additions may be necessary if future economic and other conditions differ substantially from the current operating environment 
although management uses the best information available  the level of the allowance for loan losses remains an estimate that is subject to significant judgment and short term change 
see risk factors the geographic concentration of our loan portfolio and lending activities makes us vulnerable to a downturn in the economy 
stock based compensation we recognize the cost of employee services received in exchange for awards of equity instruments based on the grant date fair value for all awards granted  modified  repurchased or cancelled after january  and for the portion of outstanding awards for which the requisite service was not rendered as of january   in accordance with sfas no 
r 
we granted performance based stock options in  and that vest if certain financial performance measures are met 
in accordance with sfas no 
r  we assess the probability of achieving these financial performance measures and recognize the cost of these performance based grants if it is probable that the financial performance measures will be met 
this probability assessment is subjective in nature and may change over the assessment period for the performance measures 
page 
table of contents we estimate the per share fair value of option grants on the date of grant using the black scholes option pricing model using assumptions for the expected dividend yield  expected stock price volatility  risk free interest rate and expected option term 
these assumptions are based on our analysis of our historical option exercise experience and our judgments regarding future option exercise experience and market conditions 
these assumptions are subjective in nature  involve uncertainties and  therefore  cannot be determined with precision 
the black scholes option pricing model also contains certain inherent limitations when applied to options that are not traded on public markets 
the per share fair value of options is highly sensitive to changes in assumptions 
in general  the per share fair value of options will move in the same direction as changes in the expected stock price volatility  risk free interest rate and expected option term  and in the opposite direction of changes in the expected dividend yield 
for example  the per share fair value of options will generally increase as expected stock price volatility increases  risk free interest rate increases  expected option term increases and expected dividend yield decreases 
the use of different assumptions or different option pricing models could result in materially different per share fair values of options 
pension and other post retirement benefit assumptions non contributory retirement and post retirement defined benefit plans are maintained for certain employees  including retired employees hired on or before july  who have met other eligibility requirements of the plans 
we adopted sfas no 
 employers accounting for defined benefit pension and other post retirement plans an amendment of fasb statements nos 
   and r as of december  this statement requires an employer to a recognize in its statement of financial condition an asset for a plan s overfunded status or a liability for a plan s underfunded status  b measure a plan s assets and its obligations that determine its funded status as of the end of the employer s fiscal year  and c recognize  in comprehensive income  changes in the funded status of a defined benefit post retirement plan in the year in which the changes occur 
the requirement to measure plan assets and benefit obligations as of the date of the employer s fiscal year end statement of financial condition became effective for the company on december  we have historically used our fiscal year end as the measurement date for plan assets and benefit obligations and therefore the measurement date provisions of sfas no 
did not affect us 
we provide our actuary with certain rate assumptions used in measuring our benefit obligation 
we monitor these rates in relation to the current market interest rate environment and update our actuarial analysis accordingly 
the most significant of these is the discount rate used to calculate the period end present value of the benefit obligations  and the expense to be included in the following year s financial statements 
a lower discount rate will result in a higher benefit obligation and expense  while a higher discount rate will result in a lower benefit obligation and expense 
the discount rate assumption was determined based on a cash flow yield curve model specific to our pension and post retirement plans 
we compare this rate to certain market indices  such as long term treasury bonds  or the moody s bond indices  for reasonableness 
a discount rate of was selected for the december  measurement date and the expense calculation 
for our pension plan  we also assumed a rate of salary increase of for future periods 
this rate is comparable to actual salary increases experienced over prior years 
we assumed a return on plan assets of for future periods 
we actuarially determine the return on plan assets based on actual plan experience over the previous ten years 
the actual return on plan assets was a net loss of for the assumed return on plan assets of is based on expected returns in future periods 
our net loss on plan assets during is a result of the current economic recession and conditions in the equity and credit markets 
there can be no assurances with respect to actual return on plan assets in the future 
we page 
table of contents continually review and evaluate all actuarial assumptions affecting the pension plan  including assumed return on assets 
for our post retirement benefit plan  the assumed health care cost trend rate used to measure the expected cost of other benefits for was 
the rate was assumed to decrease gradually to for and remain at that level thereafter 
changes to the assumed health care cost trend rate are expected to have an immaterial impact as we capped our obligations to contribute to the premium cost of coverage to the post retirement health benefit plan at the premium level 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk general as a financial institution  our primary component of market risk is interest rate volatility 
our net income is primarily based on net interest income  and fluctuations in interest rates will ultimately impact the level of both income and expense recorded on a large portion of our assets and liabilities 
fluctuations in interest rates will also affect the market value of our interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities  other than those that possess a short term to maturity 
the difference between rates on the yield curve  or the shape of the yield curve  impacts our net interest income 
during  the national economy continued to falter with particular emphasis on the deterioration of the housing and real estate markets 
during the fourth quarter of  it became widely accepted that the united states economy had entered a recession by the first quarter of the faltering economy has been marked by contractions in the availability of business and consumer credit  increases in borrowing rates  falling home prices and increasing levels of home foreclosures and unemployment 
in response  the fomc decreased the overnight lending rate by to basis points during to a target rate of to 
this unprecedented decrease in the overnight lending rate was in response to the continued liquidity crisis in the credit markets as well as an attempt to stimulate the housing markets and the overall economy 
as a result  short term market interest rates decreased during the sharp decline in short term interest rates during lowered our deposit and borrowing costs 
longer term market interest rates also decreased during  but at a slower pace than short term interest rates and  as a result  the yield curve continued to steepen 
notwithstanding the decrease in long term market interest rates noted above  mortgage rates maintained a wider credit spread relative to us treasury securities resulting in higher yields on our mortgage loans 
as a result  our net interest rate spread and net interest margin increased as compared to both the fourth quarter and full year recent actions by the federal reserve to purchase securities issued by fannie mae and freddie mac have resulted in a decrease in mortgage rates late in the fourth quarter of and continuing into january due to our investment and financing decisions  the more positive the slope of the yield curve the more favorable the environment is for our ability to generate net interest income 
our interest bearing liabilities generally reflect movements in short and intermediate term rates  while our interest earning assets  a majority of which have initial terms to maturity or repricing greater than one year  generally reflect movements in intermediate and long term interest rates 
a positive slope of the yield curve allows us to invest in interest earning assets at a wider spread to the cost of interest bearing liabilities 
the impact of interest rate changes on our interest income is generally felt in later periods than the impact on our interest expense due to differences in the timing of the recognition of items on our balance sheet 
the timing of the recognition of interest earning assets on our balance sheet generally lags the current market rates by to days due to the normal time period between commitment and settlement dates 
in contrast  the recognition of interest bearing liabilities on our balance sheet generally reflects current market page 
table of contents interest rates as we generally fund purchases at the time of settlement 
during a period of decreasing short term interest rates  as was experienced during these past months  this timing difference had a positive impact on our net interest income as our interest bearing liabilities reset to the current lower interest rates 
if short term interest rates were to increase  the cost of our interest bearing liabilities would also increase and have an adverse impact on our net interest income 
our borrowings have traditionally consisted of structured callable borrowings with ten year final maturities and initial non call periods of one to five years 
during the current period of credit instability we have not been able to borrow in this manner 
we believe that we will continue to be able to borrow from the same institutions as in the past  but structured callable borrowings may not be as readily available as they were 
in order to fund our growth and provide for our liquidity we may need to borrow short term  that is  borrowings with three to twelve month maturities 
these borrowings are typically at lower interest rates than longer term callable borrowings and  as a result  may decrease our borrowing costs 
however  using short term borrowings may increase our interest rate risk  especially if market interest rates were to increase 
while we will utilize these short term borrowings while the current conditions exist in the credit markets  we intend to use structured callable borrowings when these types of borrowings become available 
also impacting our net interest income and net interest rate spread is the level of prepayment activity on our interest sensitive assets 
the actual amount of time before mortgage loans and mortgage backed securities are repaid can be significantly impacted by changes in market interest rates and mortgage prepayment rates 
mortgage prepayment rates will vary due to a number of factors  including the regional economy in the area where the underlying mortgages were originated  availability of credit  seasonal factors and demographic variables 
however  the major factors affecting prepayment rates are prevailing interest rates  related mortgage refinancing opportunities and competition 
generally  the level of prepayment activity directly affects the yield earned on those assets  as the payments received on the interest earning assets will be reinvested at the prevailing market interest rate 
prepayment rates are generally inversely related to the prevailing market interest rate  thus  as market interest rates increase  prepayment rates tend to decrease 
prepayment rates on our mortgage related assets have been relatively stable during despite the decreases in market interest rates 
we believe the lack of acceleration of the prepayment rate on these assets reflected the limited availability of credit during this time 
calls of investment securities and borrowed funds are also impacted by the level of market interest rates 
the level of calls of investment securities are generally inversely related to the prevailing market interest rate  meaning as rates decrease the likelihood of a security being called would increase 
the level of call activity generally affects the yield earned on these assets  as the payment received on the security would be reinvested at the prevailing lower market interest rate 
during the first three months of we saw an increase in call activity on our investment securities as market interest rates decreased 
this call activity decreased during the last nine months of as rates began to stabilize and substantially all of the securities held by us were not callable during this time period 
the securities purchased during the first quarter of to replace those securities that were called were reinvested at similar interest rates by purchasing securities with longer maturities and initial non call periods 
the likelihood of a borrowing being called is directly related to the current market interest rates  meaning the higher that interest rates move  the more likely the borrowing would be called 
the level of call activity generally affects the cost of our borrowed funds  as the call of a borrowing would generally necessitate the re borrowing of the funds at the higher current market interest rate 
during we experienced limited call activity due to the decrease of market interest rates 
page 
table of contents management of interest rate risk the primary objectives of our interest rate risk management strategy are to evaluate the interest rate risk inherent in our balance sheet accounts  determine the appropriate level of interest rate risk given our business plan  the current business environment and our capital and liquidity requirements  and manage interest rate risk in a manner consistent with the approved guidelines and policies set by our board of directors 
we seek to manage our asset liability mix to help minimize the impact that interest rate fluctuations may have on our earnings 
to achieve the objectives of managing interest rate risk  our asset liability committee meets weekly to discuss and monitor the market interest rate environment compared to interest rates that are offered on our products 
this committee consists of the chief executive officer  the chief operating officer  the chief financial officer and other senior officers of the institution as required 
the asset liability committee presents periodic reports to the board of directors at its regular meetings and  on a quarterly basis  presents a comprehensive report addressing the results of activities and strategies and the effect that changes in interest rates will have on our results of operations and the present value of our equity 
historically  our lending activities have emphasized one to four family fixed rate first and second mortgage loans  while purchasing variable rate or hybrid mortgage backed securities to offset our predominantly fixed rate loan portfolio 
in the past several years  we have originated and purchased a larger percentage of variable rate mortgage related assets in order to better manage our interest rate risk 
variable rate mortgage related assets include those loans or securities with a contractual annual rate adjustment after an initial fixed rate period of one to ten years 
these variable rate instruments are more rate sensitive  given the potential interest rate adjustment  than the long term fixed rate loans that we have traditionally held in our portfolio 
this growth in variable rate mortgage related assets has helped reduce our exposure to interest rate fluctuations and is expected to benefit our long term profitability  as the rate earned on the mortgage loan will increase as prevailing market rates increase 
however  this strategy to originate a higher percentage of variable rate instruments may have an adverse impact on our net interest income and net interest margin in the short term  as variable rate interest earning assets generally have initial interest rates lower than alternative fixed rate investments 
variable rate products constituted of loan originations  of loan purchases and of mortgage backed security purchases made during in aggregate  of our mortgage related asset originations and purchases had variable rates 
of the growth in our total mortgage related assets  was due to growth in our variable rate products 
in  we intend to originate and purchase similar percentages to of variable rate mortgage related assets 
the strategy to originate and purchase a larger percentage of variable rate assets has lowered our percentage of fixed rate interest earning assets to total interest earning assets to at december  from at december  notwithstanding the decrease in the percentage of fixed rate interest earning assets to total interest earning assets  our fixed rate interest earning assets may have an adverse impact on our earnings in a rising rate environment as the interest rate on these interest earning assets would not reprice to current market interest rates as fast as the interest rates on our interest bearing deposits and callable borrowed funds 
the current prevailing interest rate environment and the desires of our customers have resulted in a demand for long term hybrid and page 
table of contents fixed rate mortgage loans 
the origination and purchase of these types of mortgage loans may have an adverse impact on our net interest income  particularly in a rising interest rate environment 
our primary sources of funds have traditionally been deposits  consisting primarily of time deposits and interest bearing demand accounts  and borrowings 
our deposits have substantially shorter terms to maturity than our mortgage loan portfolio and borrowed funds 
the borrowings have been generally long term to maturity  in an effort to offset our short term deposit liabilities and assist in managing our interest rate risk 
these long term borrowings have call options that could shorten their maturities in a changing interest rate environment 
if we experience a significant rising interest rate environment where interest rates increase above the interest rate for the borrowings  these borrowings will likely be called at their next call date and our cost to replace these borrowings would likely increase 
of our borrowings outstanding at december   billion were structured callable borrowings 
of these  billion with a weighted average rate of have the contractual right to be called within the next twelve months 
given the current market rate environment  we believe none of these borrowings will be called during the next twelve months 
in the current market environment we have borrowed for shorter terms  generally for periods of three to twelve months 
these shorter term borrowings are typically at lower interest rates than the longer term callable borrowings and  as a result  may decrease our borrowing costs 
however  using short term borrowings may increase our interest rate risk  especially if market interest rates were to increase 
while we will utilize these short term borrowings while the current conditions exist in the credit markets  we intend to use structured callable borrowings when these types of borrowings become more readily available 
as of december   we had million of borrowings with terms to maturity of less than one year 
due to the nature of our operations  we are not subject to foreign currency exchange or commodity price risk 
our real estate loan portfolio  the majority of which is located in new jersey  new york and connecticut  is subject to risks associated with the local economy 
we do not own any trading assets 
we did not engage in any hedging transactions that use derivative instruments such as interest rate swaps and caps during the year and did not have any such hedging transactions in place at december  cash flow determination 
in preparing the following analyses  we were required to estimate the future cash flows of our interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
these items are generally reported at their maturity date  subject to assumptions regarding prepayment rates  non maturity deposit decay rates  and the call of certain of our investment securities and borrowed funds 
these assumptions can have a significant impact on the simulation model 
while we believe our assumptions are reasonable  there can be no assurance that assumed prepayment rates  assumed calls of securities and borrowed funds  and deposit decay rates will approximate actual future cash flows 
increases in market interest rates may tend to reduce prepayment speeds on our mortgage related assets  as fewer borrowers refinance their loans  and reduce the anticipated calls of our investment securities 
at the same time  deposit decay rates and calls of our borrowed funds may tend to increase 
if these trends occur  we could experience larger negative percent changes in our model results in the varying rate shock scenarios 
the information presented in the following tables is based on the following assumptions we assumed an annual prepayment rate for fixed rate first mortgage loans using the fhlmc fixed rate index of moderately seasoned loans and an annual prepayment rate for variable rate first mortgage loans using the fhlmc five year balloon index of new loans  page 
table of contents we assumed an annual prepayment rate for our mortgage backed securities using the prepayment rate associated with the security type  for savings accounts that had no stated maturity  we used decay rates the assumed rate at which the balance of existing accounts would decline of in less than six months  in six months to one year  in one year to two years  in two years to three years  in three years to five years  and in more than five years  for our high value checking product  which is included in interest bearing transaction accounts  we used decay rates of in less than six months  in six months to one year  in one to two years  in two to three years  in three to five years  and in more than five years  for other interest bearing transaction accounts that had no stated maturity  we used decay rates of in less than six months  in six months to one year  in one to two years  in two to three years  in three years to five years  and in more than five years  for money market accounts that had no stated maturity  we used decay rates of in less than six months  in six months to one year  in one to two years  in two to three years  in three years to five years  and in more than five years  callable investment securities are shown at the earlier of their probable call date  maturity date or the next rate adjustment date step up securities  the model assumed calls of investment securities of million over the next year in the current zero basis point change scenario  we currently hold billion of step up bonds  of which million were reported at their next call date  and borrowed funds are shown at the earlier of their probable call date or maturity date given the rate of the instrument in relation to the current market rate environment and the call option frequency  the model assumed there were no calls of borrowed funds over the next year in the current zero basis point change scenario 
simulation model 
we use a simulation model as our primary means to calculate and monitor the interest rate risk inherent in our portfolio 
this model reports net interest income and the present value of equity in different interest rate environments  assuming an instantaneous and permanent interest rate shock to all interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities 
we assume maturing or called instruments are reinvested into the same type of product  with the rate earned or paid reset to our currently offered rate for loans and deposits  or the current market rate for securities and borrowed funds 
we have not reported the minus basis point or minus basis point interest rate shock scenarios in either of our simulation model analyses  as we believe  given the current interest rate environment and historical interest rate levels  the resulting information would not be meaningful 
net interest income 
as a primary means of managing interest rate risk  we monitor the impact of interest rate changes on our net interest income over the next twelve month period 
this model does not purport to provide estimates of net interest income over the next twelve month period  but attempts to assess the impact of a simultaneous and parallel interest rate change on our net interest income 
page 
table of contents the following table reports the changes to our net interest income assuming and basis point increases in interest rates 
our internal policy sets a maximum change of given a positive basis point interest rate shock 
change in percent change in interest rates net interest income basis points the preceding table indicates that at december   in the event of a basis point increase in interest rates  we would expect to experience a decrease in net interest income as compared to an decrease at december  this decrease to net interest income reflects the anticipated calls of borrowed funds in the basis point increase scenario and an increase in expense on our short term time deposits in both increasing interest rate scenarios 
present value of equity 
we also monitor our interest rate risk by monitoring changes in the present value of equity in the different rate environments 
the present value of equity is the difference between the estimated fair value of interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities 
the changes in market value of assets and liabilities due to changes in interest rates reflect the interest sensitivity of those assets and liabilities as their values are derived from the characteristics of the asset or liability ie  fixed rate  adjustable rate  caps  floors relative to the current interest rate environment 
for example  in a rising interest rate environment the fair market value of a fixed rate asset will decline  whereas the fair market value of an adjustable rate asset  depending on its repricing characteristics  may not decline 
increases in the market value of assets will increase the present value of equity whereas decreases in the market value of assets will decrease the present value of equity 
conversely  increases in the market value of liabilities will decrease the present value of equity whereas decreases in the market value of liabilities will increase the present value of equity 
the following table presents the estimated present value of equity over a range of interest rate change scenarios at december  the present value ratio shown in the table is the present value of equity as a percent of the present value of total assets in each of the different rate environments 
our current policy sets a minimum ratio of the present value of equity to the fair value of assets in the current interest rate environment no rate shock of and a minimum present value ratio of in the plus basis point interest rate shock scenario 
additionally  our current policy sets a maximum basis point change in the plus basis point change scenario of basis points 
present value of equity as percent of present value of assets change in present basis point interest rates value ratio change basis points page 
table of contents in the basis point increase scenario  the present value ratio was at december  as compared to at december  the change in the present value ratio was positive basis points at december  as compared to a negative basis points at december  the current low market interest rate environment has caused an increase in the estimated prepayment speeds and calls on our assets  while extending our callable borrowings to near maturity in the base case 
the slight increase of the present value ratio in the basis point increase scenario of basis points from the present value ratio in the base case scenario reflects this low market interest rate environment and the extent to which market rates can increase without significant change to our present value of equity 
at december  the present value of equity is below our board established limit  due primarily to the extraordinarily low market interest rates that existed at that time 
the methods we used in simulation modeling are inherently imprecise 
this type of modeling requires that we make assumptions that may not reflect the manner in which actual yields and costs respond to changes in market interest rates 
for example  we assume the composition of the interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities will remain constant over the period being measured and that all interest rate shocks will be uniformly reflected across the yield curve  regardless of the duration to maturity or repricing 
the table assumes that we will take no action in response to the changes in interest rates 
in addition  prepayment estimates and other assumptions within the model are subjective in nature  involve uncertainties  and  therefore  cannot be determined with precision 
accordingly  although the previous two tables may provide an estimate of our interest rate risk at a particular point in time  such measurements are not intended to and do not provide a precise forecast of the effect of changes in interest rates on our net interest income or present value of equity 
gap analysis 
the matching of the repricing characteristics of assets and liabilities may be analyzed by examining the extent to which such assets and liabilities are interest rate sensitive and by monitoring a financial institution s interest rate sensitivity gap 
an asset or liability is said to be interest rate sensitive within a specific time period if it will mature or reprice within that time period 
the interest rate sensitivity gap is defined as the difference between the amount of interest earning assets maturing or repricing within a specific time period and the amount of interest bearing liabilities maturing or repricing within that same time period 
a gap is considered negative when the amount of interest bearing liabilities maturing or repricing within a specific time period exceeds the amount of interest earning assets maturing or repricing within that same period 
a gap is considered positive when the amount of interest earning assets maturing or repricing within a specific time period exceeds the amount of interest bearing liabilities maturing or repricing within that same time period 
during a period of rising interest rates  a financial institution with a negative gap position would be expected  absent the effects of other factors  to experience a greater increase in the costs of its interest bearing liabilities relative to the yields of its interest earning assets and thus a decrease in the institution s net interest income 
an institution with a positive gap position would be expected  absent the effect of other factors  to experience the opposite result 
conversely  during a period of falling interest rates  a negative gap would tend to result in an increase in net interest income while a positive gap would tend to reduce net interest income 
the following table presents the amounts of our interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities outstanding at december   which we anticipate to reprice or mature in each of the future time periods shown 
except for prepayment activity and non maturity deposit decay rates  we determined the amounts of assets and liabilities that reprice or mature during a particular period in accordance with the earlier of the term to rate reset or the contractual maturity of the asset or liability 
for purposes of this table  assumptions used in decay rates and prepayment activity are similar to those used in the preparation of our simulation model 
callable investment securities and borrowed funds are reported at the anticipated call page 
table of contents date  for those that are callable within one year  or at their contractual maturity or rate reset date 
we reported million of investment securities at their anticipated call date 
we did not report any of our callable borrowed funds at their next call date 
we have excluded non accrual mortgage loans of million and non accrual other loans of  from the table 
at december  more than more than more than more than two years three years six months six months one year to to three to five more than or less to one year two years years years five years total dollars in thousands interest earning assets first mortgage loans consumer and other loans federal funds sold mortgage backed securities fhlb stock investment securities total interest earning assets interest bearing liabilities savings accounts interest bearing demand accounts money market accounts time deposits borrowed funds total interest bearing liabilities interest rate sensitivity gap cumulative interest rate sensitivity gap cumulative interest rate sensitivity gap as a percent of total assets cumulative interest earning assets as a percent of interest bearing liabilities the cumulative one year gap as a percent of total assets was negative at december  compared with negative at december  the slightly higher negative cumulative one year gap primarily reflects the increase in short term time deposits and short term borrowings placed on our balance sheet during the fourth quarter of the methods used in the gap table are also inherently imprecise 
for example  although certain assets and liabilities may have similar maturities or periods to repricing  they may react in different degrees to changes in market interest rates 
interest rates on certain types of assets and liabilities may fluctuate in advance of changes in market interest rates  while interest rates on other types may lag behind changes in market rates 
certain assets  such as adjustable rate loans and mortgage backed securities  have features that limit changes in interest rates on a short term basis and over the life of the loan 
if interest rates change  prepayment and early withdrawal levels would likely deviate from those assumed in calculating the table 
finally  the ability of borrowers to make payments on their adjustable rate loans may decrease if interest rates increase
