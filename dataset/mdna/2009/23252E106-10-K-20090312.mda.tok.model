item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations cautionary statement for forward looking information statements included in this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations may contain forward looking statements 
there are a number of risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those anticipated by the statements made below 
these include  but are not limited to  competitive factors  technological and product developments  market demand  economic conditions  the resolution of litigation involving us  and our ability to comply with the terms of our credit facilities 
further information on these and other factors which could affect our financial results can be found in our filings with the securities and exchange commission  including part i of this annual report on form k 
overview and outlook we are a new york corporation that develops  manufactures and markets high performance  professional quality exercise equipment products for the commercial market and  to a lesser extent  the premium segment of the consumer market 
we estimate that commercial sales represent more than of our total net sales 
our financial performance can be affected when  in times of economic uncertainty  our commercial customers  particularly fitness clubs  become cautious in making expansion investments and reduce their capital expenditures for items such as the fitness equipment offered by us 
while our net sales for marginally increased over the prior year  our net sales in the fourth quarter of were over below net sales in the corresponding period of we believe that this sales decline largely reflects our commercial customers  particularly fitness clubs  being cautious in making capital investments due to economic conditions  both generally and in the fitness industry 
while we cannot be certain how long these conditions will persist or the extent that these conditions will affect our financial performance  we expect sales to continue to be negatively impacted by the economy 
we further expect that sales will rebound as the economy recovers 
we have taken various steps to reduce expenses in response to the decline in our sales  including a first quarter work force reduction of about 
we intend to monitor general economic conditions and our sales performance and  if warranted  may effect further cost saving measures during the year 
the foregoing statements are based on current expectations 
these statements are forward looking and actual results may differ materially 
in particular  the continued uncertainties in us and global economic conditions and in the fitness industry make it particularly difficult to predict product demand and other related matters and may preclude us from achieving expected results 
results of operations the following table sets forth selected items from the consolidated statements of operations as a percentage of net sales year ended december net sales cost of sales gross profit selling  general and administrative expenses goodwill impairment charge operating income loss interest expense  net income loss before income taxes income tax expense benefit net income loss net sales our net sales increased  or  to  in compared with a  or  increase in compared to the increase in was attributable to an increase in sales of strength training products of  or  to  and increased freight  parts and other revenue of  or  to  partially offset by a decrease in sales of cardiovascular products of  or  to  the sales increase of strength training products in was primarily due to sales of vr  the strength line introduced in the second quarter of the sales decrease of cardiovascular products in was predominantly driven by reduced sales of arc trainers offset by increased sales of treadmills including models first introduced in the second quarter of the increase in was attributable to an increase in sales of cardiovascular products of  or  to  and increased sales of strength training products of  or  to  partially offset by decreased parts and other sales of  or  to  the sales increase of cardiovascular products in was predominantly driven by sales of the t treadmill  first introduced in the third quarter of along with sales of the t treadmill  cordless arc trainers and a arc trainer  first introduced in the third and fourth quarters of the sales increase of strength products in was primarily due to sales of vr  the strength line introduced in the second quarter of  and vr  the strength line introduced at the end of sales outside of north america represented  and of consolidated net sales in  and  respectively 
gross margin gross margin was in  compared with in and in margins decreased in due to higher material costs caused by higher commodity prices  higher outbound freight expense 
and higher labor and overhead costs 
these costs were offset by favorable warranty expense 
margins decreased in due to higher warranty costs  start up costs and higher fixed overhead associated with our new owatonna facility 
and product mix 
the price of steel  a major component of our products  fluctuates from time to time 
the price for steel and fuel costs increased significantly in while these costs have moderated in the first quarter of  we are uncertain of the impact of steel prices and fuel costs on margins for selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses  including bad debt expense  increased by  or  in to  compared to an increase of  or  in as a percentage of net sales  these expenses were  and in  and  respectively 
the increase in selling  general and administrative expenses was predominantly due to an increase in domestic and international selling and marketing expenses  and an increase in product development costs 
the balance of the increase in these expenses is primarily comprised of smaller amounts including higher salary levels 
the increase in product development costs includes  of expenses related to a product development agreement 
goodwill impairment charge we test our goodwill annually for impairment 
at december   we performed the initial step of our impairment evaluation by comparing the fair market value of our single reporting unit  as determined using market capitalization  as adjusted for a control premium  to its carrying value 
as the carrying amount exceeded the fair value  the second step of the impairment evaluation was performed to calculate impairment and as a result  a goodwill impairment charge of  the entire amount of the goodwill carrying value  was recorded with no corresponding tax benefit 
the primary reason for the impairment charge was the reduction in our market capitalization resulting from the sustained decline of our stock price during the second half of interest expense  net net interest expense increased by  or  in to  compared to a decrease of  or  in the increase in relates primarily to  of interest income recognized in related to the citizens interest rate swap offset by higher deferred financing costs in the decrease in relates primarily to the interest rate swap expense of  in compared to  of interest income recognized in as well as lower deferred financing costs 
we expect that net interest expense for will approximate income taxes we recorded an income tax expense of  for the year ended december  in  we established a valuation allowance against all of our deferred tax assets 
on a quarterly basis  we reevaluate the need for this valuation allowance in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes based upon the existence of various factors 
based on this reevaluation  we reduced the valuation allowance by  effective july  we further reduced the valuation allowance by  in during the period from the establishment of the valuation allowance in  to the july  reduction of the valuation allowance  our income tax provision was limited to state taxes and federal alternative minimum taxes 
the effective tax rate excluding changes in the valuation allowance was in subsequent to july  in and in before the non deductible goodwill impairment charge 
the rate increase in is primarily due to non deductible foreign losses representing a higher percentage of our results for the year 
actual cash outlays for taxes  however  continue to be reduced by the available operating loss carryforwards  consistent with prior periods 
as of december   us federal operating loss carryforwards of approximately  were available to us to offset future taxable income and  as of such date  we also had foreign net operating loss carryforwards of  federal alternative minimum tax credit carryforwards of  and federal research and development tax credit carryforwards of  the net deferred tax asset balance of  at december  represents the amount that we believe is more likely than not to be realized  and the remaining valuation allowance at december  is  we will continue to assess the need for the remaining valuation allowance in future periods 
we adopted the provisions of fin on january  there was no impact on our financial position upon adoption see note to the consolidated financial statements 
financial condition  liquidity and capital resources as of december   we had working capital of  compared to  at december  the increase in working capital is primarily due to lower accrued expenses of  primarily relating to a royalty settlement and a product development agreement in along with a  decrease in the current portion of long term debt  primarily due to the reduction of the revolver balance 
for the year ended december   we generated  of cash from operating activities compared to  for the year ended december  cash used in investing activities of  in consisted of purchases of manufacturing tooling and equipment of  primarily for the manufacture of new products   of renovations to our medway manufacturing facility and computer hardware of  cash used in investing activities of  during consisted of  for the purchase of our new owatonna manufacturing facility  purchases and deposits on manufacturing tooling and equipment of  primarily related to our new owatonna facility   of renovations to our medway manufacturing facility and computer hardware and software of  including costs associated with an upgrade to our erp system 
projected capital expenditures for relate mostly to manufacturing equipment and tooling for new products and computer hardware and infrastructure  and are expected to be approximately  for the year ended december   cash used in financing activities of  consisted primarily of net revolver payments of  and  for the purchase of treasury stock through a repurchase program offset by net term loan borrowings of  for the year ended december   cash provided by financing activities of  consisted primarily of the  real estate loan which financed in part the acquisition of the owatonna facility and a  term loan which financed certain manufacturing equipment offset by net working capital loan repayments of  we have credit facilities with citizens bank of massachusetts and rbs citizens  national association collectively  citizens and wachovia bank  na wachovia 
our citizens credit agreement provides a revolving line of credit of up to the lesser of  or an amount determined by reference to a borrowing base 
our citizens loan agreement provided for a  real estate loan which was advanced in to finance the acquisition of the owatonna facility 
we entered into the wachovia loan agreement in  providing for a term loan to finance the acquisition of machinery and equipment 
the wachovia loan agreement was supplemented in to provide an additional term loan availability of up to  to finance the acquisition of machinery and equipment 
a total of  was advanced under the wachovia loan agreement through december  the wachovia loan agreement was further supplemented in march  to provide an additional term loan availability of up to  to finance the acquisition of machinery and equipment through december  the citizens revolving line of credit is secured by our accounts receivable and inventory  and matures july  the citizens real estate loan is secured by a mortgage on the owatonna facility and matures on july  the wachovia loans are secured by the equipment financed through the facility 
the first term loan matures on march   the second term loan matures on january  and the third term loan matures on december  at december   there were outstanding no revolving credit loans  a  real estate loan and  in term loans 
availability under the revolving loan fluctuates daily 
at december   there was  in unused availability under the working capital revolving loan facility 
we are in compliance with all financial covenants as of december  and expect to remain in compliance for the foreseeable future 
in november  we announced that our board of directors has authorized a stock repurchase program of up to one million shares of our common stock 
there is no requirement that any level of purchases up to the maximum be made under this program  and the timing  amount and cost of any purchase depends upon various factors  including our stock price and market conditions 
through march    shares had been repurchased under this program with an aggregate cost to us of  we rely upon cash flows from our operations and borrowings under our credit facilities to fund our working capital and capital expenditure requirements 
a decline in sales or margins or a failure to remain in compliance with the terms of our credit facilities could result in having insufficient funds for such purposes 
we believe that our cash flows and the availability under our credit facilities are sufficient to fund our general working capital and capital expenditure needs for at least the next months 
as of december   we had approximately  in net operating loss carry forwards  substantially all of which will be available to offset future taxable income

as further described in note  employment agreements  the maximum cash exposure under these agreements is  as of december  the actual amounts to be paid can only be determined at the time of the executive officer s separation from the company 
off balance sheet arrangements we have a lease financing program  whereby we arrange equipment leases and other financing for certain commercial customers for selected products 
these leases are sales type leases and are generally for terms of three to five years  at which time title transfers to the lessee 
while most of these financings are without recourse  in certain cases we may offer a guaranty or other recourse provisions 
at december   the maximum contingent liability under all recourse provisions was approximately  a reserve for estimated losses under recourse provisions of  has been recorded based upon historical experience  and is included in accrued liabilities at december  recent accounting pronouncements in september  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no

critical accounting policies the company s significant accounting policies are described in note to the consolidated financial statements included in item of this annual report on form k 
the preparation of financial statements in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
on an ongoing basis  management evaluates its estimates and judgments  including those related to the allowance for doubtful accounts  realizability of inventory  reserves for warranty obligations  reserves for legal matters and product liability  recoverability of goodwill and valuation of deferred tax assets 
management bases its estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions  which could materially impact the company s results of operations and financial position 
these critical accounting policies and estimates have been discussed with the company s audit committee 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
management performs ongoing credit evaluations of customers and adjusts credit limits based upon payment history and the customer s current credit worthiness  as determined by a review of their current credit information 
management continuously monitors collections and payments from customers and maintains a provision for estimated credit losses based upon historical experience and any specific customer collection issues that have been identified 
if the financial condition of a specific customer or the company s general customer base were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
realizability of inventory 
the company values inventory at the lower of cost or market 
management regularly reviews inventory quantities on hand and records a provision for excess and obsolete inventory based primarily on estimated forecasts of product demand and historical usage  after considering the impact of new products 
if actual market conditions and product demand are less favorable than projected  additional inventory write downs may be required 
warranty reserve 
all products are warranted one year of labor and up to ten years for structural frames 
warranty periods for parts range from one to ten years depending on the part and the type of equipment 
a warranty liability is recorded at the time of product sale based on estimates that are developed from historical information and certain assumptions about future events 
future warranty obligations are affected by product failure rates  usage and service costs incurred in addressing warranty claims 
these factors are impacted by the level of new product introductions and the mix of equipment sold to the commercial and consumer markets 
if actual warranty costs differ from management s estimates  adjustments to the warranty liability would be required 
legal matters 
the company will record a reserve related to certain legal matters for which it is probable that a loss has been incurred and the range of such loss can be determined 
with respect to other matters  management has concluded that a loss is only possible or remote and  therefore  no loss is recorded 
as additional information becomes available  the company will continue to assess whether losses from legal matters are probable  possible  or remote  and the adequacy of accruals for probable loss contingencies 
product liability reserve 
due to the nature of its products  the company is involved in certain pending product liability claims and lawsuits 
the company maintains product liability insurance coverage subject to deductibles 
reserves for self insured retention  including claims incurred but not yet reported  are included in accrued liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets  based on management s review of outstanding claims and claims history and consultation with its third party claims administrators 
if actual results vary from management s estimates  adjustments to the reserve would be required 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion on product liability 
recoverability of goodwill 
in assessing the recoverability of goodwill  management is required to make assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors to determine whether the fair value of the business supports the carrying value of goodwill and net operating assets 
this analysis includes assumptions and estimates about future sales  costs  working capital  capital expenditures  and cost of capital 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for discussion of the goodwill impairment charge in valuation of deferred tax assets 
in  the company established a full valuation allowance against its net deferred tax assets 
effective july   management reevaluated the need for this valuation allowance in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  due to the existence of various factors 
based on this reevaluation  the company reduced the valuation allowance by  in and  in the net deferred tax asset balance of  at december  represents the amount that management believes is more likely than not to be realized and the remaining valuation allowance at december  is  management will continue to assess the need for the remaining valuation allowance in future periods 
approximately  of income before income taxes is needed to fully realize the company s recorded net deferred tax asset and  of future taxable income is needed to fully realize the company s deferred tax assets 
the difference between total deferred tax assets and the net operating loss carryforwards and credits is primarily book versus tax differences of various expenses 
if the estimates and related assumptions relating to the likely utilization of the deferred tax asset change in the future  the valuation allowance may change accordingly 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk interest rate risk the company s debt portfolio as of december  is comprised of variable rate debt denominated in us dollars 
changes in interest rates have an impact on the variable portion of the company s debt portfolio 
a change in interest rates on the variable portion of the debt portfolio impacts the interest incurred and cash flows but does not impact the company s consolidated balance sheet 
at december   the company had variable rate debt with a carrying value of  a basis point change in interest rates would have impacted interest expense by  for the year ended december  the company uses interest rate swaps to hedge its exposure to interest rate changes and also to reduce volatility of its financing costs 
under these swaps the company agrees with a counterparty to exchange the difference between fixed rate and floating rate interest amounts based on agreed notational principal amounts 
these agreements are considered highly effective as cash flow hedges for a portion of the company s variable debt  and hedge accounting is used to account for these instruments 
included in the variable rate debt are the wachovia term loans  for which the company entered into an interest rate swap agreement effective march   which effectively converts the rate from a floating rate based on libor to a fixed rate throughout the duration of the swap agreement 
the company also has an interest rate swap which effectively converts the citizens real estate loan in the amount of  at december  from a floating rate to a fixed rate of throughout the duration of the loan 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of these instruments 
foreign currency rates the company uses foreign currency forward contracts to hedge its foreign currency exposure on sales made in the uk in british sterling 
at december   the company had outstanding foreign currency forward contracts of  british sterling for the purchase of
