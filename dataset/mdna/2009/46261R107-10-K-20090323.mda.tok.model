overview at the end of  we operated retail stores  including in new england and five in florida  and for the year we generated approximately million in sales and had a net loss of approximately million 
total sales for fiscal a week period decreased compared to fiscal also a week period 
comparable store sales in decreased compared to sales in comparable store sales are defined as sales from those stores open for at least one full year 
the year began with a increase in comparable store sales in the first quarter of total sales for the first quarter of increased compared to the first quarter of this performance was mainly due to strong sales associated with the post season football playoffs  especially the super bowl  between the new england patriots and new york giants football teams  and the occurrence of easter in the first quarter of despite the increase in sales  net loss for the quarter increased due to increased merchandise costs  increased markdowns  due in part to a weather related decline in sales in december  and increased store operating expenses  as we opened two stores and closed two stores in january our net loss for the quarter was million  compared to a net loss of million for the first quarter of in the second quarter  comparable stores sales decreased compared to the same period in total sales decreased by 
during this quarter  our sales results suffered from the movement of easter from the second to the first quarter of the year 
product margins stabilized in the second quarter 
however  store operating costs continued to increase compared to levels  resulting in a lower profit for the quarter compared to the second quarter of our net income was thousand for the quarter compared to a net income of thousand for the second quarter of in the third quarter  our comparable stores sales decreased by compared to the third quarter of total sales decreased compared to third quarter the decrease in sales for the third quarter was caused by an overall weakening of customer traffic  which we believe may have been caused in part by consumer uneasiness in response to the then soaring price levels for petroleum products 
our loss for the third quarter of was million compared to a net loss in the third quarter of of million 
the year ended with a decrease in comparable store sales in the fourth quarter  which included a increase in comparable store sales in the month of october 
total company sales decreased in the fourth quarter as compared to the fourth quarter of this decrease included a increase in total company sales for the month of october 
overall  the fourth quarter was negatively affected by the deepening financial crisis in the us and world economies 
falloff in consumer confidence led to a continued softening in store traffic and sales 
the resultant sales shortfall was offset to a certain extent by a slightly better margin rate  and by lower expenses in certain categories  notably general and administrative expenses and interest  as compared to for the quarter  our net income was million  compared to million in the fourth quarter of for the full fiscal year  our comparable stores sales decrease was which follows a increase for and a increase for our net loss for was million compared to net income of million in overview summary for in  the us economy entered into a recessionary period combined with a systematic lack of liquidity 
during the year  we saw the housing crisis deepen  the stock market decline dramatically  and unemployment rise steeply 
all of these factors contributed to a difficult retail environment 
many economists anticipate a difficult although we fared better than many of our competitors in  we have taken significant steps in response to the economic crisis 
we reviewed and revamped our headquarters and store expenses  which included reducing our headcount and decreasing our advertising and other administrative costs 
we expect to save up to million in expenses in from these actions 
in addition  we do not expect to open any additional stores in  unless we see an early recovery in the economy 
for the remainder of we will focus on maintaining maximum liquidity in anticipation of continued lower sales levels associated with anticipated continued weakness in consumer confidence and overall spending levels

in  our provision for income taxes was  which included  for federal alternative minimum taxes and  for state income taxes 
our provision for state taxes was less than the average statutory rate net of federal tax benefit because we were able to use state tax loss carryforwards to reduce state taxes payable 
those state tax loss carryforwards were fully exhausted in and were therefore not available to reduce state taxes payable in we were able to utilize approximately  of net operating loss carryforwards for federal income tax purposes in  which were fully reserved for in the prior year due to the uncertainty of future taxable income 
at the end of  we had estimated net operating loss carryforwards of approximately million  which begin to expire in in accordance with section of the internal revenue code  the use of these carryforwards may be subject to annual limitations based upon certain ownership changes of our stock that may have occurred or that may occur 
net income our net income in was  or per basic and diluted share  compared to net income of  or per basic and diluted share  in critical accounting policies our financial statements are based on the application of significant accounting policies  many of which require our management to make significant estimates and assumptions see note to our consolidated financial statements 
we believe the following accounting policies to be those most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and operating results and those that require the most subjective judgment 
if actual results differ significantly from management s estimates and projections  there could be a material effect on our financial statements 
inventory and related allowance for obsolete and excess inventory our inventory consists of party supplies and is valued at the lower of moving weighted average cost or market 
we record vendor rebates  discounts and certain other adjustments to inventory  including freight costs  and we recognize these amounts in the income statement as the related goods are sold 
during each interim reporting period  we estimate the impact on cost of products sold associated with inventory shortage 
the actual inventory shortage is determined upon reconciliation of the annual physical inventory  which occurs shortly before and after our year end  and an adjustment to cost of products sold is recorded at the end of the fourth quarter to recognize the difference between the estimated and actual inventory shortage for the full year 
the adjustment in the fourth quarter of included an estimated reduction of  to the cost of products sold during the previous three quarters 
the adjustment in the fourth quarter of included an estimated reduction of  to the cost of products sold during the previous three quarters 
the adjustment in the fourth quarter of included an estimated reduction of  to the cost of products sold during the previous three quarters 
we also make adjustments to reduce the value of our inventory for an allowance for obsolete and excess inventory  which is based on our review of inventories on hand compared to estimated future sales 
we conduct reviews periodically throughout the year on each stock keeping unit sku 
as we identify obsolete and excess inventory  we take immediate measures to reduce our inventory risk on these items and we adjust our allowance accordingly 
thus  actual results could differ from our estimates 
revenue recognition revenues include the selling price of party goods sold  net of returns and discounts  and are recognized at the point of sale 
we estimate returns based upon historical return rates and such amounts have not been significant 
property and equipment property and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and are depreciated on the straight line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets 
expenditures for maintenance and repairs are charged to operations as incurred 
intangible assets intangible assets consist primarily of the values of two non compete agreements acquired in conjunction with the purchase of retail stores in and  and the values of retail store leases acquired in those transactions 
the first non compete agreement  from party city corporation and its affiliates  covers massachusetts  maine  new hampshire  vermont  rhode island  and windsor and new london counties in connecticut  and expires in the second non compete agreement was acquired in connection with the company s purchase in january of two franchised party supply stores in lincoln and warwick  rhode island 
the acquired rhode island stores had been operated as party city franchise stores  and were converted to iparty stores immediately following the closing 
the second non compete agreement covers rhode island for five years from the date of closing and within a certain distance from the company s stores in the rest of new england for three years 
both non compete agreements have an estimated life of months and are subject to certain terms and conditions in their respective acquisition agreements 
the occupancy valuations related to acquired retail store leases are for stores in peabody  massachusetts estimated life of months  lincoln  rhode island estimated life of months and warwick  rhode island estimated life of months 
intangible assets also include legal and other transaction costs incurred related to the purchase of the peabody  lincoln and warwick stores 
non compete agreements are amortized based on the pattern of their expected cash flow benefits 
occupancy valuations are amortized over the terms of the related leases 
impairment of long lived assets in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  we perform a review of each store for impairment indicators whenever events and changes in circumstances suggest that the carrying amounts may not be recoverable from estimated future store cash flows 
our review considers store operating results  future sales growth and cash flows 
the conclusion regarding impairment may differ from current estimates if underlying assumptions or business strategies change 
on november   we closed our store in east providence  rhode island due to underperforming sales 
as a result of this closing  we recorded a charge of approximately  related to remaining lease payments and other closing costs during the year ended december  the term of the lease expired on august  at december   the accrual had been reduced to zero 
we closed two stores in early january  at the end of their lease terms 
no impairment charges were required for these stores  as the assets related to them have been fully amortized  except for immaterial amounts  and no liability existed for future lease costs 
we are not aware of any impairment indicators for any of our remaining stores at december  income taxes historically  we have not recognized an income tax benefit for our losses 
accordingly  we record a valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets because of the uncertainty of future taxable income and the realizability of the deferred tax assets 
in determining if a valuation allowance against our deferred tax asset is appropriate  we consider both positive and negative evidence 
the positive evidence that we considered included we were profitable in and  and were able to use a portion of our net operating loss carryforwards in those years and expect to do so in  we have achieved positive comparable store sales growth for six out of the last seven years and we had improved merchandise margins in the negative evidence that we considered included we realized a net loss in and  our merchandise margins decreased in  and  our future profitability is vulnerable to certain risks  including a the risk that we may not be able to generate significant taxable income to fully utilize our net operating loss carryforwards of approximately million at december   b the risk of unseasonable weather and other factors in a single geographic region  new england  where our stores are concentrated  c the risk of being so dependent upon a single season  halloween  for a significant amount of annual sales and profitability and d the risk of fluctuating prices for petroleum products  which are a key raw material for much of our merchandise and which affect our freight costs and those of our suppliers and affect our customers spending levels and patterns  the costs that opening or acquiring new stores will put pressure on our profit margins until these stores reach maturity  the expected costs of increased regulatory compliance  including  without limitation  those associated with section of the sarbanes oxley act  will likely have a negative impact on our profitability  the risk that a general or perceived slowdown in the u 
s economy  or uncertainty as to the economic outlook  which the us and world economies are experiencing  could reduce discretionary spending or cause a shift in consumer discretionary spending to other products 
the negative evidence is strong enough for us to conclude that the level of our future profitability is uncertain at this time 
we believe that it is prudent for us to maintain a valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets until we have a longer track record of profitability and we can reduce our exposure to the risks described above 
should we determine that we will be able to realize our deferred tax assets in the future  an adjustment to our deferred tax assets would increase income in the period we made such a determination 
stock option compensation expense on january   we adopted statement no 
r using the modified prospective method in which compensation cost is recognized beginning with the effective date a based on the requirements of statement no

use of estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period 
our actual results could differ from our estimates 
new accounting pronouncements in march  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
 disclosures about derivative instruments and hedging activities an amendment of fasb statement no 
sfas requires enhanced disclosures regarding derivative and hedging activities 
sfas will be effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years and interim periods beginning after november   with early adoption encouraged  or for us the fiscal year ending december  we do not expect the adoption of sfas no

that the purchase method of accounting be used for business combinations achieved through the transfer of consideration  and extends that requirement to business combinations that previously used the pooling of interests method of accounting  such as those achieved by contract alone or through the lapse of minority rights 
sfas r applies prospectively to business combinations with acquisition dates on or after the beginning of the first annual reporting period beginning on or after december   or for us the fiscal year ending december  we do not expect the adoption of sfas r to have a material effect on our financial statements 
liquidity and capital resources our primary uses of cash are purchases of inventory  including purchases under our supply agreement with amscan  as described more fully below  occupancy expenses of our stores  employee salaries  and new store openings  including acquisitions 
our primary sources of cash are cash from operating activities  and debt  including our line of credit and notes payable 
our prospective cash flows are subject to certain trends  events and uncertainties  including demands for capital to support growth  improve our infrastructure  respond to economic conditions  and meet contractual commitments 
based on our current operating plan  we believe that anticipated revenues from operations and borrowings available under our existing line of credit  which expires on january   will be sufficient to fund our operations  working capital requirements and capital expenditures through the next twelve months 
in the event that our operating plan changes due to changes in our strategic plans  lower than expected revenues  unanticipated expenses  increased competition  unfavorable economic conditions or other unforeseen circumstances  including the continued turmoil and tightening of the credit markets  and further weakening of consumer confidence and spending  our liquidity may be negatively impacted 
if so  we could be required to further adjust our expenditures for to conserve working capital or raise additional capital  possibly including debt or equity financing  to fund operations and our growth strategy and to refinance our outstanding debt 
the company is in the process of negotiating financing to extend or replace its existing line of credit  which expires on january   as discussed further below 
notes payable we currently have three notes payable outstanding with principal balances totaling  at december  we refer to the notes as the highbridge note  the amscan note and the party city note 
for a full description of these notes  we refer you to item in the notes to consolidated financial statements for the fiscal years ended december  and december  included in item of this annual report on form k 
the amscan note bears interest at the rate of per annum and is payable in thirty six equal monthly installments of principal and interest of  commencing on november   and on the first day of each month thereafter until october  the party city note  which has a principal amount of  is payable by quarterly interest only payments over four years  with the full principal amount due at the note s maturity on august  in september  we closed a financing transaction with an institutional accredited investor whereby we issued a three year million subordinated note the highbridge note that bears interest at an interest rate of prime plus one percent and a warrant the highbridge warrant exercisable for  shares of our common stock at an exercise price of per share  or of the closing price of our common stock on the day immediately prior to the closing of the transaction 
the highbridge note matures on september  the agreements entered into in connection with the financing provide for certain restrictions and covenants consistent with highbridge s status as a subordinated lender  and also grant highbridge resale registration rights with respect to the shares of common stock underlying the highbridge warrant 
the issuance of the highbridge warrant triggered certain anti dilution provisions of our series b  c  and d convertible preferred stock 
we expect to pay off the highbridge note from the availability under our bank line of credit and available cash flow 
if we are unable to use our bank line of credit or available cash flow to pay off the highbridge note when due  or if there is a material increase in the cost to do so  we would need to secure alternative financing  which may not be available on commercially reasonable terms or at all  and could result in a materially adverse effect on our results of operations and financial position 
we are in preliminary discussion with wells fargo to extend our bank line of credit beyond its current expiration date of january  three months after the highbridge note becomes due and payable 
while we expect to extend the bank line of credit with wells fargo or another lender  given the state of the economy  we expect that the borrowing margins will increase and the terms of the loan will be more stringent 
if the terms are less favorable than the existing line  our results of operations and liquidity may be adversely affected 
line of credit we have a line of credit the line with wells fargo  which expires on january  the maximum loan amount available under the line of credit with wells fargo is  which may be increased up to a maximum level of million  upon days written notice  as long as we are in compliance with all debt covenants and the other provisions of the loan agreement 
the agreement permits us  at our option  to use the london interbank offered rate libor for certain of our borrowings rather than the bank s base rate 
borrowings under our line of credit are secured by our inventory and accounts receivable 
we borrow against these assets at agreed upon advance rates  which vary at different times of the year 
our inventory consists of party supplies which are valued at the lower of weighted average cost or market and are reduced by an allowance for obsolete and excess inventory and are further reduced or increased by other adjustments  including vendor rebates and discounts and freight costs 
our line of credit availability calculation allows us to borrow against acceptable inventory at cost  which is based on our inventory at cost and applies adjustments that our lender has approved  which may be different than adjustments we use for valuing our inventory in our financial statements  such as the adjustment to reserve for inventory shortage 
the amount of acceptable inventory at cost was approximately  at december  our accounts receivable consist primarily of credit card receivables and vendor rebate receivables 
our line of credit availability calculation allows us to borrow against eligible credit card receivables  which are the credit card receivables for the previous two to three days of business 
the amount of eligible credit card receivables was approximately  at december  our total borrowing base is determined by adding the acceptable inventory at cost times an agreed upon advance rate plus the eligible credit card receivables times an agreed upon advance rate but not to exceed our established credit limit  which was  at december  under the terms of our line of credit  our  credit limit was further reduced by a minimum availability block  customer deposits  gift certificates  merchandise credits and outstanding letters of credit 
the amounts outstanding under our line were  at december  and  as of december   a decrease of  our additional availability was  at december  and  at december  the decrease in the amount outstanding under our line of credit was due primarily to net payments on the line from cash provided by operating activities 
the outstanding balances under our line are classified as current liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets since we are required to apply daily lock box receipts to reduce the amount outstanding 
our line of credit includes a number of covenants  including a financial covenant requiring us to maintain a minimum availability under the line of of the credit limit 
the agreement also has a covenant that requires us to limit our capital expenditures to within of those amounts included in our business plan  which may be updated from time to time 
at december   we were in compliance with these financial covenants 
on january   we amended our line to allow for a  term loan  which increased our borrowing base  but was contained within the million credit limit 
the interest rate on the term loan was the bank s prime rate plus basis points 
during the time the term loan remained outstanding  the interest rate on the line of credit was the bank s base rate plus basis points 
the term loan had an amended maturity date of october  we repaid the term loan on march  supply agreement with amscan our supply agreement with amscan gives us the right to receive certain additional rebates and more favorable pricing terms over the term of the agreement than generally were available to us under our previous terms with amscan 
the right to receive additional rebates  and the amount of such rebates  are subject to our achievement of increased levels of purchases and other factors provided for in the supply agreement 
in exchange  the supply agreement obligates us to purchase increased levels of merchandise from amscan until the supply agreement provided for a ramp up period during and and  for five years beginning with calendar year  requires us to purchase on an annual basis merchandise equal to the total number of our stores open during such calendar year  multiplied by  the supply agreement provides for penalties in the event we fail to attain the annual purchase commitment that would require us to pay to amscan the difference between the purchases for that year and the annual purchase commitment for that year 
under the terms of the supply agreement  the annual purchase commitment for any individual year can be reduced for orders placed by the company but not filled by the supplier 
during  the supplier experienced difficulty in fulfilling certain of our orders sourced out of china 
accordingly  the supplier agreed to reduce the company s purchase commitment for to of the contractual minimum for that year 
the company s purchases for exceeded the minimum purchase amount commitments  as adjusted  under the supply agreement 
although we do not expect to incur any penalties under this supply agreement  if they were to occur  there could be a material adverse effect on our uses and sources of cash 
operating  investing and financing activities our operating activities provided  in compared to use of  in  an increase of  the increase in cash provided by operating activities was primarily due to lower inventory purchases during as compared to  as well as lower prepaid expenses at the end of compared to the end of we used  in investing activities in compared to  in  an increase of  the cash invested in was primarily due to the acquisition in january of two retail stores located in rhode island and the related non compete agreement see discussion below 
the cash invested in was primarily due to fixture and equipment improvements in our existing retail stores  plus the implementation of a new human resource information and payroll system 
our financing activities used  in compared to providing  in  an increase of  the increase was primarily related to decreased borrowings on our line of credit in as compared to as mentioned above  on january   we completed the purchase of two franchised party city corporation retail stores in lincoln  rhode island and warwick  rhode island 
the aggregate consideration for the assets purchased and related non competition covenants was  plus approximately  for associated inventory  paid in cash at closing  on terms and conditions specified in the particular asset purchase agreement 
funding for the purchase was obtained from our existing line of credit with wells fargo 
contractual obligations contractual obligations at december  were as follows payments due by period within within within after year years years years total line of credit capital lease obligations notes payable supply agreement operating leases including retail space leases total contractual obligations in addition  at december   we had outstanding purchase orders totaling approximately  for the acquisition of inventory and non inventory items that were scheduled for delivery after december  acquisitions we operate in a largely un branded market that has many small businesses 
as a result  we have considered  and may continue to consider  growing our business through acquisitions of other entities 
any determination to make an acquisition will be based upon a variety of factors  including  without limitation  the purchase price and other financial terms of the transaction  the business prospects  geographical location and the extent to which any acquisition would enhance our prospects 
given the current state of the economy and our focus on maintaining maximum liquidity  we do not expect to acquire any new stores in unless we see an early recovery in the economy 
on january   we completed the purchase of the two stores 
the aggregate consideration paid was  plus approximately  for associated inventory 
the stores were converted into iparty stores immediately following the closing of the transaction 
we did not complete any other acquisitions in  although we opened two temporary halloween stores during the fourth quarter of the year 
stockholder rights plan on november   we announced that our board of directors adopted a stockholder rights plan the rights plan 
under the rights plan each share of our capital stock outstanding at the close of business on november  and each share of our capital stock issued subsequent to that date has a right associated with it  such that each share of our common stock is entitled to one right and each share of our preferred stock is entitled to such number of rights equal to the number of common shares into which it is convertible 
the rights will become exercisable only in the event that  with certain exceptions  an acquiring party accumulates percent or more of our voting stock or if a party announces an offer to acquire percent or more of our voting stock
