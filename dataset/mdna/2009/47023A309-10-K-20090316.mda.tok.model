item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
revitalization objectives and strategy the company is in the midst of an effort to revitalize itself for future growth and long term stockholder value 
in fiscal  we experienced significant changes in our executive management team  including the departure of our chief executive officer  chief financial officer  chief marketing and brand officer  senior vice president of operations  and senior vice president of development 
we have a new chief executive officer and have internally promoted other members of the executive team and increased their responsibilities 
the company has set out in a new direction to develop and evolve the jamba brand and implement new business strategies that we believe will have a positive financial impact 
the strategic priorities for fiscal include building a customer first operationally focused service culture  building a retail food capability across all four day parts breakfast  lunch  afternoon  and dinner  accelerating the development of franchise and non traditional stores  building a consumer products growth platform  and continuing to implement a disciplined expense reduction plan 
these strategic priorities support the company s mission to continue to grow and develop jamba as a premier healthy living brand offering consumers compelling and differentiated products and experiences at jamba juice stores and other retail distribution channels 
key to our success is the jamba culture  a unique set of core values and actions that manifest themselves in employees executing at the highest levels while expressing their passion for the brand 
building a customer first operationally focused service culture a major aspect of our revitalization plan is to improve the level and consistency of customer service at our stores 
over the last few years  the administrative tasks required by the general managers at our stores had increased so that the general manager was not sufficiently promoting the interaction between our team members and the customers that lead to a positive experience and reinforcement of our brand promise by encouraging a healthy  active lifestyle 
we have recently reduced the number of these administrative tasks with the goal of 
table of contents having the general manager spend more time building  and working with other team members to build  a powerful relationship with customers based on quality  trust and integrity 
we have also introduced new initiatives to help attract  hire  and retain quality customer service oriented people who exhibit our culture and values 
we are also upgrading our training of team members so that they can more effectively deliver a high quality customer experience 
we also provide team members with financial incentives and opportunities for advancement when they fulfill service expectations 
customer satisfaction is critically important to us 
to that end  we recently instituted a mystery shopper program to measure the customer experience 
we believe delivering high quality customer service will differentiate us in the marketplace and drive long term customer loyalty 
we seek for team members to enthusiastically greet customers upon entering the store and efficiently deliver their order in a timely manner 
with a highly customized product  operational efficiency is vital to achieving high levels of throughput 
our team members are trained to not only deliver the customers orders quickly  but also to transfer the fun and energy they gain from working at jamba juice to the customers 
a related aspect of customer service is reinforcement of the vibrant and fun store environment  which we believe offers the company a competitive advantage 
we plan to embark on a refresh program with select older company stores  primarily through new paint schemes and interior finishes 
as part of the refresh program we also intend to incorporate aspects of our new store prototype  which supports our brand environment goals and provides a more customer friendly experience 
we also plan on testing self service kiosks to provide customers with easier access to nutritional information and for ordering so as to improve speed of service and optimize labor 
we plan to explore other technologies to enhance the ordering process as well 
building a retail food capability across all four day parts breakfast  lunch  afternoon and dinner menu overview we currently provide a range of freshly blended beverages  baked goods and snacks in our stores 
our menu items are designed to strengthen the relationship with our customers by offering products that are relevant to individuals striving for a healthy lifestyle 
product innovation is a high priority and our research and development team  composed of food scientists  nutritionists and culinary experts  is continually developing and testing new and improved menu items that support the integrity of the jamba brand and our commitment to offering great tasting products made from simple high quality ingredients 
in fiscal  to help establish our food capability program  we rolled out several new products on a system wide basis  including a new breakfast menu comprised of nutritionally balanced yogurt blends  smoothies  food and juices 
in january  we completed the system wide rollout of steel cut hot oatmeal with fruit as another step in establishing our food capability program 
in fiscal  we also tested other food products  including wraps  sandwiches and salads in selected stores 
these new products are designed to feature healthy  on the go food items to attract new customers  increase the frequency of current customer visits  create a point of differentiation  and provide a more complete meal solution for our customers across all day parts 
we plan to grow our food capability program in fiscal the purpose of growing our food capability program is to broaden the appeal of our offering to current customers who often purchase a smoothie and then go elsewhere for a food item in addition to bringing in new customers looking for a more complete meal solution 
in addition  we believe there is consumer demand for healthy on the go food items that is not being fulfilled by other quick service restaurants  especially those serving burgers and fries 
our goal is for jamba to be the leader in the healthy quick service restaurant segment 
beverages our blended beverages are available in three sizes  sixteen  original and power 

table of contents fresh squeezed juices and juicies we offer a line up of fresh squeezed juices  including orange juice  carrot juice  and juice combinations such as orange carrot banana and orange mango passion

our current line up of baked goods includes reduced fat blueberry lemon loaf  reduced fat cranberry orange loaf  zucchini walnut loaf and oatcakes 
each of these items is made only with natural ingredients and offers customers a complement to jamba smoothies and juices 
jamba merchandise most of our stores carry a limited supply of related merchandise  including books and smallwares 
this is not a core component of revenue but contributes to the overall store experience 

table of contents our research and development team continually seeks to enhance the product offerings available to customers  and where possible  reduce product and labor costs 
our research and development process includes both the development of new products and the optimization of the menu to ensure only the most appealing products are offered to customers 
as new products are introduced to the menu  usage occasions increase and positive word of mouth is spread 
we are passionate about creating fresh new products that meet an even greater variety of customer needs 
we pride ourselves on listening carefully to customer feedback 
we continue to devote significant resources to our research and development team in an effort to build upon recent new product successes and take our product innovation abilities to the next level 
this combination of optimizing existing products and expanding our menu with offerings that are relevant to our customers needs provides increased opportunities for both increased frequency and increased average check 
while there is no certainty that product development efforts will lead to the introduction and success of new product offerings as well as a potential increase in operating margins  we will continue to use these resources to try to develop fresh concepts that appeal to customers at any time of day and in any weather or season 
accelerating the development of franchise and non traditional stores jamba juice stores a primary goal of the company is to build accessibility  meaning making it easier for customers to experience jamba 
one way to increase accessibility is to expand the number of jamba juice stores 
the goal of building accessibility is increasing frequency and  as a result  comparable store sales and average unit volumes 
at the same time  we understand that the foundation for growth lies in strong store level economics 
accordingly  part of our growth strategy is to ensure that we  and our franchisees  achieve target metrics in terms of average unit volume  store level cash flow  store level cash flow margin  net cost per unit and cash on cash returns 
we believe we have significant market expansion opportunities both nationally and internationally 
our research and planning have shown that there is potential for at least  additional jamba juice stores in the united states which we believe could be profitable and would meet our new store opening criteria 
we have grown our concept and brand through company owned and operated stores company stores and franchise store locations franchise stores 
as of december   there were jamba juice locations consisting of company stores and franchise stores operating in states and the bahamas 
except for the single bahamas franchise location we have no other international locations 
of the locations  stores are located in california  of which are company stores 
we lease the real estate for all of our company stores 
we generally characterize our stores as either traditional or non traditional locations 
traditional locations are characterized as a business premise that exists primarily as a jamba juice store 
traditional stores currently average approximately  square feet in size and are designed to be fun  friendly  energetic and colorful to represent the active  healthy lifestyle that we promote 
these stores are located either in major urban centers or in suburban strip mall centers 
as of december   there were traditional jamba juice store locations 
non traditional locations are characterized as a jamba juice store located within another primary business in conjunction with other businesses or at institutional settings such as colleges and universities  schools  shopping malls  supermarkets and airports 
a captive audience is a common characteristic of non traditional locations 
we believe one benefit of the development of non traditional stores is to generate awareness to complement the traditional stores in the area 
as of december   there were non traditional jamba juice store locations 
all jamba juice stores are designed to provide a highly interactive jamba experience to build our customer relationship  including the enticing aroma of fresh fruit  vegetables and wheatgrass  the high energy sounds of 
table of contents whirring blenders and team members calling out greetings 
the construction and color scheme employed at the jamba juice stores provide a bright and cheerful marketplace theme with colors that embody our commitment to fresh and healthy juices  smoothies and other energizing products 
additionally  stores focus on the theater aspect of smoothie making by providing an environment in which all food preparation is conducted behind glass and in the open for customers to watch as the juices and smoothies are made 
the layout offers a casual bar type atmosphere using interior stools and exterior tables and chairs 
glass cases display baked goods  and shelving in front of cash registers allow for the sale of baked goods and prepackaged healthy snack items 
we have lowered the typical costs to construct a traditional jamba juice store from an average of  in to approximately  today  depending upon location 
this cost reduction was accomplished through reducing our real estate footprint from an average of sq 
ft 
to sq 
ft  aggressive competitive biding with our general contractor pool to reduce leasehold improvement costs  aggressive competitive biding for our furniture and fixtures package  value engineering  and innovative equipment and physical layouts to help reduce operational costs 
we believe reducing a traditional store s build out costs will help attract franchisees by providing a higher return on investment as franchisees are obligated to finance their own build out costs according to our specifications 
we have also developed plans for different jamba juice store configurations and smoothie only product offerings for non traditional locations in order to help reduce construction and operating costs and improve our flexibility in locating jamba juice stores in sites with alternative configurations 
growth strategy until the third quarter of fiscal  our growth strategy had been focused on company stores 
for fiscal  we opened new company stores  closed company stores and acquired franchise stores located in florida by means of acquiring the remaining joint venture interest we previously owned a interest in a franchisee jjc florida llc 
franchisees opened franchise stores  closed franchise stores and  through the sale of the joint venture interest noted above  sold franchise stores to the company 
we believe that our aggressive company store development in an adverse economy in fiscal and in the prior year in fiscal  which included opening new company stores  exacerbated our negative financial results 
our current growth strategy is to transition from a company store model to a model more evenly weighted between company stores and franchise stores 
we anticipate minimal company store development in fiscal we anticipate that growth in fiscal will be accomplished through the development of franchise stores  with a particular emphasis on non traditional locations 
we believe this franchise strategy will better position us for growth in market share  reduce capital outlays  provide better overall margins  allow us to open more stores faster  increase our brand presence  and increase customer frequency 
as part of this growth strategy  we are selectively re franchising company stores primarily in mixed markets where we have both company stores and franchise stores 
we also will refranchise in geographic areas where there are all company stores in order to achieve operational efficiencies 
we also continue to explore possible future international development opportunities  which will primarily be through area development or joint venture agreements with third parties 
in recognition of our expanding franchise program  in fiscal we established a franchise advisory counsel fac 
the fac formalizes a channel of communications through a representative group of franchisees to provide advice  counsel and input to us on important issues impacting the business 
franchise stores our franchising program is currently conducted via i traditional store venues such as single store franchises to a franchisee  ii franchises granted for non traditional store venues and iii exclusive multi unit 
table of contents license agreements in which the franchisee develops and operates a specified number of stores within a specified period of time within a specified geographic area  which we call area development agreements 
our current traditional store franchise agreement provides for a year term 
the agreement is renewable for additional consecutive year terms  subject to various conditions and state law 
the royalty rate in the current franchise agreement is of revenue for traditional store locations  with franchisees required to contribute up to an additional of revenue to a company administered marketing fund 
at the present time  in general  we are charging to of revenue as the marketing contribution for our traditional store franchisees 
there is typically up to a two mile geographic radius restriction for traditional stores in non downtown areas 
the royalty rates and marketing contributions for non traditional stores vary depending upon type airport  college or university or supermarket 
franchisees typically pay an initial fee ranging from  for non traditional store locations to  for traditional store locations 
except in connection with the re franchising of company stores  we do not currently provide financing to our franchisees 
however  given current market conditions  we may consider financing  joint venture or other arrangements in the future 
area development agreements as of december   we had two multi unit area developers who have the right to develop additional franchise stores pursuant to multi unit license agreements 
the exclusive territories covered by these two multi unit area license agreements are i the hawaiian islands and ii parts of texas  kansas and missouri 
generally  a franchise agreement is entered into with each area developer with regard to each store opened under a multi unit license agreement 
these franchise agreements are generally the same as those entered into with franchisees who are not area developers 
even after a multi unit license agreement expires or is terminated  the area developer continues to operate the opened stores under each store s respective franchise agreement  including in most cases  its contractually provided exclusive geographic radius restriction  which is typically one mile 
as of december   there were stores operating under the two current multi unit license agreements 
as of december   one of the two multi unit area developers had contractual commitments to open new franchise stores in their respective territories 
specifically  as of december   the area developer in parts of texas  kansas and missouri must open more new stores by may   the expiration date of this multi unit license agreement 
multi unit area development agreements can be deemed to be null and void if the terms of the agreement are not fulfilled 
although the multi unit developer for the hawaiian islands has satisfied its contractual commitment to open new franchise stores  it still has the exclusive right to open additional new stores through the expiration of its multi unit license agreement on june  under typical multi unit license agreements  the area developer generally pays one half of the  initial fee  or  for each store required to be developed upon execution of the multi unit development agreement as a development fee 
area developers are obligated to finance their own build out of each store location according to our specifications 
notwithstanding the exclusive territorial rights of the two multi unit area developers  we retain the right to franchise non traditional stores 
as of december   we have an agreement with safeway  inc for the opening of up to franchise stores within its grocery stores  of which all were open 
we also continue to strengthen our relationships with food and beverage concessionaires operating at non traditional venues such as schools  airports  and other retail and entertainment venues to help maximize our non traditional franchise development 

table of contents market planning and site selection process our market planning and site selection process is integral to the successful execution of our growth strategy 
we have processes for identifying  analyzing  and assigning undeveloped markets for either company store or franchise store development 
once a market is selected  we carefully screen trade areas for demand based on demographic  psychographic and jamba juice specific variables to assess the risk of developing a store 
we select trade areas that meet our guidelines for new store development and begin the site selection process 
once a trade area is selected  we carefully screen prospective locations for visibility  traffic patterns  ease of use and co tenancy for potential company store and franchise store locations 
our expansion strategy involves using this market planning and site selection process to leverage areas of demand within each market 
we use this approach to cluster stores in specific geographic areas of demand  which will drive brand awareness  improve operating and marketing efficiencies while leveraging the costs associated with regional supervision 
distribution efficiencies are also captured through this strategy 
in addition  we believe our ability to hire qualified team members is enhanced in markets where we are well known 
building a consumer products growth platform we believe there is untapped potential to extend the jamba brand into the retail market 
in december  we announced that nestl usa had entered into a worldwide license agreement for the manufacturing  marketing and distribution of jamba ready to drink beverages 
in may  nestl launched a jamba ready to drink product line including six skus three jamba smoothies  named strawberries wild w energy boost  orange dream machine w immunity  banana berry w heart healthy boost  and  three jamba juicies named orange strawberry banana w protein boost  mango orange peach w fiber boost and very berry w calcium boost 
the jamba smoothies and jamba juicies were available in major grocery retailers and convenience stores in eight western states california  oregon  utah  nevada  arizona  idaho  washington and colorado 
in december  nestl voluntarily suspended production and shipments of the jamba ready to drink beverages due to production issues 
we believe nestl is fully committed to re launching a jamba ready to drink beverage proposition 
we continue to have discussions with potential partners regarding fruit teas  fruit yogurt and parfaits  frozen smoothie bars and sorbets  breakfast and energy bars and packaged boosts 
our goal is to extend our product offerings outside of our jamba juice stores to not only generate revenue  but also to expand the brand accessibility and product usage occasions available to consumers 
to support and optimize this extension  we intend to structure these partnership relationships in various ways  such as  for example  licensing agreements  joint venture agreements  co packing agreements  and sales and distribution agreements 
continuing to implement a disciplined expense reduction plan this strategic priority involves all aspects of the organization to improve store level profitability and returns 
the plan is focused on a number of initiatives  including reductions in costs of goods sold  labor savings from operational simplification  improved wage and benefit management  the implementation of a labor planning system  rent and occupancy savings  improved management of controllable costs related to better cost controls and processes and the negotiation of service contracts and more effective and efficient brand communication 
we expect our general and administrative expenses to continue to decrease as we implement the strategic initiatives described above and continue to improve our processes and systems 
company store operations store management our operations team is the foundation for our performance and vital to long term growth 
we recruit and retain leaders with broad experience in management and our industry 

table of contents we support our store operations with a combination of regional directors of operations  area district managers instituted in fiscal and district managers 
our typical store operations team consists of a combination of an area general manager instituted in fiscal or general manager at each store  two to four shift managers and approximately twenty front line team members 
maintaining our corporate culture is essential as we continue to expand  and we believe that it is critical to developing our brand and ensuring our continued success 
we believe team members are the key to our success and that our culture fosters personal interaction  mutual respect  trust  empowerment  enthusiasm and commitment 
training we conduct various training programs for team members  support center staff and our leadership team 
we are dedicated to providing a meaningful experience for all team members  with ample opportunity to develop leadership skills as they move up through the organization 
our training programs include formal programs such as the manager in training programs for new managers and the more informal one on one discussions held between general managers  district managers and regional directors of operations 
in fiscal  we are also instituting a more robust online training program 
the goal of all the programs is to shorten the learning curve while creating greater confidence in order to achieve success through strong performance and results 
recruiting and retention we carefully screen potential team members to ensure that they hold many of our core values and fit into our culture 
by placing an emphasis on our mission statement and values  and encouraging responsibility and accountability at every level  we believe that it has created a sense of team member loyalty and an open and interactive work environment  resulting in a highly passionate workforce 
team members are paid competitive wages and are offered opportunities for advancement 
in addition to competitive wages  store managers are eligible for performance based bonuses and retention bonuses 
advertising and marketing our marketing strategy focuses on communicating the benefits of the products and the brand s values through many creative and non traditional avenues 
marketing efforts are concentrated on store locations to build memorable experiences that will generate positive word of mouth 
as we enter new markets we must communicate the jamba juice story  the benefits of our products and our usage occasions 
emotional connections are developed as the messages are delivered consistently and with a freshness that appeals to consumers 
in fiscal  we also refocused our marketing strategy on a local basis on what we term owning the two mile radius around our stores 
one part of this effort is capitalizing on off premises sales as an opportunity to reach new customers 
off premises sales called go go s involve bringing jamba products to sell at an event such as school  community or sporting events 
these opportunities also reinforce our strong commitment to our communities 
a second part of this effort is the additional empowerment and compensation incentives we have instituted at the store level to incentivize sales generation activities 
a third part of this effort is the addition of fundraising opportunities for non profit organizations 
we believe our healthy menu offering combined with an attractive fundraising component is a very attractive choice for non profit organizations during this challenging economic environment 
we also believe we benefit from national media attention  providing us a significant competitive advantage 
historically  we have not engaged in any mass media marketing programs  relying instead on word of mouth  trade area marketing and in store promotions to increase customer awareness 
nevertheless  we have been 
table of contents featured in stories appearing in the wall street journal and a host of local newspapers and magazines 
we have also been featured in television shows and feature films 
our fundraising events also capture a significant amount of coverage from local television stations 
in addition to the company s marketing efforts  franchisees also contribute to the development and deployment of system wide marketing programs 
franchisees also spend to market the company s brand in their local market area 
furthermore  in fiscal  we plan to enhance our online  community and social networking initiatives to drive new customer trials and foster better ongoing communication with our customers 
product supply we are committed to providing only the finest smoothies  juices and other food products 
smoothie and juice products depend heavily upon supplies of fresh and individually quick frozen iqf fruit 
the quality of each smoothie depends to a large degree on the quality of the basic fruit ingredients from which it is made 
it is therefore essential that the supply of fruit is of the highest quality and is consistent throughout the year 
to achieve these dual goals we purchase our projected requirements for the coming year of a given type of fruit from suppliers at the height of the season for that particular fruit 
the supply and price of fresh and iqf fruit are dependent upon the supply and demand at the time of purchase and are subject to significant volatility 
supply and price can be affected by multiple factors in the producing regions  including weather  natural disasters and regional political and economic conditions 
in addition  as we continue to grow  we will likely become more dependent upon global fruit supplies than we have in the past  which may result in natural disasters and global political and economic conditions having a greater effect on the supply and price of our fruit ingredients and our profitability 
we use the highest quality fruit in our products 
we conduct quality assurance testing at the time of packing to ensure that the fruit meets our high standards  which meets or exceeds usda grade a standards 
the fruit is then flash frozen and stored by the supplier s for shipment to distributors throughout the year 
we contract with independent distribution companies to distribute products to the stores 
the length of these contracts varies in duration 
given the density of stores in california  the costs of goods sold in california is lower than other regions of the country 
we believe that by clustering future store development we can begin to lower distribution costs  and therefore reduce cost of goods sold  in non california markets 
southwest traders  inc is a distributor of proprietary products to our company stores and franchise stores 
southwest traders distributed ingredients that made up approximately of cost of sales for jamba juice company s fiscal southwest traders does not manufacture or negotiate pricing agreements for products sold in our stores 
they serve solely in a warehousing and distribution capacity and receive a fixed mark up per case on the independently negotiated cost of our ingredients 
our contract does provide that during the term we will use southwest traders as our exclusive distributor within certain territorial boundaries provided they meet required service levels 
the contract is firm through december  and is not subject to cancellation unless either party defaults within the contract due to non performance 
all of our nutritional supplements ie  boosts  pretzels and baked goods are produced to very defined specifications 
all products are shipped directly to stores using outside distributors 
we do not maintain central warehousing facilities 
competition the beverage industry is highly competitive and fragmented 
restaurants compete based on a number of factors  including quality  price value relationships  customer service  name recognition  employee hiring and retention and location 
we compete with a variety of purveyors of quick  convenient food and beverage products  
table of contents including quick service restaurants  coffee shops  donut shops and grocery stores 
while competition in the beverage market is fragmented  competition is increasing  and a major competitor with substantially greater resources than the company could enter the market at any time and compete directly against jamba juice stores 
we compete most directly with regional smoothie stores  most of which are franchises of other smoothie brands 
additionally  the rising popularity of convenient and healthy food items may result in increased competition from traditionally non smoothie retailers as they increase their offerings of smoothies and other juice related products 
in addition  we also face intense competition from both restaurants and other specialty retailers for suitable sites for new stores and qualified personnel to operate both new and existing stores 
there can be no assurance that the company or franchisees will be able to continue to secure adequate sites at acceptable rent levels or that the company or franchisees will be able to attract a sufficient number of qualified personnel 
government regulation and environmental matters government regulation 
we are subject to extensive and varied federal  state and local government regulation  including regulations relating to public health and safety and zoning codes 
we operate each of our stores in accordance with standards and procedures designed to comply with applicable codes and regulations 
however  if we could not obtain or retain food or other licenses  it would adversely affect our operations 
although we have not experienced  and do not anticipate  any significant difficulties  delays or failures in obtaining required licenses  permits or approvals  any such problem could delay or prevent the opening of  or adversely impact the viability of  a particular store or group of stores 
california and other states and local jurisdictions have enacted laws  rules  regulations and ordinances which may apply to the operation of a company store  including those which a establish general standards  specifications and requirements for the construction  design and maintenance of the store premises  b regulate matters affecting the health  safety and welfare of our customers  such as general health and sanitation requirements for restaurants  employee practices concerning the storage  handling  cooking and preparation of food  special health  food service and licensing requirements  restrictions on smoking  exposure to tobacco smoke or other carcinogens or reproductive toxicants and saccharin  availability of and requirements for public accommodations  including restrooms  c set standards pertaining to employee health and safety  d set standards and requirements for fire safety and general emergency preparedness  e regulate the proper use  storage and disposal of waste  insecticides and other hazardous materials  f establish general requirements or restrictions on advertising containing false or misleading claims  or health and nutrient claims on menus or otherwise  such as low calorie or fat free  and g establish requirements concerning withholdings and employee reporting of taxes on tips 
in order to develop and construct more stores  we or our franchisees need to comply with applicable zoning  land use and environmental regulations 
federal and state environmental regulations have not had a material effect on our operations to date  but more stringent and varied requirements of local governmental bodies with respect to zoning  land use and environmental factors could delay or even prevent construction and increase development costs for new stores 
we and our franchisees are also required to comply with the accessibility standards mandated by the us americans with disabilities act  which generally prohibits discrimination in accommodation or employment based on disability 
we may  in the future  have to modify stores  for example  by adding access ramps or redesigning certain architectural fixtures  to provide service to or make reasonable accommodations for disabled persons 
while these expenses could be material  our current expectation is that any such action will not require us to expend substantial funds 
we are subject to the us fair labor standards act  the us immigration reform and control act of and various federal and state laws governing various matters including minimum wages  overtime and other working conditions 
we pay a significant number of our hourly staff at rates consistent with but higher than the 
table of contents applicable federal or state minimum wage 
accordingly  increases in the minimum wage would increase our labor cost 
we are also subject to various laws and regulations relating to our current and any future franchise operations 
see risk factors governmental regulation may adversely affect our ability to open new stores or otherwise adversely affect our existing and future operations and results 
we are also subject to various federal and state laws that regulate the offer and sale of franchises and aspects of the licensor licensee relationships 
many state franchise laws impose restrictions on the franchise agreement  including the duration and scope of non competition provisions  the ability of a franchisor to terminate or refuse to renew and the ability of a franchisor to designate sources of supply 
the federal trade commission  or the ftc  and some state laws also require that the franchisor furnish to prospective franchisees a franchise disclosure document that contains prescribed information and  in some instances  require the franchisor to register the franchise offering 
environmental matters 
we are subject to federal  state and local environmental laws and regulations concerning the discharge  storage  handling  release and disposal of hazardous or toxic substances 
these environmental laws provide for significant fines  penalties and liabilities  sometimes without regard to whether the owner or operator of the property knew of  or was responsible for  the release or presence of the hazardous or toxic substances 
third parties may also make claims against owners or operators of properties for personal injuries and property damage associated with releases of  or actual or alleged exposure to  such substances 
we cannot predict what environmental laws will be enacted in the future  how existing or future environmental laws will be administered or interpreted or the amount of future expenditures that we may need to make to comply with  or to satisfy claims relating to  environmental laws 
while  during the period of their ownership  lease or operation  our stores have not been the subject to any material environmental matters  we have not conducted a comprehensive environmental review of our properties or operations 
we have not conducted investigations of our properties to identify contamination caused by third party operations  in such instances  the contamination must be addressed by the third party 
if the relevant third party does not or has not addressed the identified contamination properly or completely  then under certain environmental laws  we could be held liable as an owner and operator to address any remaining contamination 
any such liability could be material 
further  we may not have identified all of the potential environmental liabilities at our properties  and any such liabilities could have a material adverse effect on our operations or results of operations 
trademarks and domain names the company owns and or has applied to register numerous trademarks and service marks in the united states and additional countries throughout the world 
rights to the trademarks and service marks in the united states are generally held by a wholly owned affiliate of the company and are used by the company under license 
some of the company s trademarks  including jamba juice and the jamba logo are of material importance to the company 
the duration of trademark registrations varies from country to country 
however  trademarks are generally valid and may be renewed indefinitely as long as they are in use and or their registrations are properly maintained 
in addition  the company has registered and maintains numerous internet domain names  including jamba 
com and jambajuice 
com 
management information systems each company store has computerized point of sale registers which collect transaction data used to generate pertinent information  including sales transactions and product mix 
additionally  the point of sale system is used to authorize  batch and transmit credit card data 
all product prices are programmed into the point of sale register from the company s corporate office 
franchise stores generally use the same point of sale registers as company stores  but may elect to use alternative systems provided certain information is provided to the company 
franchisees set their own menu prices 
company stores use the company s licensed labor scheduling and food cost management software to record employee time clock information  schedule labor  improve inventory management and provide management reports 

table of contents while we believe the current point of sale register system is adequate to support our expansion needs  we do intend to institute certain upgrades to the platform in fiscal seasonality our business is subject to day to day volatility based on weather and varies by season 
a significant portion of the company s revenue is realized during the second and third quarters of the fiscal year  which include the summer months

risk factors set forth below and elsewhere in this report and in other documents we file with the sec are descriptions of the risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual results to differ materially from the results contemplated by the forward looking statements contained in this report 
risks related to our business we may not be successful in implementing our strategic priorities  which may have a material adverse impact on our business and financial results 
in  we defined strategic priorities we believe necessary to revitalize the company for future growth and long term stockholder value  including building a customer first operationally focused service culture  building a retail food capability across all four day parts breakfast  lunch  afternoon  and dinner  accelerating the development of franchise and non traditional store  building a consumer products growth platform  and continuing to implement a disciplined expense reduction plan 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully implement these strategic priorities or whether these strategic priorities will be successful  either of which will impede our growth and operating results 
the failure to control our cost and expense structure could have a material adverse impact on our profitability and earnings 
as part of our revitalization efforts  we have been able to reduce both our store level expenses and our general and administrative expense 
however  we will need to continue to control our costs and expenses as we focus on our strategic priorities 
any unplanned increases in store costs  marketing expenditures  or general and administrative expenses could delay us from achieving sustained profitability or otherwise have a material adverse impact on our operating results and profitability 
see financing and liquidity risks below 
a worsening of economic conditions  a decrease in consumer spending  or a change in the competitive conditions in this market may substantially decrease our revenues and may adversely impact our ability to implement our business strategy 
our success depends to a significant extent on discretionary consumer spending  which is influenced by general economic conditions and the availability of discretionary income 
in  we saw many consumers facing steep mortgage payments  tightening credit and rising energy and food prices  which adversely affected consumer spending 
accordingly  we may experience continuing declines in revenue during economic turmoil or during periods of uncertainty 
any material decline in the amount of discretionary spending  leading cost conscious consumers to be more selective in restaurants visited  could have a material adverse effect on our revenue  results of operations  business and financial condition 

table of contents we must successfully gauge dietary and consumer preferences to succeed 
our success depends  in part  upon the popularity of our products and our ability to develop new menu items that appeal to consumers across all four day parts 
shifts in consumer preferences away from our products  our inability to develop new menu items that appeal to consumers across all day parts  or changes in our menu that eliminate items popular with some consumers could harm our business 
in  we rolled out several new products on a system wide basis to anchor our new breakfast platform  including hot oatmeal  and tested wraps  sandwiches and salads 
these new products are designed to feature healthy  on the go items to attract new customers  increase the frequency of current customer visits  create a point of differentiation  and provide a more complete meal solution for our customers across all day parts 
to the extent we misjudge the market for our products  our sales will be adversely affected  which will negatively impact our operating results 
in addition  with new menu items  we must anticipate and effectively respond to changing product mix ramifications 
these new products have new and different ingredients  vendors  lead times  packaging  and operational requirements than our existing products 
accordingly  our business may be harmed by unanticipated consequences such as an adverse effect on speed of service and higher cost of goods of these new products that could lead to suboptimal selection and timing of product purchases or subpar operational execution 
some of the new menu items we plan to introduce may involve utilizing a different distribution system than we are currently using for our products 
accordingly  our business may be harmed to the extent we are unable to economically and efficiently implement a different distribution system for new menu items 
we may not persuade customers of the benefits of paying premium prices for higher quality food 
our success depends in large part on our ability to persuade customers to pay premium prices for our freshly blended beverages 
we may not successfully educate customers about the quality and benefits of our product offerings  and customers may not care 
failure to maintain premium pricing could require us to change our pricing  products  and strategies  which would adversely affect our brand identity 
our inability to compete with the many food services businesses may result in reductions in our revenue and operating margins 
we compete with many well established companies  food service and otherwise  on the basis of taste  quality and price of product offered  customer service  atmosphere  location and overall guest experience 
we compete with other smoothie and juice bar retailers  specialty coffee retailers  yogurt and ice cream shops  bagel shops  fast food restaurants  delicatessens  caf s  take out food service companies  supermarkets and convenience stores 
our competitors change with each of the four day parts  ranging from coffee bars and bakery caf s to casual dining chains 
aggressive pricing by our competitors or the entrance of new competitors into our markets could reduce our revenue and operating margins 
we also compete with other employers in our markets for hourly workers and may become subject to higher labor costs as a result of such competition 
our revenue is subject to volatility based on weather and varies by season 
seasonal factors also cause our revenue to fluctuate from quarter to quarter 
our revenue is typically lower during the winter months and the holiday season and during periods of inclement weather because fewer people choose cold beverages and higher during the spring  summer and fall months for the opposite reason 
new stores  once opened  may not be profitable  and the increases in average store revenue and comparable store revenue that we have experienced in the past may not be indicative of future results 
historically  our new stores have opened with an initial ramp up period typically lasting approximately months or more  during which they generated revenue and profit below the levels at which we expect them to normalize 
this is in part due to the time it takes to build a customer base in a new market  higher fixed costs 
table of contents relating to increased construction and occupancy costs and other start up inefficiencies that are typical of new stores 
new stores may neither be profitable nor have results comparable to our existing stores 
in addition  our average store revenue and comparable store revenue may not continue to increase at the rates achieved over the past several years 
the ability to operate new stores profitably and increase average store revenue and comparable store revenue will depend on many factors  some of which are beyond our control or the control of our franchisees  including many of the risks described herein 
if new stores don t perform as planned  our business and future prospects could be harmed 
in addition  changes in our average store revenue or comparable store revenue could cause our operating results to vary adversely from expectations 
fluctuations in various food and supply costs  particularly fruit and dairy  could adversely affect our operating results 
supplies and prices of the various products that we use to prepare our offerings can be affected by a variety of factors  such as weather  seasonal fluctuations  demand  politics and economics in the producing countries 
these factors subject us to shortages or interruptions in product supplies  which could adversely affect our revenue and profits 
in addition  the prices of fruit and dairy  which are the main products in our offerings  can be highly volatile 
the fruit of the quality we seek tends to trade on a negotiated basis  depending on supply and demand at the time of the purchase 
an increase in pricing of any fruit that we use in our products could have a significant adverse effect on our profitability 
if we are unable to pass along increased fruit and dairy costs  our margin will decrease and our profitability will suffer accordingly 
in addition  higher diesel and gasoline prices may affect our supply costs and may affect our revenue going forward 
for example  in some cases higher diesel prices have resulted in the imposition of surcharges on the delivery of commodities to its distributors  which they have generally passed on to us to the extent permitted under our arrangements with them 
to help mitigate the risks of volatile commodity prices and to allow greater predictability in pricing  we typically enter into fixed price or to be fixed priced purchase commitments for a portion of our fruit and dairy requirements 
we cannot assure you that these activities will be successful or that they will not result in our paying substantially more for our fruit supply than would have been required absent such activities 
we do have some multi year pricing agreements with certain vendors 
declines in sales may also adversely affect our business to the extent we have purchase commitments in excess of our needs 
the company actively works with its vendors under such contracts to mitigate any such long positions by authorizing the vendors to sell such products to other customers or by more actively promoting sales of offerings that contain such products  but there is no guarantee that the company will be successful in its mitigation efforts 
we are primarily dependent upon one supplier for a significant amount of our food distribution 
we maintain food distribution contracts primarily with one supplier 
this supplier  southwest traders  inc  provided approximately of cost of sales for each of our fiscal years and  approximately of cost of sales in fiscal  and approximately of cost of sales in jamba juice company s fiscal  which potentially subjects us to a concentration of business risk 
if this supplier had operational problems  our operations could be adversely affected 
we may face difficulties entering into new or modified arrangements with existing or new suppliers or new service providers 
if we expand our operations into new geographic areas through new company stores or franchises  we may have to seek new suppliers and service providers or enter into new arrangements with existing ones 
we may also encounter difficulties or be unable to negotiate pricing or other terms as favorable as those we currently enjoy  which could harm our business and operating results 
if we cannot replace or engage new arrangements  suppliers and or service providers in a cost effective basis  we may need to change our purchasing practices  remove items from the menu  or make menu price adjustments 
these activities could negatively impact our revenues and results of operations 

table of contents our business could be adversely affected by increased labor costs or labor shortages 
labor is a primary component in the cost of operating our business 
we devote significant resources to recruiting and training our team members 
a considerable number of the team members employed by us and our franchisees are paid at rates related to the federal minimum wage 
in  the federal minimum wage increased from to and it will increase again in to 
additionally  many of our team members work in stores located in states where the minimum wage is greater than the federal minimum and receive compensation equal to the state s minimum wage 
during  we had state minimum wage increases in california  oregon  new york  arizona  washington  colorado  illinois and florida all above the federal minimum wage 
in addition  the city of san francisco itself has a minimum wage requirement greater than the state of california 
any further increases in the federal minimum wage or the enactment of additional state or local minimum wage increases will increase labor costs 
if we are unable or unwilling to increase our menu prices or take other actions to offset increased operating costs  our operating results will suffer 
additionally  competition and labor shortages in various markets could result in higher required wage rates 
we are subject to all of the risks associated with leasing space subject to long term non cancelable leases 
we and our franchisees compete for real estate and our or their inability to secure appropriate real estate or lease terms could impact the ability to grow 
our leases generally have initial terms of between five and years  and generally can be extended only in five year increments if at all 
all of our leases require a fixed annual rent  although some require the payment of additional rent if store revenue exceeds a specified amount 
generally  our leases are net leases  which require us to pay all of the cost of insurance  taxes  maintenance and utilities 
we generally cannot cancel these leases 
if an existing or future store is not profitable  and we decide to close it  we may nonetheless be committed to perform our obligations under the applicable lease including  among other things  paying the base rent for the balance of the lease term 
current locations of our stores and franchised locations may become unattractive as demographic patterns change 
in addition  as each of our leases expire  we may fail to negotiate renewals  either on commercially acceptable terms or at all  which could cause us to close stores in desirable locations 
we may not achieve sales growth plans and other assumptions that support the carrying value of our assets and we may record lease termination costs 
the carrying value of our assets is subject to impairment reviews as of the last day of each fiscal quarter or more frequently if deemed necessary due to events or changes in circumstances 
we have recorded asset impairment charges  principally related to underperforming company stores and  in fiscal  recorded lease termination costs related to store closures 
we may experience further asset impairments and lease termination costs in the future 
estimated future cash flows used in these impairment reviews could be negatively impacted if we do not achieve our sales plans  planned cost savings  and other assumptions that support the carrying value of our assets  which could result in potential impairment of further assets or a decision to close additional company stores 
our business and results may be subject to disruption from work stoppages  terrorism or natural disasters 
our operations may be subject to disruption for a variety of reasons  including work stoppages  acts of war  terrorism  pandemics  fire  earthquake  flooding or other natural disasters 
in particular  our corporate offices and support center is located in northern california  near known earthquake fault lines 
if a major earthquake or other natural disaster were to occur in northern california  our corporate offices and support center may be damaged or destroyed 
such a disruption could result in the temporary or permanent loss of critical data  suspension of operations  delays in shipments of product  and disruption of business in both the affected region and nationwide  which would adversely affect our revenue as a result 

table of contents the unexpected loss of one or more members of our executive management team could adversely affect our business 
we have experienced significant changes in our executive management team in  including the departure of our chief executive officer  chief financial officer  chief marketing officer  head of operations  and head of development 
we have a new chief executive officer and have internally promoted other members of the executive team and increased their responsibilities 
we believe that these individuals understand our operational strategies and new strategic priorities to revitalize our long term growth and stockholder value 
we have entered into employment agreements with each of these individuals  but we cannot make any assurances that we can retain these individuals for the period necessary for us to return to sustained profitability 
competition for personnel in our industry is strong and the ability to retain key employees during a revitalization effort can be difficult 
the unexpected future loss of services of one or members of our executive management team could have an adverse effect on our business 
if we are unable to retain key executive officers  then it may be difficult for us to maintain a competitive position within our industry or implement our strategic priorities 
our growth strategy depends on increasing franchise ownership 
there were company stores and franchise stores open as of december  our recent growth strategy is to transition from a company store model to a model more evenly weighted between company stores and franchise stores 
this strategy is subject to risks and uncertainties 
we may not be able to identify franchisee candidates with appropriate experience and financial resources or to negotiate mutually acceptable agreements with them 
our franchisee candidates may not be able to obtain financing at acceptable rates and terms 
we may not be able to increase the percentage of franchised stores at the annual rate we desire or achieve the ownership mix of franchise stores to company stores that we desire 
risks related to franchise operations the opening and success of franchised stores depend on various factors  including the following the demand for our franchises  the selection of appropriate franchisee candidates  financing capital expenditures  locating and securing an adequate supply of new store sites  competition for sites and for business  negotiating leases with acceptable terms  hiring and training qualified operating personnel in local markets  managing construction and development costs of new stores at affordable levels  particularly in competitive markets  the availability of construction materials and labor  the availability of  and their ability to obtain  adequate supplies of ingredients that meet our quality standards  the impact of inclement weather  natural disasters and other calamities  and securing required governmental approvals including construction  parking and other permits in a timely manner 
as the number of franchisees increase  our revenues derived from royalties at franchise stores will increase  as will the risk that revenues could be negatively impacted by defaults in the payment of royalties 

table of contents expansion into new geographic markets may present increased risks 
franchise growth is planned in new geographic areas in the united states 
our future results  and the results of new franchise stores  depend on various factors  including successful selection and expansion into these new geographic markets and market acceptance of the jamba juice experience 
those markets may have different competitive conditions  consumer tastes and discretionary spending patterns than our existing markets 
as a result  those new stores may be less successful than stores in our existing markets 
consumers in a new market may not be familiar with the jamba juice brand  and we may need to build brand awareness in that market through greater investments in advertising and promotional activity than we originally planned 
franchisees may find it more difficult in new markets to hire  motivate and keep qualified employees who can project our vision  passion and culture 
stores opened in new markets may also have lower average store revenue than stores opened in existing markets  and may have higher construction  occupancy or operating costs than stores in existing markets 
furthermore  we may have difficulty in finding reliable suppliers or distributors or ones that can provide us  either initially or over time  with adequate supplies of ingredients meeting our quality standards 
revenue at stores opened in new markets may take longer to ramp up and reach expected revenue levels  and may never do so  thereby affecting overall royalty income 
as with the experience of other retail food concepts who have tried to expand nationally  we may find that the jamba juice concept has limited or no appeal to customers in new markets or we may experience a decline in the popularity of the jamba juice experience 
newly opened franchise stores may not succeed  future markets and stores may not be successful and  even if we are successful  our average store revenue  and the royalty income generated therefrom  may not increase at historical rates 
termination or non renewal of franchise agreements may disrupt store performance 
each franchise agreement is subject to termination by us in the event of default by the franchisee after the applicable cure periods 
upon the expiration of the initial term of a franchise agreement  the franchisee generally has an option to renew for an additional term 
there is no assurance that franchisees will meet the criteria for renewal or will desire or be able to renew their franchise agreements 
if not renewed  a franchise agreement and payments required thereunder will terminate 
we may be unable to find a new franchisee to replace such lost revenue 
furthermore  while we will be entitled to terminate franchise agreements following a default that is not cured within the applicable cure period  if any  the disruption to the performance of the stores could materially and adversely affect our business 
our franchising strategy means we will become more dependent on franchisees for their success 
several of our franchisees have been experiencing financial pressures  which  in certain instances  became more exacerbated during our franchisees closed stores in fiscal and may close additional stores in the future 
royalty revenues are directly correlated to sales by franchise stores and  accordingly  franchise store closures have an adverse effect on our revenues  results of operations and cash flows 
furthermore  an insolvency or bankruptcy proceeding involving a franchisee could prevent us from collecting payments or exercising any of our other rights under the related franchise agreement 
our re franchising strategy may not be successful 
we are implementing a strategy to refranchise in certain geographic markets 
given the current risks and financing challenges associated with becoming a franchisee of a restaurant retailer in the current economy  we cannot predict the likelihood of re franchising any such markets or the amount of any proceeds that might be received therefrom  including the amounts that might be realized from the sale of store assets and from any related franchise agreements 
re franchising could result in the recognition of impairment losses on the related assets 
additionally  in certain instances  there may be change in control provisions in the lease which require us to get landlord consent for a re franchising transaction 
failure of a landlord to consent to the assumption of a lease from us by a franchisee could cause us to remain liable for such lease obligations either as a guarantor or a sublessor 

table of contents our franchisees could take actions that harm our reputation and reduce our royalty revenue 
franchisees are independent contractors and are not our employees 
further  we do not exercise control over the day to day operations of our franchise stores 
any operational or development shortcomings of our franchise stores are likely to be attributed to our system wide operations and could adversely affect our reputation and have a direct negative impact on the royalty revenue we receive from those stores 
we could face liability from our franchisee and from government agencies 
a franchisee or government agency may bring legal action against us based on the franchisor franchisee relationship 
various state and federal laws govern our relationship with our franchisees and our potential sale of a franchise 
if we fail to comply with these laws  we could be liable for damages to franchisees  fines or other penalties 
expensive litigation with our franchisees or government agencies may adversely affect both our profits and our important relations with our franchisees 
we periodically acquire existing jamba juice stores from our franchisees  which could adversely affect our results of operations 
historically  we have acquired jamba juice stores from our franchisees either by negotiated agreement or exercise of our rights of first refusal or purchase option under the franchise or area development agreement 
any acquisition that we undertake involves risks  including  our ability to successfully and profitably transition acquired franchise stores into company stores 
failure to do so effectively could strain our financial and management resources as well as negatively impact our results of operations 
if we expand into foreign markets we will be exposed to new uncertainties and risks  which could negatively impact our results of operations 
we are exploring expanding our operations into new foreign markets  which will expose us to new risks and uncertainties  including product supply  consumer preferences  occupancy costs  operating expenses and labor and infrastructure challenges 
in addition  consumers in a foreign market may not be familiar with the jamba juice brand  and we may need to build brand awareness in that market through greater investments in advertising and promotional activity 
finally  international operations have inherent risks such as foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations  the application and effect of local laws and regulations and enforceability of intellectual property and contract rights 
our failure to manage our growth effectively could harm our business and operating results 
our existing management  financial  and other resources may be inadequate to support our franchise growth strategy 
managing our growth effectively will require us to continue to enhance our financial and management controls and informational and operations systems 
we may not respond quickly enough to the changing demands that our growth will impose on our management  employees and existing infrastructure 
our failure to manage our growth effectively could harm our business and operating results 
governmental regulation may adversely affect our ability to open new stores or otherwise adversely affect our existing and future operations and results 
we and our franchisees are subject to various federal  state and local regulations 
each of our stores is subject to state and local licensing and regulation by health  sanitation  food and workplace safety and other agencies 
we and our franchisees may experience material difficulties or failures in obtaining the necessary licenses or approvals for new stores  which could delay planned store openings 
in addition  stringent and varied requirements of local regulators with respect to zoning  land use and environmental factors could delay or prevent development of new stores in particular locations 

table of contents we and our franchisees are subject to the us americans with disabilities act and similar state laws that give civil rights protections to individuals with disabilities in the context of employment  public accommodations and other areas 
we and our franchisees may in the future have to modify stores  for example by adding access ramps or redesigning certain architectural fixtures  to provide service to or make reasonable accommodations for disabled persons 
the expenses associated with these modifications could be material 
our operations are also subject to the us fair labor standards act  which governs such matters as minimum wages  overtime and other working conditions  along with the us americans with disabilities act  family leave mandates and a variety of similar laws enacted by the states that govern these and other employment law matters 
in recent years  there has been an increased legislative  regulatory and consumer focus on nutrition and advertising practices in the food industry 
establishments operating in the quick service and fast casual segments have been a particular focus 
for example  many state and local jurisdictions have adopted a regulation requiring that restaurants that make calorie information publicly available must include that information on their menus and menu boards 
we may in the future become subject to other initiatives in the area of nutrition and calorie disclosure or advertising  such as requirements to provide information about the nutritional and calorie content of our food  which could increase our expenses 
government mandatory healthcare requirements could adversely affect our profits 
the company pays a substantial part of the healthcare benefits for team members at the general manager level and above and for those working at the company s corporate office 
other team members can purchase more limited healthcare benefits 
legislation is being proposed at the federal and state levels mandating employers to either provide health care coverage to their employees or pay into a fund that would provide coverage for them 
if this type of legislation is enacted in additional geographic areas where we do business  it could have an adverse effect on our profits 
our federal  state and local tax returns may  from time to time  be selected for audit by the taxing authorities  which may result in tax assessments  interest or penalties that could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and financial position 
we are subject to federal  state and local taxes in the us in making tax estimates and paying taxes  significant judgment is often required 
although we believe our tax positions and estimates are reasonable  if a taxing authority disagrees with the positions taken by the company  we could have an additional tax liability  including interest and penalties 
if material  payment of such additional amounts could have a material impact on our results of operations and financial position 
we could be party to litigation that could adversely affect us by distracting management  increasing our expenses or subjecting us to material money damages and other remedies 
our customers occasionally file complaints or lawsuits against us alleging that we are responsible for some illness or injury they suffered at or after a visit to our stores  or that we have problems with food quality or operations 
we are also subject to a variety of other claims arising in the ordinary course of our business  including personal injury claims  contract claims and claims alleging violations of federal and state law regarding workplace and employment matters  discrimination and similar matters  and we could become subject to class action or other lawsuits related to these or different matters in the future 
regardless of whether any claims against us are valid  or whether we are ultimately held liable  claims may be expensive to defend and may divert time and money away from our operations and hurt our performance 
a judgment significantly in excess of our insurance coverage  or for which we are not covered by insurance  could materially and adversely affect our financial condition or results of operations 
any adverse publicity resulting from these allegations may also materially and adversely affect our reputation or prospects  which in turn could adversely affect our results 

table of contents in addition  the food services industry has been subject to a growing number of claims based on the nutritional content of food products they sell and disclosure and advertising practices 
we may also be subject to this type of proceeding in the future and  even if not  publicity about these matters particularly directed at the quick service and fast casual segments of the industry may harm our reputation or prospects and adversely affect our results 
we may also incur costs resulting from other security risks we may face in connection with our electronic processing and transmission of confidential customer information 
we rely on commercially available software and other technologies to provide security for processing and transmission of customer credit card data 
approximately of our current revenue is attributable to credit card transactions  and that percentage is expected to climb 
our systems could be compromised in the future  which could result in the misappropriation of customer information or the disruption of systems 
either of those consequences could have a material adverse effect on our reputation and business or subject it to additional liabilities 
financing and liquidity risks our financing agreement imposes restrictions and obligations upon us that limit our ability to operate our business 
our secured financing agreement the financing agreement imposes financial and other restrictive covenants that limit our ability to plan for and respond to changes in our business 
under the agreement  we are required to meet certain financial tests and comply with covenants  which  among other things  limit the incurrence of additional indebtedness  liens  investments  asset sales  acquisitions  and other matters customarily in such agreements 
any failure to comply with these covenants could result in an event of default under this financing agreement 
any default under the financing agreement may cause an acceleration of all outstanding amounts due under the financing agreement  which  if we do not have adequate cash reserves  could be detrimental to our business operations 
in addition  commencing september   the lenders under the financing agreement have a put right requiring us to repurchase  shares of common stock held by them at a price of per share 
any exercise of this put right could have an adverse effect on our liquidity 
the million that would be needed to repurchase these shares are classified in restricted cash on our balance sheet 
insufficient cash flows from operations may adversely affect our financial condition 
we had a net loss of million for fiscal and a net loss of million for fiscal these results have had a negative impact on our financial condition and operating cash flows 
we believe the implementation of our strategic priorities will lead to our ability to sustain profitability 
our primary sources of liquidity include cash on hand as a result of the borrowing made under our financing agreement  a federal income tax refund of million received in february  expected availability of restricted cash and cash flows from operations 
we expect that our primary sources of liquidity will be sufficient to fund non discretionary capital expenditures and working capital through fiscal however  if we are unable to maintain sufficient working capital  we may be forced to further reduce operating expenses  sell business assets or take other actions  which could be detrimental to our business operations 
furthermore  we may also explore other ways to improve our working capital 
although we believe there are financing alternatives available  additional capital may not be available on a timely basis or on acceptable terms  if at all 
moreover  in the event that any future financing is completed  to the extent it includes equity securities  the holders of our common stock may experience additional dilution 

table of contents the inability to fund capital expenditures may adversely impact future growth 
the success of our future growth will depend  to a significant extent  on our ability to fund the necessary capital expenditures 
for example  we plan to build a retail food capability across all four day parts breakfast  lunch  afternoon and dinner 
in addition  two other strategic priorities are to implement various technology initiatives which would promote efficiency in customer service and to embark on a store refresh program in selected company stores to revitalize their look and feel 
to the extent we are not able to fund the necessary capital expenditures to address these priorities  these priorities may take longer to implement and may not be as successful as we expect  which could have a material adverse impact on our business 
risks relating to intellectual property we may not be able to adequately protect our intellectual property  which could harm the value of our brand and adversely affect our business 
our intellectual property is material to the conduct of our business 
our ability to implement our business plan successfully depends in part on our ability to build further brand recognition using our trademarks  service marks  trade dress and other proprietary intellectual property  including our name and logos and the unique ambiance of our stores both domestically and overseas 
we have secured the ownership and rights to our marks in the united states and have filed or obtained registrations for restaurant services in most other significant foreign jurisdictions 
if our efforts to protect our intellectual property are inadequate  or if any third party misappropriates or infringes on our intellectual property  either in print or on the internet  the value of our brands may be harmed  which could have a material adverse effect on our business and might prevent our brands from achieving or maintaining market acceptance 
while we have not encountered claims from prior users of intellectual property relating to restaurant services in areas where we operate or intend to conduct material operations  there can be no assurances that we will not encounter such claims 
if so  this could harm our image  brand or competitive position and cause us to incur significant penalties and costs 
the company s earnings and growth of alternative distribution channels depends in large part on the success of its business partners  and the company s reputation may be harmed by actions taken by third parties 
a strategic priority is to seek opportunities to extend the jamba brand and maximize revenue by leveraging the brand in new and complementary consumer packed product categories 
these revenues will be dependent on the success of the licensed products  as well as the capability and execution of our business partner 
for example  in  we launched a line of jamba ready to drink beverages under an exclusive worldwide licensing agreement with nestl usa 
in december  nestl voluntarily suspended production and shipments of the beverages due to production issues 
while nestl has announced that it is fully committed to re assessing its jamba ready to drink beverage proposition so that it can come back stronger and positioned for success in the future  there can be no assurance when and if this may happen 
in the future  we may enter into agreements with other companies for the retail distribution of other product categories involving the licensing of the jamba juice trademarks 
any execution failure by our business partner or failure to adhere to the brand experience and standards expected by our customers may damage our reputation and brand value  which may potentially affect the results of operations 
the company s success depends on the value of the jamba brand 
the jamba brand practice is to inspire and simplify healthy living 
we believe we must preserve and grow the value of the jamba brand in order to be successful in building our business and particularly in building a consumer products growth platform 
brand value is based in part on consumer perceptions and the jamba brand has been highly rated in several brand studies 
our brand building initiatives involve increasing our product 
table of contents offerings and opening new stores to increase awareness of our brand and create and maintain brand loyalty 
if our brand building initiatives are unsuccessful  or if business incidents occur which erode consumer perceptions of our brand  then the value of our products may diminish and we may not be able to implement our business strategy 
risks related to the food service business litigation and publicity concerning food quality  health and other issues  which can result in liabilities and also cause customers to avoid our products  which could adversely affect our results of operations  business and financial condition 
food service businesses can be adversely affected by litigation and complaints from customers or government authorities resulting from food quality  allergens  illness  injury or other health concerns or operating issues stemming from one retail location or a limited number of retail locations 
adverse publicity about these allegations may negatively affect us  regardless of whether the allegations are true  by discouraging customers from buying our products 
we could also incur significant liabilities  if a lawsuit or claim results in a decision against us  or litigation costs  regardless of the result 
food safety concerns and instances of food borne illnesses could harm our customers  result in negative publicity and cause the temporary closure of some stores and  in some cases  could adversely affect the price and availability of fruits and vegetables  any of which could harm our brand reputation  result in a decline in revenue or an increase in costs 
we consider food safety a top priority and dedicate substantial resources towards ensuring that our customers enjoy high quality  safe and wholesome products 
however  we cannot guarantee that our internal controls and training will be fully effective in preventing all food borne illnesses 
furthermore  our reliance on third party food suppliers and distributors increases the risk that food borne illness incidents such as e 
coli  hepatitis a  salmonella or listeria could occur outside of our control and at multiple locations 
instances of food borne illnesses  whether real or perceived  and whether at our stores or those of our competitors  could harm customers and otherwise result in negative publicity about us or the products we serve  which could adversely affect revenue 
if there is an incident involving our stores serving contaminated products  our customers may be harmed  our revenue may decrease and our brand name may be impaired 
if our customers become ill from food borne illnesses  we could be forced to temporarily close some stores 
if we react to negative publicity by changing our menu or other key aspects of the jamba juice experience  we may lose customers who do not accept those changes  and may not be able to attract enough new customers to produce the revenue needed to make our stores profitable 
in addition  we may have different or additional competitors for our intended customers as a result of making any such changes and may not be able to compete successfully against those competitors 
food safety concerns and instances of food borne illnesses and injuries caused by food contamination have in the past  and could in the future  adversely affect the price and availability of affected ingredients and cause customers to shift their preferences  particularly if we choose to pass any higher ingredient costs along to consumers 
as a result  our costs may increase and our revenue may decline 
a decrease in customer traffic as a result of these health concerns or negative publicity  or as a result of a change in our menu or dining experience or a temporary closure of any of our stores  could materially harm our business 
the food service industry has inherent operational risks that may not be adequately covered by insurance 
we may not be adequately insured against all risks and our insurers may not pay a particular claim 
furthermore  in the future  we may not be able to obtain adequate insurance coverage at reasonable rates for our operations 
we may also be subject to calls  or premiums  in amounts based not only on our own claim records but also the claim records of all other members of the protection and indemnity associations through which we 
table of contents receive indemnity insurance coverage for tort liability 
our insurance policies also contain deductibles  limitations and exclusions  which  although we believe are standard in the food service industry  may nevertheless increase our costs 
restaurant companies  including jamba juice  have been the target of class action lawsuits and other proceedings alleging  among other things  violations of federal and state workplace and employment laws 
proceedings of this nature  if successful  could result in our payment of substantial damages 
our results of operations may be adversely affected by legal or governmental proceedings brought by or on behalf of employees or customers 
in recent years  a number of restaurant companies  including jamba juice company  have been subject to lawsuits  including class action lawsuits  alleging violations of federal and state law regarding workplace and employment matters  discrimination  tip policy and similar matters 
a number of these lawsuits have resulted in the payment of substantial awards by the defendants 
similar lawsuits have been instituted against us in the past alleging violations of state and federal wage and hour laws and failure to pay for all hours worked 
although we are not currently a party to any class action lawsuits  we could incur substantial damages and expenses resulting from lawsuits  which would increase the cost of operating the business and decrease the cash available for our business 
risks related to ownership of common stock we currently fail to meet one of nasdaq s listing requirements and if our common stock is delisted it could negatively impact the price of our common stock  our ability to access the capital markets  and trigger a put right 
our common stock is currently listed on the nasdaq global market 
a continual listing requirement of the nasdaq is that the bid price of our common stock not close below the minimum of per share for a consecutive business day period 
we are not currently in compliance with this requirement 
however  nasdaq has suspended enforcement of this requirement until april  if  absent a continued suspension of this rule by nasdaq after april   we fail to regain compliance with the minimum bid price requirement after enforcement of this requirement is resumed on april   or if at any time we fail to satisfy any of the other requirements for continued listing  our common stock could be delisted from the nasdaq global market 
the delisting of our common stock would significantly affect the ability of investors to trade our securities and would negatively affect the value and liquidity of our common stock 
if delisted from the nasdaq global market  our common stock will likely be quoted in the over the counter market in the so called pink sheets or quoted in the otc bulletin board 
in addition  our common stock would be subject to the rules promulgated under the securities exchange act of relating to penny stocks 
these rules require brokers who sell securities that are subject to the rules  and who sell to persons other than established customers and institutional accredited investors  to complete required documentation  make suitability inquiries of investors and provide investors with information concerning the risks of trading in the security 
these requirements could make it more difficult to buy or sell our common stock in the open market 
in addition  the delisting of our common stock could materially adversely affect our ability to raise capital on terms acceptable to us or at all 
delisting from the nasdaq global market could also have other negative results  including the potential loss of confidence by suppliers and employees  the loss of institutional investor interest and fewer business development opportunities 
furthermore  delisting from the nasdaq global market would trigger a put right on behalf of our lenders requiring us to repurchase  shares of common stock held by them at a price of per share 
our quarterly operating results may fluctuate significantly and could fall below the expectations of securities analysts and investors due to various factors 
our quarterly operating results may fluctuate significantly because of various factors  including the impact of inclement weather  
table of contents changes in consumer preferences and discretionary spending  the timing of new franchise store openings and related revenue  labor availability and wages of store management and team members  changes in comparable store revenue and customer visits  including as a result of the introduction of new menu items  variations in general economic conditions  such as  for example  those relating to changes in gasoline prices  negative publicity about the ingredients we use or the occurrence of food borne illnesses or other problems at our stores  increases in infrastructure costs  fluctuations in supply prices  and fluctuations in the fair value of the derivative liability associated with outstanding warrants 
because of these factors  results for any one quarter are not necessarily indicative of results to be expected for any other quarter or for any year 
average store revenue or comparable store revenue in any particular future period may decrease 
in the future  operating results may fall below the expectations of securities analysts and investors 
any failure to meet expectations  particularly for i comparable store sales  ii earnings per share  or iii new store openings could cause the market price of the company s stock to drop significantly 
results of operations may be volatile as a result of the impact of fluctuations in the fair value of our outstanding warrants from quarter to quarter 
our outstanding warrants are classified as derivative liabilities and therefore  their fair values are recorded as derivative liabilities on our balance sheet 
changes in the fair values of the warrants will result in adjustments to the amount of the recorded derivative liabilities and the corresponding gain or loss will be recorded in our statement of operations 
we are required to assess these fair values of derivative liabilities each quarter and as the value of the warrants is quite sensitive to changes in the market price of our stock  among other things  fluctuations in such value could be substantial and could cause our results to not meet the expectations of securities analysts and investors 
these fluctuations will continue to impact our results of operations as described above for as long as the warrants are outstanding 
the warrants will expire on june  failure of the company s internal control over financial reporting could harm its business and financial results 
our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting 
internal control over financial reporting is a process to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
internal control over financial reporting includes i maintaining reasonably detailed records that accurately and fairly reflect our transactions  and ii providing reasonable assurance that we a record transactions as necessary to prepare the financial statements  b make receipts and expenditures in accordance with management authorizations  and c would timely prevent or detect any unauthorized acquisition  use or disposition of our assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements 
because of its inherent limitations  internal control over financial reporting is not intended to provide absolute assurance that we would prevent or detect a misstatement of our financial statements or fraud 
any failure to maintain an effective system of internal control over financial reporting could limit our ability to report our financial results accurately and timely or to detect and prevent fraud 
a significant financial reporting failure could cause an immediate loss of investor confidence in us and a sharp decline in the market price of our common stock 

table of contents our anti takeover provisions may delay or prevent a change of control of us  which may adversely affect the price of our common stock 
certain provisions in our corporate documents and delaware law may delay or prevent a change of control of us  which could adversely affect the price of our common stock 
for example  we have adopted a stockholder rights plan  commonly known as a poison pill  which would make it difficult for someone to acquire the company without the approval of the board of directors 
also  the company s amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws include other anti takeover provisions such as limitations on the ability of stockholders to amend its charter documents  including stockholder supermajority voting requirements  the inability of stockholders to act by written consent or to call a special meeting absent the request of the holders of a majority of the outstanding common stock  advance notice requirements for nomination for election to the board of directors and for stockholder proposals  and the authority of its board of directors to issue  without stockholder approval  blank check preferred stock 
the company is also afforded the protections of section of the delaware general corporation law which prevents it from engaging in a business combination with a person who acquires at least of its common stock for a period of three years from the date such person acquired such common stock  unless board of directors or stockholder approval is obtained
