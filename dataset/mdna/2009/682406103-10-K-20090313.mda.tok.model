item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
general we are a self administered and self managed reit 
we primarily own real estate that we net lease to tenants 
as of december   we owned properties  three of which are vacant  and one of which is a tenancy in common interest  and participated in five joint ventures that own five properties  one of which is vacant 
these properties are located in states 
our rental properties are generally leased to corporate tenants under operating leases substantially all of which are noncancellable 
substantially all of our lease agreements are net lease arrangements that require the tenant to pay not only rent  but also substantially all of the operating expenses of the leased property  including maintenance  taxes  utilities and insurance 
a majority of our lease agreements provide for periodic rental increases and certain of our other leases provide for increases based on the consumer price index 
at december   excluding mortgages payable of our unconsolidated joint ventures  we had outstanding mortgages payable  aggregating million in principal amount  all of which are secured by first liens on individual real estate investments with an aggregate carrying value of approximately million  before accumulated depreciation 
the mortgages bear interest at fixed rates ranging from to  and mature between and during  the national economic recession resulted in  among other things  increased unemployment  and caused a significant decline in consumer confidence  which has dramatically reduced consumer spending on retail goods 
this affected us and our retail tenants in the following respects circuit city  a retail tenant which leased five of our properties  filed for protection under the federal bankruptcy laws in november  rejected leases for two of our properties in december and the remaining three properties in march the five properties formerly leased to circuit city accounted for of our annual rental revenues 
we recorded an impairment charge of approximately million against four properties for the year ended december   including three properties formerly leased to circuit city 
an analysis was performed and we determined that two of the properties leased to circuit city at december  which leases were rejected in march  did not require an impairment charge for the year ended december  the impairment charge for each affected property is equal to the difference between the net book value  including intangibles  and the present value of discounted cash flows of the properties based upon certain valuation assumptions 
at december   we had a non recourse mortgage with an outstanding balance of million secured by five properties for which circuit city rejected our leases 
we have not made any payments on this mortgage since december  and have entered into negotiations with representatives of the mortgagee relating to possible modifications of the mortgage 
after taking into account the impairment charge  our book value for these five properties is million  we wrote off or recorded accelerated amortization on an aggregate of  of unbilled straight line rent receivable for six retail properties  including five properties formerly leased by circuit city which resulted in a decrease in our rental revenues for the year ended december   and our quarterly distribution was reduced by from 
in october to 
in january our rental income from our retail tenants will account for of our contractual rental revenues  including which is from furniture stores and from office supply stores 
two retail tenants in the office supply and furniture business represent an aggregate of and of our contractual rental revenues 
if economic conditions in the united states do not stabilize in  we will likely experience additional tenant defaults  delinquencies and delays in payments and lease renegotiations  which could cause a decline in our rental revenues 
in addition  since the economy has also sustained a crisis in the commercial real estate market and in the commercial banking system  the value of properties that we hold or seek to sell could decline 
as a result  we may recognize additional impairment charges and losses on property sales 
also  our operating expenses will increase as we maintain and improve vacant properties 
moreover  our ability to refinance existing indebtedness and to secure additional funds from unencumbered properties may also be limited due to the liquidity constraints in the credit markets 
comparison of years ended december  and december  rental revenues rental revenues 
rental revenues increased by million  or  to million for the year ended december   from million for the year ended december  the increase in rental revenues is substantially due to rental revenues of million earned during the year ended december  on twelve properties acquired by us during the increase in rental income as compared to also resulted from a  write off of the intangible lease liability related to a property where we directly assumed in december the sublease for a property leased by us to circuit city and subleased by circuit city to a furniture retailer 
additionally  in and  we wrote off the entire balance of unbilled rent receivable relating to several properties 
operating expenses depreciation and amortization expense 
depreciation and amortization expense increased by  or  to million for the year ended december   from million for the year ended december  the increase was primarily due to depreciation and amortization of  on eleven properties acquired between january and september the increase also was due to a  increase in depreciation in on a property which had been classified as held for sale with no depreciation taken during the second half of normal and catch up depreciation on such property resumed in the increase also resulted from accelerated amortization of tenant origination costs of  principally relating to the two properties vacated by circuit city in and the three properties leased to circuit city at december  general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses increased by  or  to million for the year ended december   from million for the year ended december  the increase is due to a number of factors including i a  increase in payroll and payroll related expenses for full time employees  ii a  increase in professional fees incurred in connection with civil litigations commenced by us as plaintiff  arising out of the activities of our former president and chief executive officer  and iii a  increase in compensation expenses related to the amortization of restricted stock awards 
these increases were offset by a a  decrease paid under the compensation and services agreement  described below  b a  decrease in state tax expense and c miscellaneous decreases in accounting  legal and director fees 
included in general and administrative expenses for the years ended december  and was million and million  respectively  of expenses incurred pursuant to a compensation and services agreement which became effective january   entered into between us and majestic property management corp  an affiliated entity 
under the compensation and services agreement  majestic property management corp 
took over our obligations under a shared services agreement including our share of direct office overhead and agreed to continue to provide us with the services of all executive  administrative  legal  accounting and clerical personnel that we use on a part time basis 
accordingly  we no longer allocate direct office overhead or payroll expenses 
the agreement also requires majestic property management corp 
to continue to provide us with certain property management services including construction supervisory services  property acquisition  sales and leasing services and mortgage brokerage services 
we do not incur any fees or expenses for such services  other than the annual fee to majestic property management corp  which was  before offsets provided for in the agreement in  plus  as our share of direct office overhead 
impairment charge 
during the year ended december   we recorded an impairment charge of approximately million relating to four properties 
a charge of million was recorded relating to three of our circuit city properties and  was related to a retail furniture property 
circuit city rejected leases for two of the properties in december and rejected the lease for the third property in march we performed an analysis and have determined that the other two properties leased to circuit city which were rejected in march  do not at this time require an impairment charge 
although the retail furniture property has been vacant  the tenant is current in its rent payments 
there was no impairment charge recorded in the year ended december  real estate expenses 
real estate expenses increased by  or  to  for the year ended december   from  for the year ended december   resulting primarily from real estate taxes for the five properties formerly leased by circuit city 
real estate expenses for the year ended december  also include real estate taxes for two of our other properties  including a vacant property 
other income and expenses gain on dispositions of real estate of unconsolidated joint ventures 
in the years ended december  and  two of our joint ventures each sold a vacant property and we recognized gains on sale of  and  respectively 
interest and other income 
interest and other income decreased by million  or  to  for the year ended december   from million for the year ended december  due to the current credit crisis  interest rates have been steadily declining over the past several quarters resulting in a decrease in the income we earn on our investment in short term cash equivalents 
in addition  we had less cash available for investment after we paid a special distribution of million to our stockholders in october and purchased nine properties in september also contributing to the decrease in interest and other income was the inclusion of a  gain on the sale of available for sale securities in the year ended december  we did not have a similar sale of securities in interest expense 
interest expense increased by  or  to million for the year ended december   from million for the year ended december  this increase was primarily the result of a  decrease in fair value of an interest rate swap that we entered into in connection with a mortgage placed on a property in november the increase was also due to interest expense on this mortgage and on fixed rate mortgages placed on three properties between august and september  and the assumption of two fixed rate mortgages in connection with the purchase of two properties in january and february in addition  at the end of september  we borrowed million under our line of credit which was applied to the purchase of eight office depot properties  of which million was repaid in november with a portion of the proceeds from a mortgage financing of one of our properties 
accordingly  interest expense relating to our line of credit increased by  during the year ended december  these increases were offset from the payoff in full of two mortgage loans  as well as from the monthly principal amortization of other mortgages 
gain on sale of excess unimproved land 
during the year ended december   we sold five acres of excess land that we acquired as part of the purchase of a flex building in and recognized a gain of million 
there was no such gain in the year ended december  comparison of years ended december  and december  rental revenues rental revenues 
rental revenues increased by million  or  to million for the year ended december   from million for the year ended december  the increase in rental revenues was substantially due to rental revenues earned during the year ended december  on properties acquired by us between april and december operating expenses depreciation and amortization expense 
depreciation and amortization expense increased by million  or  to million for the year ended december   from million for the year ended december  the increase in depreciation and amortization was due to the acquisition of properties between april and december general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses increased by million  or  to million for the year ended december   from million for the year ended december  the increase is due to a number of factors including i a  increase in payroll and payroll related expenses of full time employees  ii a  increase in compensation expenses related to the amortization of restricted stock awards  iii a  increase from  to  in the compensation paid to the chairman of our board of directors  and iv a  increase in professional fees  resulting from both the retention by our compensation committee of an independent consultant  and an increase in legal and accounting fees 
offsetting these increases was a  decease in professional fees incurred in the prior year in connection with investigations by the sec and our audit committee  and legal fees relating to a civil litigation arising out of the activities of our former president and chief executive officer 
included in the increase in general and administrative expenses was million of expenses incurred pursuant to the compensation and services agreement 
in consideration of taking over our obligations under the shared services agreement and providing the services set forth in the compensation and services agreement  we agreed to pay majestic property management corp 
a fee in of  before offsets provided for in the agreement plus  as our share of direct office overhead 
the following table compares the amounts paid by us in under the compensation and services agreement and the expenses paid in which would be included in the fee paid under such agreement years ended december  compensation and services agreement allocated expenses mortgage brokerage fees sales commissions management fees supervisory fees fees paid by our joint ventures total fees deferred and written off over term of mortgage 
reduced net sales proceeds 
capitalized to improvement account 
represents our share of fees paid to majestic property management corp 
by our joint ventures 
the amount is for management fees and the amount is primarily for sales commissions  which reduced the net sales proceeds from the dispositions of real estate of unconsolidated joint ventures 
other income and expenses equity in earnings loss of unconsolidated joint ventures 
our equity in earnings of unconsolidated joint ventures increased by million to  for the year ended december   from a loss of million for the year ended december  the million loss for the year ended december  resulted primarily from million of mortgage prepayment premiums  of which  or million  was our share  paid by two of our joint ventures upon the sale of its nine movie theater properties in september and october such sales resulted in a decrease in income producing properties owned by our joint ventures since these properties generated operating income of million  of which  or million  was our share in the year ended december  also included a  impairment charge by one of our joint ventures  of which  or  was our share 
additionally  during the year ended december   one of our movie theater joint ventures recorded a  impairment charge  of which  or  was our share 
the joint venture sold this property in march the year ended december  includes an increase in our equity share of earnings from four of our other unconsolidated joint ventures  primarily due to our participation in an additional joint venture which acquired a property in september gain on dispositions of real estate of unconsolidated joint ventures 
gain on dispositions of real estate of unconsolidated joint ventures results from sales of real estate assets owned by our two movie theater joint ventures 
the year ended december  reflects the september sale by one of the joint ventures of a movie theater property located in brooklyn  new york for a consideration of million  from which it realized a gain of million  of which our share was million 
the year ended december  also reflects the october sale of eight movie theater properties by both movie theater joint ventures to an unrelated party for an aggregate purchase price of million  from which the joint ventures realized a gain of million  of which million was our share 
we wrote off the unamortized premium balance of  in our investment in one of the joint ventures against the gain 
the year ended december  reflects the sale by one of the movie theater joint ventures of its last remaining real estate asset  a vacant parcel of land  located in monroe  new york  for a consideration of million 
the joint venture recognized a gain of million on this sale  of which our share is  interest and other income 
interest and other income increased by  or  to million for the year ended december   from  for the year ended december  the increase in interest and other income for the year ended december  resulted substantially from our investment in short term cash equivalents available primarily from the distributions we received from the movie theater joint ventures upon the sales of its theater properties in september and october also contributing to the increase in interest and other income in the year ended december  was a  gain on sale of available for sale securities 
interest expense 
interest expense increased by million  or  to million for the year ended december   from million for the year ended december  this increase results primarily from fixed rate mortgages placed on ten properties in the year ended december   and the assumption of a fixed rate mortgage in connection with the purchase of eleven properties in april the year ended december  includes a full year of interest expense on these mortgages 
in addition  the increase in interest expense results from interest on a loan payable  which was originally a mortgage collateralized by a movie theater property we sold in october amortization of deferred financing costs 
amortization of deferred financing costs increased by  or  to  for the year ended december  the increase is due to results from the amortization of deferred mortgage costs during the year ended december  resulting from mortgages placed on properties between april and august gain on sale 
in july  we sold excess acreage at a property we owned to an unrelated party and recognized a  gain on the sale  and in february  we sold an option to buy an interest in certain property adjacent to one of our properties and recognized a  gain on the sale 
discontinued operations income from discontinued operations 
income from discontinued operations decreased by million  or  to  for the year ended december   from million for the year ended december  this decrease was primarily due to the million gain in the year ended december  on the sale of a movie theater wholly owned by us that we sold for million 
this sale was part of a sale which closed in october pursuant to which an unrelated party purchased one movie theater from us and eight movie theaters from two of our joint ventures 
the year ended december  also includes the net operating income of  from this property 
liquidity and capital resources we require capital to fund our operations 
our capital sources include income from operating activities  borrowings under our revolving credit facility and mortgage loans secured by our properties 
our available liquidity at december  was approximately million  including million of cash and cash equivalents and million of available liquidity under our revolving credit facility 
our business model includes the continued borrowing of funds against our portfolio of properties and the refinancing of existing debt 
with the tightening of liquidity by lending institutions  we have found that it is increasingly difficult to identify funding sources 
as a result  our ability to make new property acquisitions or increase liquidity will be limited 
we have not made any payments since december  on the million non recourse mortgage secured by our five properties formerly leased to circuit city 
short term liquidity and financing we expect to meet our short term liquidity requirements generally through our cash and cash equivalents and cash provided by operating activities and  to the extent we make a new property acquisition  from our revolving credit facility 
to the extent our cash flow from operating activities is insufficient to finance property acquisitions  we will need to finance property acquisitions through borrowings under our credit facility  and thereafter  to seek long term fixed rate mortgages for such properties 
as a result of the current economic environment and the uncertainty in the credit markets  it is difficult and or expensive to secure financing upon reasonable terms  if at all 
in addition  the credit markets may make it difficult and or expensive to repay or satisfy our existing debt 
all of our requests for draws under our credit facility have been satisfied to date 
however  in view of the current uncertainties  we have adopted a conservative acquisition strategy and will likely make few  if any  acquisitions in the near term 
long term liquidity and financing we expect to meet our long term liquidity requirements through existing cash resources  proceeds from debt  including under a credit facility and mortgages including refinances on our properties  and if required  the liquidation of our properties 
we believe that the value of our portfolio is  and will continue to be  sufficient to allow us to refinance the mortgage debt on it at maturity and repay all indebtedness we owe under our credit facility 
our current credit facility matures on march  our ability to meet our long term liquidity requirements is subject to securing an extension on our credit facility or securing a new credit facility 
any decision by our lenders or potential lenders to provide us with financing will depend upon a number of factors  such as the continuation or deterioration of the current economic recession  our compliance with the terms of our existing credit facility  our financial performance  industry or market trends  the general availability of and rates applicable to financing transactions  such lenders resources and policies concerning the terms under which they make capital commitments and the relative attractiveness of alternative investment or lending opportunities 
we expect that the terms of a new facility will be less favorable than our existing facility 
credit facility we are a party to a credit agreement  as amended  with vnb new york corp  bank leumi  usa  manufacturers and traders trust company and israel discount bank of new york which provides for a million revolving credit facility 
the credit facility is available to us to pay off existing mortgages  to fund the acquisition of additional properties or to invest in joint ventures 
the facility matures on march  borrowings under the facility bear interest at the lower of libor plus or the bank s prime rate and there is an unused facility fee of per annum 
net proceeds received from the sale or refinancing of properties are required to be used to repay amounts outstanding under the facility if proceeds from the facility were used to purchase or refinance the property 
the facility is guaranteed by our subsidiaries that own unencumbered properties and is secured by the outstanding stock of subsidiary entities 
as of december  and march   there was million outstanding under the facility 
contractual obligations the following sets forth our contractual cash obligations as of december   which relate to interest and amortization payments and balances due at maturity under outstanding mortgages secured by our properties for the periods indicated amounts in thousands payment due by period less than more than contractual obligations total year years years years mortgages payable interest and amortization mortgages payable balances due at maturity   a    total note a included is an million non recourse mortgage for which we have not made any payments since december  the mortgage is secured and cross collateralized by the five circuit city properties 
we have entered into negotiations with representatives of the mortgagee relating to possible modifications of the mortgage 
this mortgage is scheduled to mature on december  as of december   we had outstanding approximately million in long term mortgage indebtedness excluding mortgage indebtedness of our unconsolidated joint ventures  all of which is non recourse subject to standard carve outs 
we expect that debt service payments of approximately million due in the next three years will be paid primarily from cash generated from our operations 
we anticipate that loan maturities of approximately million due in the next three years will be paid primarily from mortgage financings or refinancings 
if we are not successful in refinancing our existing indebtedness or financing our unencumbered properties  our cash flow  funds available under our credit facility and available cash  if any  may not be sufficient to repay all maturing debt when payments become due  and we may be forced to sell additional equity or dispose of properties on disadvantageous terms 
in addition  we  as ground lessee  are obligated to pay rent under a ground lease for a property owned in fee by an unrelated third party 
the annual fixed leasehold rent expense is as follows more than total years we had no outstanding contingent commitments  such as guarantees of indebtedness  or any other contractual cash obligations at december  distribution policy we have elected to be taxed as a reit under the internal revenue code of  as amended 
to qualify as a reit  we must meet a number of organizational and operational requirements  including a requirement that we distribute currently at least of our ordinary taxable income to our stockholders in stock under revenue procedure or cash 
it is our current intention to comply with these requirements and maintain our reit status 
as a reit  we generally will not be subject to corporate federal  state or local income taxes on taxable income we distribute currently in accordance with the internal revenue code and applicable regulations to our stockholders 
if we fail to qualify as a reit in any taxable year  we will be subject to federal  state and local income taxes at regular corporate rates and may not be able to qualify as a reit for four subsequent tax years 
even if we qualify for federal taxation as a reit  we may be subject to certain state and local taxes on our income and to federal income taxes on our undistributed taxable income ie  taxable income not distributed in the amounts and in the time frames prescribed by the internal revenue code and applicable regulations thereunder and are subject to federal excise taxes on our undistributed taxable income 
it is our intention to pay to our stockholders within the time periods prescribed by the internal revenue code no less than  and  if possible  of our annual taxable income  including taxable gains from the sale of real estate and recognized gains on the sale of securities 
it will continue to be our policy to make sufficient distributions to stockholders in order for us to maintain our reit status under the internal revenue code 
our board has determined that  in view of the economic environment  we should conserve our capital 
as a result  the quarterly dividend paid in january was reduced from 
per share to 
per share 
our board of directors will review the dividend policy at each regularly scheduled quarterly board meeting to determine if any further reductions to our dividend should be made 
off balance sheet arrangements none 
critical accounting policies our significant accounting policies are more fully described in note to our consolidated financial statements  provided in this annual report on form k 
certain of our accounting policies are particularly important to an understanding of our financial position and results of operations and require the application of significant judgment by our management  as a result they are subject to a degree of uncertainty 
these critical accounting policies include the following  discussed below 
purchase accounting for acquisition of real estate the fair value of real estate acquired is allocated to acquired tangible assets  consisting of land and building  and identified intangible assets and liabilities  consisting of the value of above market and below market leases and other value of in place leases based in each case on their fair values 
the fair value of the tangible assets of an acquired property which includes land and building is determined by valuing the property as if it were vacant  and the as if vacant value is then allocated to land and building based on management s determination of relative fair values of these assets 
we assess fair value of the lease intangibles based on estimated cash flow projections that utilize appropriate discount rates and available market information 
the allocation made by management may have a positive or negative effect on net income and may have an effect on the assets and liabilities on the balance sheet 
revenues our revenues  which are substantially derived from rental income  include rental income that our tenants pay in accordance with the terms of their respective leases reported on a straight line basis over the initial term of each lease 
since many of our leases provide for rental increases at specified intervals  straight line basis accounting requires us to record as an asset and include in revenues  unbilled rent receivables which we will only receive if the tenant makes all rent payments required through the expiration of the initial term of the lease 
accordingly  our management must determine  in its judgment  that the unbilled rent receivable applicable to each specific tenant is collectible 
we review unbilled rent receivables on a quarterly basis and take into consideration the tenant s payment history and the financial condition of the tenant 
in the event that the collectability of an unbilled rent receivable is in doubt  we are required to take a reserve against the receivable or a direct write off of the receivable  which has an adverse affect on net income for the year in which the reserve or direct write off is taken  and will decrease total assets and stockholders equity 
value of real estate portfolio we review our real estate portfolio on a quarterly basis to ascertain if there are any indicators of impairment in the value of any of our real estate assets  including deferred costs and intangibles  in order to determine if there is any need for an impairment charge 
in reviewing the portfolio  we examine the type of asset  the economic situation in the area in which the asset is located  the economic situation in the industry in which the tenant is involved and the timeliness of the payments made by the tenant under its lease  as well as any current correspondence that may have been had with the tenant  including property inspection reports 
for each real estate asset owned for which indicators of impairment exist  if the undiscounted cash flow analysis yields an amount which is less than the asset s carrying amount  an impairment loss is recorded to the extent that the estimated fair value exceeds the asset s carrying amount 
the estimated fair value is determined using a discounted cash flow model of the expected future cash flows through the useful life of the property 
real estate assets that are expected to be disposed of are valued at the lower of carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell on an individual asset basis 
we generally do not obtain any independent appraisals in determining value but rely on our own analysis and valuations 
any impairment charge taken with respect to any part of our real estate portfolio will reduce our net income and reduce assets and stockholders equity to the extent of the amount of any impairment charge  but it will not affect our cash flow or our distributions until such time as we dispose of the property 
item a 
qualitative and quantitative disclosures about market risk 
our primary market risk exposure is the effect of changes in interest rates on the interest cost of draws on our revolving variable rate credit facility and the effect of changes in the fair value of our interest rate swap agreement 
interest rates are highly sensitive to many factors  including governmental monetary and tax policies  domestic and international economic and political considerations and other factors beyond our control 
as of december   we had one interest rate swap agreement outstanding that has a notional value of million 
as of december  and  we had no interest rate swap agreements outstanding 
the fair market value of the interest rate swap is dependent upon existing market interest rates and swap spreads  which change over time 
as of december   if there had been a basis point increase in forward interest rates  the fair market value of the interest rate swap would have increased by approximately  if there were a basis point decrease in forward interest rates  the fair market value of the interest rate swap would have decreased by approximately  we utilize interest rate swaps to limit interest rate risk 
derivatives are used for hedging purposes rather than speculation 
we do not enter into financial instruments for trading purposes 
in connection with our long term mortgage debt  it bears interest at fixed rates and accordingly  the effect of changes in interest rates would not impact the amount of interest expense that we incur under these mortgages 
our credit facility is a revolving variable rate facility which is sensitive to interest rates 
under current market conditions  we do not believe that our risk of material potential losses in future earnings  fair values and or cash flows from near term changes in market rates that we consider reasonably possible is material 
we assessed the market risk for our revolving variable rate credit facility and believe that a increase in interest rates would cause a decrease in net income of  and a decrease would cause an increase in net income of  based on the million outstanding on our credit facility at december  the fair market value fmv of our long term debt is estimated based on discounting future cash flows at interest rates that our management believes reflect the risks associated with long term debt of similar risk and duration 
the following table sets forth our long term debt obligations by scheduled principal cash flow payments and maturity date  weighted average interest rates and estimated fmv at december  amounts in thousands for the year ended december there after total fmv fixed rate long term debt note weighted average interest rate variable rate long term debt note note included in is an million non recourse mortgage for which we have not made any payments since december  the mortgage is secured and cross collateralized by five properties formerly leased to circuit city 
we have entered into negotiations with representatives of the mortgagee relating to possible modifications of the mortgage 
this mortgage is scheduled to mature on december  note our credit line facility matures in march and bears interest at the lower of libor plus or the respective bank s prime rate
