item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations executive level overview was a year marked by a significant rapid increase in steel prices for the first seven months of the year followed by a significant and steep decline in steel prices during the last five months of the year 
our results were both favorably and unfavorably impacted by those swings but on the whole  both sales and profits benefitted from this environment in with a few exceptions at certain divisions  our sales volumes declined compared to  while our average selling prices were much higher 
these higher prices were the primary reason for the slight increase in net sales as well as the million lifo charge incurred in during  we purchased  shares of our common stock for approximately million pursuant to two separate board authorizations totaling million 
we have approximately million remaining on the second authorization that expires on december  from a cash flow perspective  highlights from are as follows we generated million of cash from operating activities proceeds from the sale of capital assets exceeded capital expenditures we repurchased million of our common stock million of debt was repaid while we expect to be challenged in by reduced sales volumes  reduced production volumes and a recessionary economic environment  we also expect to be profitable and to generate solid positive cash flow 
finally  in march  we completed an amendment to our revolving credit agreement which will provide us more flexibility in utilizing our cash to repurchase our common stock  acquire capital assets or enter into joint ventures without violating certain covenants

threaded products is also in the micro pile business and threads pipe used in earth and other structural stabilization 
developments we entered anticipating that while the uprr would continue to purchase concrete ties under our agreement  total purchases would be reduced as compared to levels 
during we took certain steps to mitigate this loss of business including reducing the workforce at both facilities  developing a new industrial concrete tie  as well as other efficiency efforts including extending the cure times of our concrete ties 
actual purchases by the uprr were approximately lower than prior year levels at our grand island  ne and tucson  az concrete tie facilities 
we anticipate that our concrete tie sales volumes to the uprr will continue into at similar levels 
in december  we entered into a preliminary agreement to sell approximately acres of real estate located in houston  tx used primarily by our tubular products segment with a purchase price of million 
this transaction closed on march  pursuant to the agreement  we leased back from the purchaser approximately acres of the real estate for a ten year term at a monthly rental rate of  per acre with annual increases for our threaded product operations 
we recorded a pre tax gain of approximately million upon closing of the sale and recorded a deferred gain of approximately million which will be amortized over the life of the lease  months 
currently  we are leasing approximately acres of this real estate 

table of contents in march  we recorded a gain of approximately million related to the receipt of escrow proceeds from a favorable working capital adjustment pursuant to the sale of our investment in the dm e railroad 
additionally in march  we negotiated the renewal of the collective bargaining agreement with our bedford  pa workforce represented by the shopmen s local union number this agreement  covering approximately employees  expires in march in may  the board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to million of the company s common shares until june  in october  the board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to an additional million of the company s common shares until december  at which time this authorization will expire 
pursuant to these announcements  the company purchased  shares for approximately million at an average price of 
for additional information regarding the company s share repurchase program  refer to part ii  item issuer purchases of equity securities on page critical accounting policies and estimates the company s significant accounting policies are described in note to the consolidated financial statements 
the accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
when more than one accounting principle  or the method of its application  is generally accepted  management selects the principle or method that is appropriate in the company s specific circumstance 
application of these accounting principles requires management to make estimates that affect the reported amount of assets  liabilities  revenues  and expenses  and the related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
the following critical accounting policies relate to the company s more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements 
there can be no assurance that actual results will not differ from those estimates 
asset impairment the company is required to test for asset impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset might not be recoverable 
the company applies statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets sfas in order to determine whether or not an asset is impaired 
this statement indicates that if the sum of the future expected cash flows associated with an asset  undiscounted and without interest charges  is less than the carrying value  an asset impairment must be recognized in the financial statements 
the amount of the impairment is the difference between the fair value of the asset and the carrying value of the asset 
the company believes that the accounting estimate related to an asset impairment is a critical accounting estimate as it is highly susceptible to change from period to period and because it requires management to make assumptions about the existence of impairment indicators and cash flows over future years 
these assumptions impact the amount of an impairment  which would have an impact on the income statement 
there have been no asset impairments recorded as of december  allowance for bad debts the company s operating segments encounter risks associated with the collection of accounts receivable 
as such  the company records a monthly provision for accounts receivable that are deemed uncollectible 
in order to calculate the appropriate monthly provision  the company reviews its accounts receivable aging and calculates an allowance through application of historic reserve factors to overdue receivables 
this calculation is supplemented by specific account reviews performed by the company s credit department 
as necessary  the application of the company s allowance rates to specific customers is reviewed and adjusted to more accurately reflect the credit risk inherent within that customer relationship 
the reserve is reviewed on a monthly basis 
an account receivable is written off against the allowance when management determines it is uncollectible 
the company believes that the accounting estimate related to the allowance for bad debts is a critical accounting estimate because the underlying assumptions used for the allowance can change from period to period and the allowance could potentially cause a material impact to the income statement 
specific customer circumstances and general economic conditions may vary significantly from management s assumptions and may impact expected earnings 
at december  and  the company maintained an allowance for bad debts of million and million  respectively 

table of contents product liability the company maintains a current liability for the repair or replacement of defective products 
for certain manufactured products  an accrual is made on a monthly basis as a percentage of cost of sales 
for long term construction projects  a liability is established when the claim is known and quantifiable 
the product liability accrual is periodically adjusted based on the identification or resolution of known individual product liability claims 
the company believes that this is a critical accounting estimate because the underlying assumptions used to calculate the liability can change from period to period 
at december  and  the product liability was million and million  respectively 
slow moving inventory the company maintains reserves for slow moving inventory 
these reserves  which are reviewed and adjusted routinely  take into account numerous factors such as quantities on hand versus turnover  product knowledge  and physical inventory observations 
the company believes this is a critical accounting estimate because the underlying assumptions used in calculating the reserve can change from period to period and could have a material impact on the income statement 
at december  and  the reserve for slow moving inventory was million and million  respectively 
revenue recognition on long term contracts revenues from long term contracts are recognized using the percentage of completion method based upon the proportion of actual costs incurred to estimated total costs 
for certain products  the percentage of completion is based upon the ratio of actual direct labor costs to estimated total direct labor costs 
as certain contracts extend over one or more years  revisions to estimates of costs and profits are reflected in the accounting period in which the facts that require the revisions become known 
historically  the company s estimates of total costs and costs to complete have reasonably approximated actual costs incurred to complete contracts 
at the time a loss on a contract becomes known  the entire amount of the estimated loss is recognized in the financial statements 
the company estimates the extent of progress towards completion  contract revenues and contract costs on its long term contracts 
the company believes these estimates are critical accounting estimates because they require the use of judgments due to uncertainties inherent in the estimation process 
as a result  actual revenues and profits could differ materially from estimates 
pension plans the calculation of the company s net periodic benefit cost pension expense and benefit obligation pension liability associated with its defined benefit pension plans pension plans requires the use of a number of assumptions that the company deems to be critical accounting estimates 
changes in these assumptions can result in a different pension expense and liability amounts  and future actual experience can differ significantly from the assumptions 
the company believes that the two most critical assumptions are the expected long term rate of return on plan assets and the assumed discount rate 
the expected long term rate of return reflects the average rate of earnings expected on funds invested or to be invested in the pension plans to provide for the benefits included in the pension liability 
the company establishes the expected long term rate of return at the beginning of each fiscal year based upon information available to the company at that time  including the plan s investment mix and the forecasted rates of return on these types of securities 
any differences between actual experience and assumed experience are deferred as an unrecognized actuarial gain or loss 
the unrecognized actuarial gains or losses are amortized in accordance with sfas no 
 employers accounting for pensions sfas 
the expected long term rate of return determined by the company for and was 
pension expense increases as the expected long term rate of return decreases 
the assumed discount rate reflects the current rate at which the pension benefits could effectively be settled 
in estimating that rate  sfas requires that the company looks to rates of return on high quality  fixed income investments 
the company s pension liability increases as the discount rate is reduced 
therefore  the decline in the assumed discount rate has the effect of increasing the company s pension obligation and future pension expense 
the assumed discount rate used by the company was and for and  respectively 
on december   the company adopted the recognition and disclosure provisions of sfas no 
 employers accounting for defined benefit pension plans and other postretirement plans an amendment of fasb statements no 
  and r  sfas 
sfas required the company to recognize the funded status of its defined benefit plans in the consolidated balance sheet  with a corresponding adjustment to 
table of contents accumulated other comprehensive income loss  net of tax 
the adjustment to accumulated comprehensive income loss at adoption represents the net unrecognized actuarial losses  unrecognized prior service costs  and unrecognized transition assets remaining from the initial adoption of sfas deferred tax assets the recognition of deferred tax assets requires management to make judgments regarding the future realization of these assets 
as prescribed by sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes sfas  valuation allowances must be provided for those deferred tax assets for which it is more likely than not a likelihood more than that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
sfas requires management to evaluate positive and negative evidence regarding the recoverability of deferred tax assets 
determination of whether the positive evidence outweighs the negative and quantification of the valuation allowance requires management to make estimates and judgments of future financial results 
the company believes that these estimates and judgments are critical accounting estimates 
in july  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
 accounting for uncertainty in income taxes an interpretation of fasb statement no 
fin 
this interpretation applies to all open tax positions accounted for in accordance with sfas this interpretation is intended to result in increased relevance and comparability in financial reporting of income taxes and to provide more information about the uncertainty in income tax assets and liabilities 
we adopted this interpretation on january  see note  income taxes 
the company s ability to realize these tax benefits may affect the company s reported income tax expense and net income 
new accounting pronouncements in february  the fasb issued sfas no 
 the fair value option for financial assets and financial liabilities  including an amendment of sfas no 
 sfas 
sfas permits entities to measure eligible financial assets  financial liabilities and firm commitments at fair value  on an instrument by instrument basis  that are otherwise not permitted to be accounted for at fair value under other accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the fair value measurement election is irrevocable and subsequent changes in fair value must be recorded in earnings 
the company already records derivative contracts at fair value in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  as amended sfas 
the adoption of sfas on january  had no impact on the company as management did not elect the fair value option for any other financial instruments or certain other assets and liabilities

fourth quarter of net income for the fourth quarter of was million per diluted share on net sales of million compared to net income for the prior year period of million per diluted share on net sales of million 
net income for the fourth quarter of includes a pre tax gain of million from the sale of our investment in the dm e railroad 
excluding this gain  earnings per diluted share were during the fourth quarter of 
table of contents sales increased million  or  compared to the prior year period 
rail products sales increased to million due to rail distribution and improved concrete ties sales at our spokane  wa facility 
our rail distribution business benefitted from both increases in sales volumes as well as a rising steel price environment 
our spokane  wa plant added an additional production line during the fourth quarter to accommodate increased concrete tie sales volumes 
additionally  customer requested delivery delays deferred sales from the third quarter into the current quarter 
these increases were offset by reduced sales throughout the remainder of the segment 
our track panel plant in pueblo  co ended its operations at the beginning of due to the loss of its contract with its main customer 
reductions in the volume of orders associated with our contract with the uprr for concrete ties had a negative impact at our grand island  ne  and tucson  az facilities 
lower volumes of concrete turnout ties at our spokane  wa facility also negatively impacted sales 
lastly  market conditions at our transit products division negatively impacted sales compared to the prior year period 
construction products sales increased  or million  compared to the fourth quarter of driven almost exclusively by piling sales 
this improvement is attributable to both rising structural steel prices and the expansion in the market presence of engineered solutions for open cells  of which our flat sheet piling is a main component  throughout north america 
our tubular products sales increased to million  or  in comparison to the prior year period 
our coated pipe facility in birmingham  al continued to experience solid demand from the energy market it serves 
partially offsetting this increase was our threaded products division experiencing reduced sales orders due to the rising price environment 
our gross profit margin decreased to  a reduction of percentage points  compared to the fourth quarter due  in part  to the negative impact of increased quarterly lifo charges of approximately million 
rail products profit margin decreased percentage points to largely due to the impact of significant drops in the price of scrap steel 
additionally  gross profit margins were suppressed from reduced sales volumes in track panels  concrete ties  turnout ties and transit products 
our grand island  ne concrete tie facility experienced additional margin compression from increased manufacturing variances 
these decreases were partially mitigated by margin improvement at our tucson  az facility and at our arp division 
the reduction of inefficiencies at our tucson  az concrete tie facility related to concrete mix design and operational issues has driven margin improvement 
finally  we achieved margin expansion at our arp division due to improved billing margins and reduced inventory obsolescence 
construction products gross profit margin increased percentage points to from the prior year period due to improvement in all divisions  primarily piling 
this improvement is attributable to our sales of open cell systems as well as the significant price increases in structural steel that occurred throughout improved production efficiencies and reduced obsolescence within our concrete buildings division also contributed to the margin improvement 
our tubular products gross margins expanded by basis points to resulting from increased higher margin micropile sales 
partially offsetting this improvement was our birmingham  al facility which suffered margin compression due to escalating material costs 
selling and administrative expenses increased to million from the same prior year period due to increased bad debt expense of million due principally to one customer as well as increased salaries 
interest expense decreased million from the fourth quarter of due to reduced borrowings and interest rates 
we generated million less in interest income due to reduced cash invested as well as reduced rates during the current quarter compared to the prior quarter 
income taxes from continuing operations for the fourth quarter of were recorded at approximately compared with the prior year period of 
the lower rate in the current period quarter was due primarily to an increase in the domestic production activities deduction

excluding the aforementioned pre tax gains and previously unrecorded dividend income  net income was per diluted share in compared to per diluted share in  an increase of  or  per diluted share 
selling and administrative expenses increased due to increases in salaries and a bad debt expense of approximately million recorded during the fourth quarter of related to one customer 
interest expense decreased due to reduced outstanding average borrowings during the current period as well as a reduction in the related interest rates 
due to the sale of our investment in the dm e railroad during the prior year period  dividend income was eliminated throughout the proceeds from this sale continued to be held in principally short term  tax free and taxable money market funds which generated interest income during compared to only the fourth quarter of we recognized pre tax gains from the receipt of dm e escrow proceeds received during and from the sale leaseback of our houston  tx threaded products facility 
the income tax provision from continuing operations was compared to in the lower rate in the prior year resulted from the dividends received deduction related to the dividend income recognized at the announcement of the sale of the dm e 
we have implemented numerous initiatives focused on curbing the growth in selling and administrative expenses including  but not limited to  wage and hiring freezes  elimination of overtime for administrative and plant personnel  mandatory reductions in travel and entertainment and a reduction of approximately million in planned capital expenditures 
taking into account these initiatives  the current economic climate will likely lead to decreased net income and earnings per diluted share during the year compared to the year company analysis for the year ended december   income from continuing operations was per diluted share 
income from continuing operations for the year ended december  included the pre tax gain of million from the sale of our dm e railroad investment and million of incremental dividend income recognized in the third quarter coincident with the announcement of this sale

including income from discontinued operations of per diluted share  which includes a gain on the sale of the company s former geotechnical division of approximately million  net income for was per diluted share 
selling and administrative expenses increased due to increases in employee related costs and benefit expenses including incentive compensation 
interest expense increased due to increased average borrowings during the first half of the year 
we were able to reduce outstanding borrowings during the second half of as a result of generating strong positive cash flows from operations 
at the announcement of the sale of the dm e railroad  we recognized million of previously unrecognized dividend income due from the dm e 
this increase was offset by the loss of million in dividend income which would have been recognized during the fourth quarter of we invested the proceeds received from the sale of the dm e railroad in a series of short term  tax free mutual funds resulting in the receipt of million of interest income during the fourth quarter 
the income tax provision from continuing operations was compared to for the lower rate in the prior year resulted from a release of valuation allowances

dollars in thousands net sales rail products gross profit rail products gross profit percentage the year compared to the year rail segment sales decreased primarily from the loss of our main track panel customer in the beginning of which ultimately led to the closure of our track panel plant in pueblo  co 
additionally  the reductions in the volume of orders for concrete ties negatively impacted our facilities in grand island  ne and tucson  az 
unfavorable market conditions have lowered our transit products sales while reducing our concrete turnout tie sales  produced in spokane  wa  compared to the prior year period 
partially offsetting these sales losses were stronger sales from our spokane  wa concrete tie facility where an increase in orders for cross ties led to the addition of a second production line in the fourth quarter of finally  increased orders from class railroads as well as an increase in steel prices benefited our arp division 
a combination of the positive effects of changes in product mix offset by the negative effects of drastically decreasing scrap steel prices in the second half of led to an increase in gross profit margins within our rail distribution division 
increased billing margins and reduced obsolescence and plant inefficiencies coupled with volume increases drove the margin expansion within our arp division 
the reduction of inefficiencies our tucson  az concrete tie plant experienced during due to labor force turnover  concrete mix design and operational issues led to margin improvement 
partially offsetting this growth was the negative impact of sales volume reductions in track panels and concrete turnout ties 
due to the recessionary economic environment that has negatively impacted freight railroad car loadings and our expectations that class railroad capital spending will decline by approximately  we anticipate rail products segment sales and gross profit to decline in the year compared to the year rail segment sales increased primarily as a result of increased revenues from rail distribution  which were driven mainly by new rail project work 
secondly  we produced and sold more concrete ties during than in the previous year due principally to production at our tucson  az facility 
represented a start up year for this facility and it produced and sold only minimal ties late in the fourth quarter 
our grand island  ne facility was also able to increase tie production in due to the installation of a fifth production line at the facility 
thirdly  our transit products division had improved sales from a strong backlog entering safetea lu  legislation that authorized funding for transit products  led to increased transit agency spending 
finally  our arp division benefited from increased sales at both our pueblo  co and niles  oh facilities 
increased plant efficiencies at our spokane  wa facility and a full year of production at our tucson  az tie facility contributed to our rail products gross margin expansion

dollars in thousands net sales construction products gross profit construction products gross profit percentage the year compared to the year all divisions within our construction products segment completed with improved sales over the prior year period led predominately by our piling division 
this improvement is attributable to both rising structural steel prices and the successful expansion throughout the north american market of engineered solutions for open cells  of which our flat sheet piling is a main component 
these increases more than offset decreases in sales of our h beam piling  due to reduced supplier production  and in pipe piling 
an increase in new orders and the completion of more unit installations during improved sales in our concrete buildings division 
lastly  an increased sales force in our fabricated products division fueled sales growth during the current period 
the increase in gross profit margin was led by volume related increases within our piling division for open cell systems  reduced less profitable h beam sales and an overall rising steel price environment during construction products also benefited from improved plant efficiencies within our concrete buildings division 
in addition to the current economic recession  a number of other factors are likely to impact our construction products segment sales and gross profit 
negative factors impacting these results include approximately states currently facing  or are projecting to have  budget deficits  federal legislation  safetea lu  authorizing transportation construction funding expiring in september  and the heavy civil and public works construction market that we participate in is currently softening nationwide 
these negative impacts could be positively offset  in part  by the american recovery and reinvestment act stimulus bill signed in the year compared to the year construction segment sales increased due primarily to piling and concrete buildings sales 
our h beam and pipe piling products drove the overall increase in piling sales  benefiting from a combination of both price increases and strong customer demand throughout these increases were partially offset by a decrease in bridge products revenues 
three large bridge jobs were completed during which had a positive impact on that period s sales 
construction products gross margin percentage increased as a result of improved performance across all product lines except concrete buildings 
our spokane  wa facility experienced high employee turnover leading to an inexperienced workforce that contributed to higher unfavorable plant variances at this facility

the return to more normal volumes at our coated pipe facility resulted in reduced absorption of plant expenses and led to reduced gross profit compared to the prior year period 
while we believe that the underlying fundamentals in the end markets served by our tubular products segment will remain strong in  the negative impact caused by the financial crisis will likely lead to negative pressure on our sales and gross profit 
the year compared to the year tubular segment sales increased due to sales volumes in both our coated pipe and threaded products divisions 
the coated pipe division s sales increased due to a strong energy market leading to the addition of a second shift during a portion of the second quarter and all of the third quarter of at our birmingham  al facility 
our threaded products division has benefited from its entrance into the micropile market and providing limited service to the oil country tubular goods market  both of which have added volume to our houston  tx facility
