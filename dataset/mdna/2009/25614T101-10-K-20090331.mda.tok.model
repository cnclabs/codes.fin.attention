these increases were offset by a decrease in digital solutions revenue as the company did not have any one significant sale of its digital solutions product line as it had in through the first nine months of  revenue had increased compared to the first nine months of primarily as a the result of the significant impact of royalty revenue recognized in the second quarter of along with a growth in the company s sales of its security and commercial printing 
however  during the fourth quarter of  revenue decreased as compared to as the company experienced declines in all of its major revenue categories

there are no direct costs associated with the company s license royalty revenue  as any related costs  such as sales commissions  legal fees  and travel fees  are classified in their respective operating expense categories 
legalstore 
com experienced a significant decline in margins as that division was impacted by a decline in sales against certain fixed costs of sales  along with a change in sales mix to items that sell at lower markups

trebuchet has also purchased  shares of the company s common stock for an aggregate purchase price of  the proceeds of which were used by the company to pay existing litigation cost 
in january  the company entered into two credit agreements to enhance its capital resources 
the first is the credit facility agreement with fagenson and co  inc  as agent for other unrelated lenders  or the fagenson credit agreement  for borrowings of up to a maximum of  until january  fagenson co  is a related party to robert b 
fagenson  the chairman of the company s board of directors

both fagenson and co  inc and mr 
white have waived these defaults through january  as of december   the company had outstanding  under the white credit agreement   under the fagenson credit agreement 
interest expense amounted to  for the year ending december   of which  is included in accrued expenses as of december  future capital needs the company expects to use its working capital to support its growth efforts in order to achieve consistent positive cash flow from operations 
at its current revenue levels  the company expects to continue to use cash for operations during at the pace experienced during the second half of the company estimates that it requires a revenue level of approximately million to million to breakeven on operating cash flow basis 
this revenue level is consistent with the pro forma revenue level of the company on a consolidated basis with its newly acquired commercial printing business  dpi secuprint 
the company believes that it can achieve this revenue level by the end of  if general economic conditions stabilize 
based on this expectation  the company has committed to focus its expenditures during on areas of research and development  and sales and marketing that support near term revenue opportunities 
to address its cash requirements to the extent not provided from operations  the company will seek to continue to reduce costs to a level commensurate to its revenue levels in order to reduce the operating cash requirements  to obtain additional equity financing  most likely though private placements  borrow funds from its two secured credit facilities  and seek certain refundable tax credits for which the company may be eligible 
as of december   the company has up to million available to it under its secured credit facilities  which the company believes will be sufficient along with cash from operations to fund its operations for the next twelve months 
in december  the company borrowed  of short term debt in conjunction with its acquisition of substantially all of the assets of dpi  a commercial printer 
the company expects that existing working capital at dpi will be sufficient to satisfy the payment of the  when due  in december furthermore  the company has two credit facilities with related parties that will be due in january the total amount due may by up to  if the company cannot generate sufficient cash from operations to pay these credit facilities down prior to their due dates 
in the event that the company cannot pay these credit facilities when due  the company believes that it will be able to extend the terms of these notes  or negotiate with the lenders other means of satisfying these credit facilities  including the payment of amounts due in the form of the company s equity 
however  there is no assurance that the company will be able to do so 
key indicators of future results we believe that cash flow from operations is a significant key indicator for the company 
our ability to reduce our use of cash will depend on our ability to grow revenue to a level sufficient to meet our operating expense requirements 
to grow revenue  we may merge with or acquire manufacturing or related companies 
our ability to successfully complete these transactions on favorable terms will be a significant key indicator of our future results 
these acquisitions may require additional funds that the company does not currently have 
to obtain additional investments in the future may require us to issue shares of our common stock 
our ability to sell our common stock on favorable terms will also be a significant key indicator of our future results 
in addition  we believe that our ability to successfully enforce our patent rights  including our current litigation against the european central bank  is a significant key indicator for the company 
off balance sheet arrangements we do not have any off balance sheet arrangements that have  or are reasonably likely to have  an effect on our financial condition  financial statements  revenues or expenses 
inflation although our operations are influenced by general economic conditions  we do not believe that inflation had a material effect on our results of operations during or as we are generally able to pass the increase in our material and labor costs to our customers  or absorb them as we improve the efficiency of our operations 
critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires management to make judgments  assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
the consolidated financial statements for the fiscal year ended december  describe the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
estimates are used for  but not limited to  the accounting for the allowance for doubtful accounts and sales returns  goodwill and long lived asset impairments  inventory allowances  revenue recognition  stock based compensation valuations  the valuation of intangible assets  and allocation of assets in business combinations 
actual results could differ from these estimates 
the following critical accounting policies are impacted significantly by judgments  assumptions and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements long lived assets the company accounts for long lived assets in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
this statement requires that long lived assets and certain identifiable intangibles be reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to future net undiscounted cash flows expected to be generate by the asset 
if such assets are considered to be impaired  the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets 
fair value is determined based on discounted cash flows or appraised values  depending on the nature of the assets 
fixed assets are carried at cost 
depreciation is computed over the estimated useful life of five to seven years using the straight line depreciation method 
leasehold improvements are amortized over the shorter of their useful life or the lease term 
intangible assets consist primarily of royalty rights  contractual rights  customer list  and patent acquisition  application and defense costs 
amortization is computed over the estimated useful life of five to twenty years using the straight line depreciation method 
for patent related assets  the remaining legal life of the patent is used as the estimated useful life unless circumstances determine that the useful life will be less than the legal life 
long lived assets to be held and used by the company are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
we periodically evaluate the recoverability of our long lived assets based on estimated future cash flows from and the estimated fair value of such long lived assets  and provide for impairment if such undiscounted cash flows are insufficient to recover the carrying amount of the long lived asset 
goodwill goodwill is the excess of cost of an acquired entity over the fair value of amounts assigned to assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination 
with the adoption of sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  goodwill is not amortized  rather it is tested for impairment annually  and will be tested for impairment between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would indicate the carrying amount may be impaired 
impairment testing for goodwill is done at a reporting unit level 
reporting units are one level below the business segment level  but are combined when reporting units within the same segment have similar economic characteristics 
under the criteria set forth by sfas no 
 the company has four reporting units based on the current structure 
an impairment loss generally would be recognized when the carrying amount of the reporting unit s net assets exceeds the estimated fair value of the reporting unit 
the company completed its assessment of any potential impairment upon adoption of this standard and performs annual assessments 
other intangible assets and patent defense costs other intangible assets consists of costs associated with the application  acquisition and defense of the company s patents  contractual rights to patents and trade secrets associated with the company s technologies  a non exclusive licensing agreement  and customer lists obtained as a result of acquisitions 
the company s patents and trade secrets are for document anti counterfeiting and anti scanning technologies and processes that form the basis of the company s document security business 
external legal costs incurred to defend the company s patents are capitalized to the extent of an evident increase in the value of the patents and an expected successful outcome  in accordance to guidance provided by fasb concept statement no 
and related guidance in aicpa technical questions and answers  section  other assets  paragraph  legal expenses incurred to defend patent infringement suit 
patent defense costs are expensed at the point when it is determined that the outcome is expected to be unsuccessful 
the company capitalizes the cost of an appeal until it is determined that the appeal will be unsuccessful 
the company s capitalized patent defense costs expenses are analyzed for impairment based on the expected eventual outcome of the legal action and recoverability of proceeds or added economic value of the patent in excess of the costs 
legal actions related to the same patent defense case are unified into one asset group for the purposes on the impairment analysis 
the company amortizes its other intangible assets over their estimated useful lives 
patents are amortized over the remaining legal life  up to years 
the company considers patent related amortization expense as an operating expense 
the company believes that the decision to incur patent costs is discretionary as the associated products or services can be sold prior to or during the application process 
we account for other intangible amortization as an operating expense  unless the underlyings asset in directly associated with the production or delivery of a product 
to date  the amount of related amortization expense for other intangible assets directly attributable to revenue recognized is not material

 accounting for income taxes sfas requires that a valuation allowance be established when management determines that it is more likely than not that all or a portion of a deferred tax asset will not be realized 
the company evaluates the realizability of its net deferred tax assets on an annual basis and any additional valuation allowances are provided or released  as necessary 
since the company has had cumulative losses in recent years  the accounting guidance suggest that we should not look to future earnings to support the realizability of the net deferred tax asset 
as a result  as of the years ended december  and  the company has recorded a valuation allowance to reduce its net deferred tax assets to zero in accordance with sfas see footnote for further analysis 
the company believes that the accounting estimates related to deferred tax valuation allowances are critical accounting estimates because the need for valuation allowance is highly susceptible to change from period to period due to changes in deferred tax asset and deferred tax liability balances  the need for valuation allowance is susceptible to actual operating results and changes in the tax valuation allowance can have a material impact on the tax provisions benefit in the consolidated statements of operations and on deferred income taxes in the consolidated balance sheets
