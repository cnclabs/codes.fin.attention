asset quality the bank s lending and credit policies require management to review regularly the bank s loan portfolio so that the bank can monitor the quality of its assets 
if during the ordinary course of business  management becomes aware that a borrower may not be able to meet the contractual or payment obligations under a loan  then that loan is supervised more closely with consideration given to placing the loan on non accrual status  the need for an additional allowance for loan losses  and if appropriate partial or full charge off 
under the bank s current policy  a loan will generally be placed on a non accrual status if interest or principal is past due days or more  or in cases where management deems the full collection of principal and interest unlikely 
when a loan is placed on non accrual status  any current year unpaid accrued interest is reversed against current income and any unpaid accrued interest from the prior year is reversed against the allowance for loan losses 
thereafter  any payment is generally first applied towards the principal balance 
depending on the circumstances  management may elect to continue the accrual of interest on certain past due loans if partial payment is received or the loan is well collateralized  and in the process of collection 
the loan is generally returned to accrual status when the borrower has brought the past due principal and interest payments current and  in the opinion of management  the borrower has demonstrated the ability to make future payments of principal and interest as scheduled 
a non accrual loan may also be returned to accrual status if all principal and interest contractually due are reasonably assured of repayment within a reasonable period and there has been a sustained period of payment performance

competition the banking business in california and the other markets served by the bank is highly competitive 
the bank competes for deposits and loans with other commercial banks  savings and loan associations  brokerage houses  insurance companies  mortgage companies  credit unions  credit card companies  and other financial and non financial institutions and entities 
the bank also competes with other banks of similar size that are focused on servicing the same communities that are served by the bank 
in addition  the bank competes with other entities both governmental and private industry that are seeking to raise capital through the issuance and sale of debt and equity securities 
many of these competitors have substantially greater financial  marketing  and administrative resources than the bank and may also offer services that are not offered directly by the bank  all of which results in greater and more intense competition for the bank 
in addition  current federal legislation encourages increased competition between different types of financial institutions and has encouraged new entrants to enter the financial services market 
competitive conditions are expected to continue to intensify as legislation is enacted which will have the effect of  among other things  i eliminating historical barriers that limited participation by certain institutions in certain markets  ii increasing the cost of doing business for banks  and or iii affecting the competitive balance between banks and other financial and non financial institutions and entities 
technological factors  such as on line banking and brokerage services  and economic factors are also expected to increase competitive conditions 
to compete with other financial institutions in its primary service areas  the bank relies principally upon local promotional activities  personal contacts by its officers  directors  employees  and stockholders  extended hours on weekdays  saturday banking  sunday banking in certain locations  internet banking  an internet website www

the following discussion of statutes and regulations is a summary and does not purport to be complete 
this discussion is qualified in its entirety by reference to the statutes and regulations referred to in this discussion 
from time to time  federal and state legislation is enacted which may have the effect of materially increasing the cost of doing business  limiting or expanding permissible activities  or affecting the competitive balance between banks and other financial services providers 
several proposals for legislation that could substantially intensify the regulation of the financial services industry including a possible comprehensive overhaul of the financial institutions regulatory system are expected to be introduced and possibly enacted in the new congress in response to the current economic downturn and financial industry instability 
other legislative and regulatory initiatives which could affect the bancorp and the bank and the banking industry in general are pending  and additional initiatives may be proposed or introduced  before the congress  the california legislature  and other governmental bodies in the future 
such proposals  if enacted  may further alter the structure  regulation  and competitive relationship among financial institutions  and may subject the bancorp and the bank to increased regulation  disclosure  and reporting requirements 
in addition  the various banking regulatory agencies often adopt new rules and regulations to implement and enforce existing legislation 
it cannot be predicted whether  or in what form  any such legislation or regulations may be enacted or the extent to which the business of the bancorp or the bank would be affected thereby 
we cannot predict whether or when potential legislation will be enacted  and if enacted  the effect that it  or any implemented regulations and supervisory policies  would have on our financial condition or results of operations 
recent economic developments  legislation and regulatory initiatives negative developments beginning in the latter half of in the sub prime mortgage market and the securitization markets for such loans and other factors have resulted in uncertainty in the financial markets in general and a related general economic downturn  which continued through and are anticipated to continue at least well through dramatic declines in the housing market  with decreasing home prices and increasing delinquencies and foreclosures  have negatively impacted the credit performance of mortgage and residential construction loans and resulted in significant write downs of assets by many financial institutions 
in addition  the values of real estate collateral supporting many commercial as well as residential loans have declined and may continue to decline 
general downward economic trends  reduced availability of commercial credit and increasing unemployment have negatively impacted the credit performance of commercial and consumer credit  resulting in additional write downs 
concerns over the stability of the financial markets and the economy have resulted in decreased lending by financial institutions to their customers and to each other 
this market turmoil and tightening of credit has led to increased commercial and consumer delinquencies  lack of customer confidence  increased market volatility and widespread reduction in general business activity 
competition among depository institutions for deposits has increased significantly 
bank and bank holding company stock prices have been significantly negatively affected as has the ability of banks and bank holding companies to raise capital or borrow in the debt markets compared to recent years 
the bank regulatory agencies have been very aggressive in responding to concerns and trends identified in examinations  and this has resulted in the increased issuance of enforcement orders and other supervisory actions requiring action to address credit quality  liquidity and risk management and capital adequacy  as well as other safety and soundness concerns 
on february   the us treasury and the federal bank regulatory agencies announced in a joint statement a new financial stability plan which would include additional capital support for banks under a capital assistance program  a public private investment fund to address existing bank loan portfolios and expanded funding for the federal reserve board s pending term asset backed securities loan facility to restart lending and the securitization markets 
on february   the american recovery and reinvestment act of arra was signed into law by president obama 
the arra includes a wide variety of programs intended to stimulate the economy and provide for extensive infrastructure  energy  health  and education needs 
in addition  the arra imposes certain new executive compensation and corporate expenditure limits on all current and future tarp recipients  including the company  until the institution has repaid the us treasury  which is now permitted under the arra without penalty and without the need to raise new capital  subject to the us treasury s consultation with the recipient s appropriate regulatory agency 
the executive compensation standards are more stringent than those currently in effect under the tarp capital purchase program or those previously proposed by the us treasury 
the new standards include but are not limited to i prohibitions on bonuses  retention awards and other incentive compensation  other than restricted stock grants which do not fully vest during the tarp period up to one third of an employee s total annual compensation  ii prohibitions on golden parachute payments for departure from a company  iii an expanded clawback of bonuses  retention awards  and incentive compensation if payment is based on materially inaccurate statements of earnings  revenues  gains or other criteria  iv prohibitions on compensation plans that encourage manipulation of reported earnings  v retroactive review of bonuses  retention awards and other compensation previously provided by tarp recipients if found by the us treasury to be inconsistent with the purposes of tarp or otherwise contrary to public interest  vi required establishment of a company wide policy regarding excessive or luxury expenditures  and vii inclusion in a participant s proxy statements for annual shareholder meetings of a nonbinding say on pay shareholder vote on the compensation of executives 
on february   the us treasury and the federal bank regulatory agencies issued a joint statement providing further guidance with respect to the capital assistance program cap announced february   including i that the cap will be initiated on february  and will include stress test assessments of major banks and that should the stress test indicate that an additional capital buffer is warranted  institutions will have an opportunity to turn first to private sources of capital  otherwise the temporary capital buffer will be made available from the government  ii such additional government capital will be in the form of mandatory convertible preferred shares  which would be converted into common equity shares only as needed over time to keep banks in a well capitalized position and can be retired under improved financial conditions before the conversion becomes mandatory  and iii previous capital injections under the tarp capital purchase program will also be eligible to be exchanged for the mandatory convertible preferred shares 
the conversion of preferred shares to common equity shares would enable institutions to maintain or enhance the quality of their capital by increasing their tangible common equity capital ratios  however  such conversions would necessarily dilute the interests of existing shareholders 
on february   the first day the cap program was initiated  the us treasury released the actual terms of the program  stating that the purpose of the cap is to restore confidence throughout the financial system that the nation s largest banking institutions have a sufficient capital cushion against larger than expected future losses  should they occur due to a more severe economic environment  and to support lending to creditworthy borrowers 
under the cap terms  eligible us banking institutions with assets in excess of billion on a consolidated basis are required to participate in coordinated supervisory assessments  which are forward looking stress test assessments to evaluate the capital needs of the institution under a more challenging economic environment 
should this assessment indicate the need for the bank to establish an additional capital buffer to withstand more stressful conditions  these larger institutions may access the cap immediately as a means to establish any necessary additional buffer or they may delay the cap funding for six months to raise the capital privately 
eligible us banking institutions with assets below billion may also obtain capital from the cap 
the cap program does not replace the tarp capital purchase program  but is an additional program to the tarp capital purchase program  and is open to eligible institutions regardless of whether they participated in the tarp capital purchase program 
the deadline to apply to the cap is may  recipients of capital under the cap will be subject to the same executive compensation requirements as if they had received tarp capital purchase program 
the eesa also increased federal deposit insurance corporation fdic deposit insurance on most accounts from  to  this increase is in place until the end of with no increase in deposit insurance premiums paid by the banking industry 
in addition  the fdic has implemented two temporary liquidity programs to i provide deposit insurance for the full amount of most non interest bearing transaction accounts the transaction account guarantee through the end of and ii guarantee certain unsecured debt of financial institutions and their holding companies through june under a temporary liquidity guarantee program the debt guarantee program and together the tlgp 
the company and the bank have elected to participate in the debt guarantee program  but do not expect to issue any debt under the temporary liquidity guarantee program tlgp 
the fdic charges systemic risk special assessments to depository institutions that participate in the tlgp 
the fdic has recently proposed that congress give the fdic expanded authority to charge fees to those holding companies which benefit directly and indirectly from the fdic guarantees 
bank holding company regulation the bancorp is a bank holding company within the meaning of the bank holding company act bhca and is registered as such with the federal reserve board 
a bank holding company is required to file with the federal reserve board annual reports and other information regarding its business operations and those of its non banking subsidiaries 
it is also subject to supervision and examination by the federal reserve board 
examinations are designed to inform the federal reserve board of the financial condition and nature of the operations of the bank holding company and its subsidiaries and to monitor compliance with the bhca and other laws affecting the operations of bank holding companies 
to determine whether potential weaknesses in the condition or operations of bank holding companies might pose a risk to the safety and soundness of their subsidiary banks  examinations focus on whether a bank holding company has adequate systems and internal controls in place to manage the risks inherent in its business  including credit risk  interest rate risk  market risk for example  from changes in value of portfolio instruments and foreign currency  liquidity risk  operational risk  legal risk  and reputation risk 
bank holding companies may be subject to potential enforcement actions by the federal reserve board for unsafe or unsound practices in conducting their businesses or for violations of any law  rule  regulation or any condition imposed in writing by the federal reserve board enforcement actions may include the issuance of cease and desist orders  the imposition of civil money penalties  the requirement to meet and maintain specific capital levels for any capital measure  the issuance of directives to increase capital  formal and informal agreements  or removal and prohibition orders against officers or directors and other institution affiliated parties 
bank holding companies are subject to capital maintenance requirements on a consolidated basis that are parallel to those required for banks 
see capital adequacy requirements below 
further  a bank holding company is required to serve as a source of financial and managerial strength to its subsidiary banks and may not conduct its operations in an unsafe or unsound manner 
in addition  it is the federal reserve board s view that  in serving as a source of strength to its subsidiary banks  a bank holding company should stand ready to use available resources to provide adequate capital funds to its subsidiary banks during periods of financial stress or adversity and should maintain financial flexibility and capital raising capacity to obtain additional resources for assisting its subsidiary banks 
a bank holding company s failure to meet its source of strength obligations may constitute an unsafe and unsound practice or a violation of the federal reserve board s regulations  or both 
the source of strength doctrine most directly affects bank holding companies where a bank holding company s subsidiary bank fails to maintain adequate capital levels 
in such a situation  the subsidiary bank will be required by the bank s federal regulator to take prompt corrective action 
the prompt corrective action regulatory framework is discussed below 
see prompt corrective action provisions below 
under the prompt corrective action regulations  the subsidiary bank will be required to submit to its federal regulator a capital restoration plan and to comply with the plan 
each parent company that controls the subsidiary bank will be required to provide assurances of compliance by the bank with the capital restoration plan 
however  the aggregate liability of such parent companies will not exceed the lesser of i of the bank s total assets at the time it became undercapitalized and ii the amount necessary to bring the bank into compliance with the plan 
failure to restore capital under a capital restoration plan can result in the bank s being placed into receivership if it becomes critically undercapitalized 
a bank subject to prompt corrective action also may affect its parent bank holding company in other ways 
these include possible restrictions or prohibitions on dividends to the parent bank holding company by the bank  subordinated debt payments to the parent  and other transactions between the bank and the holding company 
in addition  the regulators may impose restrictions on the ability of the holding company itself to pay dividends  require divestiture of holding company affiliates that pose a significant risk to the bank  or require divestiture of the undercapitalized subsidiary bank 
a bank holding company is generally required to give the federal reserve board prior notice of any redemption or repurchase of its own equity securities  if the consideration to be paid  together with the consideration paid for any repurchases in the preceding year  is equal to or more of the company s consolidated net worth 
a bank holding company is also required to obtain federal reserve board approval before acquiring  directly or indirectly  ownership or control of any voting shares of any bank if it would thereby directly or indirectly own or control more than of the voting stock of that bank  unless it already owns a majority of the voting stock 
prior approval from the federal reserve is also required in connection with the acquisition of control of a bank or another bank holding company  or business combinations with another bank holding company 
the business activities and investments of bank holding companies are also regulated by the bhca 
bank holding companies  as a general rule  are prohibited from acquiring direct or indirect control of more than of the outstanding voting shares of any company that is not engaged in the business of banking or managing or controlling banks or furnishing services to or performing services for its subsidiary banks 
however  subject to certain prior approval or notification to the federal reserve board  bank holding companies are permitted to engage directly or indirectly through a subsidiary  or acquire shares of companies engaged in those activities determined by the federal reserve board to be so closely related to banking as to be deemed a proper incident thereto 
as a general rule  such closely related activities do not include underwriting or dealing in securities or underwriting of insurance 
activities that are determined to be financial in nature or are incidental or complementary to such activities may be engaged in without prior federal reserve approval or notice by bank holding companies that elect and continue to meet the requirements to maintain financial holding company status under the bhca 
pursuant to the gramm leach bliley financial modernization act of glba  in order to elect and retain financial holding company status  all depository institution subsidiaries of a bank holding company must be well capitalized  well managed  and  except in limited circumstances  be in satisfactory compliance with the community reinvestment act cra 
failure to sustain compliance with these requirements or correct any non compliance within a fixed time period could lead to divestiture of subsidiary banks or require all activities to conform to those permissible for a bank holding company 
financial activities are broadly defined to include not only banking  insurance  and securities activities  but also merchant banking and additional activities that the federal reserve board  in consultation with the secretary of the treasury  determines to be financial in nature  incidental to such financial activities  or complementary activities that do not pose a substantial risk to the safety and soundness of depository institutions or the financial system generally 
the bancorp has not elected financial holding company status even though it qualifies to do so 
the bancorp is also a bank holding company within the meaning of section of the california financial code 
therefore  the bancorp and any of its subsidiaries are subject to examination by  and may be required to file reports with  the california department of financial institutions 
securities exchange act of the bancorp s common stock is publicly held and listed on nasdaq  and the bancorp is subject to the periodic reporting  information  proxy solicitation  insider trading  corporate governance and other requirements and restrictions of the securities exchange act of and the regulations of the securities and exchange commission promulgated hereunder and the listing requirements of nasdaq 
sarbanes oxley act the sarbanes oxley act of implemented legislative reforms applicable to companies with securities traded publicly in the united states 
the sarbanes oxley act is intended to address corporate and accounting fraud and contains provisions dealing with corporate governance and management  disclosure  oversight of the accounting profession  and auditor independence 
although the bancorp has incurred and expects to continue to incur additional expenses in complying with the provisions of the sarbanes oxley act  it does not expect that compliance will have a material effect on its financial condition or results of operations 
bank regulation as a california commercial bank whose deposits are insured by the fdic  the bank is subject to regulation  supervision  and regular examination by the california department of financial institutions dfi and the fdic  and must comply with applicable regulations of the federal reserve board 
specific federal and state laws and regulations which are applicable to banks regulate  among other things  the scope of their business  their investments  their reserves against deposits  the timing of the availability of deposited funds  its activities relating to dividends  investments  loans  the nature and amount of and collateral for certain loans  borrowings  capital requirements  certain check clearing activities  branching  and mergers and acquisitions 
supervision  examination and enforcement actions by these agencies are generally intended to protect depositors  creditors  borrowers and the deposit insurance fund and generally are not intended for the protection of stockholders 
under the california financial code  california banks have all the powers of a california corporation  subject to the general limitation of state bank powers under the federal deposit insurance act fdia to those permissible for national banks 
california banks may engage in the commercial banking business  which generally encompasses lending  deposit taking  and all other kinds of banking business in which banks  including national banks  customarily engage in the united states 
further  california banks may form subsidiaries to engage in the non banking activities commonly conducted by national banks in operating subsidiaries 
federal law prohibits the bank and its subsidiaries from engaging in any banking activities in which a national bank acting as principal rather than agent cannot engage  unless the activity is found by the fdic not to pose a significant risk to the deposit insurance fund 
this prohibition does not extend to those activities in which the bank or a subsidiary of the bank is authorized under state law to engage as agent  advisor  custodian  administrator  or trustee for its customer 
in addition  under glba  the bank may engage in expanded financial activities through specially qualified financial subsidiaries to the same extent as a national bank 
in order to form a financial subsidiary  the bank must be well capitalized and would be subject to the same capital deduction  risk management and affiliate transaction rules as apply to national banks 
generally  a financial subsidiary is permitted to engage in activities as may a financial holding company that are financial in nature or incidental thereto  even though they are not permissible for the national bank to conduct directly within the bank 
however  a bank financial subsidiary may not engage as principal in underwriting insurance other than credit life insurance  issue annuities  or engage in real estate development or investment or merchant banking 
presently  none of the bank s subsidiaries are financial subsidiaries 
the bank operates branches and or loan production offices in california  new york  illinois  massachusetts  texas  washington and new jersey 
while the california department of financial institutions remains the bank s primary state regulator  the bank s operations in these jurisdictions are subject to examination and supervision by local bank regulators  and transactions with customers in those jurisdictions are subject to local laws  including consumer protection laws 
the bank also operates a branch in hong kong and representative offices in taipei and in shanghai 
the operations of these offices and limits on the scope of their activities and the hong kong branch are subject to local law in those jurisdictions in addition to regulation and supervision by the california department of financial institutions and the federal reserve board 
deposit insurance the fdic is an independent federal agency that insures deposits  up to prescribed statutory limits  of federally insured banks and savings institutions and safeguards the safety and soundness of the banking and savings industries 
the fdic insures our customer deposits through the dif up to prescribed limits for each depositor 
pursuant to the eesa  the maximum deposit insurance amount has been increased from  to  the amount of fdic assessments paid by each dif member institution is based on its relative risk of default as measured by regulatory capital ratios and other supervisory factors 
pursuant to the federal deposit insurance reform act of  the fdic is authorized to set the reserve ratio for the dif annually at between and of estimated insured deposits 
the fdic may increase or decrease the assessment rate schedule on a semi annual basis 
in an effort to restore capitalization levels and to ensure the dif will adequately cover projected losses from future bank failures  the fdic  in october  proposed a rule to alter the way in which it differentiates for risk in the risk based assessment system and to revise deposit insurance assessment rates  including base assessment rates 
first quarter assessment rates were increased to between and cents for every of domestic deposits  with most banks paying between and cents 
on february   the fdic approved an interim rule to institute a one time special assessment of cents per in domestic deposits to restore the dif reserves depleted by recent bank failures 
the interim rule additionally reserves the right of the fdic to charge an additional up to basis point special premium at a later point if the dif reserves continue to fall 
the fdic also approved an increase in regular premium rates for the second quarter of for most banks this will be between to basis points per in domestic deposits 
premiums for the rest of have not yet been set 
additionally  by participating in the fdic s tlgp  banks temporarily become subject to an additional assessment on deposits in excess of  in certain transaction accounts and additionally for assessments from basis points to basis points per annum depending on the initial maturity of the debt 
further  all fdic insured institutions are required to pay assessments to the fdic to fund interest payments on bonds issued by the financing corporation fico  an agency of the federal government established to recapitalize the predecessor to the dif 
the fico assessment rates  which are determined quarterly  averaged of insured deposits in fiscal these assessments will continue until the fico bonds mature in the fdic may terminate a depository institution s deposit insurance upon a finding that the institution s financial condition is unsafe or unsound or that the institution has engaged in unsafe or unsound practices that pose a risk to the dif or that may prejudice the interest of the bank s depositors 
the termination of deposit insurance for a bank would also result in the revocation of the bank s charter by the dfi 
capital adequacy requirements the bank as well as the bancorp is subject to capital adequacy guidelines and prompt corrective action regulations 
those regulations incorporate both risk based and leverage capital requirements 
these capital adequacy guidelines define capital in terms of core capital elements  or tier capital  and supplemental capital elements  or tier capital 
tier capital is generally defined as the sum of the core capital elements less goodwill and certain other deductions  notably the unrealized net gains or losses after tax adjustments on available for sale investment securities carried at fair value 
the following items are included as core capital elements i common shareholders equity  ii qualifying non cumulative perpetual preferred stock and related surplus  including trust preferred securities but not in excess of of tier capital  and iii minority interests in the equity accounts of consolidated subsidiaries 
supplementary capital elements include i allowance for loan and lease losses but not more than of an institution s risk weighted assets  ii perpetual preferred stock and related surplus not qualifying as core capital  iii hybrid capital instruments  perpetual debt and mandatory convertible debt instruments  and iv term subordinated debt and intermediate term preferred stock and related surplus 
the maximum amount of supplemental capital elements which qualifies as tier capital is limited to of tier capital 
the minimum required ratio of qualifying total capital to total risk weighted assets  or the total risk based capital ratio  is  at least one half of which must be in the form of tier capital  and the minimum required ratio of tier capital to total risk weighted assets  or the tier risk based capital ratio  is 
risk based capital ratios are calculated to provide a measure of capital that reflects the degree of risk associated with a banking organization s operations for both transactions reported on the balance sheet as assets  and transactions  such as letters of credit and recourse arrangements  which are recorded as off balance sheet items 
under the risk based capital guidelines  the nominal dollar amounts of assets and credit equivalent amounts of off balance sheet items are multiplied by one of several risk adjustment percentages  which range from for assets with low credit risk  such as certain us treasury securities  to for assets with relatively high credit risk  such as business loans 
as of december   the bank s total risk based capital ratio was and its tier risk based capital ratio was 
as of december   the bancorp s total risk based capital ratio was and its tier risk based capital ratio was the risk based capital requirements also take into account concentrations of credit ie  relatively large proportions of loans involving one borrower  industry  location  collateral or loan type and the risks of non traditional activities those that have not customarily been part of the banking business 
the regulations require institutions with high or inordinate levels of risk to operate with higher minimum capital standards and authorize the regulators to review an institution s management of such risks in assessing an institution s capital adequacy 
the risk based capital regulations also include exposure to interest rate risk as a factor that the regulators will consider in evaluating a bank s capital adequacy 
interest rate risk is the exposure of a bank s current and future earnings and equity capital arising from adverse movements in interest rates 
while interest risk is inherent in a bank s role as financial intermediary  it introduces volatility to bank earnings and to the economic value of the institution 
bank holding companies and banks engaged in significant trading activity trading assets constituting or more of total assets  or billion or more may also be subject to the market risk capital guidelines and be required to incorporate additional market and interest rate risk components into their risk based capital standards 
neither the bancorp nor the bank is currently subject to the market risk capital rules 
the bancorp and the bank are also required to maintain a leverage capital ratio designed to supplement the risk based capital guidelines 
banks and bank holding companies that have received the highest rating of the five categories used by regulators to rate banks and that are not anticipating or experiencing any significant growth must maintain a ratio of tier capital net of all intangibles to adjusted total assets of at least 
all other institutions are required to maintain a leverage ratio of at least to basis points above the minimum  for a minimum of to 
pursuant to federal regulations  banks must maintain capital levels commensurate with the level of risk to which they are exposed  including the volume and severity of problem loans 
federal regulators may  however  set higher capital requirements when a bank s particular circumstances warrant 
as of december   the bank s leverage capital ratio was  and the bancorp s leverage capital ratio was  both ratios exceeding regulatory minimums 
the current risk based capital guidelines which apply to the company and the bank are based upon the capital accord of the international basel committee on banking supervision  a committee of central banks and bank supervisors regulators from the major industrialized countries that develops broad policy guidelines for use by each country s supervisors in determining the supervisory policies they apply 
a new international accord  referred to as basel ii  which emphasizes internal assessment of credit  market and operational risk  supervisory assessment and market discipline in determining minimum capital requirements  became mandatory for large or core international banks outside the us in total assets of billion or more or consolidated foreign exposures of billion or more  is optional for others  and if adopted  must first be complied with in a parallel run for two years along with the existing basel i standards 
in january  the basel committee proposed to reconsider regulatory capital standards  supervisory and risk management requirements and additional disclosures in the final new accord in response to recent worldwide developments 
in july  the us federal banking agencies issued a proposed rule that would give banking organizations that do not use the basel ii advanced approaches the option to implement a new risk based capital framework 
this framework would adopt the standardized approach of basel ii for credit risk  the basic indicator approach of basel ii for operational risk  and related disclosure requirements 
while this proposed rule generally parallels the relevant approaches under basel ii  it diverges where united states markets have unique characteristics and risk profiles  most notably with respect to risk weighting residential mortgage exposures 
a definitive final rule has not been issued 
the us banking agencies have indicated  however  that they will retain the minimum leverage requirement for all us banks 
prompt corrective action provisions federal law requires each federal banking agency to take prompt corrective action when a bank falls below one or more prescribed minimum capital ratios 
the federal banking agencies have by regulation defined the following five capital categories well capitalized total risk based capital ratio of  tier risk based capital ratio of  and leverage capital ratio of and not subject to any order or written directive by any regulatory authority to meet and maintain a specific capital level for any capital measure  adequately capitalized total risk based capital ratio of  tier risk based capital ratio of  and leverage capital ratio of or if the institution receives the highest rating from its primary regulator  undercapitalized total risk based capital ratio of less than  tier risk based capital ratio of less than  or leverage capital ratio of less than or if the institution receives the highest rating from its primary regulator  significantly undercapitalized total risk based capital ratio of less than  tier risk based capital ratio of less than  or leverage capital ratio less than  and critically undercapitalized tangible equity to total assets less than 
a bank may be treated as though it were in the next lower capital category if after notice and the opportunity for a hearing  the appropriate federal agency finds an unsafe or unsound condition or practice so warrants  but no bank may be treated as critically undercapitalized unless its actual capital ratio warrants such treatment 
undercapitalized banks are required to submit capital restoration plans and  during any period of capital inadequacy  may not pay dividends or make other capital distributions  are subject to asset growth and expansion restrictions and may not be able to accept brokered deposits 
at each successively lower capital category  banks are subject to increased restrictions on operations 
the federal banking agencies have also adopted non capital safety and soundness standards to assist examiners in identifying and addressing potential safety and soundness concerns before capital becomes impaired 
the guidelines set forth operational and managerial standards relating to i internal controls  information systems and internal audit systems  ii loan documentation  iii credit underwriting  iv asset quality and growth  v earnings  vi risk management  and vii compensation and benefits 
in general  the standards are designed to assist the federal banking agencies in identifying and addressing problems at insured depository institutions before capital becomes impaired 
if an institution fails to meet safety and soundness standards  the appropriate federal banking agency may require the institution to submit a compliance plan and institute enforcement proceedings if an acceptable compliance plan is not submitted or the deficiency is not corrected 
dividends holders of the bancorp s common stock and preferred stock are entitled to receive dividends as and when declared by the board of directors out of funds legally available therefore under the laws of the state of delaware 
delaware corporations such as the bancorp may make distributions to their stockholders out of their surplus  or out of their net profits for the fiscal year in which the dividend is declared and for the preceding fiscal year 
however  dividends may not be paid out of a corporation s net profits if  after the payment of the dividend  the corporation s capital would be less than the capital represented by the issued and outstanding stock of all classes having a preference upon the distribution of assets 
the federal reserve board has advised bank holding companies that it believes that payment of cash dividends in excess of current earnings from operations is inappropriate and may be cause for supervisory action 
as a result of this policy  banks and their holding companies may find it difficult to pay dividends out of retained earnings from historical periods prior to the most recent fiscal year or to take advantage of earnings generated by extraordinary items such as sales of buildings or other large assets in order to generate profits to enable payment of future dividends 
further  the federal reserve board s position that holding companies are expected to provide a source of managerial and financial strength to their subsidiary banks potentially restricts a bank holding company s ability to pay dividends 
the bank is a legal entity that is separate and distinct from its holding company 
the bancorp receives income through dividends paid by the bank 
subject to the regulatory restrictions described below  future cash dividends by the bank will depend upon management s assessment of future capital requirements  contractual restrictions  and other factors 
the powers of the board of directors of the bank to declare a cash dividend to its holding company is subject to california law  which restricts the amount available for cash dividends to the lesser of a bank s retained earnings or net income for its last three fiscal years less any distributions to shareholders made during such period 
where the above test is not met  cash dividends may still be paid  with the prior approval of the dfi in an amount not exceeding the greatest of retained earnings of the bank  the net income of the bank for its last fiscal year  or the net income of the bank for its current fiscal year 
the amount of retained earnings available for cash dividends to the bancorp immediately after december   is restricted to approximately million under this regulation 
bank regulators also have authority to prohibit a bank from engaging in business practices considered to be unsafe or unsound 
it is possible  depending upon the financial condition of a bank and other factors  that such regulators could assert that the payment of dividends or other payments might  under certain circumstances  be an unsafe or unsound practice  even if technically permissible 
under the terms of the tarp capital purchase program  for so long as any preferred stock issued under the tarp capital purchase program remains outstanding  the bancorp is prohibited from increasing dividends on its common stock  and from making certain repurchases of equity securities  including its common stock  without the treasury s consent until the third anniversary of the treasury s investment or until the treasury has transferred all of the preferred stock it purchased under the tarp capital purchase program to third parties 
as long as the preferred stock issued to the treasury is outstanding  as well as the bancorp s series b preferred stock  dividend payments and repurchases or redemptions relating to certain equity securities  including the bancorp s common stock  are also prohibited until all accrued and unpaid dividends are paid on such preferred stock  subject to certain limited exceptions 
see the sections capital resources and liquidity of the management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in item of this annual report on form k 
safety and soundness standards and enforcement actions the federal banking agencies have adopted guidelines establishing safety and soundness standards for all insured depository institutions 
those guidelines set forth managerial and operational standards relating to i internal controls and information systems  ii internal audit systems  iii loan documentation  iv credit underwriting  v  interest rate exposure  vi asset growth  vii asset quality  viii earnings and ix compensation and benefits 
in general  the standards are designed to assist the federal banking agencies in identifying and addressing problems at insured depository institutions before capital becomes impaired 
if an institution fails to meet safety and soundness standards  the appropriate federal banking agency may require the institution to submit a compliance plan and institute enforcement proceedings if an acceptable compliance plan is not submitted or the deficiency is not corrected 
the regulatory structure gives the bank regulatory agencies extensive discretion in connection with their supervisory and enforcement activities and examination policies  including policies with respect to the classification of assets and the establishment of adequate loan loss reserves for regulatory purposes 
if  as a result of an examination  the dfi or the fdic should determine that the financial condition  capital resources  asset quality  earnings prospects  management  liquidity  or other aspects of the bank s operations are unsatisfactory or that the bank or its management is violating or has violated any law or regulation or any condition imposed in writing by the agency or any written agreement with the agency  the dfi and the fdic have residual authority to require affirmative action to correct any conditions resulting from any violation or practice  direct an increase in capital and the maintenance of specific minimum capital ratios  restrict the bank s growth geographically  by products and services or by mergers and acquisitions  enter into informal or formal enforcement orders  including memoranda of understanding  written agreements and consent or cease and desist orders to take corrective action and enjoin unsafe and unsound practices  remove officers and directors and assess civil monetary penalties  and take possession and close and liquidate the bank 
transactions with affiliates federal banking law imposes restrictions on extensions of credit by the bank to the bancorp or its non banking affiliates  the purchase by the bank of assets of  or securities issued by  the bancorp or its non banking affiliates  and the taking by the bank of securities issued by the bancorp as collateral for loans made by the bank 
such restrictions prevent the bancorp and its non banking affiliates from borrowing from the bank unless the loans are secured by marketable obligations of designated amounts 
further  these secured loans and investments by the bank to or in the bancorp  or to or in any non banking affiliate  are limited  individually  to of the bank s capital and surplus  and these secured loans and investments are limited  in the aggregate  to of the bank s capital and surplus 
california law also imposes certain restrictions with respect to transactions involving persons or entities controlling the bank  such as the bancorp  and requires that such transactions be approved in advance by the california department of financial institutions 
additional restrictions on transactions with affiliates may be imposed on the bank under the prompt corrective action provisions of federal law discussed above 
see prompt corrective action provisions 
loans to one borrower with certain limited exceptions  the maximum amount that a california bank may lend to any borrower at any one time including the obligations to the bank of certain related entities of the borrower may not exceed and unsecured loans may not exceed of the bank s shareholder equity  allowance for loan losses  and any capital notes and debentures of the bank 
extension of credit to insiders federal law place limitations and conditions on loans or extensions of credit to a bank s or bank holding company s executive officers  directors  and principal shareholders ie  in most cases  those persons who own  control or have power to vote more than of any class of voting securities  any company controlled by any such executive officer  director  or shareholder  or any political or campaign committee controlled by such executive officer  director  or principal shareholder 
loans and leases extended to any of the above persons must comply with california s loan to one borrower limits described above  require prior full board approval when aggregate extensions of credit to the person exceed specified amounts  must be made on substantially the same terms including interest rates and collateral as  and follow credit underwriting procedures that are not less stringent than those prevailing at the time for comparable transactions with non insiders  and must not involve more than the normal risk of repayment  or present other unfavorable features 
a bank is also prohibited from paying an overdraft on an account of an executive officer or director  except pursuant to a written pre authorized interest bearing extension of credit plan that specifies a method of repayment or a written pre authorized transfer of funds from another account of the executive officer or director at the bank 
in addition  the aggregate limit on extensions of credit to all insiders of a california bank as a group cannot exceed the bank s unimpaired capital and unimpaired surplus 
interstate banking and branching under the riegle neal interstate banking and branching efficiency act of  bank holding companies and banks generally have the ability to acquire or merge with banks in other states  and  subject to certain state restrictions  banks may also acquire or establish new branches outside their home state 
interstate branches are subject to certain laws of the states in which they are located 
the bank presently has interstate branches in the states of new york  massachusetts  texas  illinois  new jersey and washington 
bank secrecy act and usa patriot act the bank secrecy act bsa is a disclosure law that forms the basis of the federal government s framework to prevent and detect money laundering and to deter other criminal enterprises 
under the bsa  financial institutions such as the bank are required to maintain certain records and file certain reports regarding domestic currency transactions and cross border transportations of currency 
among other requirements  the bsa requires financial institutions to report imports and exports of currency in the amount of  or more and  in general  all cash transactions of  or more 
the bank has established a bsa compliance policy under which  among other precautions  the bank keeps currency transaction reports to document cash transactions in excess of  or in multiples totaling more than  during one business day  monitors certain potentially suspicious transactions such as the exchange of a large number of small denomination bills for large denomination bills  and scrutinizes electronic funds transfers for bsa compliance 
the bsa also requires that financial institutions report to relevant law enforcement agencies any suspicious transactions potentially involving violations of law 
the usa patriot act and its implementing regulations significantly expanded the anti money laundering and financial transparency laws in response to the terrorist attacks in september the bank has adopted additional comprehensive policies and procedures to address the requirements of the usa patriot act 
material deficiencies in anti money laundering compliance can result in public enforcement actions by the banking agencies  including the imposition of civil money penalties and supervisory restrictions on growth and expansion 
such enforcement actions could also have serious reputation consequences for the bancorp and the bank 
consumer laws the bancorp and the bank are subject to many federal and state consumer protection statutes and regulations and laws prohibiting unfair or fraudulent business practices  untrue or misleading advertising and unfair competition  including the home ownership and equity protection act of  or hoepa  requires extra disclosures and consumer protections to borrowers from certain lending practices  such as practices deemed to be predatory lending 
privacy policies are required by federal and state banking laws regulations which limit the ability of banks and other financial institutions to disclose nonpublic information about consumers to nonaffiliated third parties 
the federal bank regulatory agencies have adopted customer information security guidelines for safeguarding confidential  personal customer information 
the guidelines require each financial institution  under the supervision and ongoing oversight of its board of directors or an appropriate committee thereof  to create  implement  and maintain a comprehensive written information security program designed to ensure the security and confidentiality of customer information  protect against any anticipated threats or hazards to the security or integrity of such information and protect against unauthorized access or use of such information that could result in substantial harm or inconvenience to any customer 
the fair credit reporting act  as amended by the fair and accurate credit transactions act  or the fact act  requires financial firms to help deter identity theft  including developing appropriate fraud response programs  and gives consumers more control of their credit data 
the equal credit opportunity act  or ecoa  generally prohibits discrimination in any credit transaction  whether for consumer or business purposes  on the basis of race  color  religion  national origin  sex  marital status  age except in limited circumstances  receipt of income from public assistance programs  or good faith exercise of any rights under the consumer credit protection act 
the truth in lending act  or tila  requires that credit terms be disclosed in a meaningful and consistent way so that consumers may compare credit terms more readily and knowledgeably 
the fair housing act regulates many lending practices  including making it unlawful for any lender to discriminate in its housing related lending activities against any person because of race  color  religion  national origin  sex  handicap or familial status 
the community reinvestment act  or cra  requires insured depository institutions  while operating safely and soundly  to help meet the credit needs of their communities  directs the federal regulatory agencies  in examining insured depository institutions  to assess a bank s record of helping meet the credit needs of its entire community  including low and moderate income neighborhoods  consistent with safe and sound banking practices and further requires the agencies to take a financial institution s record of meeting its community credit needs into account when evaluating applications for  among other things  domestic branches  mergers or acquisitions  or holding company formations 
in its most recently released public reports  from april  the bank received a satisfactory rating 
the home mortgage disclosure act  or hmda  includes a fair lending aspect that requires the collection and disclosure of data about applicant and borrower characteristics as a way of identifying possible discriminatory lending patterns and enforcing anti discrimination statutes 
the real estate settlement procedures act  or respa  requires lenders to provide borrowers with disclosures regarding the nature and cost of real estate settlements and prohibits certain abusive practices  such as kickbacks 
the national flood insurance act  or nfia  requires homes in flood prone areas with mortgages from a federally regulated lender to have flood insurance 
the americans with disabilities act  in conjunction with similar california legislation  requires employers with or more employees and all businesses operating commercial facilities or public accommodations to accommodate disabled employees and customers 
these laws and regulations mandate certain disclosure requirements and regulate the manner in which financial institutions must deal with customers when taking deposits  making loans  collecting loans  and providing other services 
failure to comply with these laws and regulations can subject the bank to various penalties  including but not limited to enforcement actions  injunctions  fines or criminal penalties  punitive damages to consumers  and the loss of certain contractual rights 
federal home loan bank system the bank is a member of the federal home loan bank fhlb of san francisco 
among other benefits  each fhlb serves as a reserve or central bank for its members within its assigned region 
each fhlb is financed primarily from the sale of consolidated obligations of the fhlb system 
each fhlb makes available loans or advances to its members in compliance with the policies and procedures established by the board of directors of the individual fhlb 
each member of the fhlb of san francisco is required to own stock in an amount equal to the greater of i a membership stock requirement with an initial cap of million of membership asset value as defined  or ii an activity based stock requirement based on percentage of outstanding advances 
the fhlb recently announced that it would not pay any dividends on its capital stock in the first quarter of  and there can be no assurance that the fhlb will pay dividends at the same rate it has paid in the past  or that it will pay any dividends in the future 
impact of monetary policies the earnings and growth of the bank are largely dependent on its ability to maintain a favorable differential or spread between the yield on its interest earning assets and the rates paid on its deposits and other interest bearing liabilities 
as a result  the bank s performance is influenced by general economic conditions  both domestic and foreign  the monetary and fiscal policies of the federal government  and the policies of the regulatory agencies 
the federal reserve board implements national monetary policies such as seeking to curb inflation and combat recession by its open market operations in us government securities  by adjusting the required level of reserves for financial institutions subject to its reserve requirements and by varying the discount rate applicable to borrowings by banks from the federal reserve banks 
the actions of the federal reserve board in these areas influence the growth of bank loans  investments  and deposits and also affect interest rates charged on loans and deposits 
the nature and impact of any future changes in monetary policies cannot be predicted 
environmental regulation in the course of the bank s business  the bank may foreclose and take title to real estate  and could be subject to environmental liabilities with respect to these properties 
the bank may be held liable to a governmental entity or to third parties for property damage  personal injury  investigation and clean up costs incurred by these parties in connection with environmental contamination  or may be required to investigate or clear up hazardous or toxic substances  or chemical releases at a property 
the costs associated with investigation or remediation activities could be substantial 
in addition  as the owner or former owner of any contaminated site  the bank may be subject to common law claims by third parties based on damages and costs resulting from environmental contamination emanating from the property 
if the bank ever becomes subject to significant environmental liabilities  its business  financial condition  liquidity and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 
audit requirements the bank is required to have an annual independent audit  alone or as a part of its bank holding company s audit  and to prepare all financial statements in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles 
the bank or the bancorp is also required to have an audit committee comprised entirely of independent directors 
as required by nasdaq  the bancorp has certified that its audit committee has adopted formal written charters and meets the requisite number of directors  independence  and qualification standards 
in addition  because the bank has more than billion in total assets  it is subject to the fdic requirements for audit committees of large institutions 
as such  among other requirements  the bancorp must maintain an audit committee which includes members with banking or related financial management expertise  has access to its own outside counsel  and does not include members who are large customers of the bank 
the sarbanes oxley act also addresses accounting oversight and corporate governance matters 
management and the bancorp s independent registered public accounting firm are required to assess the effectiveness of the bancorp s internal control over financial reporting as of december  these assessments are included in item a  controls and procedures  below

risk factors 
difficult economic and market conditions have adversely affected our industry 
dramatic declines in the housing market  with decreasing home prices and increasing delinquencies and foreclosures  have negatively impacted the credit performance of mortgage and construction loans and resulted in significant write downs of assets by many financial institutions 
general downward economic trends  reduced availability of commercial credit and increasing unemployment have negatively impacted the credit performance of commercial and consumer credit  resulting in additional write downs 
concerns over the stability of the financial markets and the economy have resulted in decreased lending by financial institutions to their customers and to each other 
this market turmoil and tightening of credit has led to increased commercial and consumer deficiencies  lack of customer confidence  increased market volatility and widespread reduction in general business activity 
financial institutions have experienced decreased access to deposits and borrowings 
the resulting economic pressure on consumers and businesses and the lack of confidence in the financial markets may adversely affect our business  financial condition  results of operations and stock price 
we do not expect that the difficult conditions in the financial markets are likely to improve in the near future 
a worsening of these conditions would likely exacerbate the adverse effects of these difficult market conditions on us and others in the financial institutions industry 
in particular  we may face the following risks in connection with these events we potentially face increased regulation of our industry 
compliance with such regulation may increase our costs and limit our ability to pursue business opportunities 
the process we use to estimate losses inherent in our credit exposure requires difficult  subjective and complex judgments  including forecasts of economic conditions and how these economic conditions might impair the ability of our borrowers to repay their loans 
the level of uncertainty concerning economic conditions may adversely affect the accuracy of our estimates which may  in turn  impact the reliability of the process 
we may be required to pay significantly higher fdic premiums because market developments have significantly depleted the insurance fund of the fdic and reduced the ratio of reserves to insured deposits 
our banking operations are concentrated primarily in california  and secondarily in new york  texas  massachusetts  washington  illinois  new jersey  and hong kong 
adverse economic conditions in these regions in particular could impair borrowers ability to service their loans  decrease the level and duration of deposits by customers  and erode the value of loan collateral 
these conditions include the effects of the current general decline in real estate sales and prices in many markets across the united states  the current economic recession  and higher rates of unemployment 
these conditions could increase the amount of our non performing assets and have an adverse effect on our efforts to collect our non performing loans or otherwise liquidate our non performing assets including other real estate owned on terms favorable to us  if at all  and could also cause a decline in demand for our products and services  or a lack of growth or a decrease in deposits  any of which may cause us to incur losses  adversely affect our capital  and hurt our business 
if current levels of market disruption and volatility continue or worsen  there can be no assurance that we will not experience an adverse effect  which may be material  on our ability to access capital and on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
recent legislative and regulatory initiatives to address difficult market and economic conditions may not stabilize the us banking system 
on oct 
  president bush signed into law the emergency economic stabilization act of the eesa and  on february   president obama signed into law the american recovery and reinvestment act the arra in response to the current crisis in the financial sector 
the us treasury and banking regulators are implementing a number of programs under this legislation to address capital and liquidity issues in the banking system 
there can be no assurance  however  as to the actual impact that the eesa and the arra will have on the financial markets  including the extreme levels of volatility and limited credit availability currently being experienced 
the failure of these legislations to help stabilize the financial markets and a continuation or worsening of current financial market conditions could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations  access to credit  or the value of our securities 
us and international financial markets and economic conditions could adversely affect our liquidity  results of operations  and financial condition 
as described in recent economic development  legislation and regulatory initiatives  in item of this annual report on form k  there have been significant disruption in the us and international financial system 
although we remain well capitalized and have not suffered any significant liquidity issues as a result of these recent events  the cost and availability of funds may be adversely affected by illiquid credit markets and the demand for our products and services may decline as our borrowers and customers realize the impact of an economic slowdown and recession 
in view of the concentration of our operations and the collateral securing our loan portfolio in northern and southern california  we may be particularly susceptible to the adverse economic conditions in the state of california  where our business is concentrated 
in addition  the severity and duration of these adverse conditions are unknown and may exacerbate our exposure to credit risk and adversely affect the ability of borrowers to perform under the terms of their lending arrangements with us 
we may be required to make additional provisions for loan losses and charge off additional loans in the future  which could adversely affect our results of operations 
during the year ended december   we recorded a million provision for loan losses and charged off approximately million  net of million in recoveries 
there has been a significant slowdown in the real estate market in portions of los angeles  san diego  riverside  and san bernardino counties and the central valley of california where many of our commercial real estate and construction loan customers are based 
this slowdown reflects declining prices and excess inventories of homes to be sold  which has contributed to financial strain on home builders and suppliers 
as of december   we had approximately billion in commercial real estate and construction loans 
continuing deterioration in the real estate market generally and in the residential building segment in particular could result in additional loan charge offs and provisions for loan losses in the future  which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  net income and capital 
the allowance for credit losses is an estimate of probable credit losses 
actual credit losses in excess of the estimate could adversely affect our net income and capital 
a significant source of risk arises from the possibility that we could sustain losses because borrowers  guarantors  and related parties may fail to perform in accordance with the terms of their loans and leases 
the underwriting and credit monitoring policies and procedures that we have adopted to address this risk may not prevent unexpected losses that could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
the allowance for credit losses is based on management s estimate of the probable losses from our credit portfolio 
if actual losses exceed the estimate  the excess losses could adversely affect our net income and capital 
such excess losses could also lead to larger allowances for credit losses in future periods  which could in turn adversely affect net income and capital in those periods 
if economic conditions differ substantially from the assumptions used in the estimate or adverse developments arise with respect to our credits  future losses may occur  and increases in the allowance may be necessary 
in addition  various regulatory agencies  as an integral part of their examination process  periodically review the adequacy of our allowance 
these agencies may require us to establish additional allowances based on their judgment of the information available at the time of their examinations 
no assurance can be given that we will not sustain credit losses in excess of present or future levels of the allowance for credit losses 
we may experience goodwill impairment 
if our estimates of goodwill fair value change due to changes in our businesses or other factors  we may determine that impairment charges are necessary 
estimates of fair value are determined based on a complex model using cash flows and company comparisons 
if management s estimates of future cash flows are inaccurate  the fair value determined could be inaccurate and impairment may not be recognized in a timely manner 
liquidity risk could impair our ability to fund operations and jeopardize our financial condition 
liquidity is essential to our business 
although we have not suffered liquidity issues as a result of recent events  an inability to raise funds through deposits  borrowings  the sale of loans  and other sources could have a material adverse effect on our liquidity 
our access to funding sources in amounts adequate to finance our activities could be impaired by factors that affect us specifically or the financial services industry in general 
factors that could detrimentally impact our access to liquidity sources include a decrease in the level of our business activity due to a market downturn or adverse regulatory action against us 
our ability to acquire deposits or borrow could also be impaired by factors that are not specific to us  such as a severe disruption of the financial markets or negative views and expectations about the prospects for the financial services industry as a whole as the recent turmoil faced by banking organizations in the domestic and worldwide credit markets deteriorates 
our business is subject to interest rate risk and fluctuations in interest rates could reduce our net interest income and adversely affect our business 
a substantial portion of our income is derived from the differential or spread between the interest earned on loans  investment securities and other interest earning assets  and the interest paid on deposits  borrowings and other interest bearing liabilities 
the interest rate risk inherent in our lending  investing  and deposit taking activities is a significant market risk to us and our business 
income associated with interest earning assets and costs associated with interest bearing liabilities may not be affected uniformly by fluctuations in interest rates 
the magnitude and duration of changes in interest rates  events over which we have no control  may have an adverse effect on net interest income 
prepayment and early withdrawal levels  which are also impacted by changes in interest rates  can significantly affect our assets and liabilities 
increases in interest rates may adversely affect the ability of our floating rate borrowers to meet their higher payment obligations  which could in turn lead to an increase in non performing assets and net charge offs 
generally  the interest rates on our interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities do not change at the same rate  to the same extent  or on the same basis 
even assets and liabilities with similar maturities or periods of re pricing may react in different degrees to changes in market interest rates 
interest rates on certain types of assets and liabilities may fluctuate in advance of changes in general market interest rates  while interest rates on other types of assets and liabilities may lag behind changes in general market rates 
certain assets  such as fixed and adjustable rate mortgage loans  have features that limit changes in interest rates on a short term basis and over the life of the asset 
we seek to minimize the adverse effects of changes in interest rates by structuring our asset liability composition to obtain the maximum spread 
we use interest rate sensitivity analysis and a simulation model to assist us in estimating the optimal asset liability composition 
however  such management tools have inherent limitations that impair their effectiveness 
there can be no assurance that we will be successful in minimizing the adverse effects of changes in interest rates

we have engaged in and may continue to engage in further expansion through acquisitions  which could negatively affect our business and earnings 
we have engaged in and may continue to engage in expansion through acquisitions 
there are risks associated with such expansion 
these risks include  among others  incorrectly assessing the asset quality of a bank acquired in a particular transaction  encountering greater than anticipated costs in integrating acquired businesses  facing resistance from customers or employees  and being unable to profitably deploy assets acquired in the transaction 
additional country and region specific risks are associated with transactions outside the united states  including in china 
to the extent we issue capital stock in connection with additional transactions  these transactions and related stock issuances may have a dilutive effect on earnings per share and share ownership 
our earnings  financial condition  and prospects after a merger or acquisition depend in part on our ability to successfully integrate the operations of the acquired company 
we may be unable to integrate operations successfully or to achieve expected cost savings 
any cost savings which are realized may be offset by losses in revenues or other charges to earnings 
inflation and deflation may adversely affect our financial performance 
the consolidated financial statements and related financial data presented in this report have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
these principles require the measurement of financial position and operating results in terms of historical dollars  without considering changes in the relative purchasing power of money over time due to inflation or deflation 
the primary impact of inflation on our operations is reflected in increased operating costs 
conversely  deflation will tend to erode collateral values and diminish loan quality 
virtually all of our assets and liabilities are monetary in nature 
as a result  interest rates have a more significant impact on our performance than the general levels of inflation or deflation 
interest rates do not necessarily move in the same direction or in the same magnitude as the price of goods and services 
as we expand our business outside of california markets  we will encounter risks that could adversely affect us 
we primarily operate in california markets with a concentration of chinese american individuals and businesses  however  one of our strategies is to expand beyond california into other domestic markets that have concentrations of chinese american individuals and businesses 
we currently have operations in six other states new york  texas  washington  massachusetts  illinois  and new jersey and in hong kong 
in the course of this expansion  we will encounter significant risks and uncertainties that could have a material adverse effect on our operations 
these risks and uncertainties include increased expenses and operational difficulties arising from  among other things  our ability to attract sufficient business in new markets  to manage operations in noncontiguous market areas  to comply with all of the various local laws and regulations  and to anticipate events or differences in markets in which we have no current experience 
to the extent that we expand through acquisitions  such acquisitions may also adversely harm our business if we fail to adequately address the financial and operational risks associated with such acquisitions 
for example  risks can include difficulties in assimilating the operations  technology  and personnel of the acquired company  diversion of management s attention from other business concerns  inability to maintain uniform standards  controls  procedures and policies  potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities  the incurring of additional debt and contingent liabilities  use of cash resources  large write offs  and amortization expenses related to other intangible assets with finite lives 
our loan portfolio is largely secured by real estate  which can adversely affected our net income a downturn in our real estate markets has hurt our business because many of our loans are secured by real estate 
the real estate collateral securing our borrowers obligations is principally located in california  and to a lesser extent  in new york  texas  massachusetts  washington  illinois  and new jersey 
the value of such collateral depends upon conditions in the relevant real estate markets 
these include general or local economic conditions and neighborhood characteristics  unemployment rates  real estate tax rates  the cost of operating the properties  governmental regulations and fiscal policies  and acts of nature including earthquakes  floods  and hurricanes which may result in uninsured losses  and other factors beyond our control 
the current general decline in real estate sales and prices in many markets across the united states could reduce the value of our collateral such that we may not be able to realize an amount upon a foreclosure sale equal to the indebtedness secured by the property 
continued declines in real estate sales and prices coupled with the current economic recession and an associated increase in unemployment will result in higher than expected loan delinquencies or problem assets  a decline in demand for our products and services  or a lack of growth or a decrease in deposits  which may cause us to incur losses  adversely affect our capital  and hurt our business 
the risks inherent in construction lending may continue to affect adversely our net income 
such risks include  among other things  the possibility that contractors may fail to complete  or complete on a timely basis  construction of the relevant properties  substantial cost overruns in excess of original estimates and financing  market deterioration during construction  and lack of permanent take out financing 
loans secured by such properties also involve additional risk because such properties have no operating history 
in these loans  loan funds are advanced upon the security of the project under construction which is of uncertain value prior to completion of construction and the estimated operating cash flow to be generated by the completed project 
there is no assurance that such properties will be sold or leased so as to generate the cash flow anticipated by the borrower 
the current general decline in real estate sales and prices across the united states  the decline in demand for residential real estate  the current recession  higher rates of unemployment  and reduced availability of mortgage credit  are all factors that can adversely affect the borrowers ability to repay their obligations to us and the value of our security interest in collateral and thereby adversely affect our net income and financial results 
our use of appraisals in deciding whether to make a loan on or secured by real property does not ensure the value of the real property collateral 
in considering whether to make a loan secured by real property  we generally require an appraisal of the property 
however  an appraisal is only an estimate of the value of the property at the time the appraisal is made 
if the appraisal does not reflect the amount that may be obtained upon any sale or foreclosure of the property  we may not realize an amount equal to the indebtedness secured by the property 
we face substantial competition from larger competitors 
we face substantial competition for deposits and loans  as well as other banking services  throughout our market area from the major banks and financial institutions that dominate the commercial banking industry 
this may cause our cost of funds to exceed that of our competitors 
these banks and financial institutions have greater resources than us  including the ability to finance advertising campaigns and allocate their investment assets to regions of higher yield and demand 
by virtue of their larger capital bases  they have substantially greater lending limits than us and perform certain functions  including trust services  which are not presently offered by us 
we also compete for loans and deposits  as well as other banking services  with savings and loan associations  brokerage houses  insurance companies  mortgage companies  credit unions  credit card companies and other financial and non financial institutions and entities 
we are subject to extensive government regulation that could limit or restrict our activities  which  in turn  may hamper our ability to increase our assets and earnings 
our operations are subject to extensive regulation by federal  state and local governmental authorities and are subject to various laws and judicial and administrative decisions imposing requirements and restrictions on part or all of our operations 
because our business is highly regulated  the laws  rules  regulations and supervisory guidance and policies applicable to us are subject to regular modification and change 
perennially various laws  rules and regulations are proposed  which  if adopted  could impact our operations by making compliance much more difficult or expensive  restricting our ability to originate or sell loans or further restricting the amount of interest or other charges or fees earned on loans or other products 
it is impossible to predict the competitive impact that any such changes would have on commercial banking in general or on our business in particular 
such changes may  among other things  increase the cost of doing business  limit permissible activities  or affect the competitive balance between banks and other financial institutions 
the short term and long term impact of the new basel ii capital standards and the forthcoming new capital rules to be proposed for non basel ii us banks is uncertain 
as a result of the recent deterioration in the global credit markets and the potential impact of increased liquidity risk and interest rate risk  it is unclear what the short term impact of the implementation of basel ii may be or what impact a pending alternative standardized approach to basel ii option for non basel ii us banks may have on the cost and availability of different types of credit and the potential compliance costs of implementing the new capital standards 
we are dependent on key personnel and the loss of one or more of those key personnel may materially and adversely affect our prospects 
competition for qualified employees and personnel in the banking industry is intense and there are a limited number of qualified persons with knowledge of  and experience in  the communities that we serve 
the process of recruiting personnel with the combination of skills and attributes required to carry out our strategies is often lengthy 
our success depends to a significant degree upon our ability to attract and retain qualified management  loan origination  finance  administrative  marketing and technical personnel and upon the continued contributions of our management and personnel 
in particular  our success has been and continues to be highly dependent upon the abilities of key executives  and certain other employees 
furthermore  the recently enacted american recovery and reinvestment act will place additional limitations and restrictions on compensation paid to our senior executive officers and the next ten most highly compensated employees and may further constrain our ability to compete for talented personnel 
these additional limitations and restrictions are subject to rules and regulations to be adopted by the us treasury and  until these rules and regulations are adopted and promulgated  their effect and impact on us are uncertain and unknown 
managing reputational risk is important to attracting and maintaining customers  investors and employees 
threats to our reputation can come from many sources  including adverse sentiment about financial institutions generally  unethical practices  employee misconduct  failure to deliver minimum standards of service or quality  compliance deficiencies  and questionable or fraudulent activities of our customers 
we have policies and procedures in place that seek to protect our reputation and promote ethical conduct  but these policies and procedures may not be fully effective 
negative publicity regarding our business  employees  or customers  with or without merit  may result in the loss of customers  investors and employees  costly litigation  a decline in revenues and increased governmental regulation 
natural disasters and geopolitical events beyond our control could adversely affect us 
natural disasters such as earthquakes  wildfires  extreme weather conditions  hurricanes  floods  and other acts of nature and geopolitical events involving terrorism or military conflict could adversely affect our business operations and those of our customers and cause substantial damage and loss to real and personal property 
these natural disasters and geopolitical events could impair our borrowers ability to service their loans  decrease the level and duration of deposits by customers  erode the value of loan collateral  and result in an increase in the amount of our non performing loans and a higher level of non performing assets including real estate owned  net charge offs  and provision for loan losses  which could adversely affect our earnings 
adverse conditions in asia could adversely affect our business 
a substantial number of our customers have economic and cultural ties to asia and  as a result  we are likely to feel the effects of adverse economic and political conditions in asia 
in addition  in  we opened a branch in hong kong 
us and global economic policies  military tensions  and unfavorable global economic conditions may adversely impact the asian economies 
pandemics and other public health crises or concerns over the possibility of such crises could create economic and financial disruptions in the region 
if economic conditions in asia deteriorate  we could  among other things  be exposed to economic and transfer risk  and could experience an outflow of deposits by those of our customers with connections to asia 
transfer risk may result when an entity is unable to obtain the foreign exchange needed to meet its obligations or to provide liquidity 
this may adversely impact the recoverability of investments with or loans made to such entities 
adverse economic conditions in asia  and in china or taiwan in particular  may also negatively impact asset values and the profitability and liquidity of our customers who operate in this region 
statutory restrictions on dividends and other distributions from the bank may adversely impact us by limiting the amount of distributions the bancorp may receive 
state laws may restrict our ability to pay dividends 
a substantial portion of the bancorp s cash flow comes from dividends that the bank pays to us 
various statutory provisions restrict the amount of dividends that the bank can pay without regulatory approval 
in addition  if the bank were to liquidate  the bank s creditors would be entitled to receive distributions from the assets of the bank to satisfy their claims against the bank before bancorp  as a holder of the equity interest in the bank  would be entitled to receive any of the assets of the bank 
our ability for the bank to pay dividends to us is limited by california law and the ability of us to pay dividends on our outstanding stock is limited by delaware law 
see the sections capital resources and liquidity of the management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in item of this annual report on form k 
the terms of our outstanding preferred stock limit our ability to pay dividends on and repurchase our common stock and there can be no assurance of any future dividends on our common stock generally 
the purchase agreement between us and the us treasury the purchase agreement pursuant to which we sold million of our fixed rate cumulative perpetual preferred stock  series b  with a liquidation preference of  per share stock the tarp preferred stock and issued a warrant to purchase up to  shares of our common stock the warrant provides that prior to the earlier of i december   and ii the date on which all of the shares of the tarp preferred stock have been redeemed by us or transferred by the us treasury to third parties  we may not  without the consent of the us treasury  a increase the cash dividend on our common stock above 
per share  the amount of the last quarterly cash dividend per share declared prior to october   or b subject to limited exceptions  redeem  repurchase or otherwise acquire shares of our common stock or preferred stock other than the tarp preferred stock 
in addition  we are unable to pay any dividends on our common stock unless we are current in our dividend payments on the tarp preferred stock 
these restrictions  together with the potentially dilutive impact of the warrant  described below  could have a negative effect on the value of our common stock 
moreover  holders of our common stock are entitled to receive dividends only when  as and if declared by our board of directors 
although we have historically paid cash dividends on our common stock  we are not required to do so and our board of directors could reduce or eliminate our common stock dividend in the future 
see the sections capital resources and liquidity of the management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in item of this annual report on form k 
our outstanding preferred stock impacts net income available to our common stockholders and earnings per common share  and the warrant as well as other potential issuances of equity securities may be dilutive to holders of our common stock 
the dividends declared and the accretion on discount on our outstanding preferred stock will reduce the net income available to common stockholders and our earnings per common share 
our outstanding preferred stock will also receive preferential treatment in the event of our liquidation  dissolution  or winding up 
additionally  the ownership interest of the existing holders of our common stock will be diluted to the extent the warrant is exercised 
the  shares of common stock underlying the warrant represent approximately of the shares of our common stock outstanding as of february  including the shares issuable upon exercise of the warrant in total shares outstanding 
although the us treasury has agreed not to vote any of the shares of common stock it receives upon exercise of the warrant  a transferee of any portion of the warrant or of any shares of common stock acquired upon exercise of the warrant is not bound by this restriction 
in addition  to the extent options to purchase common stock under our stock option plans are exercised  holders of our common stock will incur additional dilution 
further  if we sell additional equity or convertible debt securities  these sales could result in increased dilution to our stockholders 
because of our participation in the tarp capital purchase program  we are subject to several restrictions including restrictions on compensation paid to our executives 
pursuant to the terms of the purchase agreement  we adopted certain standards for executive compensation and corporate governance 
these standards generally apply to our chief executive officer  chief financial officer and the three next most highly compensated executive officers 
the standards include ensuring that incentive compensation for senior executive officers does not encourage unnecessary and excessive risks that threaten the value of the financial institution  required clawback of any bonus or incentive compensation paid to a senior executive officer based on statements of earnings  gains or other criteria that are later proven to be materially inaccurate  prohibition on making golden parachute payments to senior executives  and agreement not to deduct for tax purposes executive compensation in excess of  for each senior executive 
in particular  the change to the deductibility limit on executive compensation will likely increase the overall cost of our compensation programs in future periods 
on february   president obama signed into law the american recovery and reinvestment act  which will place additional limitations and restrictions on compensation paid to our senior executive officers and the next ten most highly compensated employees 
these additional limitations and restrictions are subject to rules and regulations to be adopted by the us treasury and  until these rules and regulations are adopted  and promulgated  their effect and impact on us are uncertain and unknown 
our need to continue to adapt to our information technology systems to allow us to provide new and expanded services could present operational issues and require significant capital spending 
as we continue to offer internet banking and other on line services to our customers  and continue to expand our existing conventional banking services  we will need to adapt our information technology systems to handle these changes in a way that meets constantly changing industry and regulatory standards 
this can be very expensive and may require significant capital expenditures 
in addition  our success will depend  among other things  on our ability to provide secure and reliable services  anticipate changes in technology  and efficiently develop and introduce services that are accepted by our customers and cost effective for us to provide 
systems failures  delays  breaches of confidentiality and other problems could harm our reputation and business 
the price of our common stock may be volatile or may decline 
the trading price of our common stock may fluctuate widely as a result of a number of factors  many of which are outside our control 
in addition  the stock market is subject to fluctuations in the share prices and trading volumes that affect the market prices of the shares of many companies 
these broad market fluctuations could adversely affect the market price of our common stock 
among the factors that could affect our stock price are actual or anticipated quarterly fluctuations in our operating results and financial condition  changes in revenue or earnings estimates or publication of research reports and recommendations by financial analysts  failure to meet analysts revenue or earnings estimates  speculation in the press or investment community  strategic actions by us or our competitors  such as acquisitions or restructurings  actions by institutional shareholders  fluctuations in the stock price and operating results of our competitors  general market conditions and  in particular  developments related to market conditions for the financial services industry  proposed or adopted regulatory changes or developments  anticipated or pending investigations  proceedings or litigation that involve or affect us  or domestic and international economic factors unrelated to our performance 
the stock market and  in particular  the market for financial institution stocks  has experienced significant volatility 
as a result  the market price of our common stock may be volatile 
in addition  the trading volume in our common stock may fluctuate more than usual and cause significant price variations to occur 
the trading price of the shares of our common stock and the value of our other securities will depend on many factors  which may change from time to time  including  without limitation  our financial condition  performance  creditworthiness and prospects  future sales of our equity or equity related securities  and other factors identified above in forward looking statements 
current levels of market volatility are unprecedented 
the capital and credit markets have been experiencing volatility and disruption for more than a year 
in recent months  the volatility and disruption have reached unprecedented levels 
in some cases  the markets have produced downward pressure on stock prices and credit availability for certain issuers without regard to those issuers underlying financial strength 
a significant decline in our stock price could result in substantial losses for individual stockholders and could lead to costly and disruptive securities litigation 
certain provisions of our charter  bylaws  and rights agreement could make the acquisition of our company more difficult 
certain provisions of our charter  bylaws  and rights agreement between us and american stock transfer and trust company  as rights agent  could make the acquisition of our company more difficult 
these provisions include authorized but unissued shares of preferred and common stock that may be issued without stockholder approval  three classes of directors serving staggered terms  preferred share purchase rights that generally become exercisable if a person or group acquires or more of our common stock or announces a tender offer for or more of our common stock  special requirements for stockholder proposals and nominations for director  and super majority voting requirements in certain situations including certain types of business combinations 
our financial results could be adversely affected by changes in accounting standards or tax laws and regulations 
from time to time  the financial accounting standards board and the securities and exchange commission will change the financial accounting and reporting standards that govern the preparation of our financial statements 
in addition  from time to time  federal and state taxing authorities will change the tax laws  regulations  and their interpretations 
these changes and their effects can be difficult to predict and can materially and adversely impact how we record and report our financial condition and results of operations

item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
general the following discussion is intended to provide information to facilitate the understanding and assessment of the consolidated financial condition and results of operations of the bancorp and its subsidiaries 
it should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and notes appearing elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
the bank offers a wide range of financial services 
it currently operates branches in southern california  branches in northern california  nine branches in new york state  one branch in massachusetts  two branches in texas  three branches in washington state  three branches in illinois  one branch in new jersey  one branch in hong kong and two representative offices one in shanghai  china  and one in taipei  taiwan 
the bank is a commercial bank  servicing primarily individuals  professionals  and small to medium sized businesses in the local markets in which its branches are located 
the financial information presented herein includes the accounts of the bancorp  its subsidiaries  including the bank  and the bank s consolidated subsidiaries 
all material transactions between these entities are eliminated 
recent developments there have been significant disruptions in the us and international financial system during the period covered by this report 
as a result  available credit has been reduced or ceased to exist 
the availability of credit  confidence in the entire financial sector  and the financial markets have been adversely affected 
the us government  the governments of other countries  and multinational institutions have provided vast amounts of liquidity and capital for the banking system 
in response to the financial crises affecting the overall banking system and financial markets in the united states  on october   the emergency economic stabilization act of eesa was enacted to provide up to billion to the united states department of treasury us treasury to purchase mortgages  mortgage backed securities and certain other financial instruments from financial institutions for the purpose of stabilizing and providing liquidity to the us financial markets 
on october   under the authority of eesa  the us treasury announced the troubled asset relief program tarp capital purchase program 
under this program  the us treasury would purchase up to billion of senior preferred shares from qualified us financial institutions 
the terms of the tarp capital purchase program could reduce investment returns to participating banks shareholders by restricting dividends to common shareholders  diluting existing shareholders interests  and restricting capital management practices 
although both the bancorp and the bank meet all applicable regulatory capital requirements and remain well capitalized  on december   we issued senior preferred stock of  shares for million under the capital purchase program 
federal and state governments could pass additional legislation responsive to current credit conditions 
as an example  we could experience higher credit losses because of federal or state legislation or regulatory action that reduces the principal amount or interest rate under existing loan contracts 
also  we could experience higher credit losses because of federal or state legislation or regulatory action that limits the bank s ability to foreclose on property or other collateral or makes foreclosure less economically feasible 
the federal deposit insurance corporation fdic insures deposits at fdic insured financial institutions up to certain limits 
the fdic charges insured financial institutions premiums to maintain the deposit insurance fund 
current economic conditions have increased expectations for bank failures  in which case the fdic would take control of failed banks and ensure payment of deposits up to insured limits using the resources of the deposit insurance fund 
in such case  the fdic may increase premium assessments to maintain adequate funding of the deposit insurance fund  including requiring riskier institutions to pay a larger share of the premiums 
an increase in premium assessments would increase the company s expenses 
the eesa included a provision for a temporary increase in the amount of deposits insured by fdic to  until december on october   the fdic announced a new program the temporary liquidity guarantee program that provides unlimited deposit insurance coverage on funds in non interest bearing transaction deposit accounts and now accounts with rates not in excess of not otherwise covered by the existing temporary deposit insurance limit of  all eligible institutions will be covered under the program for the first days without incurring any costs 
after the initial period  participating institutions will be assessed an annualized basis point surcharge on the additional insured deposits 
the bank has chosen to participate in the temporary liquidity guarantee program 
the behavior of depositors in regard to the level of fdic insurance could cause the bank s existing customers to reduce the amount of deposits held at the bank  and or could cause new customers to open deposit accounts at the bank 
the level and composition of the bank s deposit portfolio directly impacts the bank s funding cost and net interest margin 
as a result of these measures  it is likely that the premiums the bank pays for fdic insurance will increase  which would adversely affect net income 
the impact of such measures cannot be assessed at this time 
the actions described above  together with additional actions announced by the us treasury and other regulatory agencies  continue to develop 
it is not clear at this time what impact  eesa  tarp  other liquidity and funding initiatives of the us treasury and of other bank regulatory agencies that have been previously announced  and any additional programs that may be initiated in the future  will have on the financial markets and the financial services industry 
the extreme levels of volatility and limited credit availability currently being experienced could continue to effect the us banking industry and the broader us and global economies  which will have an affect on all financial institutions  including the company 
critical accounting policies the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our consolidated financial statements 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
certain accounting policies involve significant judgments and assumptions by management which have a material impact on the carrying value of certain assets and liabilities  management considers such accounting policies to be critical accounting policies 
the judgments and assumptions used by management are based on historical experience and other factors  which are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
management believes the following are critical accounting policies that require the most significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements accounting for the allowance for loan losses the determination of the amount of the provision for loan losses charged to operations reflects management s current judgment about the credit quality of the loan portfolio and takes into consideration changes in lending policies and procedures  changes in economic and business conditions  changes in the nature and volume of the portfolio and in the terms of loans  changes in the experience  ability and depth of lending management  changes in the volume and severity of past due  nonaccrual and adversely classified or graded loans  changes in the quality of the loan review system  changes in the value of underlying collateral for collateral dependent loans  the existence and effect of any concentrations of credit and the effect of competition  legal and regulatory requirements  and other external factors 
the nature of the process by which we determine the appropriate allowance for loan losses requires the exercise of considerable judgment 
while management utilizes its best judgment and information available  the ultimate adequacy of the allowance is dependent upon a variety of factors beyond our control  including the performance of our loan portfolio  the economy  changes in interest rates and the view of the regulatory authorities toward loan classifications 
the allowance is increased by the provision for loan losses and decreased by charge offs when management believes the uncollectibility of a loan is confirmed 
subsequent recoveries  if any  are credited to the allowance 
a weakening of the economy or other factors that adversely affect asset quality could result in an increase in the number of delinquencies  bankruptcies  or defaults  and a higher level of non performing assets  net charge offs  and provision for loan losses in future periods 
the total allowance for loan losses consists of two components specific allowances and general allowances 
to determine the adequacy of the allowance in each of these two components  we employ two primary methodologies  the classification migration methodology and the individual loan review analysis methodology 
these methodologies support the basis for determining allocations between the various loan categories and the overall adequacy of our allowance to provide for probable losses inherent in the loan portfolio 
these methodologies are further supported by additional analysis of relevant factors such as the historical losses in the portfolio  trends in the non performing non accrual loans  loan delinquencies  the volume of the portfolio  peer group comparisons  and federal regulatory policy for loan and lease losses 
other significant factors of portfolio analysis include changes in lending policies underwriting standards  portfolio composition  and concentrations of credit  and trends in the national and local economy 
with these methodologies  a general allowance is established for those loans internally classified and risk graded as pass  special mention  substandard  doubtful  or loss based on historical losses in the portfolio 
additionally  our management allocates a specific allowance for impaired credits  in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting by creditors for impairment of a loan 
the level of the general allowance is established to provide coverage for management s estimate of the credit risk in the loan portfolio by various loan segments not covered by the specific allowance 
the allowance for credit losses is discussed in more detail in allowance for credit losses below 
accounting for acquisitions accounting for acquisitions of other financial institutions involves significant judgments and assumptions by management  which has a material impact on the carrying value of fixed rate loans and borrowings and the determination of the core deposit intangible asset and goodwill 
except for the resolution of any pre acquisition income tax uncertainties  no additional fair value adjustments can be made after the end of the allocation period of one year 
investment securities the classification and accounting for investment securities are discussed in detail in note of the consolidated financial statements presented elsewhere herein 
under sfas no 
 accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities  investment securities must be classified as held to maturity  available for sale  or trading 
the appropriate classification is based partially on our ability to hold the securities to maturity and largely on management s intentions with respect to either holding or selling the securities 
the classification of investment securities is significant since it directly impacts the accounting for unrealized gains and losses on securities 
unrealized gains and losses on trading securities flow directly through earnings during the periods in which they arise  whereas available for sale securities are recorded as a separate component of stockholders equity accumulated other comprehensive income or loss and do not affect earnings until realized 
the fair values of our investment securities are generally determined by reference to quoted market prices and reliable independent sources 
we are obligated to assess  at each reporting date  whether there is an other than temporary impairment to our investment securities 
such impairment must be recognized in current earnings rather than in other comprehensive income loss 
investment securities are discussed in more detail in note to the consolidated financial statements presented elsewhere herein 
income taxes the provision for income taxes is based on income reported for financial statement purposes  and differs from the amount of taxes currently payable  since certain income and expense items are reported for financial statement purposes in different periods than those for tax reporting purposes 
taxes are discussed in more detail in note to the consolidated financial statements presented elsewhere herein 
accrued taxes represent the net estimated amount due or to be received from taxing authorities 
in estimating accrued taxes  we assess the relative merits and risks of the appropriate tax treatment of transactions taking into account statutory  judicial  and regulatory guidance in the context of our tax position 
we account for income taxes using the asset and liability approach  the objective of which is to establish deferred tax assets and liabilities for the temporary differences between the financial reporting basis and the tax basis of our assets and liabilities at enacted tax rates expected to be in effect when such amounts are realized or settled 
a valuation allowance is established for deferred tax assets if  based on the weight of available evidence  it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
as previously disclosed  on december   the california franchise tax board ftb announced its intent to list certain transactions that in its view constitute potentially abusive tax shelters 
included in the transactions subject to this listing were transactions utilizing regulated investment companies rics and real estate investment trusts reits 
while we continue to believe that the tax benefits recorded in   and with respect to our regulated investment company were appropriate and fully defensible under california law  we participated in option of the voluntary compliance initiative of the franchise tax board  and paid all california taxes and interest on these disputed through tax benefits  and at the same time filed a claim for refund for these years while avoiding certain potential penalties 
we retain potential exposure for assertion of an accuracy related penalty should the ftb prevail in its position in addition to the risk of not being successful in our refund claims 
in june  we received a notice from the ftb indicating that the ftb intends to deny our claim for refund for its through tax years 
we are in discussions with the ftb to resolve this matter 
the fasb issued interpretation no 
accounting for uncertainty in income taxes fin  which requires that the amount of recognized tax benefit should be the maximum amount that is more likely than not to be realized and that amounts previously recorded that do not meet the requirements of fin be charged as a cumulative effect adjustment to retained earnings 
as of december   we reflected a million net state tax receivable related to payments it made in april under the voluntary compliance initiative program for the years   and  after giving effect to reserves for loss contingencies on the refund claims 
we have determined that our refund claim related to our regulated investment company is not more likely than not to be realized and consequently  charged a total of million  comprised of the million after tax amount related to our refund claims as well as a million after tax amount related to california net operating losses generated in as a result of our regulated investment company  to the opening balance of retained earnings as of the january   effective date of fin goodwill and goodwill impairment goodwill represents the excess of costs over fair value of assets of businesses acquired 
goodwill and intangible assets acquired in a purchase business combination and determined to have an indefinite useful life are not amortized  but instead are tested for impairment at least annually in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
sfas no 
also requires that intangible assets with estimable useful lives be amortized over their respective estimated useful lives to their estimated residual values  and reviewed for impairment in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
our policy is to assess goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level on an annual basis or between annual assessments if an triggering event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount 
impairment is the condition that exists when the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value 
accounting standards require management to estimate the fair value of each reporting unit in making the assessment of impairment at least annually 
the impairment testing process conducted by us begins by assigning net assets and goodwill to our three reporting units commercial lending  retail banking  and east coast operations 
we then completes step one of the impairment test by comparing the fair value of each reporting unit as determined based on the discussion below with the recorded book value or carrying amount of its net assets  with goodwill included in the computation of the carrying amount 
if the fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount  goodwill of that reporting unit is not considered impaired  and step two of the impairment test is not necessary 
if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value  step two of the impairment test is performed to determine the amount of impairment 
step two of the impairment test compares the carrying amount of the reporting unit s goodwill to the implied fair value of that goodwill 
the implied fair value of goodwill is computed by assuming all assets and liabilities of the reporting unit would be adjusted to the current fair value  with the offset as an adjustment to goodwill 
this adjusted goodwill balance is the implied fair value used in step two 
an impairment charge is recognized for the amount by which the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value

included in the transactions subject to this listing were transactions utilizing regulated investment companies rics and real estate investment trusts reits 
while we continue to believe that the tax benefits recorded in   and with respect to our regulated investment company were appropriate and fully defensible under california law  we participated in option of the voluntary compliance initiative of the franchise tax board  and paid all california taxes and interest on these disputed through tax benefits  and at the same time filed a claim for refund for these years while avoiding certain potential penalties 
we retain potential exposure for assertion of an accuracy related penalty should the ftb prevail in its position in addition to the risk of not being successful in our refund claims 
in june  we received a notice from the ftb indicating that the ftb intends to deny our claim for refund for our through tax years 
we are in discussions with the ftb to resolve this matter 
the fasb issued interpretation no 
accounting for uncertainty in income taxes fin  which requires that the amount of recognized tax benefit should be the maximum amount that is more likely than not to be realized and that amounts previously recorded that do not meet the requirements of fin be charged as a cumulative effect adjustment to retained earnings 
as of december   we reflected a million net state tax receivable related to payments made in april under the voluntary compliance initiative program for the years   and  after giving effect to reserves for loss contingencies on the refund claims 
we have determined that our refund claim related to our regulated investment company is not more likely than not to be realized and consequently charged a total of million  comprised of the million after tax amount related to our refund claims as well as a million after tax amount related to california net operating losses generated in as a result of our regulated investment company  to the opening balance of retained earnings as of the january   effective date of fin we recognize accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits as an income tax provision expense 
we recognized million in and million in in interest and penalties 
we had accrued interest and penalties of approximately million as of both december   and december  our tax returns are open for audits by the internal revenue service back to and by the franchise tax board of the state of california back to we are currently under audit by the california franchise tax board for the years to during the second quarter of  the internal revenue service completed an examination of our and tax returns and did not propose any adjustments deemed to be material 
from time to time  there may be differences in opinion with respect to the tax treatment accorded transactions 
when  and if  such differences occur and the related tax effects become probable and estimable  such amounts will be recognized 
review of financial condition total assets increased by billion  or  to billion at december   compared with total assets of billion at december  the increase in total assets was due primarily to growth in loans of million  or  and increases in investment securities of million  or  offset by decreases of securities purchased under agreements to resell of million 
securities securities represented of total assets at december   compared with of december  total assets 
the fair value of securities available for sale at december   was billion compared with billion at december  securities available for sale are carried at fair value and had a net unrealized gain of million at december   compared with a net unrealized loss  at december  the following table summarizes the carrying value of our portfolio of securities for each of the past two years as of december  in thousands securities available for sale us treasury securities us government sponsored entities state and municipal securities mortgage backed securities commercial mortgage backed securities collateralized mortgage obligations asset backed securities corporate bonds preferred stock of government sponsored entities foreign corporate bonds total between and  we purchased a number of mortgage backed securities and collateralized mortgage obligations comprised of interests in non agency guaranteed residential mortgages 
at december   the remaining par value was million for non agency guaranteed mortgage backed securities with unrealized losses of million and million of collateralized mortgage obligations with unrealized losses of million 
the remaining par value of these securities totaled million which represents of the fair value of securities available for sale and of total assets 
at december   the unrealized loss for these securities totaled million which represented of the par amount of these non agency guaranteed residential mortgages 
based on our analysis at december   there was no other than temporary impairment in these securities due to the low loan to value ratio for the loans underlying these securities  the credit support provided by junior tranches of these securitizations  and the continued aaa rating of these securities 
we have the ability and intent to hold the securities  including the non agency collateralized mortgage obligation securities discussed above with unrealized losses of million for a period of time sufficient for a recovery of cost for those issues with unrealized losses 
the company s unrealized loss on investments in corporate bonds relates to three investments in bonds of financial institutions in the amounts of million  million and  all of which were investment grade at the date of acquisition and as of december  the unrealized losses were primarily caused by the widening of credit spreads since the dates of acquisition 
the contractual terms of those investments do not permit the issuers to settle the security at a price less than the amortized cost of the investment 
the company currently does not believe it is probable that it will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the investment 
therefore  it is expected that these debentures would not be settled at a price less than the amortized cost of the investment 
because the company has the ability and intent to hold this investment until a recovery of fair value  which may be maturity  it does not consider its investments in corporate bonds to be other than temporarily impaired at december  the temporarily impaired securities represent of the fair value of securities available for sale as of december  unrealized losses for securities with unrealized losses for less than twelve months represent  and securities with unrealized losses for twelve months or more represent  of the historical cost of these securities 
unrealized losses on these securities were generally resulted from increases in credit spreads subsequent to the date that these securities were purchased 
all of these securities are investment grade as of december  at december   issues of securities had unrealized losses for months or longer and issues of securities had unrealized losses of less than months 
at december   management believes the impairment is temporary and  accordingly  no impairment loss has been recognized in our consolidated statements of income 
the table below shows the fair value  unrealized losses  and number of issuances as of december   of the temporarily impaired securities in our available for sale securities portfolio temporarily impaired securities as of december  less than months months or longer total fair value unrealized losses no

risk elements of the loan portfolio non performing assets non performing assets include loans past due days or more and still accruing interest  non accrual loans  and other real estate owned 
the company s policy is to place loans on non accrual status if interest and principal or either interest or principal is past due days or more  or in cases where management deems the full collection of principal and interest unlikely 
after a loan is placed on non accrual status  any current year unpaid accrued interest is reversed against current income and any unpaid accrued interest from the prior year is reversed against the allowance for loan losses 
thereafter  any payment is generally first applied towards the principal balance 
depending on the circumstances  management may elect to continue the accrual of interest on certain past due loans if partial payment is received and or the loan is well collateralized and in the process of collection 
the loan is generally returned to accrual status when the borrower has brought the past due principal and interest payments current and  in the opinion of management  the borrower has demonstrated the ability to make future payments of principal and interest as scheduled 
management reviews the loan portfolio regularly for problem loans 
during the ordinary course of business  management becomes aware of borrowers that may not be able to meet the contractual requirements of the loan agreements

troubled debt restructurings a troubled debt restructuring is a formal restructure of a loan when the lender  for economic or legal reasons related to the borrower s financial difficulties  grants a concession to the borrower

the assessment for impairment occurs when and while such loans are on non accrual  or the loan has been restructured 
those loans less than our defined selection criteria  generally the loan amount less than  are treated as a homogeneous portfolio 
if loans meeting the defined criteria are not collateral dependent  we measure the impairment based on the present value of the expected future cash flows discounted at the loan s effective interest rate 
if loans meeting the defined criteria are collateral dependent  we measure the impairment by using the loan s observable market price or the fair value of the collateral 
if the measurement of the impaired loan is less than the recorded amount of the loan  we then recognize impairment by creating or adjusting an existing valuation allowance with a corresponding charge to the provision for loan losses 
we identified impaired loans with a recorded investment of million at year end  compared to million at year end the average balance of impaired loans was million in and million in interest collected on impaired loans totaled million in and million in the following table presents impaired loans and the related allowance as of the dates indicated at december  in thousands balance of impaired loans with no allocated allowance balance of impaired loans with an allocated allowance total recorded investment in impaired loans amount of the allowance allocated to impaired loans the impaired loans included in the table above are comprised of million in commercial loans and million in real estate loans as of december   and comprised of million in commercial loans and million in real estate loans as of december  loan concentration most of the company s business activity is with customers located in the predominantly asian areas of california  new york city  dallas and houston  texas  seattle  washington  boston  massachusetts  chicago  illinois  and new jersey

allowance for credit losses the bank maintains the allowance for credit losses at a level that is considered to be equal to the estimated and known risks in the loan portfolio and off balance sheet unfunded credit commitments 
allowance for credit losses is comprised of allowances for loan losses and for off balance sheet unfunded credit commitments 
with this risk management objective  the bank s management has an established monitoring system that is designed to identify impaired and potential problem loans  and to permit periodic evaluation of impairment and the adequacy level of the allowance for credit losses in a timely manner 
in addition  our board of directors has established a written credit policy that includes a credit review and control system which it believes should be effective in ensuring that the bank maintains an adequate allowance for credit losses 
the board of directors provides oversight for the allowance evaluation process  including quarterly evaluations  and determines whether the allowance is adequate to absorb losses in the credit portfolio 
the determination of the amount of the allowance for credit losses and the provision for credit losses is based on management s current judgment about the credit quality of the loan portfolio and takes into consideration known relevant internal and external factors that affect collectibility when determining the appropriate level for the allowance for credit losses 
the nature of the process by which the bank determines the appropriate allowance for credit losses requires the exercise of considerable judgment 
additions to the allowance for credit losses are made by charges to the provision for credit losses 
while management utilizes its best judgment and information available  the ultimate adequacy of the allowance is dependent upon a variety of factors beyond the bank s control  including the performance of the bank s loan portfolio  the economy  changes in interest rates  and the view of the regulatory authorities toward loan classifications 
identified credit exposures that are determined to be uncollectible are charged against the allowance for credit losses 
recoveries of previously charged off amounts  if any  are credited to the allowance for credit losses 
a weakening of the economy or other factors that adversely affect asset quality could result in an increase in the number of delinquencies  bankruptcies  or defaults  and a higher level of non performing assets  net charge offs  and provision for loan losses in future periods 
see part i item a risk factors in this annual report on form k for additional factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from forward looking statements or historical performance 
the following table sets forth the information relating to the allowance for loan losses  charge offs  recoveries  and the reserve for off balance sheet credit commitments for the past five years allowance for credit losses amount outstanding as of december  dollars in thousands allowance for loan losses balance at beginning of year provision reversal for credit losses transfers to reserve for off balance sheet credit commitments charge offs commercial loans construction loans real estate loans real estate land loans installment loans and other loans total charge offs recoveries commercial loans construction loans real estate loans installment loans and other loans total recoveries allowance from acquisitions balance at end of year reserve for off balance sheet credit commitments balance at beginning of year provision reversal for credit losses transfers balance at end of year average loans outstanding during year ended ratio of net charge offs to average loans outstanding during the year provision for credit losses to average loans outstanding during the year allowance for credit losses to non performing loans at year end allowance for credit losses to gross loans at year end our allowance for loan losses consists of the following specific allowance for impaired loans  we provide specific allowances based on an evaluation of impairment  and for each criticized loan  we allocate a portion of the general allowance to each loan based on a loss percentage assigned 
the percentage assigned depends on a number of factors including loan classification  the current financial condition of the borrowers and guarantors  the prevailing value of the underlying collateral  charge off history  management s knowledge of the portfolio  and general economic conditions 
during the third quarter of  we revised our minimum loss rates for loans rated special mention and substandard to incorporate the results of a classification migration model reflecting actual losses beginning in general allowance the unclassified portfolio is segmented on a group basis 
segmentation is determined by loan type and by identifying risk characteristics that are common to the groups of loans 
the allowance is provided to each segmented group based on the group s historical loan loss experience  the trends in delinquency and non accrual  and other significant factors  such as national and local economy  trends and conditions  strength of management and loan staff  underwriting standards  and the concentration of credit 
beginning in the third quarter of  minimum loss rates have been assigned for loans graded minimally acceptable instead of grouping these loans with the unclassified portfolio 
to determine the adequacy of the allowance in each of these two components  the bank employs two primary methodologies  the classification migration methodology and the individual loan review analysis methodology 
these methodologies support the basis for determining allocations between the various loan categories and the overall adequacy of the bank s allowance to provide for probable losses inherent in the loan portfolio 
these methodologies are further supported by additional analysis of relevant factors such as the historical losses in the portfolio  trends in the non performing non accrual loans  loan delinquencies  the volume of the portfolio  peer group comparisons  and federal regulatory policy for loan and lease losses 
other significant factors of portfolio analysis include changes in lending policies underwriting standards  portfolio composition  concentrations of credit  and trends in the national and local economy 
with these methodologies  a general allowance is for those loans internally classified and risk graded pass  special mention  substandard  doubtful  or loss based on historical losses in the portfolio 
additionally  the bank s management allocates a specific allowance for impaired credits  in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting by creditors for impairment of a loan 
the level of the general allowance is established to provide coverage for management s estimate of the credit risk in the loan portfolio by various loan segments not covered by the specific allowance 
the table set forth below reflects management s allocation of the allowance for loan losses by loan category and the ratio of each loan category to the total loans as of the dates indicated allocation of allowance for loan losses as of december  amount percentage of loans in each category to to average gross loans amount percentage of loans in each category to to average gross loans amount percentage of loans in each category to to average gross loans amount percentage of loans in each category to to average gross loans amount percentage of loans in each category to to average gross loans dollars in thousands type of loans commercial loans residential mortgage loans and equity lines commercial mortgage loans real estate construction loans installment loans other loans total the increase of million in the allowance allocated to commercial loans to million at year end is due primarily to an increase in loans risk graded special mentioned and substandard due in part to weakness in the economy and an increase of million in the allowance reserved against impaired commercial loans

construction loans comprised of impaired loans  of non accrual loans  and of loans over days still on accrual status at december  compared to of impaired loans  of non accrual loans  and of loans over days still on accrual status at december  also  see part i item a risk factors above in this annual report form k for additional factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from forward looking statements or historical performance 
liquidity liquidity is our ability to maintain sufficient cash flow to meet maturing financial obligations and customer credit needs  and to take advantage of investment opportunities as they are presented in the marketplace 
our principal sources of liquidity are growth in deposits  proceeds from the maturity or sale of securities and other financial instruments  repayments from securities and loans  federal funds purchased  securities sold under agreements to repurchase  and advances from the fhlb 
at year end  our liquidity ratio defined as net cash and short term and marketable securities to net deposits and short term liabilities increased to primarily due to higher securities balances compared to at year end to supplement its liquidity needs  the bank maintains a total credit line of million for federal funds with four correspondent banks 
in addition  the bank is also a shareholder of the fhlb  which enables the bank to have access to lower cost fhlb financing when necessary 
at december   the bank had an approved credit line with the fhlb of san francisco totaling billion 
total advances from the fhlb of san francisco at december   were billion  of which million are non callable advances and million are callable advances 
these borrowings bear fixed rates and are secured by loans and securities 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
on january   the bank pledged a portion of its commercial loans to the federal reserve bank s discount window under the borrower in custody program and increased its borrowing capacity from the discount window by million 
liquidity can also be provided through the sale of liquid assets  which consist of federal funds sold  securities purchased under agreements to resell  and securities available for sale 
at december   securities available for sale totaled billion  with billion pledged as collateral for borrowings and other commitments 
the remaining million was available as additional liquidity or to be pledged as collateral for additional borrowings 
approximately of our time deposits mature within one year or less as of december  management anticipates that there may be some outflow of these deposits upon maturity due to the keen competition in the bank s marketplace 
however  based on our historical runoff experience  we expect the outflow will not be significant and can be replenished through our normal growth in deposits 
management believes all the above mentioned sources will provide adequate liquidity for the next twelve months to the bank to meet its operating needs 
the company obtains funding for its activities primarily through dividend income contributed by the bank  proceeds from the issuance of the bancorp common stock through our dividend reinvestment plan and exercise of stock options 
dividends paid to the bancorp by the bank are subject to regulatory limitations 
the business activities of the bancorp consist primarily of the operation of the bank with limited activities in other investments 
management believes the bancorp s liquidity generated from its prevailing sources is sufficient to meet its operational needs

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk market risk is the risk of loss from adverse changes in market prices and rates 
the principal market risk to the company is the interest rate risk inherent in our lending  investing  deposit taking and borrowing activities  due to the fact that interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities do not re price at the same rate  to the same extent  or on the same basis 
we monitor and manage our interest rate risk through analyzing the re pricing characteristics of our loans  securities  deposits  and borrowings on an on going basis 
the primary objective is to minimize the adverse effects of changes in interest rates on our earnings  and ultimately the underlying market value of equity  while structuring our asset liability composition to obtain the maximum spread 
management uses certain basic measurement tools in conjunction with established risk limits to regulate its interest rate exposure 
due to the limitation inherent in any individual risk management tool  we use a simulation model to measure and quantify the impact to our profitability as well as to estimate changes to the market value of our assets and liabilities 
we use a net interest income simulation model to measure the extent of the differences in the behavior of the lending  investing  and funding rates to changing interest rates  so as to project future earnings or market values under alternative interest rate scenarios 
interest rate risk arises primarily through the traditional business activities of extending loans  investing securities  accepting deposits  and borrowings 
many factors  including economic and financial conditions  movements in interest rates  and consumer preferences affect the spread between interest earned on assets and interest paid on liabilities 
the net interest income simulation model is designed to measure the volatility of net interest income and net portfolio value  defined as net present value of assets and liabilities  under immediate rising or falling interest rate scenarios in basis points increments 
although the modeling is very helpful in managing interest rate risk  it does require significant assumptions for the projection of loan prepayment rates on mortgage related assets  loan volumes and pricing  and deposit and borrowing volume and pricing  that might prove inaccurate 
because these assumptions are inherently uncertain  the model cannot precisely estimate net interest income  or precisely predict the effect of higher or lower interest rates on net interest income 
actual results will differ from simulated results due to the timing  magnitude  and frequency of interest rates changes  the differences between actual experience and the assumed volume  changes in market conditions  and management strategies  among other factors 
the company monitors its interest rate sensitivity and attempts to reduce the risk of a significant decrease in net interest income caused by a change in interest rates 
we establish a tolerance level in our policy to define and limit interest income volatility to a change of plus or minus when the hypothetical rate change is plus or minus basis points 
when the net interest rate simulation projects that our tolerance level will be met or exceeded  we seek corrective action after considering  among other things  market conditions  customer reaction  and the estimated impact on profitability 
at december   if interest rates were to increase instantaneously by basis points  the simulation indicated that our net interest income over the next twelve months would increase by  and if interest rates were to increase instantaneously by basis points  the simulation indicated that our net interest income over the next twelve months would decrease by 
conversely  if interest rates were to decrease instantaneously by basis points  the simulation indicated that our net interest income over the next twelve months would decrease by  and if interest rates were to decrease instantaneously by basis points  the simulation indicated that our net interest income over the next twelve months would decrease by 
our simulation model also projects the net economic value of our portfolio of assets and liabilities 
we have established a tolerance level to value the net economic value of our portfolio of assets and liabilities in our policy to a change of plus or minus when the hypothetical rate change is plus or minus basis points 
at december   if interest rates were to increase instantaneously by basis points  the simulation indicated that the net economic value of our portfolio of assets and liabilities would decrease by  and conversely  if interest rates were to decrease instantaneously by basis points  the simulation indicated that the net economic value of our assets and liabilities would increase by quantitative information about interest rate risk the following table shows the carrying value of our financial instruments that are sensitive to changes in interest rates  categorized by expected maturity  as well as the instruments total fair values at december   and for assets  expected maturities are based on contractual maturity 
for liabilities  we use our historical experience and decay factors to estimate the deposit runoffs of interest bearing transactional deposits 
we use certain assumptions to estimate fair values and expected maturities which are described in note to the consolidated financial statements 
off balance sheet commitments to extend credit  letters of credit  and bill of lading guarantees represent the contractual unfunded amounts 
off balance sheet financial instruments represent fair values 
the results presented may vary if different assumptions are used or if actual experience differs from the assumptions used

however  we enter into financial derivatives in order to seek mitigation of exposure to interest rate risks related to our interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
we believe that these transactions  when properly structured and managed  may provide a hedge against inherent interest rate risk in our assets or liabilities and against risk in specific transactions 
in such instances  we may protect our position through the purchase or sale of interest rate futures contracts for a specific cash or interest rate risk position 
other hedge transactions may be implemented using interest rate swaps  interest rate caps  floors  financial futures  forward rate agreements  and options on futures or bonds 
prior to considering any hedging activities  we seek to analyze the costs and benefits of the hedge in comparison to other viable alternative strategies 
all hedges will require an assessment of basis risk and must be approved by the bank s investment committee 
the company follows sfas no 
which established accounting and reporting standards for financial derivatives  including certain financial derivatives embedded in other contracts  and hedging activities 
it requires the recognition of all financial derivatives as assets or liabilities in our consolidated balance sheet and measurement of those financial derivatives at fair value 
the accounting treatment of changes in fair value is dependent upon whether or not a financial derivative is designated as a hedge and if so  the type of hedge 
fair value is based on dealer quotes  or quoted prices from instruments with similar characteristics 
for derivatives designated as cash flow hedges  changes in fair value are recognized in other comprehensive income until the hedged item is recognized in earnings 
for derivatives designated as fair value hedges  changes in the fair value of the derivatives are reflected in current earnings  together with changes in the fair value of the related hedged item if there is a highly effective correlation between changes in the fair value of the interest rate swaps and changes in the fair value of the underlying asset or liability that is intended to be hedged 
if there is not a highly effective correlation between changes in the fair value of the interest rate swap and changes in the fair value of the underlying asset or liability that is intended to be hedged  then only the changes in the fair value of the interest rate swaps are reflected in the company s consolidated financial statements
