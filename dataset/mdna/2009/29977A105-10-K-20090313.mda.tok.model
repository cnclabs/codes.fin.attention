item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with evercore partners inc s consolidated combined financial statements and the related notes included elsewhere in this form k 
reorganization formation transaction prior to the ipo  our business  or predecessor company  had historically been owned by our senior managing directors 
on august   and pursuant to a contribution and sale agreement dated as of may   our senior managing directors contributed to evercore lp each of the various entities included in our historical combined financial statements that were under common control of the members of evercore lp members  with the exception of the general partners of ecp i  ecp ii and evp and certain other entities through which messrs 
altman and beutner funded their capital commitments to ecp i  forming the successor company 
the successor company has continued to conduct the same business as the predecessor company 
more specifically  our senior managing directors contributed to evercore lp all of the equity interests in evercore group holdings lp  a delaware limited partnership egh and its general partner  evercore group holdings llc egh wholly owns evercore partners services east llc east  the operating company that in turn wholly owns the advisors to the ecp ii and evp funds and certain other entities 
as part of the formation transaction  evercore advisors llc  the advisor to ecp i  egl  evercore s registered broker dealer and evercore properties llc  evercore s leaseholding entity were sold to east 
evercore gp holdings llc  a delaware limited liability company which became a non managing member of the general partner of ecp ii and is entitled to to depending on the particular fund investment of any carried interest realized from that fund following the reorganization  which represented of the carried interest then allocable to our senior managing directors 
in exchange for these contributions to evercore lp  our senior managing directors and certain trusts benefiting certain of their families received  vested and  unvested evercore lp partnership units 
the vesting arrangements applicable to these evercore lp partnership units are described under other expenses 
in addition  we distributed cash to the members so as to distribute to them all earnings for the period from january  to the date of the closing of the contribution and sale agreement 
we accounted for this transaction  which we refer to as the formation transaction  substantially by using the members historical cost of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed and recorded minority interest to reflect the members ongoing ownership in evercore lp 
we account for the remaining unvested evercore lp partnership units issued in the formation transaction as future compensation expense

combination with protego protego s business historically was owned by its directors and other stockholders and conducted by protego and its subsidiaries and protego si sc protego si 
concurrently with the formation transaction  we and protego undertook the following steps pursuant to the contribution and sale agreement  which we refer to collectively as the protego combination evercore lp acquired protego and its subsidiaries including a interest in pcb  protego s asset management subsidiary and a interest in the discovery fund  and protego si in exchange for million aggregate principal amount of non interest bearing notes  and 
table of contents mr 
aspe and the other protego directors became senior managing directors of evercore partners inc and subscribed  collectively with certain companies they control  certain trusts benefiting their families and a trust benefiting certain directors and employees of protego  for  vested and  unvested evercore lp partnership units 
of the million in notes issued in consideration for the protego combination  million was payable in cash and million was payable in shares of our class a common stock valued at the ipo price of per share 
we issued  shares of class a common stock upon repayment of such notes 
in addition  protego distributed to its directors cash  and to the extent cash was not available  interest in certain accounts receivable  so as to distribute to its directors all earnings for the period from january   to the date of the closing of the contribution and sale agreement 
ipo on august   evercore partners inc completed the ipo of its class a common stock by issuing  shares of its class a common stock  including shares issued to the underwriters pursuant to their election to exercise in full their overallotment option  for cash consideration of per share net of underwriting discounts to a syndicate of underwriters 
evercore partners inc contributed all of the net proceeds from the ipo to evercore lp  and evercore lp issued to evercore partners inc a number of evercore lp partnership units equal to the number of shares of class a common stock that evercore partners inc issued in connection with the protego combination and in the ipo 
evercore partners inc also became the sole general partner of evercore lp 
as a result of the formation transaction  the protego combination and the other transactions described above  which we collectively refer to as the reorganization  immediately following the ipo evercore partners inc became the sole general partner of evercore lp and  through evercore lp and its subsidiaries  operates our business  including the business of protego  our senior managing directors  including the former directors of protego  and certain companies they control  certain trusts benefiting certain of their families and a trust benefiting certain directors and employees of protego held shares of our class b common stock and  evercore lp partnership units  and our public stockholders including certain former stockholders of protego who received million payable in shares of our class a common stock as described above collectively owned  shares of class a common stock 
the class b common stock provides its holder with no economic rights but entitles the holder to a number of votes that is equal to the number of evercore lp partnership units held by such holder 
subject to the vesting and transfer restriction provisions of the evercore lp partnership agreement  the limited partners of evercore lp are entitled to exchange their evercore lp partnership units for shares of class a common stock on a one for one basis  subject to customary rate adjustment for stock splits  stock amendments and reclassifications 
acquisition of braveheart on december   we completed the acquisition of braveheart 
braveheart was organized to provide corporate finance and private equity advisory services  subject to its receipt of applicable regulatory approvals 
in exchange for of the outstanding share capital of braveheart  we paid initial consideration  deferred consideration and earn out consideration 
the initial consideration was comprised of  shares of evercore partners inc class a common stock 
the deferred consideration was comprised of  additional shares of class a common stock 
of this deferred consideration   shares were issued to braveheart shareholders on april  and an additional  shares were issued to braveheart shareholders on march  as part of the overall consideration  the company issued million of interest bearing notes 
table of contents to the former shareholders of braveheart  due  which bear interest at libor plus basis points and which are redeemable by the holder at any time after october  these notes were paid in full on april  additionally  we paid million in cash as part of the acquisition 
follow on offering of evercore partners inc class a common stock on may   we completed a follow on offering of  shares of class a common stock for cash consideration of per share net of underwriting discounts 
net proceeds in conjunction with this issuance  after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and offering expenses  were million 
we contributed all of the net proceeds from this follow on offering to evercore lp  and evercore lp issued to us  evercore lp partnership units 
we used and intend to use these proceeds to expand and diversify our advisory and investment management businesses and for general corporate purposes in our operating subsidiary  evercore lp 
in conjunction with the follow on offering  members exchanged  evercore lp partnership units for shares of our class a common stock on a one for one basis 
the follow on offering related transactions resulted in messrs 
altman  beutner and aspe  and trusts benefiting their families and permitted transferees  collectively  ceasing to beneficially own at least of the aggregate evercore lp partnership units owned by them on the date of the reorganization  which in turn resulted in the vesting of  or approximately  of the unvested evercore lp partnership units   unvested rsus and  unvested shares of restricted stock 
the vesting of evercore lp partnership units resulted in a non cash charge to compensation expense and an offsetting increase in minority interest of million on our consolidated statement of financial condition as of december   and the vesting of rsus and restricted stock resulted in a non cash charge to compensation expense of million and an offsetting increase in stockholders equity of million on our consolidated statement of financial condition as of december  we refer to the above transactions collectively as the follow on offering 
prior to the follow on offering  each holder of class b common stock had effectively ceded their voting rights with respect to their ownership of class b common stock and evercore lp partnership units to messrs 
altman  beutner and aspe 
subsequent to the follow on offering  each holder of class b common stock is entitled to one vote for each evercore lp partnership unit held by such holder 
at the completion of the follow on offering   or  of the non forfeited  unvested rsus issued in conjunction with the ipo vested 
as with the unvested evercore lp partnership units  the rsus that vested were charged to expense at the completion of the follow on offering based on the grant date fair value of the class a common stock deliverable pursuant to such rsus  which is the ipo price of the class a common stock of per share 
accordingly  at the completion of the follow on offering we recorded a non cash equity based compensation charge associated with the vesting of these previously unvested rsus of million 
following the completion of the follow on offering  if all of the remaining unvested and unforfeited rsus as of december  were to vest at some point in the future  based on the grant date fair value of the class a common stock deliverable pursuant to such rsus of per share  the total amount of compensation expense that we will record in connection with the vesting of these unvested rsus would be approximately million 
to the extent unvested rsus vest  they are included in weighted average shares outstanding for purposes of calculating basic and diluted net income per share  which has a dilutive effect on these measures 
in the first six months of and prior to the follow on offering  and in connection with new hiring activity  we granted  rsus with a grant date fair value of per unit   of which were fully vested and  of which were unvested and vest upon the same conditions as the unvested evercore lp partnership units issued in connection with the reorganization and  shares of restricted stock with a grant date fair value of per share  all of which were unvested and vest upon the earlier of one year following the date of grant or when messrs 
altman  beutner and aspe  and trusts benefiting their families and permitted transferees  collectively  cease to beneficially own at least of the aggregate evercore lp partnership units owned by them on the date the reorganization was effected 
at the completion of the follow on offering   of these rsus and all of these  shares of restricted stock vested and we accordingly recorded a non cash equity based compensation charge of million in connection therewith 

table of contents prior to the follow on offering  members exchanged  evercore lp partnership units that they held on a one for one basis for shares of our class a common stock 
in addition  evercore lp partnership units held by members may be exchanged in the future for shares of our class a common stock on a one for one basis  subject to customary conversion rate adjustments for stock splits  stock dividends and reclassifications 
this exchange and any such future exchanges are expected to result in an increase in the tax basis of the tangible and intangible assets of evercore lp 
these increases in tax basis increase for tax purposes amortization and  therefore  reduce the amount of tax that we would otherwise be required to pay 
we have entered into a tax receivable agreement with members that provides for the payment by us to an exchanging member of of the amount of cash savings  if any  in us federal  state and local income tax that we actually realize as a result of these increases in tax basis 
we expect to benefit from the remaining of cash savings  if any  in income tax that we realize 
while the actual amount and timing of any payments under this agreement will vary depending upon a number of factors  including the timing of exchanges  the extent to which such exchanges are taxable and the amount and timing of our income  we expect that  as a result of the size of the increases of the tangible and intangible assets of evercore lp attributable to our interest in evercore lp  during the expected term of the tax receivable agreement  the payments that we may make to our members could be substantial 
assuming no material changes in the relevant tax law  and that we earn sufficient taxable income to realize the full tax benefit of the increased amortization  we expect that future payments to our members in respect of the exchange of evercore lp partnership units that occurred prior to the follow on offering to aggregate approximately million  resulting in payments of approximately  on average  million per year  based on a value of the class a common stock of per share 
future payments to our members in respect of subsequent exchanges pursuant to the tax receivable agreement would be in addition to these amounts and are expected to be substantial 
the effects of the tax receivable agreement on our consolidated statement of financial condition as a result of the exchange of  evercore lp partnership units by members prior to the follow on offering were as follows we recorded an increase of million in deferred tax assets for the estimated income tax effects of the increase in the tax basis of the assets owned by evercore lp  based on enacted federal and state tax rates at the date of the transaction 
to the extent we estimate that we will not realize the full benefit represented by the deferred tax asset  based on an analysis of expected future earnings  we will reduce the deferred tax asset with a valuation allowance  and we recorded of the estimated realizable tax benefit which is the recorded deferred tax asset less any recorded valuation allowance as an increase of million between amounts due pursuant to tax receivable agreements and payable to employees and related parties and the remaining of the estimated realizable tax benefit  or million  as an increase to additional paid in capital 
therefore  as of the date of the exchange of the evercore lp partnership units  on a cumulative basis the net effect of accounting for income taxes and the tax receivable agreement on our consolidated combined financial statements was a net increase in stockholders equity of of the estimated realizable tax benefit 
the amounts that were recorded for both the deferred tax asset and the liability for our obligations under the tax receivable agreement have been estimated 
any additional payments under the tax receivable agreement that will further increase the tax benefits and the estimated payments under the tax receivable agreement have not been included in this estimate 
all of the effects of changes in any of our estimates after the date of the exchange will be included in net income 
similarly  the effect of subsequent changes in the enacted tax rates will be included in net income 
future exchanges of evercore lp partnership units for our shares of class a common stock will be accounted for in a similar manner 

table of contents comparability of results for various periods the successor company results represent the consolidated results of evercore partners inc and its subsidiaries subsequent to our ipo on august  the predecessor company results represent the results of the combined entities known as evercore holdings prior to the reorganization 
both the predecessor and successor company results have been prepared in accordance with us gaap 
as discussed above  during we entered into several material transactions that make it more difficult to compare the results of and with in particular the formation transaction  which includes the elimination of the financial results of the general partners of the ecp i  ecp ii and evp funds and certain other entities through which messrs 
altman and beutner had invested capital in the ecp i fund  which was not contributed to evercore lp  and the protego and braveheart acquisitions which resulted in the inclusion of each of the acquired entity s financial results  as well as certain purchase accounting adjustments  such as the recording of intangible assets and their periodic amortization 
in addition to the inclusion and exclusion of the results of certain entities  the transactions mentioned above had additional effects on our results that also limit the ability to compare and with principally prior to the ipo  evercore was not subject to federal income taxes  but was subject to new york city unincorporated business tax ubt and new york city general corporation taxes 
as a result of the ipo  the operating business entities of evercore were restructured and a portion of evercore s income is subject to us federal income taxes  as well as foreign  state and local taxes  and payments for services rendered by evercore s senior managing directors were historically accounted for as distributions of members capital rather than as compensation expense 
following the ipo  management has included all payments for services rendered by the senior managing directors in employee compensation and benefits expense 
key financial measures revenue total revenues reflect revenues from our advisory and investment management business segments that includes transaction related client reimbursements plus other revenue 
net revenues reflect total revenues less interest expense related to repurchase agreements  senior notes and other borrowings 
advisory 
our advisory business earns fees from our clients for providing advice on mergers  acquisitions  restructurings  leveraged buy outs  recapitalizations and other corporate transactions 
the amount and timing of the fees paid vary by the type of engagement 
in general  fees are paid at the time we sign an engagement letter  during the course of the engagement or when an engagement is completed 
the majority of our advisory revenue comes from fees that are dependent on the successful completion of a transaction 
a transaction can fail to be completed for many reasons  including failure to agree upon final terms with the counterparty  to secure necessary board or shareholder approvals  to secure necessary financing or to achieve necessary regulatory approvals 
revenue trends in our advisory business generally are correlated to the volume of m a activity and restructurings 
however  deviations from this trend can occur in any given year for a number of reasons 
for example  changes in our market share or the ability of our clients to close certain large transactions can cause our revenue results to diverge from the level of overall m a or restructuring activity 
we operate in a highly competitive environment where there are no long term contracted sources of revenue and each revenue generating engagement is separately awarded and negotiated 
our list of clients  including our list of clients with whom there is a currently active revenue generating engagement  changes continually 
we 
table of contents gain new clients through our business development initiatives  through recruiting additional senior investment banking professionals who bring with them client relationships and through referrals from executives  directors  attorneys and other parties with whom we have relationships 
we may also lose clients as a result of the sale or merger of a client  a change in a client s senior management  competition from other investment banks and other causes 
investment management 
our investment management business includes operations related to the management of the private equity funds  institutional asset management  wealth management and other business activities 
revenue sources primarily include management fees  performance fees including carried interest  fees earned from portfolio company fees and gains or losses on our investments 
management fees are generally a percentage of committed capital or invested capital at rates agreed with the investment funds we manage or with the individual client 
performance fees are earned when specified benchmarks are exceeded 
in certain circumstances  such fees are subject to claw back provisions 
portfolio company fees include monitoring  director and transaction fees associated with services provided to the portfolio companies of the private equity funds we manage 
gains and losses include both realized and unrealized gains and losses on principal investments  including those arising from our equity interest in investment partnerships 
transaction related client reimbursements 
in both our advisory and investment management segments we make various transaction related expenditures  such as travel and professional fees  on behalf of our clients 
pursuant to the engagement letters with our clients or the contracts with the limited partners in the private equity funds we manage  these expenditures may be reimbursable 
we define these expenses as transaction related expenses and record such expenditures as incurred and record revenue when it is determined that clients have an obligation to reimburse us for such transaction related expenses 
client expense reimbursements are recorded as revenue on the consolidated combined statements of operations on the later of the date an engagement letter is executed or the date we pay or accrue the expense 
net interest revenue 
net interest revenue is derived primarily from investing customer funds in financing transactions by pcb 
these transactions are principally repurchases and resales of mexican government securities 
revenue and expenses associated with these transactions are recognized over the term of the repurchase or resale transaction 
net interest revenue also includes interest expense associated with the senior notes  as well as income earned on marketable securities and cash deposited with financial institutions 
operating expenses employee compensation and benefits expense 
prior to the ipo  our employee compensation and benefits expense reflected compensation solely to non senior managing directors 
historically  payments for services rendered by our senior managing directors  including all salaries and bonuses  had been accounted for as distributions from members capital rather than as employee compensation and benefits expense 
as a result  our employee compensation and benefits expense and net income had not reflected payments for services rendered by our senior managing directors 
following the ipo  we include all payments for services rendered by our senior managing directors in employee compensation and benefits expense 
the company maintains compensation programs  including base salary  cash and equity bonus awards and benefits programs and manages compensation to estimates of competitive levels based on market conditions 
our level of compensation for the current period reflects our plan to maintain competitive compensation levels to retain key personnel during market down cycles  as well as the impact of new senior managing directors  hired in and  on compensation expense  including grants of equity awards valued at and stock prices 
increasing the number of high caliber senior managing directors is critical to our growth efforts 
typically newly hired senior managing directors don t start until the middle of a calendar year  and the new hires do not begin to generate significant revenue in the year they are hired 

table of contents we changed our annual compensation program during the second quarter of to include stock based compensation awards as a component of the annual bonus awards for certain senior managing directors 
these equity awards are subject to annual vesting requirements over a four year period beginning at the date of grant  which generally occurs in the first quarter of each year  accordingly  the expense is being amortized over the vesting period 
non compensation expenses 
the balance of our operating expenses includes costs for occupancy and equipment rental  professional fees  travel and related expenses  communications and information services  depreciation and amortization and other operating expenses 
we refer to all of these expenses as non compensation expenses 
we incurred significant additional non compensation expenses in and associated with compliance with section of the sarbanes oxley act of other expenses other expenses include stock based compensation costs associated with the ipo and the may follow on offering  a stock based compensation charge related to a severance agreement  a charge associated with deferred consideration pursuant to the braveheart sale and purchase agreement in  amortization of intangibles associated with the acquisitions of protego and braveheart  special charges in connection with the write off of certain capitalized costs associated with evercore capital partners ecp capital raising and employee severance  accelerated share based vesting and other costs related to the closing of the los angeles office and acquisition and transition costs incurred in connection with acquisitions currently in process 
approximately two thirds of the evercore lp partnership units received by our senior managing directors  other than mr 
altman and mr 
beutner  in the formation transaction and two thirds of the evercore lp partnership units received by the directors of protego who became our senior managing directors  other than mr 
aspe  and certain companies they control and a trust benefiting directors and employees of protego in the protego combination are  with specified exceptions  subject to forfeiture and re allocation to other senior managing directors or  in the event that there are no eligible senior managing directors  forfeiture and cancellation if the senior managing director ceases to be employed by us prior to the occurrence of specified vesting events 
 or approximately  of these unvested evercore lp partnership units vested in conjunction with the follow on offering 
in addition  the company entered into a severance agreement with an employee which modified the award terms that resulted in the company expensing the value of the employee s unvested evercore lp partnership units 
the remaining unvested evercore lp partnership units issued will vest upon the earliest to occur of the following events when messrs 
altman  beutner and aspe  and trusts benefiting their families and permitted transferees  collectively  cease to beneficially own at least of the aggregate evercore lp partnership units owned by them at the time of the reorganization  a change of control of evercore  or two of messrs 
altman  beutner and aspe are not employed by  or do not serve as a director of  evercore partners inc or one of its affiliates within a year period following the ipo 
in addition  of the remaining unvested evercore lp partnership units held by a senior managing director will vest if such senior managing director dies or becomes disabled while in our employ 
our equity committee  which is comprised of messrs 
altman and aspe  may also accelerate vesting of unvested evercore lp partnership units at any time 
post reorganization  on august   we account for the unvested evercore lp partnership units as compensation paid to employees in accordance with sfas no 
r  share based payments sfas r  which we adopted effective january  the unvested evercore lp partnership units vest based on the achievement of one of the performance and service vesting conditions as described above 
in accordance with sfas r  accruals of compensation costs for awards with a performance or service condition are based on 
table of contents the probable outcome of that service or performance condition 
compensation cost is accrued if it is probable that the performance condition will be achieved and is not accrued if it is not probable that the performance condition will be achieved 
we had heretofore concluded that it was not probable that the conditions relating to a decline in the collective beneficial ownership of messrs 
altman  beutner and aspe and trusts benefiting their families and permitted transferees  a change of control of evercore or a lack of continued association of messrs 
altman  beutner and aspe with evercore would be achieved  or that the death or disability condition during the employment period would be satisfied 
accordingly  prior to the follow on offering  we had not been accruing compensation expense relating to any unvested evercore lp partnership units 
we recorded compensation expense in conjunction with the vesting that occurred due to the follow on offering as described above  and we continue to believe that it is not probable that the remaining conditions relating to vesting of evercore lp partnership units will be achieved  or that the death or disability condition during the employment period will be satisfied 
accordingly  we do not intend to accrue compensation expense in the future relating to the remaining unvested evercore lp partnership units unless such conditions become probable 
mr 
beutner announced his retirement from the company on may  management has assessed the impact of mr 
beutner s retirement on the evercore lp partnership unit vesting events discussed above and has concluded that no such condition has become probable at this time 
management has concluded that  at the current time  the disassociation of mr 
altman or mr 
aspe with the company within ten years subsequent to the ipo date is not probable 
there have not been any stated changes in the intentions of either mr 
altman or mr 
aspe to terminate their employment or current roles and functions with the company 
provision for income taxes prior to august   we had not been subject to us federal income tax  but had been subject to the new york city ubt and new york city general corporate tax on our us earnings  including certain non income tax fees in other jurisdictions where we had registered offices and conduct business 
our operations were historically organized as a series of partnerships  limited liability companies and subchapter s corporations 
taxes related to income earned by these entities represent obligations of the individual members  partners or shareholders and have not historically been reflected in the accompanying consolidated combined financial statements 
commencing august   evercore partners inc became subject to us corporate federal income tax on its allocable share of income 
we account for income taxes in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  which requires the recognition of tax benefits or expenses on temporary differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of its assets and liabilities 
minority interest on a historical basis  our minority interest consisted of unaffiliated third party interests in the general partner of evp 
following the ipo  we no longer consolidate the general partner of that fund and  accordingly  minority interest related to evp is no longer reflected in our financial results 
we do  however  record significant minority interest relating to the ownership interest of our senior managing directors and their estate planning vehicles in evercore lp  as well as the portions of pcb and ewm not owned by evercore 
as described in note to our consolidated combined financial statements herein  evercore partners inc is the sole general partner of evercore lp 
accordingly  although evercore partners inc has a minority economic interest in evercore lp  it has a majority voting interest and controls the management of evercore lp 
as a result  evercore partners inc consolidates evercore lp and records a minority interest for the economic interest in evercore lp held by the limited partners 
during  the vesting of additional evercore lp partnership units described above under other expenses resulted in an increase in the minority interest relating to the ownership interest of our senior managing directors and their estate planning vehicles in evercore lp 
this was partially offset by the exchange of our class a common stock for evercore lp partnership units and the purchase of additional evercore lp partnership units by us in conjunction with the follow on offering 

table of contents results of operations following is a discussion of our results of operations for the years ended december   and for a more detailed discussion of the factors that affected the revenue and operating expenses of our advisory and investment management business segments in these periods  see the discussion in business segments below 
historical results for periods prior to the ipo and subsequent thereto are not comparable 
for example  in results of operations for periods prior to our ipo on august   payments for services rendered by our senior managing directors were reflected as distributions to members  while such payments are reflected as compensation expense in subsequent periods 
operating expenses include a employee compensation and benefits expenses that are incurred directly in support of the segments and b non compensation expenses  which include expenses for premises and occupancy  professional fees  travel and entertainment  communications and information services  equipment and indirect support costs including compensation and other operating expenses related thereto for administrative services 
such administrative services include  but are not limited to  accounting  tax  legal  facilities management and senior management activities 
other expenses include stock based compensation costs associated with the ipo and the may follow on offering  a stock based compensation charge related to a severance agreement  a charge associated with deferred consideration pursuant to the braveheart sale and purchase agreement in  amortization of intangibles associated with the acquisitions of protego and braveheart  special charges in connection with the write off of certain capitalized costs associated with ecp capital raising and employee severance  accelerated share based vesting and other costs related to the closing of the los angeles office and acquisition and transition costs incurred in connection with acquisitions currently in process 
the global financial markets have experienced unprecedented disruption and volatility during and therefore difficult market conditions persisted throughout most of the year 
contraction in worldwide credit markets due in part to sub prime lending issues  volatile currency and commodity markets  major write downs within the financial sector and volatile oil prices have raised significant uncertainty about the state of the us and global economies 
these economic and market conditions have negatively affected our financial performance in both our advisory and investment management businesses  particularly in the second half of  and may continue to adversely affect our financial performance in we operate in a very competitive and rapidly changing environment 
new risks and uncertainties emerge from time to time  and it is not possible for us to predict all risks and uncertainties  nor can we assess the impact of all potentially applicable factors on our business or the extent to which any factor  or combination of factors  may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward looking statements

liquidity and capital resources general our current assets include cash and cash equivalents  marketable securities and accounts receivable in relation to advisory and investment management revenues 
our current liabilities include accrued expenses and employee compensation 
we traditionally have made payments for employee bonuses and year end distributions to partners in the first quarter of the year with respect to the prior year s results 
cash distributions related to partnership tax allocations are made to the partners of evercore lp in accordance with the company s corporate estimated payment calendar  these payments are made prior the end of each calendar quarter

we regularly monitor our liquidity position  including cash  other significant working capital current assets and liabilities  long term liabilities  lease commitments  principal investment commitments related to our investment management business  dividends on class a common shares  partnership distributions and other matters relating to liquidity and compliance with regulatory requirements 
our liquidity is highly dependent on our revenue stream from our operations  principally from our advisory business  which is a function of closing transactions and earning success fees  the timing and realization of which is irregular and dependent upon factors which are not subject to our control 
our revenue stream funds the payment of our expenses  including annual bonus payments  interest expense on our senior notes and income taxes 
payments made for income taxes may be reduced by deductions taken for the increase in tax basis of the company s investment in evercore lp 
these tax deductions  when realized  require payment under our long term liability  amounts due pursuant to tax receivable agreements 
the company intends to fund these payments from cash and cash equivalents on hand  principally derived from cash flows from the operations of the company 
these tax deductions  when realized  will result in cash otherwise required to satisfy tax obligations becoming available for other purposes

the result of this review contributes to management s recommendation to the board of directors as to the level of quarterly dividend payments  if any 
as a financial services firm  our businesses are materially affected by conditions in the global financial markets and economic conditions throughout the world 
the domestic and global markets and economic conditions have been disruptive and volatile throughout in particular  the cost and availability of funding have been and may continue to be adversely affected by illiquid credit markets and wider credit spreads 
in addition  global equity prices have declined significantly 
as a result of concern about the stability of markets and the strength of counterparties  many lenders and institutional investors have materially reduced funding to 
table of contents many borrowers 
revenue generated by our advisory business is directly related to the number and value of the transactions in which we are involved 
during periods of unfavorable market or economic conditions  the number and value of m a transactions generally has decreased  thereby reducing the demand for our advisory services among financial services companies seeking such engagements 
our operating results are adversely affected by any such reduction in the number or value of mergers and acquisitions transactions 
this reduction has been partially offset by an increase in restructuring advisory activity 
in addition  as a result of the market and general economic downturn  the private equity funds that our investment management business manages have been impacted by reduced valuations and opportunities to exit and realize value from their investments and our institutional asset management business has generated lower revenue because investment advisory fees we receive typically are in part based on the market value of underlying publicly traded securities 
our profitability may also be adversely affected by our fixed costs and the possibility that we would be unable to scale back other costs within a time frame sufficient to match any decreases in revenue relating to changes in market and economic conditions 
during the second quarter of  our board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to million of evercore class a common stock and or evercore lp partnership units 
under this share repurchase program  shares may be repurchased from time to time in open market transactions  in privately negotiated transactions or otherwise 
the timing and the actual number of shares repurchased will depend on a variety of factors  including legal requirements  price and economic and market conditions 
this program may be suspended or discontinued at any time and does not have a specified expiration date

these repurchase agreements are primarily with institutional customer accounts managed by pcb  are generally in overnight maturities and permit the counterparty to pledge the securities

critical accounting policies and estimates the consolidated combined financial statements included in this report are prepared in conformity with us gaap  which requires management to make estimates and assumptions regarding future events that affect the amounts reported in our consolidated combined financial statements and their notes  including reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities

actual results could differ materially from those estimates 
we believe that the following discussion addresses our most critical accounting policies  which are those that are most important to the presentation of our financial condition and results of operations and require management s most difficult  subjective and complex judgments 
revenue recognition advisory revenue we earn advisory revenue through success fees based on the occurrence of certain events which may include announcements or completion of various types of financial transactions  retainer arrangements and fairness opinions 
we recognize advisory revenue when there is evidence of an arrangement with a client  agreed upon services have been provided  fees are fixed or determinable and collection is reasonably assured 
fees paid in advance of services rendered are initially recorded as deferred revenue  which is recorded within other current liabilities on the consolidated statements of financial condition  and recognized as advisory revenue ratably over the period in which the related service is rendered

management fees are contractually based and are derived from investment management services provided in originating  recommending and consummating investment opportunities to private equity funds 
management fees are typically paid in advance on committed capital during the private equity funds investment period  and on invested capital  thereafter 
management fees are initially recorded as deferred revenue and revenue is recognized ratably  thereafter  over the period during which services are provided 
the management fees may provide for a management fee offset for certain portfolio company fees we earn 
we also record performance fee revenue from the private equity funds when the returns on the private equity funds investments exceed certain threshold minimums 
these performance fees  or carried interest  are computed in accordance with the underlying private equity funds partnership agreements and are based on investment performance over the life of each investment partnership 
performance fees are recorded as revenue as earned pursuant to the client agreements 
institutional asset management revenue earned from the institutional asset management sector includes pcb s management fees and performance fees

generally  the approach in sfas r is similar to the approach described in sfas however  sfas r requires all share based payments to employees  including grants of employee stock options  to be recognized in the consolidated combined statements of operations based on their fair values

we adopted sfas r on january  see key financial measures operating expenses employee compensation and benefits expense for a discussion on expense related to vesting of evercore lp partnership units  rsus and shares of restricted stock that we recorded as a result of the completion of the follow on offering 

table of contents post reorganization  on august   we account for the unvested evercore lp partnership units as compensation paid to employees in accordance with sfas r  which we adopted effective january  compensation cost is accrued if it is probable that the performance condition will be achieved and is not accrued if it is not probable that the performance condition will be achieved 
see note to the consolidated combined financial statements herein for further information 
income taxes as part of the process of preparing our consolidated combined financial statements  we are required to estimate income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
significant management judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes  our deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against our net deferred tax assets 
this process requires us to estimate our actual current tax liability and to assess temporary differences resulting from differing book versus tax treatment of items  such as deferred revenue  compensation and benefits expense  unrealized gains on long term investments and depreciation 
these temporary differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included within our consolidated statements of financial condition 
we must then assess the likelihood that deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income  and  to the extent we believe that recovery is not more likely than not  we must establish a valuation allowance 
the ultimate realization of the deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which temporary differences become deductible 
management considers the level of historical taxable income  scheduled reversals of deferred taxes  projected future taxable income and tax planning strategies that can be implemented by us in making this assessment 
if actual results differ from these estimates or we adjust these estimates in future periods  we may need to adjust our valuation allowance  which could materially impact our consolidated financial condition and results of operations 
in addition  in order to determine the quarterly tax rate  we are required to estimate full year pre tax income and the related annual income tax expense in each jurisdiction 
changes in the geographic mix or estimated level of annual pre tax income can affect our overall effective tax rate 
furthermore  our interpretation of complex tax laws may impact our measurement of current and deferred income taxes 
on january   we adopted fin fin provides a benefit recognition model with a two step approach consisting of more likely than not recognition criteria  and a measurement attribute that measures the position as the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement 
fin also requires the recognition of liabilities created by differences between tax positions taken in a tax return and amounts recognized in the financial statements 
see note to the consolidated combined financial statements herein in regard to the impact of the adoption of fin on our consolidated combined financial statements 
impairment of assets in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  goodwill is tested for impairment annually or more frequently if circumstances indicate impairment may have occurred 
in this process  we make estimates and assumptions in order to determine the fair value of our reporting units and to project future earnings using valuation techniques  including a discounted cash flow model 
we use our best judgment and information available to us at the time to perform this review 
because our assumptions and estimates are used in projecting future earnings as part of the valuation  actual results could differ 
intangible assets with finite lives are amortized over their estimated useful lives which are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable as prescribed by sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
in addition to goodwill and intangible assets  we annually assess our equity method investments for impairment per apb opinion no 
 the equity method of accounting for investments in common stock 
for the year ended december   we concluded there was no impairment of goodwill  intangible assets and equity method investments
