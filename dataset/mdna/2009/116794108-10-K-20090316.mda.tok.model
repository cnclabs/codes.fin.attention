executive overview business overview bruker corporation and its wholly owned subsidiaries design  manufacture  market and service proprietary life science and materials research systems based on our core technology platforms  including x ray technologies  magnetic resonance technologies  mass spectrometry technologies  optical emission spectroscopy and infrared and raman molecular spectroscopy technologies 
we also 
table of contents manufacture and distribute a broad range of field analytical systems for chemical  biological  radiological and nuclear  or cbrn  detection 
we also develop and manufacture low temperature and high temperature wires for use in advanced magnet technology and energy applications 
we maintain major technical and manufacturing centers in europe  north america and japan and we have sales offices located throughout the world 
our corporate headquarters are located in billerica  massachusetts 
on february   we completed our acquisition of bruker biospin 
both the company and bruker biospin were majority owned by six affiliated stockholders prior to the acquisition 
as a result  the acquisition of bruker biospin is considered a combination of companies under common control  and has been accounted for at historical carrying values 
historical consolidated balance sheets  statements of operations  statements of cash flows and notes to the consolidated financial statements have been restated by combining the historical audited consolidated financial statements of bruker corporation with those of bruker biospin 
in addition  because the transaction is accounted for as an acquisition of businesses under common control  all one time transaction costs have been expensed as incurred 
our business strategy is to capitalize on our ability to innovate and generate rapid revenue growth  both organically and through acquisitions 
our revenue growth strategy combined with anticipated improvements to our gross profit margins and increased leverage on our research and development  sales and marketing and distribution investments and general and administrative expenses is expected to enhance our operating margins and improve our earnings in the future 
with the addition of bruker biospin  we enhanced our position as a leading supplier of life science and materials research systems 
the technologies of bruker biospin are particularly complementary to our accurate mass electrospray time of flight mass spectrometers and our single crystal diffraction x ray spectrometers and are expected to create revenue synergies and provide opportunities to supply customers with equipment packages that have a broader range of applications and value 
we believe the addition of bruker biospin also enhances our distribution in the americas  europe and asia and our sales and service infrastructure  which should provide revenue growth opportunities and accelerate our drive to improve our margins  net income and operating cash flows 
following the acquisition of bruker biospin  we changed our internal reporting structure to better reflect the way we manage and measure the performance of our business 
under the new reporting structure  we are organized into four operating segments  representing each of our four divisions bruker axs  bruker daltonics  bruker optics and bruker biospin 
bruker axs is in the business of manufacturing and distributing advanced x ray and oes spark instrumentation used in non destructive molecular and elemental analysis 
bruker daltonics is in the business of manufacturing and distributing mass spectrometry instruments that can be integrated and used along with other analytical instruments 
bruker optics is in the business of manufacturing and distributing research  analytical and process analysis instruments and solutions based on infrared and raman molecular spectroscopy technologies

financial overview for the year ended december   our revenue increased by million  or  to  million  compared to  million for the comparable period in included in this change in revenue is approximately million from the impact of foreign exchange 
excluding the effect of foreign exchange  revenue increased by million  or 
income from operations for the year ended december  was million  resulting in an operating margin of  compared to income from operations of million  resulting in an operating margin of  for the comparable period in our gross profit margin for the year ended december  was  compared to for the comparable period in lower gross margins were driven primarily by the mix of products sold and pricing pressure in certain product lines 
additionally  increases in operating expenses related primarily to higher sales and marketing expenses and higher research and development expenses contributed to lower operating margins 
the higher costs are a result of increased headcounts in support of our planned revenue growth and new product development and higher material costs associated with a number of new products recently released  or scheduled to be released over the next six months 
changes in foreign currency exchange rates  primarily the euro  also contributed significantly to the increase in operating expenses as a majority of our research and development is performed in europe 
income from operations for was below management s expectations and  as a result  we began implementing cost savings programs throughout our organization 
our actions have included voluntary salary decreases for top level management in  selected staff reductions  hiring and salary freezes and cut backs in discretionary spending 
the objective of these programs is to refocus our gross margin improvement programs  reduce our operating and interest expenses and further reduce our exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
in the fourth quarter of we recorded million of restructuring charges in connection with these initiatives 
during the year ended december   we recorded net losses on foreign currency transactions of million compared to net losses of million for the comparable period in foreign exchange losses of million were incurred in the first three months of and were driven by the re measurement of certain foreign currency denominated assets  principally cash  inter company receivables and a short term inter company loan into the functional currency of the affected entities 
the losses in the first quarter of resulted from the weakening of the us dollar and the euro relative to the swiss franc by approximately and  respectively  from the closing date of the bruker biospin acquisition to the end of the first quarter of since the first quarter of  we recorded cumulative gains on foreign currency transactions of million 
we have implemented certain programs to reduce our exposure to changes in foreign currencies  specifically settling inter company balances in a more timely manner and reducing certain foreign currency denominated assets  and are considering additional actions  including an expanded use of forward contracts within a transactional hedging program  that could be implemented in the first half of 
table of contents in connection with the acquisition of bruker biospin we borrowed million under a new credit facility in the first quarter of we repaid approximately million of acquisition related debt in we incurred approximately million of interest expense during the year ended december   of which million related to the acquisition related debt 
we incurred approximately million of interest expense during the year ended december   none of which related to the acquisition related debt 
our effective tax rate for the year ended december  was  compared with an effective tax rate of for the comparable period in changes in our effective tax rate are generally driven by the amount and mix of income in locations outside the us because we do not recognize any benefit for the losses that we incur in the us however  in we recorded million of net tax benefits related primarily to reversing certain valuation allowances on deferred tax assets and as a result of reaching the more likely than not threshold for recognizing certain tax receivables 
the tax benefits described were offset by million of income taxes incurred in connection with the liquidation of an entity within the biospin segment 
in addition  acquisition related costs did not generate significant tax benefits for us because they were incurred primarily in the us and foreign currency exchange losses did not generate significant tax benefits for us because they occurred in foreign locations with relatively low statutory tax rates 
in  we recorded million of net tax benefits related primarily to new tax legislation in germany 
our net income for the year ended december  was million  or per diluted share  compared to net income of million  or per diluted share  for critical accounting policies the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires that we make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
on an ongoing basis  management evaluates its estimates and judgments  including those related to revenue recognition  allowance for doubtful accounts  inventories  goodwill  long lived assets  warranty costs and income taxes 
we base our estimates and judgments on historical experience  current market and economic conditions  industry trends and other assumptions that we believe are reasonable and form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results could differ from these estimates 
we believe the following critical accounting policies to be both those most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and those that require the most subjective judgment 
revenue recognition 
we recognize revenue from system sales when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  the price is fixed or determinable  title and risk of loss has been transferred to the customer and collectibility of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured 
title and risk of loss is generally transferred to the customer upon receipt of a signed customer acceptance form for a system that has been shipped  installed  and for which the customer has been trained 
as a result  the timing of customer acceptance or readiness could cause our reported revenues to differ materially from expectations 
when products are sold through an independent distributor or a strategic distribution partner  who assumes responsibility for installation  we recognize the system sale when the product has been shipped and title and risk of loss have been transferred 
our distributors do not have price protection rights or rights of return  however  our products are typically warranted to be free from defect for a period of one year 
revenue is deferred until cash is received when a significant portion of the fee is due over one year after delivery  installation and acceptance of a system 
for arrangements with multiple elements  we recognize revenue for each element based on the fair value of the element  
table of contents provided all other criteria for revenue recognition have been met 
the fair value for each element provided in multiple element arrangements is typically determined by referencing historical pricing policies when the element is sold separately 
changes in our ability to establish the fair value for each element in multiple element arrangements could affect the timing of revenue recognition 
revenue from accessories and parts is recognized upon shipment and service revenue is recognized as the services are performed 
grant revenue is recognized when we complete the services required under the grant 
warranty costs 
we normally provide a one year parts and labor warranty with the purchase of equipment 
the anticipated cost for this warranty is accrued upon recognition of the sale and is included as a current liability on the balance sheet 
although our facilities undergo quality assurance and testing procedures throughout the production process  our warranty obligation is affected by product failure rates  material usage and service delivery costs incurred in correcting a product failure 
although our actual warranty costs have historically been consistent with expectations  to the extent warranty claim activity or costs associated with servicing those claims differ from our estimates  revisions to the warranty accrual may be required 
inventories 
inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market  with costs determined by the first in  first out method for a majority of subsidiaries and by average cost for certain international subsidiaries 
we maintain an allowance for excess and obsolete inventory to reflect the expected non saleable or non refundable inventory based on an evaluation of slow moving products 
if ultimate usage or demand varies significantly from expected usage or demand  additional write downs may be required  resulting in a charge to operations 
derivative financial instruments 
all derivative instruments are recorded as other assets or other liabilities at fair value  which is calculated as an estimate of the future cash flows  and subsequent changes in a derivative s fair value are recognized in income  unless specific hedge accounting criteria are met 
changes in the fair value of a derivative that is highly effective and designated as a cash flow hedge are recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income until the forecasted transaction occurs or it becomes probable that the forecasted transaction will not occur 
we perform an assessment at the inception of the hedge and on a quarterly basis thereafter  to determine whether our derivatives are highly effective in offsetting changes in the value of the hedged items 
any changes in the fair value resulting from hedge ineffectiveness  is immediately recognized as income or expense 
goodwill  other intangible assets and other long lived assets 
we evaluate whether goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets are impaired annually and when events occur or circumstances change 
goodwill is impaired when the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount 
fair value is determined using discounted future cash flows 
we also review long lived intangible assets and other assets when indication of potential impairment exists  such as a significant reduction in undiscounted cash flows associated with the assets 
should the fair value of our long lived assets decline because of reduced operating performance  market declines  or other indicators of impairment  a charge to operations for impairment may be necessary 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to pay amounts due 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  reducing their ability to make payments  additional allowances would be required  resulting in a charge to operations 
income taxes 
we estimate the degree to which tax assets and loss carryforwards will result in a benefit based on expected profitability by tax jurisdiction  and we provide a valuation allowance for tax assets and loss carryforwards that we believe will more likely than not go unused 
if it becomes more likely than not that a tax asset or loss carryforward will be used for which a reserve has been provided  we reverse the related valuation allowance 
if our actual future taxable income by tax jurisdiction differs from estimates  additional allowances or reversals of reserves may be necessary

the increase in operating expenses relates primarily to sales and marketing expenses and research and development expenses 
the higher costs are a result of increased headcounts in support of our investments in certain sales and marketing initiatives and acquisitions completed in the second half of  higher commissions associated with our increase in revenue and changes in foreign currency exchange rates  primarily the euro  as a majority of research and development in the bioscience segment is performed in europe

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are potentially exposed to market risks associated with changes in foreign exchange rates and interest rates 
we selectively use financial instruments to reduce these risks 
all transactions related to risk management techniques are authorized and executed pursuant to our policies and procedures 
analytical techniques used to manage and monitor foreign exchange and interest rate risk include market valuations and sensitivity analysis 
impact of foreign currencies we generate a substantial portion of our revenues in international markets  principally europe and japan  which subjects our operations to the exposure of exchange rate fluctuations 
the impact of currency exchange rate movement can be positive or negative in any period 
our costs related to sales in foreign currencies are largely denominated in the same respective currencies  limiting our transaction risk exposure 
however  for sales not denominated in us dollars  if there is an increase in the rate at which a foreign currency is exchanged for us dollars  it will require more of the foreign currency to equal a specified amount of us dollars than before the rate increase 
in such cases  if we price our products in the foreign currency  we will receive less in us dollars than we did before the rate increase went into effect 
if we price our products in us dollars and competitors price their products in local currency  an increase in the relative strength of the us dollar could result in our prices not being competitive in a market where business is transacted in the local currency 
our foreign exchange losses  net were million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
we will continue to evaluate our currency risks and may utilize foreign currency contracts more frequently in order to mitigate our foreign currency exposure 
from time to time  we have entered into foreign currency contracts in order to minimize the volatility that fluctuations in exchange rates have on our cash flows related to purchases and sales denominated in foreign currencies 
there were no outstanding forward contracts at december  impact of interest rates we regularly invest excess cash in short term investments that are subject to changes in interest rates 
we believe that the market risk arising from holding these financial instruments is minimal 
our exposure related to adverse movements in interest rates is derived primarily from outstanding floating rate debt instruments that are indexed to short term market rates 
our objective in managing our exposure to interest rates is to decrease the volatility that changes in interest rates might have on our earnings and cash flows 
to achieve this objective we entered into interest rate swaps and cross currency rate swaps in order to minimize the volatility that changes in interest rates might have on earnings and cash flows 
a increase or decrease in the average cost of our variable rate debt would not result in a material change in pre tax interest expense 
in april  we entered into an interest rate swap arrangement to pay a fixed rate of approximately and receive a variable rate based on three month libor through december  the initial notional amount of this interest swap was million and amortizes in proportion to the term debt component of our credit agreement 
at december   the outstanding notional amount of this swap was million 
we have determined that this swap is an effective hedge of the variability of cash flows of the interest payments 

table of contents we entered into a cross currency interest rate swap arrangement in with an initial notional amount of million under which we receive semiannual interest payments in euros based on a variable interest rate equal to the six month euribor rate in exchange for semiannual payments in swiss francs at a fixed rate of 
we terminated this cross currency interest rate swap in because of its ineffectiveness in offsetting the changes in cash flows 
we entered into an interest rate swap arrangement with an initial notional amount of million in under which we receive a variable rate of interest based on the securities industry and financial markets municipal swap index in exchange for a fixed rate of interest 
we also terminated this interest rate swap in because the related debt was repaid in full 
inflation we do not believe inflation had a material impact on our business or operating results during any of the periods presented
