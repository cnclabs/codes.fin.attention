item business general we are an independent oil and natural gas exploration and production company with operations in the rocky mountain  mid continent and gulf coast regions of the united states 
we were originally formed in to explore  develop and produce oil and natural gas properties 
through  our activities and growth remained focused primarily in oklahoma 
in  we expanded our activity into the rocky mountain and gulf coast regions 
approximately of our estimated proved reserves as of december  are located in the rocky mountain region 
we completed an initial public offering of our common stock on may   and our common stock began trading on the new york stock exchange on may  under the ticker symbol clr 
we focus our exploration activities in large new or developing plays that provide us the opportunity to acquire undeveloped acreage positions for future drilling operations 
we have been successful in targeting large repeatable resource plays where horizontal drilling  advanced fracture stimulation and enhanced recovery technologies provide the means to economically develop and produce oil and natural gas reserves from unconventional formations 
as a result of these efforts  we have grown substantially through the drillbit  adding mmboe of proved oil and natural gas reserves through extensions and discoveries from january  through december  compared to mmboe added through proved reserve purchases during that same period 
as of december   our estimated proved reserves were mmboe  with estimated proved developed reserves of mmboe  or of our total estimated proved reserves 
crude oil comprised of our total estimated proved reserves 
for the year ended december   we generated revenues of million and operating cash flows of million 
for the year and quarter ended december   daily production averaged  and  boe per day  respectively 
this represents growth of and as compared to the year and quarter ended december   when daily production averaged  boe and  boe  respectively 

table of contents the following table summarizes our total estimated proved reserves  pv and net producing wells as of december   average daily production for the three months ended december  and the reserve to production index in our principal regions 
our reserve estimates as of december  are based primarily on a reserve report prepared by ryder scott company  lp  our independent reserve engineers 
in preparing its report  ryder scott company  lp evaluated properties representing approximately of our pv our technical staff evaluated properties representing the remaining of our pv at december  average daily production fourth quarter boe per day percent of total annualized reserve production index proved reserves mboe percent of total pv in millions net producing wells rockies red river units bakken field montana bakken north dakota bakken other mid continent arkoma woodford other gulf coast total pv is a non gaap financial measure and generally differs from standardized measure  the most directly comparable gaap financial measure  because it does not include the effects of income taxes on future net revenues 
the standardized measure at december  is billion  a billion difference from pv because of the tax effect 
neither pv nor standardized measure represents an estimate of the fair market value of our oil and gas properties 
we and others in the industry use pv as a measure to compare the relative size and value of proved reserves held by companies without regard to the specific tax characteristics of such entities 
the annualized reserve production index is the number of years proved reserves would last assuming current production continued at the same rate 
this index is calculated by dividing annualized fourth quarter production into the proved reserve quantity at december  the following table provides additional information regarding our key development areas developed acres undeveloped acres gross wells planned for drilling capital expenditures in millions gross net gross net rockies red river units bakken field montana bakken north dakota bakken other mid continent arkoma woodford other gulf coast total 
table of contents capital expenditures budgeted for includes amounts for drilling  capital workovers and facilities and excludes amounts for land of million  seismic of million  and million for vehicles  computers and other equipment 
while the above capital expenditures budget reflects our current intentions  we intend to manage our capital expenditures to be inline with our cash flow from operations 
continued weakness in oil and natural gas prices could cause us to curtail our actual capital expenditures 
conversely  an increase in commodity prices could result in increased capital expenditures 
our business strategy our goal is to increase shareholder value by finding and developing crude oil and natural gas reserves at costs that provide an attractive rate of return on our investment 
the principal elements of our business strategy are focus on oil 
during the late s we began to believe that the valuation potential for crude oil exceeded that of natural gas 
accordingly  we began to shift our reserve and production profiles towards crude oil 
as of december   crude oil comprises of our total proved reserves and of our annual production 
although we do pursue natural gas opportunities  we continue to believe that crude oil valuations will be superior to natural gas valuations on a relative btu basis 
growth through low cost drilling 
substantially all of our annual capital expenditures are invested in drilling projects and acreage and seismic acquisitions 
from january  through december   proved oil and natural gas reserve additions through extensions and discoveries were mmboe compared to mmboe of proved reserve purchases 
internally generate prospects 
our technical staff has internally generated substantially all of the opportunities for the investment of our capital 
as an early entrant in new or emerging plays  we expect to acquire undeveloped acreage at a lower cost than those of later entrants into a developing play 
focus on unconventional oil and natural gas resource plays 
our experience with horizontal drilling  advanced fracture stimulation and enhanced recovery technologies allows us to commercially develop unconventional oil and natural gas resource plays  such as the red river b dolomite  bakken shale and arkoma woodford formations 
production rates in the red river units also have been increased through the use of enhanced recovery technology 
our production from the red river units  the bakken field  and the arkoma woodford comprised approximately  mboe  or of our total oil and natural gas production during the year ended december  acquire significant acreage positions in new or developing plays 
in addition to the  net undeveloped acres held in the montana and north dakota bakken shale and arkoma woodford fields  we held  net undeveloped acres in other oil and natural gas shale plays as of december  our technical staff is focused on identifying and testing new unconventional oil and natural gas resource plays where significant reserves could be developed if commercial production rates can be achieved through advanced drilling  fracture stimulation and enhanced recovery techniques 
our business strengths we have a number of strengths that we believe will help us successfully execute our strategies large acreage inventory 
we own  net undeveloped and  net developed acres as of december  approximately of the undeveloped acres are located within unconventional shale resource plays including the bakken shale in north dakota and montana  the woodford shale in southeast and western oklahoma  the atoka shale in western oklahoma and the texas panhandle  the new albany shale in indiana and kentucky and the lower huron  rhinestreet and marcellus shales in west virginia  pennsylvania  new york and ohio 
the balance of the undeveloped acreage is located primarily in conventional plays

horizontal drilling and enhanced recovery experience 
in  we drilled our initial horizontal well  and we have drilled over horizontal wells since that time 
we also have substantial experience with enhanced recovery methods and currently serve as the operator of waterflood units 
additionally  we operate eight high pressure air injection hpai floods 
control operations over a substantial portion of our assets and investments 
as of december   we operated properties comprising of our pv by controlling operations  we are able to more effectively manage the cost and timing of exploration and development of our properties  including the drilling and fracture stimulation methods used 
experienced management team 
our senior management team has extensive expertise in the oil and gas industry 
our chief executive officer  harold g 
hamm  began his career in the oil and gas industry in our seven senior officers have an average of years of oil and gas industry experience 
additionally  our technical staff  which includes petroleum engineers  geoscientists and landmen  has an average of years experience in the industry 
strong financial position 
as of february   we had outstanding borrowings under our revolving credit facility of approximately million and available borrowing capacity under our selected commitment level of million 
we have elected to set the commitment level at million  which is below the revolving credit facility note amount of million and the established borrowing base of million 
we believe that our planned exploration and development activities will be funded substantially from our operating cash flows and borrowings under our revolving credit facility 
our capital expenditures budget has been established based on our current expectation of available cash flow from operations 
should expected available cash flow from operations materially vary from expectations  we believe our credit facility has sufficient availability to fund any deficit or that we can further reduce our capital expenditures to be in line with cash flow from operations 
oil and gas operations proved reserves the following tables set forth our estimated proved oil and natural gas reserves  percent of total proved reserves that are proved developed  the pv and standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows as of december  by reserve category and region 
ryder scott company  lp  our independent petroleum engineers  evaluated properties representing approximately of our pv  and our technical staff evaluated the remaining properties 
the year end weighted average oil and natural gas prices used in the computation of future net cash flows at december  were per barrel and per mcf  respectively

as of february   we operated rigs on our properties 
our rig activity during will be highly dependent on oil and natural gas prices and accordingly our rig count may increase or decrease from current levels 
there can be no assurance  however  that additional rigs will be available to us at an attractive cost 
see risk factors the unavailability or high cost of additional drilling rigs  equipment  supplies  personnel and oilfield services could adversely affect our ability to execute our exploration and development plans within our budget and on a timely basis 
summary of oil and natural gas properties and projects throughout the following discussion  we discuss our budgeted number of wells and capital expenditures 
while the discussion reflects our current intentions  we intend to manage capital expenditures to be inline with our cash flow from operations 
continued weakness in oil and natural gas prices could cause us to curtail our actual capital expenditures 
conversely  an increase in commodity prices could result in increased capital expenditures 

table of contents rocky mountain region our properties in the rocky mountain region represented of our pv as of december  during the three months ended december   our average daily production from such properties was  net bbls of oil and  net mcf of natural gas 
our principal producing properties in this region are in the red river units  the bakken field and the big horn basin 
red river units our red river units represented of our pv in the rocky mountain region as of december  and of our average daily rocky mountain region boe production for the three months ended december  the eight units comprising the red river units are located along the cedar creek anticline in north dakota  south dakota and montana and produce oil and natural gas from the red river b formation  a thin  continuous  dolomite formation at depths of  to  feet 
our red river units comprise a portion of the cedar hills field  listed by the energy information administration in as the th largest onshore  lower field in the united states ranked by liquid proved reserves 
cedar hills units 
the cedar hills north unit chnu is located in bowman and slope counties  north dakota 
we drilled the initial horizontal well in the chnu  the ponderosa  in april as of december   we had drilled horizontal wells within this  acre unit  with producing wellbores and the remainder serving as injection wellbores 
we operate and own a working interest in the chnu 
the cedar hills west unit chwu  in fallon county  montana  is contiguous to the northern portion of chnu 
as of december   this  acre unit contained eleven horizontal producing wells and six horizontal injection wells 
we operate and own a working interest in the chwu 
in january  we commenced enhanced recovery in the two cedar hills units  with hpai used throughout most of the area and water injected generally along the boundary of the chnu 
under hpai  compressed air injected into a reservoir oxidizes residual oil and produces flue gases primarily carbon dioxide and nitrogen that mobilize and sweep the crude oil into producing wellbores 
in response to the hpai  water injection and increased density drilling operations  production from the cedar hills units increased to  net boe per day in december from  net boe per day in november as of december   the average density in the cedar hill units was approximately one producing wellbore per acres 
we currently plan to drill new horizontal wellbores and horizontal extensions of existing wellbores in the cedar hills units during  increasing the density of both the producing and injection wellbores 
the reduced distance between wells allows part of the field to be converted from air injection to water injection 
this conversion began in and is forecast to lower operating expenses  as water is less costly to inject than air 
in  we plan to invest approximately million drilling and improving facilities in the cedar hills units 
this expenditure is lower than previously forecast due to the elimination of gross wells from the increased density development program 
this adjustment to the plan is a result of reduced commodity prices 
the peak rate for the field will be reduced but we expect no reduction in ultimate reserves 
on august  the hiland partners  lp hiland badlands gas plant became operational for the processing and treatment of gas produced from the chnu  chwu and medicine pole hills unit 
under the terms of the november  contract we deliver low pressure gas to hiland for compression  treatment and processing 
nitrogen and carbon dioxide must be removed from the gas production associated with oil production from the units for the gas production to be marketable 
we pay per mcf in gathering and treating fees  and of the electrical costs attributable to compression and plant operation and receive of the proceeds from residue gas and plant product sales 
after we deliver bcf of gas  the per mcf gathering and treating fee is eliminated 
during december  we sold  net mcf of natural gas per day from the cedar hills units 
medicine pole hills units 
the medicine pole hills units mphu are approximately five miles east of the southern portion of the chnu 
we acquired the medicine pole hills unit in at that time  the  
table of contents acre unit consisted of vertical producing wellbores and four injection wellbores under hpai producing net bbls of oil per day 
we have since drilled horizontal wellbores extending production to the west with the formation of the  acre medicine pole hills west unit and to the south  with the  acre medicine pole hills south unit 
all three units are under hpai 
we operate and own an average working interest in the three units 
production from the units averaged  net bbls of oil and net mcf of natural gas per day during december during we drilled new horizontal wellbores  horizontal extensions of existing wellbores  and horizontal re entries of vertical wellbores  increasing the density of both producing and injection wellbores 
we believe these operations will increase production and sweep efficiency 
in  we plan to invest approximately million for capital workover and facilities in mphu 
buffalo red river units 
three contiguous buffalo red river units buffalo  west buffalo and south buffalo are located in harding county  south dakota  approximately miles south of the mphu 
when we purchased the units in  there were vertical producing wellbores and injection wellbores under hpai producing approximately  net bbls of oil per day 
we operate and own an average working interest of in the  acres comprising the three units 
from through  we re entered existing vertical wells and drilled horizontal laterals to increase production and sweep efficiency from the three units 
production for the month of december was  net bbls of oil per day compared to an average of  net bbls of oil per day for the first half of in  we plan to invest million for capital workover and facilities in the buffalo red river units 
bakken field we control one of the largest acreage positions in the bakken field of montana and north dakota with approximately  gross  net acres as of december  approximately of the net acreage is producing and of the net acreage is undeveloped as of december  our properties within the bakken field in montana and north dakota represented of our pv in the rocky mountain region as of december  and of our average daily rocky mountain region boe production for the three months ended december  as of december  we had completed gross net wells in the bakken field 
the bakken formation or bakken shale  as it is often called  is one of the most actively drilled unconventional oil resource plays in the united states with approximately rigs drilling in the play as of december   including in north dakota and seven in montana 
a report issued by the united states geologic survey usgs in april estimates that the bakken shale contains up to billion barrels of recoverable oil using today s technology and classifies it as the largest continuous oil accumulation ever assessed by the usgs 
the bakken formation is a devonian age shale found within the williston basin underlying portions of north dakota and montana that contains three lithologic members including the upper shale  middle member and lower shale that combined range up to feet thick 
the upper and lower shales are highly organic  thermally mature and over pressured and act as both a source and reservoir for the oil 
the middle member  which varies in composition from a silty dolomite to shalely limestone or sand  also serves as a reservoir and is thought to be a critical component for commercial production 
the three forks sanish formation found immediately under the lower bakken shale has also proven to contain productive reservoir rock that may add incremental reserves to the play 
the three forks sanish typically consists of interbedded dolomites and shale with local development of a discontinuous sandy member at the top  known as the sanish sand 
all of these reservoir rocks have low porosity and permeability and depend on natural fracturing and artificial fracture stimulation to produce economically 
horizontal drilling and multi stage fracture stimulation technology has enabled commercial production from this historically non commercial reservoir 
generally  the bakken formation is found at vertical depths of  to  feet and drilled horizontally on  or  acre spacing with single  dual or triple leg horizontal laterals extending  to  feet into the formation 
these wells are fracture stimulated to maximize recovery and economic returns 
the fracture stimulation techniques vary but most commonly utilize multi stage mechanically diverted stimulations using un cemented liners and packers 

table of contents montana bakken 
our montana bakken production is located in the elm coulee field in richland county  montana 
the elm coulee field is listed by the energy information administration as the th largest onshore  lower field in the united states ranked by liquid proved reserves 
since drilling our first well in august  we have completed a total of gross net wells in the field as of december  our daily average production from these wells was approximately  net bbls of oil and  net mcf of natural gas during the month of december the field has been developed exclusively with horizontal drilling and has been substantially drilled on acre spacing 
during  we began to further develop our acreage in the field on acre spacing and have identified undrilled acre infield locations on our acreage as of december  out of the gross net wells we drilled in the field during  gross net were acre infield wells 
these wells are performing in line with our expected reserve model of mboe per well 
in december we also began operations on a one well secondary recovery pilot project to evaluate the potential to increase oil recovery from the bakken reservoir utilizing co injection 
laboratory tests indicate this technique is feasible and could increase oil recovery from the bakken reservoir 
using a technique known as the huff and puff method  we began injecting co in january and expect to complete the injection phase by march after allowing the co to soak into the reservoir for approximately days  we will flow the co and associated fluids back from the well 
production from the well will be measured and the performance will be analyzed to assess the incremental recovery and economics of the technique 
as of december   we held  gross  net undeveloped acres in the montana bakken play within and adjacent to the elm coulee field 
we have recently suspended drilling in the montana bakken due to weakness in oil and natural gas prices and will resume drilling as prices improve 
north dakota bakken 
our drilling program significantly expanded the proven extents of our north dakota bakken acreage along the nesson anticline 
during the year we completed gross net wells and exited producing at an average daily rate of  net bbls of oil during the month of december   a increase over the same period in and  net mcf of natural gas during the month of december  an increase of over the same period in during the year we drilled almost exclusively  acre spaced  long single leg laterals  up to  feet long and fracture stimulated these wells with up to mechanically diverted stages using un cemented liners and packers 
we found this technique provided better wellbore integrity and on average delivered higher initial flow rates 
of significance  we completed gross net three forks sanish wells during the three forks sanish formation which lies immediately below the lower bakken shale is known to be productive locally throughout the williston basin and may add incremental reserves to the bakken play 
our three forks sanish completions were strategically located throughout our acreage along the nesson anticline over a distance of approximately miles north to south 
the success of these three forks sanish wells demonstrates the widespread productive potential of the three forks sanish reservoir underlying our acreage 
although the results in themselves do not demonstrate the three forks sanish formation adds incremental reserves to the bakken play  it is notable that the gross net three forks sanish completions we operated in had an average initial production rate of gross boe per day which is higher than our average operated middle bakken completion in as of december   we held  gross  net undeveloped acres in the north dakota bakken field 
as of february   we had rigs drilling in the north dakota bakken field  including operated by continental resources  inc  and operated by conocophillips through a joint venture 
we plan to invest million drilling gross net wells in the north dakota bakken field during 
table of contents big horn basin and other rockies our wells within the big horn basin in northern wyoming and other areas within the rocky mountain region represented of our pv in the rocky mountain region as of december  and of our average daily rocky mountain region boe production for the three months ended december  during the three months ended december   we produced an average of  net bbls of oil and  net mcf of natural gas per day from our wells in the big horn basin and other areas within the rocky mountain region 
our principal property in the big horn basin  the worland field  produces primarily from the phosphoria formation 
we also have several other ongoing projects in the rockies including conventional d defined red river and lodgepole structures in north dakota and montana  horizontal fryburg opportunities in north dakota and the lewis shale and fort union in wyoming 
conventional red river 
the red river is a well known conventional producing oil and gas reservoir throughout the williston basin of north dakota and montana 
the production can be quite prolific with individual red river wells producing up to million barrels of oil but the productive reservoir is generally confined to structural closures and structural stratigraphic traps of acres to acres in size 
the potential exists to find this type of conventional red river production underlying any portion of our bakken acreage in north dakota and montana 
to identify these red river traps generally requires d seismic 
we own or have under license square miles of d seismic over portions of our acreage in montana and north dakota 
as of december  we had interpreted approximately of this data using our proprietary processing techniques and have identified undrilled potential locations 
in  we drilled and completed gross net vertical red river wells with gross net wells completed as producers for a success rate 
during  we plan to continue re processing and evaluating our d seismic to identify new potential drilling locations 
mid continent and gulf coast region our properties in the mid continent and gulf coast region represented of our pv as of december  during the three months ended december   our average daily production from such properties was  net bbls of oil and  net mcf of natural gas 
our principal producing properties in this region are located in the anadarko and arkoma basins of oklahoma  the michigan basin and the illinois basin 
arkoma woodford the arkoma woodford play in atoka  coal  hughes and pittsburg counties  oklahoma has matured into one of the more active unconventional gas resource plays in the united states with rigs drilling in the play industry wide as of december  we owned approximately  gross  net acres in the woodford play as of december  since drilling our first well in february   we have completed a total of gross net horizontal woodford wells through december  these arkoma woodford wells represent of the pv in the mid continent region as of december  and of our average daily mid continent region equivalent production for the three months ended december  during  production from our arkoma woodford wells grew from an average of  mcf of natural gas equivalent per day during december to  mcf of natural gas equivalent per day in december we completed gross net woodford wells during this drilling consisted of a combination of exploratory  step out and development drilling designed to secure acreage and delineate areas of economic production for further development 
of significance  we expanded the known extents of commercial production to the western extents of our ashland ami and south into our big mac prospect 
we also completed our first well in the east mcalester area 
as of december   approximately of our net acreage remained undeveloped 

table of contents during the year ended december   we began to develop the field on various densities including  and acre spacing  to determine the optimum spacing for development 
results indicated that acre development is economically feasible on much of our acreage 
we also began simul fracing wells when possible to more effectively stimulate and produce the woodford shale while causing minimal disruption to existing production 
we also reduced our average cost per lateral foot drilled by compared to through improved mud systems  bit selections and operational efficiencies 
we also successfully demonstrated that we can drill and complete wells across faults that previously limited the length of lateral drilled 
to guide our drilling we acquired square miles of d seismic data during the year bringing the total of d seismic we own or have under license to square miles 
we plan to invest approximately million drilling gross net horizontal wells in the arkoma woodford during we currently have one operated rig drilling in the play and are in the process of acquiring square miles of d seismic to guide future drilling on our east mcalester acreage 
anadarko basin our properties within the anadarko basin represented of our pv in the mid continent region as of december  and of our average daily mid continent region equivalent production for the three months ended december  our wells within the anadarko basin produce from a variety of sands and carbonates in both stratigraphic and structural traps 
during the year we drilled gross net wells with a gross net success rate 
in  we plan to invest approximately million in the drilling of gross net wells in the anadarko basin 
anadarko woodford 
we owned  gross  net acres in the emerging anadarko woodford shale play of western oklahoma as of december  this includes  gross  net undeveloped acres acquired in and  gross  net acres held by production 
our acreage is strategically positioned within the window of thermal maturation for natural gas along the eastern flank of the anadarko basin extending across portions of grady  canadian  blaine  custer and dewey counties of oklahoma 
the woodford shale underlying this acreage ranges from to feet thick and occurs at depth ranging from  to  feet 
industry peers began drilling and completing horizontal woodford shale wells in canadian county  oklahoma in august of and as of december  there were rigs drilling in the play 
results announced by various operators in the play have been encouraging  with initial daily production rates of up to  mcf of natural gas equivalent per well 
based on our economic model  we expect to recover approximately bcf to bcf per well 
during we drilled gross net horizontal woodford wells and both are currently in the process of being completed 
anadarko atoka 
we owned  gross  net acres in the emerging anadarko atoka shale play of western oklahoma and the panhandle of texas as of december  our acreage is focused in ellis county  oklahoma and lipscomb county  texas and strategically located along trend with the development of the novi lime formation 
the novi lime formation is important as it serves as both reservoir and drilling conduit for the horizontal wellbore through which the surrounding natural gas charged atoka shales can be fracture stimulated and produced 
the atoka shales range from feet to feet thick and are present throughout our properties 
public records show as of february   horizontal atoka wells have been completed by industry peers with initial production rates of up to  mcf of natural gas per day 
during  we drilled gross net horizontal atoka wells 
the first well  the shrewder h wi completed flowing  mcf of natural gas per day from a short   foot  horizontal lateral 
the second well  the jones trust h wi was recently fracture stimulated and currently flow testing at a rate of approximately mcf of natural gas per day 

table of contents illinois basin our properties within the illinois basin represented of the pv in the mid continent region as of december  and of our average daily mid continent region boe production for the three months ended december  we drilled gross net wells during developing fields and expanding our reserve base in the illinois basin 
our production within the illinois basin is primarily crude oil from units comprised of shallow sand formations under water injection 
michigan trenton black river our trenton black river project in and around hillsdale county  michigan continues to produce excellent results guided by our proprietary d seismic techniques 
as of december   we had completed gross net operated wells in the play with gross net of the wells completed as trenton black river producers and gross net well temporarily abandoned 
these producing wells were assigned average estimated recoverable reserves of mboe per well 
combined  these wells were producing an average of gross barrels of oil per day during the month of december  three of the wells are capable of flowing in excess of the barrels of oil per day allowable set by the michigan department of environmental quality and are restricted by natural gas flaring restrictions which will be removed once the wells are connected to a natural gas pipeline 
a natural gas gathering pipeline has been installed and processing facilities are under construction to enable these flare restricted wells to produce up to the barrels of oil per day allowable rate 
we owned approximately  gross  net acres in the play and have shot  processed and interpreted approximately square mile of d seismic on the acreage as of december  during  we completed the acquisition of square miles of d seismic on our chicago norad project 
interpretation of the seismic data identified up to potential drilling locations 
four of these locations have been selected and permitted for drilling 
we plan to acquire another square miles of additional d seismic data during gulf coast during the three months ended december   our average daily production from our gulf coast properties was net bbls of oil and  net mcf of natural gas 
our principal producing properties in this region are located in south texas and louisiana

as of december   we owned interests in no wells containing multiple completions 

table of contents title to properties as is customary in the oil and gas industry  we initially conduct only a cursory review of the title to our properties on which we do not have proved reserves 
prior to the commencement of drilling operations on those properties  we endeavor to conduct a thorough title examination and perform curative work with respect to significant defects 
to the extent title opinions or other investigations reflect title defects on those properties  we are typically responsible for curing any title defects at our expense 
we generally will not commence drilling operations on a property until we have cured any material title defects on such property 
we have obtained title opinions on substantially all of our producing properties and believe that we have satisfactory title to our producing properties in accordance with standards generally accepted in the oil and gas industry 
prior to completing an acquisition of producing oil and natural gas leases  we perform title reviews on the most significant leases and  depending on the materiality of properties  we may obtain a title opinion or review previously obtained title opinions 
our oil and natural gas properties are subject to customary royalty and other interests  liens to secure borrowings under our revolving credit facility  liens for current taxes and other burdens which we believe do not materially interfere with the use or affect our carrying value of the properties 
marketing and major customers we primarily sell our oil production to end users at major market centers 
other production is sold to select midstream marketing companies or oil refining companies at the lease 
we have significant production directly connected to a pipeline gathering system  although the balance of our production is transported by truck 
where the oil that is directly marketed is transported by truck  the oil is delivered to the most practical point on a pipeline system for delivery to a sales point downstream on another connecting pipeline 
oil that is sold at the lease is delivered directly onto the purchasers truck and the sale is complete at that point 
during the fourth quarter of and various periods in  we were unable to market some of our rocky mountain area crude at a price acceptable to us 
this resulted in increases in our crude oil inventory at various times throughout the year 
the prices we were offered were adversely affected by seasonal demand and by pipeline constraints 
at various times during and  we shipped some of our rocky mountain crude by railcar to help alleviate this situation and obtain more favorable prices 
our marketing of oil and natural gas can be affected by factors beyond our control  the effects of which cannot be accurately predicted 
for a description of some of these factors  see risk factors market conditions or operational impediments may hinder our access to oil and natural gas markets or delay our production 
for the year ended december   oil sales to marathon oil company accounted for of our total revenue 
no other purchasers accounted for more than of our total oil and gas sales 
we believe that the loss of any of these purchasers would not have a material adverse effect on our operations  as there are a number of alternative crude oil purchasers in our producing regions 
competition we operate in a highly competitive environment for acquiring properties  marketing oil and natural gas and securing trained personnel 
our competitors vary within the regions in which we operate  and some of our competitors may possess and employ financial  technical and personnel resources substantially greater than ours  which can be particularly important in the areas in which we operate 
those companies may be able to pay more for productive oil and natural gas properties and exploratory prospects and to evaluate  bid for and purchase a greater number of properties and prospects than our financial or personnel resources permit 
in addition  shortages or the high cost of drilling rigs could delay or adversely affect our development and exploration operations 
our ability to acquire additional prospects and to find and develop reserves in the future will depend on our ability to evaluate and select suitable properties and to consummate transactions in a highly competitive environment 
also  there is substantial competition for capital available for investment in the oil and natural gas industry 

table of contents regulation of the oil and natural gas industry regulation of transportation of oil sales of crude oil  condensate and natural gas liquids are not currently regulated and are made at negotiated prices 
nevertheless  congress could reenact price controls in the future 
our sales of crude oil are affected by the availability  terms and cost of transportation 
the transportation of oil in common carrier pipelines is also subject to rate and access regulation 
the federal energy regulatory commission  or the ferc  regulates interstate oil pipeline transportation rates under the interstate commerce act 
in general  interstate oil pipeline rates must be cost based  although settlement rates agreed to by all shippers are permitted and market based rates may be permitted in certain circumstances 
effective january   the ferc implemented regulations establishing an indexing system based on inflation for transportation rates for oil that allowed for an increase or decrease in the cost of transporting oil to the purchaser 
intrastate oil pipeline transportation rates are subject to regulation by state regulatory commissions 
the basis for intrastate oil pipeline regulation  and the degree of regulatory oversight and scrutiny given to intrastate oil pipeline rates  varies from state to state 
insofar as effective interstate and intrastate rates are equally applicable to all comparable shippers  we believe that the regulation of oil transportation rates will not affect our operations in any way that is of material difference from those of our competitors who are similarly situated 
further  interstate and intrastate common carrier oil pipelines must provide service on a non discriminatory basis 
under this open access standard  common carriers must offer service to all similarly situated shippers requesting service on the same terms and under the same rates 
when oil pipelines operate at full capacity  access is governed by prorating provisions set forth in the pipelines published tariffs 
accordingly  we believe that access to oil pipeline transportation services generally will be available to us to the same extent as to our similarly situated competitors 
regulation of transportation and sales of natural gas historically  the transportation and sale for resale of natural gas in interstate commerce have been regulated by agencies of the us federal government  primarily the ferc 
in the past  the federal government has regulated the prices at which natural gas could be sold 
while sales by producers of natural gas can currently be made at uncontrolled market prices  congress could reenact price controls in the future 
deregulation of wellhead natural gas sales began with the enactment of the natural gas policy act and culminated in adoption of the natural gas wellhead decontrol act which removed controls affecting wellhead sales of natural gas effective january  ferc regulates interstate natural gas transportation rates and service conditions  which affects the marketing of natural gas that we produce  as well as the revenues we receive for sales of our natural gas 
since  the ferc has endeavored to make natural gas transportation more accessible to natural gas buyers and sellers on an open and non discriminatory basis 
the ferc has stated that open access policies are necessary to improve the competitive structure of the interstate natural gas pipeline industry and to create a regulatory framework that will put natural gas sellers into more direct contractual relations with natural gas buyers by  among other things  unbundling the sale of natural gas from the sale of transportation and storage services 
beginning in  the ferc issued a series of orders to implement its open access policies 
as a result  the interstate pipelines traditional role as wholesalers of natural gas has been eliminated and replaced by a structure under which pipelines provide transportation and storage service on an open access basis to others who buy and sell natural gas 
although the ferc s orders do not directly regulate natural gas producers  they are intended to foster increased competition within all phases of the natural gas industry 
we cannot accurately predict whether the ferc s actions will achieve the goal of increasing competition in markets in which our natural gas is sold 
additional proposals and proceedings that might affect the natural gas industry are pending before the ferc and the courts 
the natural gas industry historically has been very heavily 
table of contents regulated 
therefore  we cannot provide any assurance that the less stringent regulatory approach recently established by the ferc will continue 
however  we do not believe that any action taken will affect us in a way that materially differs from the way it affects other natural gas producers 
the price at which we sell natural gas is not currently subject to federal rate regulation and  for the most part  is not subject to state regulation 
however  with regard to our physical sales of these energy commodities  we are required to observe anti market manipulation laws and related regulations enforced by the ferc and or the commodity futures trading commission cftc 
see below the discussion of other federal laws and regulations affecting our industry energy policy act of should we violate the anti market manipulation laws and regulations  we could also be subject to related third party damage claims by  among others  sellers  royalty owners and taxing authorities 
in addition  pursuant to order  some of our operations may be required to annually report to ferc  starting may   information regarding natural gas sale transactions depending on the volume of natural gas transacted during the prior calendar year 
see below the discussion of other federal laws and regulations affecting our industry ferc market transparency rules 
gathering service  which occurs upstream of jurisdictional transmission services  is regulated by the states onshore and in state waters 
although its policy is still in flux  ferc has reclassified certain jurisdictional transmission facilities as non jurisdictional gathering facilities  which has the tendency to increase our costs of getting gas to point of sale locations 
state regulation of natural gas gathering facilities generally include various safety  environmental and  in some circumstances  nondiscriminatory take requirements 
although such regulation has not generally been affirmatively applied by state agencies  natural gas gathering may receive greater regulatory scrutiny in the future 
intrastate natural gas transportation is also subject to regulation by state regulatory agencies 
the basis for intrastate regulation of natural gas transportation and the degree of regulatory oversight and scrutiny given to intrastate natural gas pipeline rates and services varies from state to state 
insofar as such regulation within a particular state will generally affect all intrastate natural gas shippers within the state on a comparable basis  we believe that the regulation of similarly situated intrastate natural gas transportation in any states in which we operate and ship natural gas on an intrastate basis will not affect our operations in any way that is of material difference from those of our competitors 
like the regulation of interstate transportation rates  the regulation of intrastate transportation rates affects the marketing of natural gas that we produce  as well as the revenues we receive for sales of our natural gas 
regulation of production the production of oil and natural gas is subject to regulation under a wide range of local  state and federal statutes  rules  orders and regulations 
federal  state and local statutes and regulations require permits for drilling operations  drilling bonds and reports concerning operations 
all of the states in which we own and operate properties have regulations governing conservation matters  including provisions for the unitization or pooling of oil and natural gas properties  the establishment of maximum allowable rates of production from oil and natural gas wells  the regulation of well spacing  and plugging and abandonment of wells 
the effect of these regulations is to limit the amount of oil and natural gas that we can produce from our wells and to limit the number of wells or the locations at which we can drill  although we can apply for exceptions to such regulations or to have reductions in well spacing 
moreover  each state generally imposes a production or severance tax with respect to the production and sale of oil  natural gas and natural gas liquids within its jurisdiction 
the failure to comply with these rules and regulations can result in substantial penalties 
our competitors in the oil and natural gas industry are subject to the same regulatory requirements and restrictions that affect our operations 

table of contents other federal laws and regulations affecting our industry energy policy act of on august   president bush signed into law the domenici barton energy policy act of ep act 
the ep act is a comprehensive compilation of tax incentives  authorized appropriations for grants and guaranteed loans  and significant changes to the statutory policy that affects all segments of the energy industry 
among other matters  ep act amends the nga to add an anti market manipulation provision which makes it unlawful for any entity to engage in prohibited behavior to be prescribed by ferc  and furthermore provides ferc with additional civil penalty authority 
the ep act provides the ferc with the power to assess civil penalties of up to  per day for violations of the nga and increases the ferc s civil penalty authority under the ngpa from  per violation per day to  per violation per day 
the civil penalty provisions are applicable to entities that engage in the sale of natural gas for resale in interstate commerce 
on january   ferc issued order no 
 a rule implementing the anti market manipulation provision of ep act  and subsequently denied rehearing 
the rules make it unlawful to in connection with the purchase or sale of natural gas subject to the jurisdiction of ferc  or the purchase or sale of transportation services subject to the jurisdiction of ferc  for any entity  directly or indirectly  to use or employ any device  scheme or artifice to defraud  to make any untrue statement of material fact or omit to make any such statement necessary to make the statements made not misleading  or to engage in any act or practice that operates as a fraud or deceit upon any person 
the new anti market manipulation rule does not apply to activities that relate only to intrastate or other non jurisdictional sales or gathering  but does apply to activities of gas pipelines and storage companies that provide interstate services  as well as otherwise non jurisdictional entities to the extent the activities are conducted in connection with gas sales  purchases or transportation subject to ferc jurisdiction  which now includes the annual reporting requirements under order the anti market manipulation rule and enhanced civil penalty authority reflect an expansion of ferc s nga enforcement authority 
ferc market transparency rules 
on december   ferc issued a final rule on the annual natural gas transaction reporting requirements  as amended by subsequent orders on rehearing order 
under order  wholesale buyers and sellers of more than million mmbtu of physical natural gas in the previous calendar year  including interstate and intrastate natural gas pipelines  natural gas gatherers  natural gas processors  natural gas marketers  and natural gas producers  are now required to report  on may of each year beginning in  aggregate volumes of natural gas purchased or sold at wholesale in the prior calendar year to the extent such transactions utilize  contribute to  or may contribute to the formation of price indices 
it is the responsibility of the reporting entity to determine which individual transactions should be reported based on the guidance of order order also requires market participants to indicate whether they report prices to any index publishers  and if so  whether their reporting complies with ferc s policy statement on price reporting 
additional proposals and proceedings that might affect the natural gas industry are pending before congress  ferc and the courts 
we cannot predict the ultimate impact of these or the above regulatory changes to our natural gas operations 
we do not believe that we would be affected by any such ferc action materially differently than similarly situated competitors 
environmental  health and safety regulation general 
our operations are subject to stringent and complex federal  state  local and provincial laws and regulations governing environmental protection  health and safety  including the discharge of materials into the environment 
these laws and regulations may  among other things require the acquisition of various permits before drilling commences  restrict the types  quantities and concentration of various substances that can be released into the environment in connection with oil and natural gas drilling  production and transportation activities  limit or prohibit drilling activities on certain lands lying within wilderness  wetlands and other protected areas including areas containing endangered specie of plants and animals  and 
table of contents require remedial measures to mitigate pollution from former and ongoing operations  such as requirements to close pits and plug abandoned wells 
these laws and regulations may also restrict the rate of oil and natural gas production below the rate that would otherwise be possible 
the regulatory burden on the oil and gas industry increases the cost of doing business in the industry and consequently affects profitability 
additionally  congress and federal and state agencies frequently revise environmental  health and safety laws and regulations  and any changes that result in more stringent and costly waste handling  disposal  cleanup and remediation requirements for the oil and gas industry could have a significant impact on our operating costs 
some of the existing environmental  health and safety laws and regulations to which our business operations are subject include  among others  i regulations by the epa and various state agencies regarding approved methods of disposal for certain hazardous and nonhazardous wastes  ii the comprehensive environmental response  compensation  and liability act and analogous state laws that may require the removal of previously disposed wastes including wastes disposed of or released by prior owners or operators  property contamination including groundwater contamination  and remedial plugging operations to prevent future contamination  iii the clean air act and comparable state and local requirements  which establish pollution control requirements with respect to air emissions from our operations  iv the oil pollution act of  which contains numerous requirements relating to the prevention of and response to oil spills into waters of the united states  v the federal water pollution control act  or the clean water act  and analogous state laws which impose restrictions and strict controls with respect to the discharge of pollutants  including oil and other substances generated by our operations  into waters of the united states or state waters  vi the resource conservation and recovery act  which is the principal federal statute governing the treatment  storage and disposal of hazardous wastes and comparable state law pertaining to the handling of solid and hazardous wastes  vii the safe drinking water act and analogous state laws which impose requirements relating to our underground injection activities  viii the national environmental policy act  which requires federal agencies  including the department of interior  to evaluate major agency actions that have the potential to significantly impact the environment  ix the federal occupational safety and health act and comparable state statutes which require that we organize and or disclose information about hazardous materials stored  used or produced in our operations and  x state regulations and statutes governing the handling  treatment  storage and disposal of naturally occurring radioactive material 
we have incurred in the past  and expect to incur in the future  capital and other expenditures related to environmental compliance 
such expenditures  however  are included within our overall capital and operating budgets and are not separately itemized 
although we believe that our continued compliance with existing requirements will not have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations  we cannot assure you that the passage of more stringent laws or regulations in the future will not have a negative impact on our financial position or results of operations 
employees as of december   we employed people  including employees in drilling and production  in financial and accounting  in land  in exploration  in reservoir engineering  in administrative and in information technology 
our future success will depend partially on our ability to attract  retain and motivate qualified personnel 
we are not a party to any collective bargaining agreements and have not experienced any strikes or work stoppages

risk factors you should carefully consider each of the risks described below  together with all of the other information contained in this report  before deciding to invest in shares of our common stock 
if any of the following risks develop into actual events  our business  financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected  the trading price of your shares could decline and you may lose all or part of your investment 
risks relating to the oil and natural gas industry and our business a substantial or extended decline in oil and natural gas prices may adversely affect our business  financial condition or results of operations and our ability to meet our capital expenditure obligations and financial commitments 
the price we receive for our oil and natural gas production heavily influences our revenue  profitability  access to capital and future rate of growth 
oil and natural gas are commodities and  therefore  their prices are subject to wide fluctuations in response to relatively minor changes in supply and demand 
historically  the markets for oil and natural gas have been volatile 
these markets will likely continue to be volatile in the future 
the prices we receive for our production  and the levels of our production  depend on numerous factors beyond our control 
these factors include the following worldwide and regional economic conditions impacting the global supply and demand for oil and natural gas  the actions of the organization of petroleum exporting countries  or opec  the price and quantity of imports of foreign oil and natural gas  political conditions in or affecting other oil producing and natural gas producing countries  including the current conflicts in the middle east and conditions in south america and russia  the level of global oil and natural gas exploration and production  the level of global oil and natural gas inventories  localized supply and demand fundamentals and transportation availability  weather conditions  technological advances affecting energy consumption  and the price and availability of alternative fuels 
furthermore  the current worldwide financial and credit crisis has reduced the availability of liquidity and credit to fund the continuation and expansion of industrial business operations worldwide 
the shortage of liquidity and credit combined with recent substantial losses in worldwide equity markets has lead to a worldwide economic recession 
the slowdown in economic activity caused by such recession has reduced worldwide demand for energy and resulted in lower oil and natural gas prices 
oil prices declined from record high levels in early july of over per bbl to below per bbl in february  while natural gas prices declined from over per mcf to approximately per mcf over the same period 
lower oil and natural gas prices will reduce our cash flows and borrowing ability 
for example  although our average realized price received for oil and natural gas was per boe for the year ended december   it was bolstered by record oil prices for the first half of the year 
in the fourth quarter of  our average realized price received for oil and natural gas declined to per boe 
see our exploration  development and exploitation projects require substantial capital expenditures 
we may be unable to obtain needed capital or financing on satisfactory terms  which could lead to a decline in our oil and natural gas reserves 
lower oil and natural gas prices may also reduce the amount of oil and natural gas that we can produce economically 

table of contents substantial decreases in oil and natural gas prices would render uneconomic a significant portion of our exploration  development and exploitation projects 
this may result in our having to make significant downward adjustments to our estimated proved reserves 
as a result  a substantial or extended decline in oil or natural gas prices may materially and adversely affect our future business  financial condition  results of operations  liquidity or ability to finance planned capital expenditures 
in addition  because our producing properties are geographically concentrated in the rocky mountain region  we are vulnerable to fluctuations in pricing in that area 
in particular  of our production during the fourth quarter of was from the rocky mountain region 
as a result of this concentration  we may be disproportionately exposed to the impact of regional supply and demand factors  transportation capacity constraints  curtailment of production or interruption of transportation of oil produced from the wells in these areas 
such factors can cause significant fluctuation in our realized oil and natural gas prices 
for example  the difference between the average nymex oil price and our average realized oil price for the year ended december  was per bbl  whereas the difference between the nymex oil price and our realized oil price for the year ended december  was per bbl 
our exploration  development and exploitation projects require substantial capital expenditures 
we may be unable to obtain needed capital or financing on satisfactory terms  which could lead to a decline in our oil and natural gas reserves 
the oil and natural gas industry is capital intensive 
we make and expect to continue to make substantial capital expenditures in our business for the development  exploitation  production and acquisition of oil and natural gas reserves 
our cash flow used in investing activities was million related to capital and exploration expenditures in our budgeted capital expenditures for are expected to be approximately million with million allocated for drilling and completion operations 
to date  these capital expenditures have been financed with cash generated by operations and through borrowings under our revolving credit facility 
the actual amount and timing of our future capital expenditures may differ materially from our estimates as a result of  among other things  commodity prices  actual drilling results  the availability of drilling rigs and other services and equipment  and regulatory  technological and competitive developments 
we expect to manage capital expenditures for to be inline with our cash flows from operations  and expect our capital expenditures during to be significantly lower than our capital expenditures due to our desire to cut back on spending due to the current economic crisis and steep drop in oil and natural gas prices 
continued weakness in commodity prices may result in a decrease in our actual capital expenditures 
conversely  a significant improvement in product prices could result in an increase in our capital expenditures 
we intend to finance our future capital expenditures primarily through cash flow from operations and through borrowings under our revolving credit facility  however  our financing needs may require us to alter or increase our capitalization substantially through the issuance of debt or equity securities or the sale of assets 
the issuance of additional debt may require that a portion of our cash flow from operations be used for the payment of interest and principal on our debt  thereby reducing our ability to use cash flow to fund working capital  capital expenditures and acquisitions 
the issuance of additional equity securities could have a dilutive effect on the value of your common stock 
our cash flow from operations and access to capital are subject to a number of variables  including our proved reserves  the level of oil and natural gas we are able to produce from existing wells  the prices at which our oil and natural gas are sold  our ability to acquire  locate and produce new reserves  and the ability of our banks to lend 
if our revenues or the borrowing base under our revolving credit facility decrease as a result of lower oil or natural gas prices  operating difficulties  declines in reserves or for any other reason  we may have limited ability 
table of contents to obtain the capital necessary to sustain our operations at current levels 
if additional capital is needed  we may not be able to obtain debt or equity financing 
if cash generated by operations or cash available under our revolving credit facility is not sufficient to meet our capital requirements  the failure to obtain additional financing could result in a curtailment of our operations relating to development of our prospects  which in turn could lead to a decline in our oil and natural gas reserves  and could adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
drilling for and producing oil and natural gas are high risk activities with many uncertainties that could adversely affect our business  financial condition or results of operations 
our future financial condition and results of operations will depend on the success of our exploitation  exploration  development and production activities 
our oil and natural gas exploration and production activities are subject to numerous risks beyond our control  including the risk that drilling will not result in commercially viable oil or natural gas production 
our decisions to purchase  explore  develop or otherwise exploit prospects or properties will depend in part on the evaluation of data obtained through geophysical and geological analyses  production data and engineering studies  the results of which are often inconclusive or subject to varying interpretations 
for a discussion of the uncertainty involved in these processes  see reserve estimates depend on many assumptions that may turn out to be inaccurate 
any material inaccuracies in these reserve estimates or underlying assumptions will materially affect the quantities and present value of our reserves 
our cost of drilling  completing and operating wells is often uncertain before drilling commences 
further  many factors may curtail  delay or cancel our scheduled drilling projects  including the following delays imposed by or resulting from compliance with regulatory requirements  pressure or irregularities in geological formations  shortages of or delays in obtaining equipment and qualified personnel  equipment failures or accidents  adverse weather conditions  such as blizzards and ice storms  reductions in oil and natural gas prices  limited availability of financing at acceptable rates  title problems  and limitations in the market for oil and natural gas 
reserve estimates depend on many assumptions that may turn out to be inaccurate 
any material inaccuracies in these reserve estimates or underlying assumptions will materially affect the quantities and present value of our reserves 
the process of estimating oil and natural gas reserves is complex 
it requires interpretations of available technical data and many assumptions  including assumptions relating to current and future economic conditions and commodity prices 
any significant inaccuracies in these interpretations or assumptions could materially affect our estimated quantities and present value of our reserves 
see item business proved reserves for information about our estimated oil and natural gas reserves and the pv and standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows as of december  in order to prepare our estimates  we must project production rates and timing of development expenditures 
we must also analyze available geological  geophysical  production and engineering data 
the extent  quality and reliability of this data can vary 
the process also requires economic assumptions about matters such as oil and natural gas prices  drilling and operating expenses  capital expenditures  taxes and availability of funds 
actual future production  oil and natural gas prices  revenues  taxes  development expenditures  operating expenses and quantities of recoverable oil and natural gas reserves will vary from our estimates 
any significant 
table of contents variance could materially affect the estimated quantities and present value of our reserves 
in addition  we may adjust estimates of proved reserves to reflect production history  results of exploration and development  prevailing oil and natural gas prices and other factors  many of which are beyond our control 
you should not assume that the present value of future net revenues from our proved reserves is the current market value of our estimated oil and natural gas reserves 
in accordance with sec requirements  we generally base the estimated discounted future net cash flows from our proved reserves on prices and costs on the date of the estimate 
actual future prices and costs may differ materially from those used in the present value estimate 
if oil prices decline by per bbl  then our pv as of december  would decrease approximately million 
if natural gas prices decline by per mcf  then our pv as of december  would decrease approximately million 
our use of enhanced recovery methods creates uncertainties that could adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 
one of our business strategies is to commercially develop unconventional oil and natural gas resource plays using enhanced recovery technologies 
for example  we inject water and high pressure air into formations on some of our properties to increase the production of oil and natural gas 
the additional production and reserves attributable to the use of these enhanced recovery methods are inherently difficult to predict 
if our enhanced recovery programs do not allow for the extraction of oil and natural gas in the manner or to the extent that we anticipate  our future results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected 
if oil and natural gas prices decrease  we may be required to take write downs of the carrying values of our oil and natural gas properties 
accounting rules require that we periodically review the carrying value of our oil and natural gas properties for possible impairment 
based on specific market factors and circumstances at the time of prospective impairment reviews  and the continuing evaluation of development plans  production data  economics and other factors  we may be required to write down the carrying value of our oil and natural gas properties 
a write down constitutes a non cash charge to earnings 
we may incur impairment charges in the future  which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations for the periods in which such charges are taken 
unless we replace our oil and natural gas reserves  our reserves and production will decline  which would adversely affect our cash flows and results of operations 
unless we conduct successful development  exploitation and exploration activities or acquire properties containing proved reserves  our proved reserves will decline as those reserves are produced 
producing oil and natural gas reservoirs generally are characterized by declining production rates that vary depending upon reservoir characteristics and other factors 
our future oil and natural gas reserves and production  and therefore our cash flow and results of operations  are highly dependent on our success in efficiently developing and exploiting our current reserves and economically finding or acquiring additional recoverable reserves 
we may not be able to develop  exploit  find or acquire sufficient additional reserves to replace our current and future production 
if we are unable to replace our current and future production  the value of our reserves will decrease  and our business  financial condition and results of operations would be adversely affected 
the unavailability or high cost of additional drilling rigs  equipment  supplies  personnel and oilfield services could adversely affect our ability to execute our exploration and development plans within our budget and on a timely basis 
shortages or the high cost of drilling rigs  equipment  supplies  personnel or oilfield services could delay or cause us to incur significant expenditures that are not provided for in our capital budget  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations 

table of contents we may incur substantial losses and be subject to substantial liability claims as a result of our oil and natural gas operations 
additionally we may not be insured for  or our insurance may be inadequate to protect us against  these risks 
we are not insured against all risks 
losses and liabilities arising from uninsured and underinsured events could materially and adversely affect our business  financial condition or results of operations 
our oil and natural gas exploration and production activities are subject to all of the operating risks associated with drilling for and producing oil and natural gas  including the possibility of environmental hazards  such as uncontrollable flows of oil  natural gas  brine  well fluids  toxic gas or other pollution into the environment  including groundwater and shoreline contamination  abnormally pressured formations  mechanical difficulties  such as stuck oilfield drilling and service tools and casing collapse  fires  explosions and ruptures of pipelines in connection with our high pressure air injection operations  personal injuries and death  and natural disasters 
any of these risks could adversely affect our ability to conduct operations or result in substantial losses to us as a result of injury or loss of life  damage to and destruction of property  natural resources and equipment  pollution and other environmental damage  regulatory investigations and penalties  suspension of our operations  and repair and remediation costs 
we may elect not to obtain insurance if we believe that the cost of available insurance is excessive relative to the risks presented 
in addition  pollution and environmental risks generally are not fully insurable 
the occurrence of an event that is not fully covered by insurance could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
prospects that we decide to drill may not yield oil or natural gas in commercially viable quantities 
prospects that we decide to drill that do not yield oil or natural gas in commercially viable quantities will adversely affect our results of operations and financial condition 
in this report  we describe some of our current prospects and our plans to explore those prospects 
our prospects are in various stages of evaluation  ranging from a prospect which is ready to drill to a prospect that will require substantial additional seismic data processing and interpretation 
there is no way to predict in advance of drilling and testing whether any particular prospect will yield oil or natural gas in sufficient quantities to recover drilling or completion costs or to be economically viable 
the use of seismic data and other technologies and the study of producing fields in the same area will not enable us to know conclusively prior to drilling whether oil or natural gas will be present or  if present  whether oil or natural gas will be present in commercial quantities 
we cannot assure you that the analogies we draw from available data from other wells  more fully explored prospects or producing fields will be applicable to our drilling prospects 

table of contents our identified drilling locations are scheduled out over several years  making them susceptible to uncertainties that could materially alter the occurrence or timing of their drilling 
our management has specifically identified and scheduled drilling locations as an estimation of our future multi year drilling activities on our existing acreage 
these drilling locations represent a significant part of our growth strategy 
our ability to drill and develop these locations depends on a number of uncertainties  including oil and natural gas prices  the availability of capital  costs  drilling results  regulatory approvals and other factors 
the north dakota bakken shale and arkoma woodford projects comprise the majority of these drilling locations 
due to limited production history on the relatively few number of wells drilled in these projects  we are unable to predict with certainty the quantity of future production from wells to be drilled in these projects 
if future drilling results in these projects do not establish sufficient reserves to achieve an economic return  we may curtail drilling in these projects 
because of these uncertainties  we do not know if the numerous potential drilling locations we have identified will ever be drilled or if we will be able to produce oil or natural gas from these or any other potential drilling locations 
in addition  unless production is established within the spacing units covering the undeveloped acres on which some of the locations are identified  the leases for such acreage will expire 
as of december   we had leases representing  net acres expiring in   net acres expiring in  and  net acres expiring in as such  our actual drilling activities may materially differ from those presently identified  which could adversely affect our business 
market conditions or operational impediments may hinder our access to oil and natural gas markets or delay our production 
market conditions or the unavailability of satisfactory oil and natural gas transportation arrangements may hinder our access to oil and natural gas markets or delay our production 
the availability of a ready market for our oil and natural gas production depends on a number of factors  including the demand for and supply of oil and natural gas and the proximity of reserves to pipelines and terminal facilities 
our ability to market our production depends in substantial part on the availability and capacity of gathering systems  pipelines and processing facilities owned and operated by third parties 
our failure to obtain such services on acceptable terms could materially harm our business 
we may be required to shut in wells due to lack of a market or inadequacy or unavailability of crude oil or natural gas pipeline or gathering system capacity 
in addition  if gas quality specifications for the third party natural gas pipelines with which we connect change so as to restrict our ability to transport natural gas  our access to natural gas markets could be impeded 
if our production becomes shut in for any of these or other reasons  we would be unable to realize revenue from those wells until other arrangements were made to deliver the products to market 
we have been an early entrant into new or emerging plays 
as a result  our drilling results in these areas are uncertain  and the value of our undeveloped acreage will decline if drilling results are unsuccessful 
while our costs to acquire undeveloped acreage in new or emerging plays have generally been less than those of later entrants into a developing play  our drilling results in these areas are more uncertain than drilling results in areas that are developed and producing 
since new or emerging plays have limited or no production history  we are unable to use past drilling results in those areas to help predict our future drilling results 
as a result  our cost of drilling  completing and operating wells in these areas may be higher than initially expected  and the value of our undeveloped acreage will decline if drilling results are unsuccessful 
we are subject to complex federal  state  local  provincial and other laws and regulations that could adversely affect the cost  manner or feasibility of conducting our operations or expose us to significant liabilities 
our oil and natural gas exploration  production and transportation operations are subject to complex and stringent laws and regulations 
in order to conduct our operations in compliance with these laws and regulations  we must obtain and maintain numerous permits  approvals and certificates from various federal  state  local and provincial governmental authorities 
we may incur substantial costs in order to maintain compliance with these 
table of contents existing laws and regulations 
in addition  our costs of compliance may increase if existing laws and regulations are revised or reinterpreted  or if new laws and regulations become applicable to our operations 
such costs could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
our business is subject to federal  state  local and provincial laws and regulations as interpreted and enforced by governmental authorities possessing jurisdiction over various aspects of the exploration for  and the production and transportation of  oil and natural gas 
failure to comply with such laws and regulations  as interpreted and enforced  could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
see regulation of the oil and natural gas industry for a description of the laws and regulations that affect us 
strict  joint and several liabilities may be imposed under certain environmental laws  which could cause us to become liable for the conduct of others or for consequences of our own actions that were in compliance with all applicable laws at the time those actions were taken 
in addition  claims for damages to persons or property  including natural resources  may result from our operations 
new laws  regulations or enforcement policies could be more stringent and impose unforeseen liabilities or significantly increase compliance costs 
if we were not able to recover the resulting costs through insurance or increased revenues  our business  financial condition or results of operations could be adversely affected 
should we fail to comply with all applicable ferc administered statutes  rules  regulations and orders  we could be subject to substantial penalties and fines 
under the ep act  ferc has civil penalty authority under the nga to impose penalties for current violations of up to million per day for each violation and disgorgement of profits associated with any violation 
while our systems have not been regulated by ferc as a natural gas company under the nga  ferc has adopted regulations that may subject certain of our otherwise non ferc jurisdictional facilities to ferc annual reporting and daily scheduled flow and capacity posting requirements 
additional rules and legislation pertaining to those and other matters may be considered or adopted by ferc from time to time 
failure to comply with those regulations in the future could subject continental to civil penalty liability 
our operations may incur substantial liabilities in connection with climate change legislation and regulatory initiatives 
recent scientific studies have suggested that emissions of certain gases  commonly referred to as greenhouse gases and including carbon dioxide and methane  may be contributing to warming of the earth s atmosphere 
in response to such studies  the us congress is considering legislation to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases and more than one third of the states  either individually or through multi state initiatives  already have begun implementing legal measures to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases 
also  the us supreme court s holding in its decision  massachusetts  et al 
v 
epa  that carbon dioxide may be regulated as an air pollutant under the federal clean air act could result in future regulation of greenhouse gas emissions from stationary sources  even if congress does not adopt new legislation specifically addressing emissions of greenhouse gases 
in july  epa released an advance notice of proposed rulemaking regarding possible future regulation of greenhouse gas emissions under the clean air act 
although the notice did not propose any specific  new regulatory requirements for greenhouse gases  it indicates that federal regulation of greenhouse gas emissions could occur in the near future 
although it is not possible at this time to predict how legislation or new regulations that may be adopted to address greenhouse gas emissions would impact our business  any such future laws and regulations could result in increased compliance costs or additional operating restrictions  and could have an adverse effect on our business or demand for the oil and natural gas we produce 

table of contents competition in the oil and natural gas industry is intense  making it more difficult for us to acquire properties  market oil and natural gas and secure trained personnel 
our ability to acquire additional prospects and to find and develop reserves in the future will depend on our ability to evaluate and select suitable properties and to consummate transactions in a highly competitive environment for acquiring properties  marketing oil and natural gas and securing trained personnel 
also  there is substantial competition for capital available for investment in the oil and natural gas industry 
many of our competitors possess and employ financial  technical and personnel resources substantially greater than ours 
those companies may be able to pay more for productive oil and natural gas properties and exploratory prospects and to evaluate  bid for and purchase a greater number of properties and prospects than our financial or personnel resources permit 
in addition  companies may be able to offer better compensation packages to attract and retain qualified personnel than we are able to offer 
the cost to attract and retain qualified personnel has increased over the past three years due to competition and may increase substantially in the future 
we may not be able to compete successfully in the future in acquiring prospective reserves  developing reserves  marketing hydrocarbons  attracting and retaining quality personnel and raising additional capital  which could have a material adverse effect on our business 
the loss of senior management or technical personnel could adversely affect operations 
we depend on the services of our senior management and technical personnel 
the loss of the services of our senior management or technical personnel  including harold g 
hamm  our chairman  president and chief executive officer  could have a material adverse effect on our operations 
we do not maintain  nor do we plan to obtain  any insurance against the loss of any of these individuals 
seasonal weather conditions and lease stipulations adversely affect our ability to conduct drilling activities in some of the areas where we operate 
oil and natural gas operations in the rocky mountains are adversely affected by seasonal weather conditions and lease stipulations designed to protect various wildlife 
in certain areas  including parts of montana  north dakota  south dakota  and wyoming  drilling and other oil and natural gas activities can only be conducted during the spring and summer months 
this limits our ability to operate in those areas and can intensify competition during those months for drilling rigs  oilfield equipment  services  supplies and qualified personnel  which may lead to periodic shortages 
these constraints and the resulting shortages or high costs could delay our operations and materially increase our operating and capital costs 
our revolving credit facility contains certain covenants that may inhibit our ability to make certain investments  incur additional indebtedness and engage in certain other transactions  which could adversely affect our ability to meet our future goals 
our revolving credit facility includes certain covenants that  among other things  restrict our investments  loans and advances and the paying of dividends and other restricted payments  our incurrence of additional indebtedness  the granting of liens  other than liens created pursuant to the revolving credit facility and certain permitted liens  mergers  consolidations and sales of all or substantial part of our business or properties  the hedging  forward sale or swap of our production of crude oil or natural gas or other commodities  the sale of assets  and our capital expenditures 
our revolving credit facility requires us to maintain certain financial ratios  such as leverage ratios 
all of these restrictive covenants may restrict our ability to expand or pursue our business strategies 
our ability to 
table of contents comply with these and other provisions of our revolving credit facility may be impacted by changes in economic or business conditions  results of operations or events beyond our control 
the breach of any of these covenants could result in a default under our revolving credit facility  in which case  depending on the actions taken by the lenders thereunder or their successors or assignees  such lenders could elect to declare all amounts borrowed under our revolving credit facility  together with accrued interest  to be due and payable 
if we were unable to repay such borrowings or interest  our lenders could proceed against their collateral 
if the indebtedness under our revolving credit facility were to be accelerated  our assets may not be sufficient to repay in full such indebtedness 
increases in interest rates could adversely affect our business 
our business and operating results can be harmed by factors such as the availability  terms of and cost of capital  increases in interest rates or a reduction in credit rating 
these changes could cause our cost of doing business to increase  limit our ability to pursue acquisition opportunities  reduce cash flow used for drilling and place us at a competitive disadvantage 
for example  as of february   outstanding borrowings under our revolving credit facility were million and the impact of a increase in interest rates on this amount of debt would result in increased interest expense of approximately million and a million decrease in our net income 
recent and continuing disruptions and volatility in the global financial markets may lead to a contraction in credit availability impacting our ability to finance our operations 
we require continued access to capital 
a significant reduction in cash flows from operations or the availability of credit could materially and adversely affect our ability to achieve our planned growth and operating results 
the continuing financial crisis may impact our business and financial condition 
we may not be able to obtain funding in the capital markets on terms we find acceptable  or obtain funding under our current revolving credit facility because of the deterioration of the capital and credit markets and our borrowing base 
the current credit crisis and related turmoil in the global financial systems have had an impact on our business and our financial condition  and we may face challenges if economic and financial market conditions do not improve 
historically  we have used our cash flow from operations and borrowings under our revolving credit facility to fund our capital expenditures and have relied on the capital markets and asset monetization transactions to provide us with additional capital for large or exceptional transactions 
a continuation of the economic crisis could further reduce the demand for oil and natural gas and continue to put downward pressure on the prices for oil and natural gas  which have declined significantly since reaching historic highs in july these price declines have negatively impacted our revenues and cash flows 
we have an existing revolving credit facility with lender commitments totaling million 
in the future  we may not be able to access adequate funding under our bank credit facilities as a result of i a decrease in our borrowing base due to the outcome of a subsequent borrowing base redetermination  or ii an unwillingness or inability on the part of our lending counterparties to meet their funding obligations 
the recent declines in commodity prices  or a continuing decline in those prices  could result in a determination to lower the borrowing base in the future and  in such case  we could be required to repay any indebtedness in excess of the borrowing base 
the turmoil in the financial markets has adversely impacted the stability and solvency of a number of large global financial institutions 
the current credit crisis makes it difficult to obtain funding in the public and private capital markets 
in particular  the cost of raising money in the debt and equity capital markets has increased substantially while the availability of funds from those markets generally has diminished significantly 
also  as a result of concerns about the general stability of financial markets and the solvency of specific counterparties  the cost of obtaining money from the credit markets has increased as many lenders and institutional investors have increased interest rates  imposed tighter lending standards  refused to refinance existing debt at maturity at all or on terms similar to existing debt or at all  and reduced and  in some cases  ceased to provide any new funding 

table of contents the credit crisis also has impacted the level of activity in the oil and natural gas property sales market 
the lack of available credit and access to capital has limited and will likely continue to limit the parties interested in any proposed asset transactions and will likely reduce the values we could realize in those transactions 
due to these factors  we cannot be certain that funding  if needed  will be available to the extent required and on acceptable terms 
if we are unable to access funding when needed on acceptable terms  we may not be able to fully implement our business plans  complete new property acquisitions to replace our reserves  take advantage of business opportunities  respond to competitive pressures  or refinance our debt obligations as they come due  any of which could have a material adverse effect on our operations and financial results 
the inability of our significant customers to meet their obligations to us may adversely affect our financial results 
our principal exposures to credit risk are through joint interest receivables million at december  and the sale of our oil and natural gas production million in receivables at december   which we market to energy marketing companies  refineries and affiliates 
joint interest receivables arise from billing entities who own partial interest in the wells we operate 
these entities participate in our wells primarily based on their ownership in leases on which we wish to drill 
we can do very little to choose who participates in our wells 
we are also subject to credit risk due to concentration of our oil and natural gas receivables with several significant customers 
the largest purchaser of our oil and natural gas  during the twelve months ended december   accounted for of our total revenues 
we do not require our customers to post collateral 
the inability or failure of our significant customers to meet their obligations to us or their insolvency or liquidation may adversely affect our financial results 
our derivative activities could result in financial losses or could reduce our earnings 
to achieve a more predictable cash flow and to reduce our exposure to adverse fluctuations in the prices of oil and natural gas  we on occasion  enter into derivative instruments for a portion of our oil and or natural gas production  including collars and price fix swaps 
in july  we entered into fixed price swaps covering  barrels of oil per day for august through april at a price of per barrel 
we did not designate any of our derivative instruments as hedges for accounting purposes and did record all derivative instruments on our balance sheet at fair value 
changes in the fair value of our derivative instruments were recognized in current earnings 
accordingly  our earnings may fluctuate significantly as a result of changes in fair value of our derivative instruments 
derivative instruments also expose us to the risk of financial loss in some circumstances  including when production is less than the volume covered by the derivative instruments  the counter party to the derivative instrument defaults on its contract obligations  or there is an increase in the differential between the underlying price in the derivative instrument and actual prices received 
in addition  these types of derivative arrangements limit the benefit we would receive from increases in the prices for oil and natural gas 
we may be subject to risks in connection with acquisitions 
the successful acquisition of producing properties requires an assessment of several factors  including recoverable reserves  future oil and natural gas prices and their appropriate differentials  operating costs  and potential environmental and other liabilities 

table of contents the accuracy of these assessments is inherently uncertain 
in connection with these assessments  we perform a review of the subject properties that we believe to be generally consistent with industry practices 
our review will not reveal all existing or potential problems nor will it permit us to become sufficiently familiar with the properties to fully assess their deficiencies and capabilities 
inspections may not always be performed on every well  and environmental problems are not necessarily observable even when an inspection is undertaken 
even when problems are identified  the seller may be unwilling or unable to provide effective contractual protection against all or part of the problems 
we often are not entitled to contractual indemnification for environmental liabilities and acquire properties on an as is basis 
our business depends on oil and natural gas transportation facilities  most of which are owned by third parties 
the marketability of our oil and natural gas production depends in part on the availability  proximity and capacity of pipeline systems owned by third parties 
the unavailability of  or lack of  available capacity on these systems and facilities could result in the shut in of producing wells or the delay  or discontinuance of  development plans for properties 
although we have some contractual control over the transportation of our product  material changes in these business relationships could materially affect our operations 
we generally do not purchase firm transportation on third party facilities and therefore  our production transportation can be interrupted by those having firm arrangements 
federal and state regulation of oil and natural gas production and transportation  tax and energy policies  changes in supply and demand  pipeline pressures  damage to or destruction of pipelines and general economic conditions could adversely affect our ability to produce  gather and transport oil and natural gas 
the disruption of third party facilities due to maintenance and or weather could negatively impact our ability to market and deliver our products 
we have no control over when or if such facilities are restored or what prices will be charged 
a total shut in of production could materially affect us due to a lack of cash flow  and if a substantial portion of the production is hedged at lower than market prices  those financial hedges would have to be paid from borrowings absent sufficient cash flow 
our chairman and chief executive officer owns approximately of our outstanding common stock  giving him influence and control in corporate transactions and other matters  including a sale of our company 
as of february   harold g 
hamm  our chairman  president and chief executive officer  beneficially owns  shares of our outstanding common stock representing approximately of our outstanding common shares 
as a result  mr 
hamm will continue to be our controlling shareholder and will continue to be able to control the election of our directors  determine our corporate and management policies and determine  without the consent of our other shareholders  the outcome of certain corporate transactions or other matters submitted to our shareholders for approval  including potential mergers or acquisitions  asset sales and other significant corporate transactions 
as controlling shareholder  mr 
hamm could cause  delay or prevent a change of control of our company 
the interests of mr 
hamm may not coincide with the interests of other holders of our common stock 
several affiliated companies controlled by mr 
hamm provide oilfield  gathering and processing  marketing and other services to us 
we expect these transactions will continue in the future and may result in conflicts of interest between mr

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation the following discussion should be read in conjunction with our historical consolidated financial statements and notes  as well as the selected historical consolidated financial data  included elsewhere in this report 
overview we are engaged in oil and natural gas exploration  exploitation and production activities in the rocky mountain  mid continent and gulf coast regions of the united states 
crude oil comprised of our mmboe of estimated proved reserves as of december  and of our  mboe of production for the year then ended 
we seek to operate wells in which we own an interest  and we operated wells that accounted for of our pv and of our  gross wells as of december  by controlling operations  we are able to more effectively manage the cost and timing of exploration and development of our properties  including the drilling and fracture stimulation methods used 
our business strategy has focused on reserve and production growth through exploration and development 
for the three year period ended december   we added  mboe of proved reserves through extensions and discoveries  compared to  mboe added through purchases 
during this period  our production increased from  mboe in to  mboe in an aspect of our business strategy has been to acquire large undeveloped acreage positions in new or developing resource plays 
as of december   we held approximately  gross  net undeveloped acres  including  net acres in the bakken field in montana and north dakota and  net acres in the arkoma woodford and lewis shale projects 
as an early entrant in new or emerging plays  we expect to acquire undeveloped acreage at a lower cost than those of later entrants into a developing play 
in the year ended december   our oil and gas production increased to  mboe  boe per day  up from the year ended december  the increase in production primarily resulted from an increase in production from our red river units  bakken field and arkoma woodford 
oil and natural gas revenues for the year increased by to million due to increases in volumes and commodity prices 
our realized price per boe increased to for the year compared to the year while we experienced increases in production expense and production tax of a combined total of million  or  our increase in combined per unit cost was only  or per boe  due to the increase in sales volumes of  mboe  or 
oil sales volumes were mbbls more than oil production for the year ended december  due to temporarily stored barrels being sold during the year and oil sales volumes were mbbls less for the same period in due to an increase in crude oil inventory for pipeline line fill and stored barrels 
our cash flow from operating activities for the year ended december   was million  an increase of million from million provided by our operating activities during the comparable period 
the increase in operating cash flows was mainly due to increases in sales prices and volumes partially offset by increased production expenses and production taxes 
during the year ended december   we invested million inclusive of non cash accruals of million in our capital program concentrating mainly in the red river units  the bakken field and the arkoma woodford play 
as a response to significantly lower oil and natural gas prices during the fourth quarter of and continuing into and the resulting decrease in cash flows  we have significantly reduced our capital expenditures budget for we have reduced our rig count from operated rigs in october to operated rigs in early february while we have an approved capital expenditures budget for of million  we expect to manage our capital expenditures for the year to be inline with our cash flows from operations 
continued weakness in commodity prices may result in a decrease in our actual capital expenditures during conversely  a significant improvement in product prices could result in an increase in our capital expenditures 
see liquidity and capital resources 

table of contents how we evaluate our operations we use a variety of financial and operational measures to assess our performance 
among these measures are volumes of oil and natural gas produced  oil and natural gas prices realized  per unit operating and administrative costs and ebitdax

the mid continent area contributed incremental volumes of mbbls in excess of levels 
favorable results from drilling and acquisitions have been the primary contributors to production growth in these areas 
gas volumes increased  mmcf  or  during the year ended december  compared to the majority of the increase  bcf  was from the mid continent region due to the results of our exploration efforts in the arkoma woodford 
the rocky mountain region gas production was up bcf for the year ended december  compared to due to additional gas being sold through the hiland partners badlands plant which became operational in late august since that time  we have sold bcf of gas from the red river units through the new plant 
revenues oil and natural gas sales 
oil and natural gas sales for the year ended december  were million  a increase from sales of million for our sales volumes increased  mboe or over the volumes due to the continuing success of our enhanced oil recovery and drilling programs 
our realized price per boe increased to for the year ended december  from for the year ended december  during  the differential between nymex calendar month average crude oil prices and our realized crude oil prices widened 
the differential per barrel for the year ended december  was compared to for factors contributing to the higher differentials in included canadian oil imports  increases in production in the rocky mountain region  coupled with downstream transportation capacity constraints  refinery downtime in the rocky mountain region  and reduced seasonal demand for gasoline 
derivatives 
in july  we entered into fixed price swap contracts covering  barrels of oil per day for the period from august through april during each month of the contract  we received a fixed price of per barrel and paid to the counterparties the average of the prompt nymex crude oil futures contract settlement prices for such month

we did not have any open derivative positions at december  oil and natural gas service operations 
our oil and natural gas service operations consist primarily of sales of high pressure air and the treatment and sale of lower quality crude oil  or reclaimed oil 
we sold high pressure air from our red river units to a third party and recorded revenues of million for the year ended december  and revenues of million for the year ended december  prices for reclaimed oil sold from our central treating unit were higher for the year ended december  than the comparable period 
the price increased per barrel which increased reclaimed oil income by million contributing to an overall increase in oil and gas service operations revenue of million for the year ended december  associated oil and natural gas service operations expenses increased million to million during the year ended december  from million during the year ended december  due mainly to an increase in the costs of purchasing and treating oil for resale compared to the same period in operating costs and expenses production expense and tax 
production expense increased million  or  during the year ended december  to million from million during the year ended december  the increase in production expense is partially attributable to our increase in sales volumes of which is a direct result of new wells being drilled and escalating field service costs 
during the year ended december   we participated in the completion of gross net wells 
production expense per boe increased to for the year ended december  from per boe for the year ended december  production taxes increased million  or  during the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  as a result of higher revenues resulting from increased sales prices and volumes and the expiration of various tax incentives 
the majority of the production tax increase was in the mid continent and rocky mountain regions due to an increase of  mboe sold in the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  production tax as a percentage of oil and natural gas sales was for the year ended december  compared to for the year ended december  production taxes are based on the wellhead values of production and vary by state 
additionally  some states offer exemptions or reduced production tax rates for wells that produce less than a certain quantity of oil or gas and to encourage certain activities  such as horizontal drilling and enhanced recovery projects 
in montana  north dakota and oklahoma new horizontal wells qualify for a tax incentive and are taxed at a lower rate during their initial months of production 
after the incentive period expires  the tax rate increases to the statutory rates 
our overall rate is expected to increase as production tax incentives we currently receive for horizontal wells reach the end of their incentive period 
on a unit of sales basis  production expense and production taxes were as follows year ended december  percent increase boe production expense production tax production expense and tax exploration expense 
exploration expense consists primarily of dry hole costs and exploratory geological and geophysical costs that are expensed as incurred 
exploration expense increased million in the year ended december  to million due primarily to an increase in dry hole expense of million to million and an increase in seismic expense of million to million 
the majority of the dry hole costs were in the rocky mountain region for the years ended december  and

property impairments  both non producing and developed  increased in the year ended december  by million to million compared to million during the year ended december  impairment of non producing properties increased million during the year ended december  to million compared to million for reflecting higher amortization of lease costs in our existing fields resulting from further defining likely drilling locations and amortization of new fields 
non producing properties consist of undeveloped leasehold costs and costs associated with the purchase of certain proved undeveloped reserves 
non producing properties are amortized on a composite method based on our estimated experience of successful drilling and the average holding period 
impairment provisions for developed oil and gas properties were approximately million for the year ended december  compared to approximately million for the year ended december   an increase of million  or 
we evaluate our developed oil and gas properties for impairment by comparing their cost basis to the estimated future cash flows on a field basis 
if the cost basis is in excess of estimated future cash flows  then we impair it based on an estimate of fair market value based on discounted cash flows 
impairments in reflect uneconomic drilling results in certain small fields primarily in our mid continent region and our rockies other area which resulted in impairments of million in the significant decrease in oil and gas prices at december  resulted in impairments of million 
impairments in were primarily related to uneconomic wells in our gulf region and certain small fields primarily in our mid continent region 
general and administrative expense 
general and administrative expense increased million to million during the year ended december  from million during the comparable period of general and administrative expense includes non cash charges for stock based compensation of million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
stock compensation expense was higher in due to an increase in the value of our stock as we approached our initial public offering 
until our initial public offering in may  the outstanding options and restricted stock were accounted for as liability awards and their value fluctuated with the value of the underlying stock 
general and administrative expense excluding equity compensation increased million for the twelve months ended december  compared to the twelve months ended december  the increase was primarily related to a million increase in personnel costs due to additional employees and higher wages and increased benefits 
on a volumetric basis  general and administrative expense was per boe for the year ended december  compared to per boe for the year ended december  due to higher sales volumes 
interest expense 
interest expense decreased  or million  for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december   due to lower interest rates during partially offset by higher debt balances 
our average debt balance increased to million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december   but the weighted average interest rate on our

oil production volumes increased during the year ended december  in comparison to the year ended december  production increases in the red river units contributed incremental volumes in excess of levels of mbbls  and the bakken field contributed mbbls of incremental production 
initial production commenced in the bakken field in august and has increased thereafter  as we have continued exploration and development activities within the montana and north dakota portions of the field 
favorable results from our enhanced recovery program and increased density drilling have been the primary contributors to production growth in the red river units 
gas volumes increased  mmcf  or  during the year ended december  compared to the majority of the increase   mmcf  was from the mid continent region due to the results of our exploration efforts in the arkoma woodford 
the rocky mountain gas production was up  mmcf for the year ended december  compared to the new hiland partners badlands plant became operational in late august through december   we sold mmcf of gas from the red river units through the new plant

oil and natural gas sales for the year ended december  were million  a increase from sales of million for our sales volumes increased  mboe  or  over the volumes due to the continuing success of our enhanced oil recovery and drilling programs 
our realized price per boe increased to for the year ended december  from for the year ended december  during  the differential between nymex calendar month average crude oil prices and our realized crude oil prices narrowed 
the differential per barrel for the year ended december  was compared to for factors contributing to the higher differentials in included canadian oil imports  increases in production in the rocky mountain region  coupled with downstream transportation capacity constraints  refinery downtime in the rocky mountain region  and reduced seasonal demand for gasoline 
crude oil differentials were better during due to additional transportation capacity and efforts by us to move crude oil to more favorable markets 
during the fourth quarter of  we elected not to sell some of our rocky mountain area crude oil as price differentials were unacceptable to us and we expected the differentials to improve in early this resulted in an increase in our crude oil inventory of  barrels 
the price we were offered was adversely affected by seasonal demand 
in the fourth quarter of  we shipped some of our rocky mountain area crude by railcar to help alleviate this situation 
we were able to sell the majority of this oil at improved differentials during january and february derivatives 
in july  we entered into fixed price swap contracts covering  barrels of oil per day for the period from august through april during each month of the contract  we will receive a fixed price of per barrel and will pay to the counterparties the average of the prompt nymex crude oil futures contract settlement prices for such month

see notes to consolidated financial statements note for more information 
liquidity and capital resources our primary sources of liquidity have been cash flows generated from operating activities and financing provided by our revolving credit facility 
as we exited the fourth quarter of  oil and natural gas prices had declined significantly from their recent record levels which reduced our operational cash flows 
in response  we began reducing capital expenditures during the last quarter of and have prepared our capital expenditure budget for assuming lower commodity prices 
however  realigning capital expenditures to reflect lower cash flows is not an instantaneous process  accordingly our debt has increased and will continue to increase as operating activities and expenses are matched with the reduced level of cash flow 
additionally  as in the past  we will consider selling non strategic assets in order for us to focus on our core projects if and when appropriate 
the recent problems in the credit markets  steep stock market declines  financial institution failures and government bail outs are evidence of a weakening global economy 
if the unsettled conditions  including sustained declines in commodity prices  continue long term it may impact our ability to develop all of our projects 
our current revolving credit facility is backed by a syndicate of banks and we believe that all of the syndicate banks have the capability to fund up to our current commitment 
if one or more banks should not be able to do so  we may not have the full availability of million commitment 

table of contents we believe that funds from operating cash flows and the revolving credit facility should be sufficient to meet our cash requirements inclusive of  but not limited to  normal operating needs  debt service obligations  planned capital expenditures  and commitments and contingencies for the next months 
we currently anticipate that we will be able to generate or obtain funds sufficient to meet our long term cash requirements 
we intend to finance our future capital expenditures primarily through cash flow from operations and through borrowings under our revolving credit facility  however  our financing needs may require us to alter or increase our capitalization substantially through the issuance of debt or equity securities or the sale of assets 
please see risk factors 
lower oil and natural gas prices will reduce our cash flows and borrowing ability 
for example  although our average realized price received for oil and natural gas was per boe for the year ended december   it was bolstered by record oil prices for the first half of the year 
in the fourth quarter of  our average realized price received for oil and natural gas declined to per boe 
furthermore  the issuance of additional debt may require that a portion of our cash flow from operations be used for the payment of interest and principal on our debt  thereby reducing our ability to use cash flow to fund working capital  capital expenditures and acquisitions 
the issuance of additional equity securities could have a dilutive effect on the value of your common stock 
in the future  we may not be able to access adequate funding under our bank credit facilities as a result of i a decrease in our borrowing base due to the outcome of a subsequent borrowing base redetermination  or ii an unwillingness or inability on the part of our lending counterparties to meet their funding obligations 
the recent declines in commodity prices  or a continuing decline in those prices  could result in a determination to lower the borrowing base in the future and  in such case  we could be required to repay any indebtedness in excess of the borrowing base 
the turmoil in the financial markets has adversely impacted the stability and solvency of a number of large global financial institutions 
the current credit crisis makes it difficult to obtain funding in the public and private capital markets 
in particular  the cost of raising money in the debt and equity capital markets has increased substantially while the availability of funds from those markets generally has diminished significantly 
also  as a result of concerns about the general stability of financial markets and the solvency of specific counterparties  the cost of obtaining money from the credit markets has increased as many lenders and institutional investors have increased interest rates  imposed tighter lending standards  refused to refinance existing debt at maturity at all or on terms similar to existing debt or at all  and reduced and  in some cases  ceased to provide any new funding 
the credit crisis also has impacted the level of activity in the oil and natural gas property sales market 
the lack of available credit and access to capital has limited and will likely continue to limit the parties interested in any proposed asset transactions and will likely reduce the values we could realize in those transactions 
due to these factors  we cannot be certain that funding  if needed  will be available to the extent required and on acceptable terms 
if we are unable to access funding when needed on acceptable terms  we may not be able to fully implement our business plans  complete new property acquisitions to replace our reserves  take advantage of business opportunities  respond to competitive pressures  or refinance our debt obligations as they come due  any of which could have a material adverse effect on our operations and financial results 
cash flow from operating activities our net cash provided by operating activities was million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the increase in operating cash flows for the year ended december  was mainly due to increases in revenues reflecting increased production volumes and product prices partially offset by higher operating costs 

table of contents cash flow from investing activities during the years ended december   and we had cash flows used in investing activities excluding asset sales of million  million and million  respectively  in our capital program  inclusive of dry hole and seismic costs 
the increase in our capital program for the year ended december  was mainly due to increased drilling in our rocky mountain region and in our arkoma woodford shale play 
cash flow from financing activities net cash provided by financing activities of million for the year ended december   was mainly the result of amounts borrowed under our revolving credit facility to fund capital expenditures  including acquisitions 
net cash provided by financing activities of million for the year ended december  was mainly the results of proceeds of our initial public offering net of amounts used to pay cash dividends 
net cash used in financing activities during of million was used mainly for the payment of cash dividends 
credit facility we had million and million outstanding under our revolving credit facility at december  and  respectively 
as of february   the amount outstanding under our credit facility has increased by million to million 
the increase was largely due to borrowings to cover capital expenditures incurred in the fourth quarter of that could not be funded from cash flow from operations due to the continued deterioration in oil and natural gas prices in the second half of and into the revolving credit facility matures on april   and borrowings under our revolving credit facility bear interest  payable quarterly  at a a rate per annum equal to the london interbank offered rate for one  two  three or six months as offered by the lead bank plus an applicable margin ranging from to basis points  depending on the percentage of our borrowing base utilized or b the lead bank s reference rate 
at december  and  we had cash and cash equivalents of million and million  respectively  and available borrowing capacity on our revolving credit facility of million and million  respectively 
at february   we had available borrowing capacity on our revolving credit facility of million 
the revolving credit facility was amended in december to change the borrowing base to million  subject to semi annual redetermination  increase the applicable london interbank offered rate margins by basis points to a range of to basis points and increase the commitment level to million 
subsequently  in february  the commitment level was increased to million 
the note amount remains at million 
borrowings under the revolving credit facility are secured by liens on substantially all of our oil and gas properties and associated assets 
our next semi annual redetermination will occur in april the terms of the revolving credit facility commitment level can be increased up to the lesser of the borrowing base or note amount subject to bank agreement 
the revolving credit facility contains restrictive covenants that may limit our ability to  among other things  incur additional indebtedness  sell assets  make loans to others  make investments  enter into mergers  change material contracts  incur liens and engage in certain other transactions without the prior consent of the lenders 
the facility also requires us to maintain certain ratios as defined and further described in our revolving credit facility a current ratio of not less than to adjusted for available borrowing capacity  a total funded debt to ebitdax  as defined therein  of no greater than to as of december   we were in compliance with all covenants 

table of contents capital expenditures and commitments we evaluate opportunities to purchase or sell oil and natural gas properties in the marketplace and could participate as a buyer or seller of properties at various times 
we seek acquisitions that utilize our technical expertise or offer opportunities to expand our existing core areas 
acquisition expenditures are not budgeted 
we invested approximately million inclusive of non cash accruals of million for capital and exploration expenditures in as follows in millions amount exploration and development drilling acquisition of producing properties capital facilities  workovers and re completions land costs seismic vehicles  computers and other equipment total expenditures for exploration and development of oil and natural gas properties are the primary use of our capital resources 
in november  our board of directors approved budgeted capital expenditures of approximately million 
however  as a response to significantly lower oil and natural gas prices during the fourth quarter of and continuing into and the resulting decrease in expected cash flows  we have significantly reduced our capital expenditures budgeted for in addition  we have reduced our rig count from operated rigs in october to operated rigs on february  we expect to manage our capital expenditures for the year to be inline with our cash flows from operations 
continued weakness in commodity prices may result in a further decrease in our actual capital expenditures during conversely  a significant improvement in commodity prices could result in an increase in our actual capital expenditures during in february  our board of directors approved a decrease in our budgeted capital expenditures to million as follows in millions amount exploration and development drilling capital facilities  workovers and re completions land costs seismic vehicles  computers and other equipment total our budgeted capital expenditures are expected to decrease approximately from the million invested during we plan to invest approximately million in development drilling 
in the red river units  we plan to invest approximately million to drill infill wells and extend horizontal laterals on existing wells to increase production and sweep efficiency of the enhanced recovery projects 
most of the remaining development drilling budget is expected to be invested in the drilling of development wells in the montana bakken field 
we have budgeted approximately million for exploratory drilling with approximately million and million allocated to drilling exploratory wells in the north dakota bakken field and the arkoma woodford project  respectively 
although we cannot provide any assurance  assuming successful implementation of our strategy  including the future development of our proved reserves and realization of our cash flows as anticipated  we believe that our remaining cash balance  cash flows from operations and borrowings available under our revolving credit facility will be sufficient to satisfy our capital budget 
the actual amount and timing of our capital expenditures may differ materially from our estimates as a result of  among other things  available cash flow  actual drilling results  the availability of drilling rigs and other services and equipment  and regulatory  technological and competitive developments 

table of contents shareholder distribution on january   we declared a cash dividend of approximately million to our shareholders and  subject to forfeiture  to holders of unvested restricted stock 
on january   we paid million of the dividend declared  of which million was paid to our principal shareholder 
on march   we declared a cash dividend of approximately million to our shareholders of record and  subject to forfeiture  to holders of unvested restricted stock 
on april   we paid million of the dividend declared  of which million was paid to our principal shareholder 
we converted from a subchapter s corporation to a subchapter c corporation on may  when we became a publicly traded company  and we do not anticipate paying any additional cash dividends on our common stock in the foreseeable future

amounts represent expected asset retirements by period 
critical accounting policies and practices our historical consolidated financial statements and notes to our historical consolidated financial statements contain information that is pertinent to our management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires that our management make estimates  judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
however  the accounting principles used by us generally do not change our reported cash flows or liquidity 
interpretation of the existing rules must be done and judgments made on how the specifics of a given rule apply to us 
in management s opinion  the more significant reporting areas impacted by management s judgments and estimates are oil and natural gas reserve estimation  revenue recognition  the choice of accounting method for oil and natural gas activities  asset retirement obligations  impairment of assets and income taxes 
management s judgments and estimates in these areas are based on information available from both internal and external sources  including engineers  geologists and historical experience in similar matters 
actual results could differ from the estimates  as additional information becomes known 

table of contents oil and natural gas reserves and standardized measure of future cash flows our independent engineers and technical staff prepare the estimates of our oil and natural gas reserves and associated future net cash flows 
current accounting guidance allows only proved oil and natural gas reserves to be included in our financial statement disclosures 
the sec has defined proved reserves as the estimated quantities of crude oil and natural gas which geological and engineering data demonstrate with reasonable certainty to be recoverable in future years from known reservoirs under existing economic and operating conditions 
even though our independent engineers and technical staff are knowledgeable and follow authoritative guidelines for estimating reserves  they must make a number of subjective assumptions based on professional judgments in developing the reserve estimates 
reserve estimates are updated at least annually and consider recent production levels and other technical information about each field 
oil and natural gas reserve engineering is a subjective process of estimating underground accumulations of oil and natural gas that cannot be precisely measured 
the accuracy of any reserve estimate is a function of the quality of available data and of engineering and geological interpretation and judgment 
periodic revisions to the estimated reserves and future cash flows may be necessary as a result of a number of factors  including reservoir performance  new drilling  oil and natural gas prices  cost changes  technological advances  new geological or geophysical data  or other economic factors 
accordingly  reserve estimates are often different from the quantities of oil and gas that are ultimately recovered 
we cannot predict the amounts or timing of future reserve revisions 
if such revisions are significant  they could significantly alter future dd a and result in impairment of assets that may be material 
revenue recognition we derive substantially all of our revenues from the sale of oil and natural gas 
oil and gas revenues are recorded in the month the product is delivered to the purchaser and title transfers 
we generally receive payment from one to three months after the sale has occurred 
each month we estimate the volumes sold and the price at which they were sold to record revenue 
variances between estimated revenue and actual amounts are recorded in the month payment is received 
successful efforts method of accounting we utilize the successful efforts method of accounting for our oil and natural gas exploration and development activities 
exploration expenses  including geological and geophysical costs  rentals and exploratory dry holes  are charged against income as incurred 
costs of successful wells and related production equipment and developmental dry holes are capitalized and amortized on a field basis using the unit of production method as oil and natural gas is produced 
this accounting method may yield significantly different results than the full cost method of accounting 
depreciation  depletion and amortization  or dd a  of capitalized drilling and development costs of oil and natural gas properties are generally computed using the unit of production method on a field basis based on total estimated proved developed oil and natural gas reserves 
amortization of producing leasehold is based on the unit of production method using total estimated proved reserves 
in arriving at rates under the unit of production method  the quantities of recoverable oil and natural gas are established based on estimates made by our geologists and engineers and independent engineers 
service properties  equipment and other assets are depreciated using the straight line method over estimated useful lives of to years 
upon sale or retirement of depreciable or depletable property  the cost and related accumulated dd a are eliminated from the accounts and the resulting gain or loss is recognized 
unproved oil and natural gas properties  the majority of the costs of which relates to the acquisition of leasehold interests  are assessed for impairment on a property by property basis for individually significant balances and on an aggregate basis for individually insignificant balances 
if the assessment indicates an impairment  a loss is recognized by providing a valuation allowance at the level consistent with the level at which impairment was assessed 
the impairment assessment is affected by economic factors such as the results of exploration activities  commodity price outlooks  remaining lease terms  and potential shifts in business 
table of contents strategy employed by management 
in the case of individually insignificant balances  the amount of the impairment loss recognized is determined by amortizing the portion of the unproved properties costs which we feel will not be transferred to proved properties over the life of the lease 
asset retirement obligations we are required to recognize an estimated liability for future costs associated with the abandonment of our oil and gas properties 
we base our estimate of the liability on our historical experience in abandoning oil and gas wells projected into the future based on our current understanding of federal and state regulatory requirements 
our present value calculations require us to estimate the economic lives of our properties  assume what future inflation rates apply to external estimates  and determine what credit adjusted risk free rate to use 
the impact to the consolidated statement of income from these estimates is reflected in our depreciation  depletion  and amortization calculations and occurs over the remaining life of our oil and gas properties 
impairment of assets all of our long lived assets are monitored for potential impairment when circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may be greater than its future net cash flows  including cash flows from risk adjusted proved reserves 
the evaluations involve a significant amount of judgment since the results are based on estimated future events  such as future sales prices for oil and natural gas  future costs to produce these products  estimates of future oil and natural gas reserves to be recovered and the timing thereof  the economic and regulatory climates and other factors 
the need to test a field for impairment may result from significant declines in sales prices or downward revisions to oil and natural gas reserves 
any assets held for sale are reviewed for impairment when we approve the plan to sell 
estimates of anticipated sales prices are highly judgmental and subject to material revision in future periods 
because of the uncertainty inherent in these factors  we cannot predict when or if future impairment charges will be recorded 
income taxes we make certain estimates and judgments in determining our income tax expense for financial reporting purposes 
these estimates and judgments occur in the calculation of certain tax assets and liabilities that arise from differences in the timing and recognition of revenue and expense for tax and financial reporting purposes 
our federal and state income tax returns are generally not prepared or filed before the consolidated financial statements are prepared  therefore  we estimate the tax basis of our assets and liabilities at the end of each period as well as the effects of tax rate changes  tax credits and net operating loss carryforwards 
adjustments related to these estimates are recorded in our tax provision in the period in which we file our income tax returns 
further  we must assess the likelihood that we will be able to recover or utilize our deferred tax assets 
if recovery is not likely  we must record a valuation allowance against such deferred tax assets for the amount we would not expect to recover  which would result in an increase to our income tax expense 
as of december   we believe that all of our deferred tax assets recorded on our consolidated balance sheet will ultimately be recovered 
we consider future taxable income in making such assessments 
numerous judgments and assumptions are inherent in the determination of future taxable income  including factors such as future operating conditions particularly as related to prevailing oil and natural gas prices 
if our estimates and judgments change regarding our ability to utilize our deferred tax assets  our tax provision would increase in the period it is determined that recovery is not probable 
our effective tax rate is subject to variability from period to period as a result of factors other than changes in federal and state tax rates and or changes in tax laws which can affect tax paying companies 
our effective tax rate is affected by changes in the allocation of property  payroll  and revenues between states in which we own property as rates vary from state to state 
as the mix of property  payroll  and revenues varies by state  our estimated tax rate changes 
due to the size of our gross deferred tax balances  a small change in our estimated future tax rate can have a material effect on current period earnings

on december   the securities and exchange commission announced final approval of new requirements  effective for annual reports on form k for fiscal years ending on or after december   to provide investors with a more meaningful and comprehensive understanding of oil and natural gas reserves 
the new disclosure requirements include consideration of new technologies in evaluating oil and natural gas reserves  disclosure of probable and possible oil and natural gas reserves  use of an average price based on the prior twelve month period rather than year end prices  and revisions of the oil and natural gas disclosure requirements for operations 
we have not yet evaluated the effects of the above on our financial statements and disclosures 

table of contents inflation historically  general inflationary trends have not had a material effect on our operating results 
however  we have experienced inflationary pressure on technical staff compensation and the cost of oilfield services and equipment due to the increase in drilling activity and competitive pressures resulting from higher oil and natural gas prices in recent years 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to a variety of market risks including credit risk  commodity price risk and interest rate risk 
we address these risks through a program of risk management which may include the use of derivative instruments 
credit risk 
we monitor our risk of loss due to non performance by counterparties of their contractual obligations 
our principal exposure to credit risk is through joint interest receivables million at december  and the sale of our oil and natural gas production  which we market to energy marketing companies  refineries and affiliates million in receivables at december  
see notes to consolidated financial statements 
note organization and summary of significant accounting policies 
joint interest receivables arise from billing entities who own partial interest in the wells we operate 
these entities participate in our wells primarily based on their ownership in leases on which we wish to drill 
we can do very little to choose who participates in our wells 
in order to minimize our exposure to credit risk we request prepayment of drilling costs where it is allowed by contract or state law 
for such prepayments  a liability is recorded and subsequently reduced as the associated work is performed 
in this manner  we reduce credit risk 
we also have the right to place a lien on our co owners production proceeds in order to secure payment 
historically  our credit losses on joint interest receivables have been immaterial 
we monitor our exposure to counterparties on oil and natural gas sales primarily by reviewing credit ratings  financial statements and payment history 
we extend credit terms based on our evaluation of each counterparty s credit worthiness 
we have not generally required our counterparties to provide collateral to support oil and natural gas receivables owed to us 
commodity price risk 
our primary market risk exposure is in the pricing applicable to our natural gas and oil production 
realized pricing is primarily driven by the prevailing worldwide price for crude oil and spot market prices applicable to our us natural gas production 
pricing for natural gas and oil production has been volatile and unpredictable for several years  and we expect this volatility to continue in the future 
the prices we receive for production depend on many factors outside of our control including volatility in the differences between product prices at sales points and the applicable index price 
based on our average daily production for the year ended december   our annual revenue would increase or decrease by approximately million for each per barrel change in crude oil prices and million for each per mmbtu change in natural gas prices 
to partially reduce price risk caused by these market fluctuations  we have occasionally hedged crude oil and natural gas prices in the past  through the utilization of derivatives  including zero cost collars and fixed price contracts 
most recently  in july  we entered into fixed price swap contracts covering  barrels of oil per day for the period from august through april during and  we had recognized losses on derivatives of million and million  respectively 
these contracts expired in april and we currently have no hedges in place 
interest rate risk 
our exposure to changes in interest rates relates primarily to long term debt obligations 
we manage our interest rate exposure by limiting our variable rate debt to a certain percentage of total capitalization and by monitoring the effects of market changes in interest rates 
we may utilize interest rate derivatives to alter interest rate exposure in an attempt to reduce interest rate expense related to existing debt issues 
interest rate derivatives are used solely to modify interest rate exposure and not to modify the overall 
table of contents leverage of the debt portfolio 
we are exposed to changes in interest rates as a result of our revolving credit facility 
we had total indebtedness of million outstanding under our revolving credit facility at february  the impact of a increase in interest rates on this amount of debt would result in increased interest expense of approximately million and a million decrease in net income 
our weighted average interest rate at december  was 
our weighted average interest rate at february  was 
the fair value of long term debt is estimated based on quoted market prices and management s estimate of current rates available for similar issues
