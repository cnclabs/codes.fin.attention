item a 
risk factors our business is subject to a variety of risks 
the most important of these is our ability to remain relevant to our guests and a brand they trust 
meeting our guests expectations requires us to manage various operational and financial risks 
set forth below are the most significant risks that we face 
our success depends on our ability to positively differentiate ourselves from other retailers 
the retail business is highly competitive 
in the past we have been able to compete successfully by differentiating our shopping experience by creating an attractive value proposition through a careful combination of price  merchandise assortment  convenience  guest service and marketing efforts 
guest perceptions regarding the cleanliness and safety of our stores and our in stock levels are also factors in our ability to compete 
no single competitive factor is dominant  and actions by our competitors on any of these factors could have an adverse effect on our sales  gross margin and expenses 
if we fail to continue to positively differentiate ourselves from our competitors  our results of operations could be adversely affected 
if we fail to anticipate and respond quickly to changing consumer preferences  our sales  gross margin and profitability could suffer 
a substantial part of our business is dependent on our ability to make trend right decisions in apparel  home d cor  seasonal offerings and other merchandise 
failure to accurately predict constantly changing consumer tastes  preferences  spending patterns and other lifestyle decisions could lead to lost sales  increased markdowns on inventory and adversely affect our results of operations 
all of our stores are located within the united states  making us highly susceptible to deteriorations in us macroeconomic conditions and consumer confidence 
all of our stores are located within the united states  making our results highly dependent on us consumer confidence and the health of the us economy 
in addition  a significant portion of our total sales is derived from stores located in five states california  texas  florida  minnesota and illinois  resulting in further dependence on local economic conditions in these states 
the success of our credit card business is also highly dependent on consumers willingness to use credit cards over other payment methods  their ability to pay and our ability to anticipate changes to the risk profile of our cardholders when extending credit 
deterioration in macroeconomic conditions and consumer confidence could negatively impact our business in many ways  including slowing sales growth or reduction in overall sales 
reducing gross margins 
increasing our expenses  including bad debt expense 

table of contents if we do not continually attract  train and retain qualified employees  our results of operations could be adversely affected 
our business is dependent on our ability to attract  train and retain a large and growing number of qualified team members 
many of those team members are in entry level or part time positions with historically high turnover rates 
our ability to meet our labor needs while controlling our costs is subject to external factors such as unemployment levels  health care costs and changing demographics 
if we are unable to attract and retain adequate numbers of qualified team members  our operations  guest service levels and support functions could suffer  and we could experience delays in opening new stores 
those factors  together with increased wage and benefit costs  could adversely affect our results of operations 
inability to build new stores in suitable locations could slow our growth  and difficulty in building new stores could increase our costs and capital requirements 
our future growth is dependent  in part  on our ability to build new stores and expand existing stores in a manner that achieves appropriate returns on our capital investment 
we compete with other retailers and businesses for suitable locations for our stores 
in addition  for many sites we are dependent on a third party developer s ability to acquire land  obtain financing and secure the necessary zoning changes and permits for a larger project  of which our store may be one component 
turmoil in the financial markets has made it difficult for third party developers to obtain financing for new projects 
local land use and other regulations applicable to the types of stores we desire to construct may impact our ability to find suitable locations and also influence the cost of constructing and expanding our stores 
a significant portion of our expected new store development activity is planned to occur within fully developed markets  which is generally a more time consuming and expensive undertaking than developments in undeveloped suburban and ex urban markets 
delays in new store openings could have an adverse effect on our sales growth  and increased costs associated with new stores and store expansions could adversely affect our results of operations 
interruptions in our supply chain could adversely affect our results 
we are dependent on our vendors to supply merchandise in a timely and efficient manner 
if a vendor fails to deliver on its commitments  whether due to financial difficulties or other reasons  we could experience merchandise shortages that could lead to lost sales 
in addition  a large portion of our merchandise is sourced  directly or indirectly  from outside the united states  with china as our single largest source 
political or financial instability  trade restrictions  tariffs  currency exchange rates  the outbreak of pandemics  labor unrest  transport capacity and costs  port security or other events that could slow port activities and impact foreign trade are beyond our control and could disrupt our supply of merchandise and adversely affect our results of operations 
product safety concerns could adversely affect our sales and results of operations 
if our merchandise offerings  including food  drug and children s products  do not meet applicable safety standards or our guests expectations regarding safety  we could experience lost sales  experience increased costs and be exposed to legal and reputational risk 
all of our vendors must comply with applicable product safety laws  and we are dependent on them to ensure that the products we buy comply with all safety standards 
events that give rise to actual  potential or perceived product safety concerns  including food or drug contamination  could expose us to government enforcement action or private litigation and result in costly product recalls and other liabilities 
in addition  negative guest perceptions regarding the safety of the products we sell could cause our guests to seek alternative sources for their needs  resulting in lost sales 
in those circumstances  it may be difficult and costly for us to regain the confidence of our guests 
if we fail to protect the security of personal information about our guests  we could be subject to costly government enforcement actions or private litigation and our reputation could suffer 
the nature of our business involves the receipt and storage of personal information about our guests 
if we experience a data security breach  we could be exposed to government enforcement actions and private litigation 
in addition  our guests could lose confidence in our ability to protect their personal information  which could cause them to discontinue usage of our credit card products  decline to use our pharmacy 
table of contents services  or stop shopping at our stores altogether 
such events could lead to lost future sales and adversely affect our results of operations 
changes in federal  state or local laws and regulations  or our failure to comply with such laws and regulations  could increase our expenses and expose us to legal risks 
our business is subject to a wide array of laws and regulations 
significant legislative changes that impact our relationship with our workforce none of which is represented by unions as of the end of could increase our expenses and adversely affect our operations 
examples of possible legislative changes impacting our relationship with our workforce include changes to an employer s obligation to recognize collective bargaining units  the process by which collective bargaining agreements are negotiated or imposed  minimum wage requirements  and health care mandates 
in addition  certain aspects of our business  such as our pharmacy and credit card operations  are more heavily regulated than other areas 
changes in the regulatory environment regarding topics such as banking and consumer credit  medicare reimbursements  privacy and information security  product safety or environmental protection  among others  could cause our expenses to increase 
in addition  if we fail to comply with applicable laws and regulations  particularly wage and hour laws  we could be subject to legal risk  including government enforcement action and class action civil litigation  which could adversely affect our results of operations 
given the geographic concentration of our stores  natural disasters could adversely affect our results of operations 
our three largest states  by total sales  are california  texas and florida  areas where hurricanes and earthquakes are prevalent 
such events could result in significant physical damage to or closure of one or more of our stores or distribution centers  and cause delays in the distribution of merchandise from our vendors to our distribution centers and stores  which could adversely affect our results of operations 
changes in our effective income tax rate could affect our results of operations 
our effective income tax rate is influenced by a number of factors  including statutory tax rates  the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities  and  due to the method by which we economically hedge our deferred compensation liabilities  changes in capital market returns 
changes in the tax laws  the interpretation of existing laws  or our failure to sustain our reporting positions on examination could adversely affect our effective tax rate 
in addition  our effective income tax rate bears an inverse relationship to capital market returns due principally to our use of company owned life insurance as an investment vehicle to economically hedge our deferred compensation liabilities 
if we are unable to access the capital markets or obtain bank credit  our growth plans  liquidity and results of operations could suffer 
we are dependent on a stable  liquid and well functioning financial system to fund our operations and growth plans 
in particular  we have historically relied on the public debt markets to raise capital for new store development and other capital expenditures  the commercial paper market and bank credit facilities to fund seasonal needs for working capital  and the asset backed securities markets to partially fund our accounts receivable portfolio 
in addition  we use a variety of derivative products to manage our exposure to market risk  principally interest rate and equity price fluctuations 
disruptions or turmoil in the financial markets could adversely affect our ability to meet our capital requirements  fund our working capital needs or lead to losses on derivative positions resulting from counterparty failures
