in addition  the company s infrastructure segment produces large diameter steel tubing and railroad signaling structures  and provides outsourced manufacturing and production services for other companies 
key factors which impact demand for the company s irrigation products include agricultural commodity prices  crop yields  weather  environmental regulations  availability of financing and interest rates 
significantly lower crop prices  lower us department of agriculture usda projected net farm income  and declining farmer sentiment created unfavorable market conditions for domestic irrigation equipment sales during fiscal international sales were primarily influenced by the same factors affecting the domestic market 
a key factor which impacts demand for the company s infrastructure products is the amount of spending authorized by governments to improve road and highway systems 
much of the us highway infrastructure market is driven by government spending programs 
for example  the us government funds highway and road improvements through the federal highway program 
this program provides funding to improve the nation s roadway system

in reaching such decisions  management applies judgment based on its understanding and analysis of the relevant facts and circumstances 
certain of the company s accounting policies are critical  as these policies are most important to the presentation of the company s consolidated results of operations and financial condition 
they require the greatest use of judgments and estimates by management based on the company s historical experience and management s knowledge and understanding of current facts and circumstances

results of operations the following fiscal compared to fiscal and the fiscal compared to fiscal sections present an analysis of the company s consolidated operating results displayed in the consolidated statements of operations and should be read together with the industry segment information in note r to the consolidated financial statements 
fiscal compared to fiscal the following table provides highlights for fiscal compared with fiscal for the years ended percent august  increase in thousands decrease consolidated operating revenues cost of operating revenues gross profit gross margin operating expenses operating income operating margin interest expense interest income other income expense  net income tax provision effective income tax rate net earnings irrigation equipment segment see note r operating revenues operating income operating margin infrastructure products segment operating revenues operating income operating margin includes million and million of unallocated general and administrative expenses for fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
excludes unallocated corporate general and administrative expenses 
beginning in fiscal  segment specific general administrative expenses have been allocated to each of the company s reporting segments 
prior year disclosures have been modified accordingly 
revenues operating revenues for fiscal decreased by million or from fiscal this decrease was attributable to a decrease in irrigation equipment revenues and a decrease in infrastructure product revenues 
domestic irrigation revenues decreased million or compared to fiscal the decline in domestic irrigation equipment revenues was mostly due to a decline in the number of systems shipped compared to fiscal the company has generally not reduced prices for its irrigation equipment in order to maintain sales volume or market share 
near record projected harvests have continued to keep commodity prices lower than last year 

table of contents commodity prices for corn  soybeans  and wheat were lower when compared to the same time last year 
usda projections for net farm income show a decline when compared to estimates and below the ten year average 
throughout the traditional selling season in fiscal  and in the typically slower fourth quarter  farmers remained cautious about making investments in capital goods 
international irrigation revenues decreased million or compared to fiscal export shipments decreased to australia  central america  mexico and the mideast  but were partially offset by increased exports to china 
the net decrease in export irrigation sales was driven by general economic conditions  lower commodity prices and funding availability in developing markets 
revenue from the company s international irrigation business units in brazil  south africa  and france were also significantly lower as compared to fiscal for similar reasons 
while global farmer sentiment regarding capital goods purchases was impacted by general economic conditions and lower commodity prices  the long term market drivers remain positive 
a growing world wide population  the benefits of mechanized irrigation in expanding yields and improving water use efficiencies remain a very compelling proposition for farmers infrastructure products segment revenues decreased by million or compared to the prior fiscal year 
the decrease in infrastructure revenues is primarily attributable to revenues decreasing approximately and in the company s bsi and diversified manufacturing business units  respectively 
the decrease in revenues for bsi was due to lower sales of moveable barrier projects compared to fiscal while bsi had anticipated significant revenues in from an order for a large road project in mexico city  this project was delayed and is now expected to generate those revenues in fiscal road infrastructure projects from federal stimulus funds have been implemented  but it appears that those projects have had minimal incremental effect on demand as states have faced reduced tax revenues  resulting in curtailing other planned infrastructure projects 
in addition  the early stimulus funds have been applied to shovel ready maintenance projects  versus more significant road widening or new road construction projects  which are more likely to use the company s moveable barrier and crash cushion products 
the decrease in revenues for the diversified manufacturing business unit was due to lower sales of tubing to manufacturers of grain handling equipment  also affected by farmers sentiment regarding equipment purchases 
diversified manufacturing revenues were also lower on shipments of railroad signaling structures sold to ge transportation systems 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  the company purchased this product line from ge transportation systems and is transitioning from contract manufacturing these products to direct sales to the railroads 
as this change is fully implemented  the company s management expects this to improve gross margins in the diversified manufacturing business unit 
gross margin gross profit was million for fiscal a decrease of million compared to fiscal gross margin was for fiscal compared to for the prior fiscal year 
manufacturing efficiency decreased on irrigation products during fiscal resulting from significantly reduced factory volume 
gross margin on infrastructure products decreased primarily as a result of unfavorable product mix  manufacturing variances on lower volume  and higher steel costs 
operating expenses the company s operating expenses of million for fiscal decreased million as compared to fiscal the decrease in operating expenses for fiscal was primarily attributable to lower personnel related costs 
interest  other income expense  net interest expense for fiscal of million decreased by million compared to the prior fiscal year

this primarily resulted from foreign currency transaction losses realized from the volatility of exchange rates during fiscal taxes the company recorded income tax expense of million and million for fiscal and  respectively 
the effective tax rate was and for fiscal and  respectively 
the effective tax rate for the fiscal year was lower than the us statutory tax rate primarily due to three items that reduced income tax expense for the period 
the first item was a benefit of million due to the reversal of previously 
table of contents recorded liabilities for uncertain tax positions relating to taxation of the company s brazilian subsidiary 
this reversal was recorded due to the expiration of the statute of limitations without any actual tax liability being assessed 
the second item was a benefit of million resulting from finalizing the fiscal income tax return calculation that was less than the estimated fiscal income tax provision 
the third item was a benefit of million related to the section domestic production activities deduction 
net earnings net earnings were million or per diluted share for fiscal compared with million or per diluted share for the same prior year period 
the company s operating income fell to million for fiscal compared to million for fiscal due primarily to a decline in revenues and in gross margins  which were partially offset by lower operating costs

revenues operating revenues for fiscal increased by million or from fiscal this increase was attributable to a increase in irrigation equipment revenues and a increase in infrastructure product revenues 
domestic irrigation revenues increased million or over fiscal the increase in revenues was a result of increased volume and price increases implemented throughout the year  triggered by rising input costs 
even though unit prices increased  overall demand in the us irrigation market remained strong as a result of higher crop prices and improved usda projected net farm income 
the company experienced robust demand for its irrigation 
table of contents equipment  driven by high economic returns for farmers  global food requirements  biofuel demand  agricultural development  and water use efficiency demands 
international irrigation revenues increased million or over fiscal  with the most significant demand growth in australia  brazil  china  latin america and europe 
higher commodity prices and expanded agricultural development in many regions had increased the demand for the company s yield enhancing irrigation systems 
the continued need to improve farm efficiency in food production has driven the expansion of the mechanized irrigation market globally 
infrastructure products segment revenues increased by million or compared to fiscal the increased infrastructure revenues are attributable to bsi s range of crash cushions and moveable barrier products  the diversified manufacturing business and snoline 
fiscal year includes a full year of snoline s financial results while fiscal included only eight months of snoline results 
the company expanded its presence in crash cushions and other road safety products in europe through its snoline subsidiary 
gross margin gross margin was for fiscal compared to for the prior fiscal year 
the gross margin improvement was primarily a result of a continuation of improved irrigation margins 
while gross margin improved on irrigation products compared to the prior fiscal year  gross margin on infrastructure products decreased  primarily as a result of unfavorable product mix  manufacturing variances  and higher steel costs 
the company s on going cost reduction process and lean manufacturing initiatives  coupled with pricing discipline and strong equipment demand allowed the company to achieve higher efficiency in its lindsay  nebraska factory 
operating expenses the company s operating expenses for fiscal increased million or over the prior year

the increase in interest expense was primarily due to the borrowings incurred to finance the acquisitions of snoline and watertronics 
interest income for fiscal of million decreased million from fiscal primarily due to the company s lower interest bearing deposits and bond balances compared to the prior year 
interest bearing deposits were lower due to the working capital needs of the business 
taxes the effective tax rate for fiscal was comparable to the effective tax rate for fiscal the company s effective tax rate of for fiscal was higher than the us statutory tax rate primarily due to state  local and foreign taxes 
these items were partially offset by federal tax exempt interest income on the investment portfolio  the section domestic production activities deduction  a reduction in the tax rate for deferred tax items and other tax credits 
the effective tax rate was also reduced by a correction of previously recorded tax expense related to section m of the internal revenue code  which resulted in a million or per diluted share reduction to fiscal income tax expense 
net earnings net earnings were million  or per diluted share  for fiscal  compared with million  or per diluted share  for fiscal liquidity and capital resources the company requires cash for financing its receivables and inventories  paying operating costs and capital expenditures  and for dividends

the company s management expects to obtain a similar line of credit prior to termination 
the company also has two term loan arrangements that it used to finance previous acquisitions 
the company entered into an unsecured million term note and credit agreement  each effective as of june   with wells fargo bank  na collectively  the bsi term note to partially finance the acquisition of bsi 
borrowings under the bsi term note bear interest at a rate equal to libor plus basis points 
however  this variable interest rate has been converted to a fixed rate of through an interest rate swap agreement with the lender 
principal is repaid quarterly in equal payments of million over a seven year period that commenced in september  the bsi term note is due in june of on december   the company entered into an unsecured million seven year term note and credit agreement the snoline term note with wells fargo bank  na in conjunction with the acquisition of snoline

upon the occurrence of any event of default of these covenants specified in the notes  including a change in control of the company as defined in the notes  all amounts due under the notes may be declared to be immediately due and payable 
at august   the company was in compliance with all loan covenants 
the risk of receivable collectability has increased as global economic conditions have softened 
in response  the company continuously monitors the receivable portfolio and takes aggressive collection actions when required 
in light of the ongoing significant changes in credit market liquidity and the general slowdown in the global economy  the company still believes its current cash resources  projected operating cash flow  and remaining capacity under its bank lines of credit are sufficient to cover all of its expected working capital needs  planned capital expenditures  dividends  and other cash requirements  excluding potential acquisitions 
cash flows provided by operations totaled million during the fiscal year ended august  compared to million provided by operations during the same prior year period 
cash provided by operations improved million due to a decrease in cash used for working capital items resulting from lower business activities  and an increase in cash provided by noncurrent assets and liabilities  partially offset by a decrease in cash provided from net income

inflation the company is subject to the effects of changing prices 
during fiscal  the company experienced volatility in pricing for purchases of certain commodities  in particular steel and zinc products  used in the production of its products 
while the cost outlook for commodities used in the production of the company s products is not certain  management believes it can manage these inflationary pressures by introducing appropriate sales price adjustments and by actively pursuing internal cost reduction efforts  while further refining the company s inventory and raw materials risk management system 
however  competitive market pressures may affect the company s ability to pass price adjustments along to its customers 
contractual obligations and commercial commitments in the normal course of business  the company enters into contracts and commitments which obligate the company to make future payments 
the table below sets forth the company s significant future obligations by time period 
where applicable  information included in the company s consolidated financial statements and notes is cross referenced in this table

market conditions and fiscal outlook during the first quarter of fiscal  the economic recession significantly affected farmers sentiment regarding capital investments  resulting in a dramatic decrease in irrigation equipment demand in the us market  shortly followed by a similar decrease in the international markets 
the september usda projections for net farm income show a decline when compared to the estimate and below the ten year average 
farmers have been driven to analyze their production costs and capital investments carefully and have remained cautious throughout the year awaiting clearer indications of improving farm economics 
in the us market  farmers typically purchase irrigation equipment in the late winter or early spring  in advance of planting 
because of that seasonal buying pattern and heavy dependence on the us market  the outlook for fiscal year remains uncertain at this time 
however  in the long term  as farmers become more confident in their income potential  the company expects to see increased investment in improving farm efficiency 
in the infrastructure segment  additional projects have resulted from the federal stimulus package  however  future projects may be impacted by the uncertainty surrounding the passage of a new federal highway bill 
as a result  demand for the company s road safety products remains unclear at this time 
in the long term  the company believes that the federal program provides a solid platform for growth in the us market and that additional funding will be required for infrastructure development and maintenance in the future 
while the company has responded to the contracted market activities with reductions in its workforce and overall spending in all of its operations  it expects that it will be able to meet demand as markets improve 
as of august   the company had an order backlog of million compared with million at august  the backlog at august   includes approximately million of quick move barrier for the 
table of contents previously disclosed road project in mexico city 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  the initial deposit was received for the mexico city road project and work started on the project 
the global drivers of increasing food production  improving water use efficiency  expanding biofuel production  expanding interest in reducing environmental impacts and improving transportation infrastructure  continue to be drivers of demand for the company s products and the company believes that its current financial resources and capabilities are sufficient to weather the current economic instability 
in addition  the company s focus on improving cash flow has resulted in increasing cash and cash equivalents by million to million compared with the prior year 
the company also reduced debt by million over the same period 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company uses certain financial derivatives in accordance with its policies to mitigate its exposure to volatility in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 
the company uses these derivative instruments to hedge exposures in the ordinary course of business and does not invest in derivative instruments for speculative purposes 
the company also monitors counter party credit risk associated with its derivative instruments 
the counter party credit risk under these interest rate and foreign currency agreements is not considered to be significant 
the company has manufacturing operations in the united states  france  brazil  italy  south africa and china 
the company has sold products throughout the world and purchases certain of its components from third party international suppliers 
export sales made from the united states are principally us dollar denominated 
in addition  a majority of the company s revenue generated from operations outside the united states is denominated in local currency 
accordingly  these sales are not subject to significant foreign currency transaction risk 
at times  export sales may be denominated in a currency other than the us dollar 
the company s most significant transactional foreign currency exposures are the euro  the brazilian real  south african rand and chinese renminbi in relation to the us dollar 
fluctuations in the value of foreign currencies create exposures  which can adversely affect the company s results of operations 
in order to reduce exposures related to changes in foreign currency exchange rates  the company  at times  may enter into forward exchange or option contracts for transactions denominated in a currency other than the functional currency for certain of the company s operations 
this activity primarily relates to economically hedging against foreign currency risk in sales of finished goods and future settlement of foreign denominated assets and liabilities 
in order to reduce translation exposure resulting from translating the financial statements of its international subsidiaries into us dollars  the company  at times  utilizes euro foreign currency forward contracts to hedge its euro net investment exposure in its foreign operations 
during the first quarter of its fiscal  the company settled its one outstanding euro foreign currency forward contract for an after tax gain of million which was included in other comprehensive income as part of the currency translation adjustment  net of tax 
this foreign currency forward contract qualified as a hedge of net investments in foreign operations 
at august   the company had no outstanding euro foreign currency forward contracts designated as hedges of net investments in foreign operations 
in order to reduce interest rate risk on the million bsi term note  the company has entered into an interest rate swap agreement with wells fargo bank  na that is designed to convert the variable interest rate on the entire amount of this borrowing to a fixed rate of per annum 
under the terms of the interest rate swap  the company receives variable interest rate payments and makes fixed interest rate payments on an amount equal to the outstanding balance of the bsi term note  thereby creating the equivalent of fixed rate debt 
similarly  the company entered into a cross currency swap transaction fixing the conversion rate of euros to us dollars for the snoline term note at and obligating the company to make quarterly payments of million euros per quarter over the same seven year period as the snoline term note and to receive payments of million per quarter 
in addition  the variable interest rate was converted to a fixed rate of 
this is approximately equivalent to converting the million seven year snoline term note into a million euro seven year term note at a fixed rate of 
under the terms of the cross currency swap  the company receives variable interest rate payments and makes fixed interest rate payments  thereby creating the equivalent of fixed rate debt
