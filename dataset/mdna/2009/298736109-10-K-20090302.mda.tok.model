table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations company overview  geographic locations and principal products and services euronet worldwide  inc together with our subsidiaries  we  us  euronet or the company is a leading electronic payments provider  offering automated teller machine atm  point of sale pos and card outsourcing services  card issuing and merchant acquiring services  integrated electronic financial transaction eft software  network gateways  electronic distribution of top up services for prepaid mobile airtime and other prepaid products  electronic consumer money transfer and bill payment services to financial institutions  mobile operators  retailers and individual customers 
as of december   we operate in the following three principal business segments an eft processing segment  which processes transactions for a network of  atms and approximately  pos terminals across europe  the middle east and asia pacific 
we provide comprehensive electronic payment solutions consisting of atm network participation  outsourced atm and pos management solutions  credit and debit card outsourcing and electronic recharge services for prepaid mobile airtime 
through this segment  we also offer a suite of integrated eft software solutions for electronic payment and transaction delivery systems 
a prepaid processing segment  which provides electronic distribution of prepaid mobile airtime and other prepaid products and collection services for various prepaid products  cards and services 
including terminals operated by unconsolidated subsidiaries  we operate a network of approximately  pos terminals providing electronic processing of prepaid mobile airtime top up services in europe  the middle east  asia pacific and north america 
a money transfer segment  which provides global consumer to consumer money transfer services through a sending network of agents and company owned stores primarily in north america and europe  disbursing money transfers through a worldwide payer network 
the money transfer segment originates and terminates transactions through a network of approximately  locations  which include sending agents and company owned stores  and an extensive payer network in more than countries 
we have five processing centers in europe  two in asia pacific and two in north america 
we have principal offices in europe  one in the middle east  five in asia pacific  and six in north america 
our executive offices are located in leawood  kansas  usa 
with approximately of our revenues denominated in currencies other than the us dollar  any significant changes in currency exchange rates will likely have a significant impact on our growth in revenues  operating income and diluted earnings per share for more discussion  see item a risk factors and item a quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk sources of revenues and cash flow euronet earns revenues and income based on atm management fees  transaction fees and commissions  professional services  software licensing fees and software maintenance agreements 
each business segment s sources of revenue are described below 
eft processing segment revenue in the eft processing segment  which represented approximately of total consolidated revenue for the year ended december   is derived from fees charged for transactions effected by cardholders on our proprietary network of atms  as well as fixed management fees and transaction fees we charge to banks for operating atms and processing credit cards under outsourcing agreements 
through our proprietary network  we generally charge fees for four types of atm transactions i cash withdrawals  ii balance inquiries  iii transactions not completed because the relevant card issuer does not give authorization  and iv prepaid telecommunication recharges 
revenue in this segment is also derived from license fees  professional services and maintenance fees for software and sales of related hardware 
software license fees are the fees we charge to license our proprietary application software to customers 
professional service fees consist of charges for customization  installation and consulting services to customers 
software maintenance revenue represents the ongoing fees charged for maintenance and support for customers software products 
hardware sales are derived from the sale of computer equipment necessary for the respective software solution 
prepaid processing segment revenue in the prepaid processing segment  which represented approximately of total consolidated revenue for the year ended december   is primarily derived from commissions or processing fees received from telecommunications service providers for the sale and distribution of prepaid mobile airtime 
we also generate revenue from commissions earned from the distribution of other prepaid products 
due to certain provisions in our mobile phone operator agreements  the operators have the ability to reduce the overall commission paid on each top up transaction 
however  by virtue of our agreements with retailers distributors where pos terminals are located in certain markets  not all of these reductions are absorbed by us because we are able to pass a significant portion of the reductions to retailers 
accordingly  under certain retailer agreements  the effect is to reduce revenues and reduce our direct operating costs resulting in only a small impact on gross margin and operating income 
in some markets  reductions in commissions can significantly impact our results as it may not be possible  either contractually or commercially in the concerned market  to pass a reduction in commissions to the retailers 
in australia  certain retailers negotiate 
table of contents directly with the mobile phone operators for their own commission rates  which also limits our ability to pass through reductions in commissions 
agreements with mobile operators are important to the success of our business 
these agreements permit us to distribute prepaid mobile airtime to the mobile operators customers 
other products offered by this segment include prepaid long distance calling card plans  prepaid internet plans  prepaid debit cards  prepaid gift cards  bill payment  money transfer and prepaid mobile content such as music  ringtones and games 
money transfer segment revenue in the money transfer segment  which represents approximately of total consolidated revenue for the year ended december   is primarily derived through the charging of a transaction fee  as well as the difference between purchasing foreign currency at wholesale exchange rates and selling the foreign currency to consumers at retail exchange rates 
we have an origination network in place comprised of agents and company owned stores primarily in north america and europe and a worldwide network of distribution agents  consisting primarily of financial institutions in the transfer destination countries 
origination and distribution agents each earn fees for cash collection and distribution services 
these fees are recognized as direct operating costs at the time of sale 
opportunities and challenges our expansion plans and opportunities are focused on five primary areas signing new outsourced atm and pos terminal management contracts  increasing transactions processed on our network of owned and operated atms  expansion of our prepaid mobile airtime top up processing network  expansion of our money transfer and bill payment network  and development of our credit and debit card outsourcing business 
eft processing segment the continued expansion and development of our eft processing segment business will depend on various factors including  but not necessarily limited to  the following the impact of competition by banks and other atm operators and service providers in our current target markets  the demand for our atm outsourcing services in our current target markets  the ability to develop products or services to drive increases in transactions  the expansion of our various business lines in markets where we operate and in new markets  the entrance into additional card acceptance and atm management agreements with banks  the ability to obtain required licenses in markets we intend to enter or expand services  the availability of financing for expansion  the ability to efficiently install atms contracted under newly awarded outsourcing agreements  the ability to renew existing contracts at profitable rates  the ability to expand and sign additional customers for the cross border merchant processing and acquiring business  and the continued development and implementation of our software products and their ability to interact with other leading products 
we consistently evaluate and add prospects to our list of potential atm outsource customers 
however  we cannot predict the increase or decrease in the number of atms we manage under outsourcing agreements because this depends largely on the willingness of banks to enter into outsourcing contracts with us 
due to the thorough internal reviews and extensive negotiations conducted by existing and prospective banking customers in choosing outsource vendors  the process of entering into or renewing outsourcing agreements can take approximately six to twelve months or longer 
the process is further complicated by the legal and regulatory considerations of local countries 
these agreements tend to cover large numbers of atms  so significant increases and decreases in our pool of managed atms could result from acquisition or termination of these management contracts 
therefore  the timing of both current and new contract revenues is uncertain and unpredictable 
software products are an integral part of our product lines  and our investment in research  development  delivery and customer support reflects our ongoing commitment to an expanded customer base 
we have been able to enter into agreements under which we contribute the right to use our software in lieu of cash as our initial capital contributions to new transaction processing joint ventures 
such contributions sometimes permit us to enter new markets without significant capital investment 
we have entered the cross border merchant processing and acquiring business through the execution of an agreement with a large petrol retailer in central europe 
since the beginning of  we have devoted significant resources to the development of the necessary processing systems and capabilities to enter this business  which involves the purchase and design of hardware and software 
merchant acquiring involves processing credit and debit card transactions that are made on pos terminals  including authorization  settlement  and processing of settlement files 
it generally involves the assumption of credit risk  as the principal amount of transactions is usually settled to merchants before settlements are received from card associations 

table of contents prepaid processing segment the continued expansion and development of the prepaid processing segment business will depend on various factors  including  but not necessarily limited to  the following the ability to negotiate new agreements in additional markets with mobile phone operators  agent financial institutions and retailers  the ability to use existing expertise and relationships with mobile operators and retailers to our advantage  the continuation of the trend towards conversion from scratch card solutions to electronic processing solutions for prepaid mobile airtime among mobile phone users  and the continued use of third party providers such as ourselves to supply this service  the development of mobile phone networks in the markets in which we do business and the increase in the number of mobile phone users  the overall pace of growth in the prepaid mobile phone market  our market share of the retail distribution capacity  the level of commission that is paid to the various intermediaries in the prepaid mobile airtime distribution chain  our ability to add new and differentiated prepaid products in addition to those offered by mobile operators  the ability to take advantage of cross selling opportunities with our money transfer segment  including providing money transfer services through our prepaid locations  and the availability of financing for further expansion 
in mature markets  such as the uk  new zealand and spain  the conversion from scratch cards to electronic forms of distribution is either complete or nearing completion 
because of this factor  we are not likely to experience the organic increases in the number of transactions per terminal that we have experienced historically 
also in mature markets  competition among prepaid distributors results in the increase of commissions paid to retailers and increases in retailer attrition rates 
the combined impact of these factors in developed markets is a flattening of growth in the revenues and profits that we earn 
in other markets in which we operate  such as poland  germany and the us  many of the factors that may contribute to rapid growth conversion from scratch cards to electronic distribution  growth in the prepaid market  expansion of our network of retailers and access to all mobile operators products remain present 
in australia  our main competitor ceased business during  allowing us to strengthen our position in this key market 
money transfer segment the expansion and development of our money transfer business will depend on various factors  including  but not necessarily limited to  the following the continued growth in worker migration and employment opportunities  the mitigation of economic and political factors that have had an adverse impact on money transfer volumes  such as changes in the economic sectors in which immigrants work and the developments in immigration policies in the us  the continuation of the trend of increased use of electronic money transfer and bill payment services among immigrant workers and the unbanked population in our markets  the ability to maintain our agent and correspondent networks  the ability to offer our products and services or develop new products and services at competitive prices to drive increases in transactions  the expansion of our services in markets where we operate and in new markets  the ability to strengthen our brands  our ability to fund working capital requirements  our ability to maintain compliance with the regulatory requirements of the jurisdictions in which we operate or plan to operate  the ability to take advantage of cross selling opportunities with the prepaid processing segment  including providing prepaid services through ria s stores and agents worldwide  the ability to leverage our banking and merchant retailer relationships to expand money transfer corridors to europe and asia  including high growth corridors to central and eastern european countries  the availability of financing for further expansion  and our ability to continue to successfully integrate ria with our other operations 
like other participants in the money transfer industry  as a result of immigration developments  downturns in certain labor markets and the current economic crisis  the number of money transfers from the us to mexico decreased in compared to we cannot predict how long these issues will continue to affect the us market or whether other markets will experience similar issues 
corporate services  eliminations and other in addition to operating in our principal business segments described above  our corporate services  elimination and other division includes non operating activity  certain inter segment eliminations and the cost of providing corporate and other administrative services to the business segments  including share based compensation expense related to most stock option and restricted stock grants 
these services are not directly identifiable with our business segments 

table of contents the accounting policies of each segment are the same as those referenced in the summary of significant accounting policies see note  summary of significant accounting policies and practices  to the consolidated financial statements 
we evaluate performance of our segments based on income or loss from continuing operations before income taxes  foreign currency exchange gain loss  minority interest and other nonrecurring gains and losses 
for all segments  our continued expansion may involve additional acquisitions that could divert our resources and management time and require integration of new assets with our existing networks and services 
our ability to effectively manage our rapid growth has required us to expand our operating systems and employee base  particularly at the management level  which has added incremental operating costs 
an inability to continue to effectively manage expansion could have a material adverse effect on our business  growth  financial condition or results of operations 
inadequate technology and resources would impair our ability to maintain current processing technology and efficiencies  as well as deliver new and innovative services to compete in the marketplace 
segment revenues and operating income loss for the years ended december   and revenues operating income loss in thousands eft processing prepaid processing money transfer total corporate services total summary our annual consolidated revenues increased by for over  and for over these increases reflect acquisitions  primarily ria in april  as well as growth in our business resulting from increases in the average number of atms managed and transactions processed 
for further discussion regarding acquisitions  see note  acquisitions  to the consolidated financial statements 
our operating income for includes a non cash goodwill and intangible asset impairment charge of million as discussed in note  goodwill and acquired intangible assets  net  to the consolidated financial statements 
the results for include an increase in operating income of million for a federal excise tax refund discussed in note  federal excise tax refund  to the consolidated financial statements 
excluding the goodwill and intangible assets impairment charge in and the federal excise tax refund in  our operating income increased for over and for over these increases were primarily the result of growth in transaction volumes and related revenues 
net loss for was million  or per diluted share  compared to net income for of million  or per diluted share  and net income of million  or per diluted share for in addition to the explanations above  net loss for included an million impairment loss on investment securities and a foreign currency exchange translation loss of million  while net income for and included foreign currency exchange translation gains of million and million  respectively 
net loss for includes a loss from discontinued operations of million  or per diluted share while net income for and include gains from discontinued operations of million and million  respectively  or per diluted share for each year 
impact of changes in foreign currency exchange rates beginning in and through mid  the us dollar weakened compared to most of the currencies of the countries in which we operate 
in the second half of  the us dollar strengthened significantly 
despite the recent strengthening  the us dollar was  on average  weaker in than in because our revenues and local expenses are recorded in the functional currencies of our operating entities  amounts we earned for and are positively impacted by the weakening of the us dollar 
we estimate that  depending on the mix of countries and currencies  our and operating income benefited by approximately to when compared to and  respectively 
while the benefit of the weakened us dollar generally contributed to improvements in each segment in  the benefit for was mainly concentrated in the eft processing segment  largely due to the impact of the changes in exchange rates of the polish zloty 

table of contents comparison of operating results for the years ended december   and by business segment eft processing segment compared to the following table summarizes the results of operations for the eft processing segment for the years ended december  and year ended december  year over year change increase increase decrease decrease dollar amounts in thousands amount percent total revenues operating expenses direct operating costs salaries and benefits selling  general and administrative depreciation and amortization total operating expenses operating income transactions processed millions atms as of december average atms discontinued operations during  we decided to sell euronet essentis limited essentis  a uk software entity previously included in the eft processing segment  in order to focus our investments and resources on our transactions processing businesses 
we are in the process of selling the business 
accordingly  the results of operations for essentis are shown as discontinued operations in the consolidated statements of operations for all periods presented and have been removed from the table above 
revenues our revenue for increased when compared to primarily due to increases in the average number of atms operated and the number of transactions processed 
these increases were attributable to many of our operations  but primarily our operations in poland  india and euronet card services greece 
additionally  during the us dollar was weaker on average than during relative to the currencies of most of the countries in which we operate 
because our revenues are recorded in the functional currencies of our operating entities  amounts we earn in foreign currencies are positively impacted by the weakening of the us dollar 
partly offsetting these improvements were decreases in revenue associated with our operations in romania due to a decrease in the per transaction fee structure with a customer that was granted in exchange for an extension of the contract term and the expiration of an atm services contract discussed in more detail in the following paragraph 
average monthly revenue per atm was  for  compared to  for and revenue per transaction was for both and the increase in revenues per atm is generally the result of the expiration of an atm services contract in the uk at the end of the first quarter that involved processing services only  with very little associated costs and  therefore  had lower than average revenue per atm 
as of december  and march   we were providing processing services for approximately  and  atms  respectively  under this contract 
partly offsetting this improvement is the addition of atms in china and india  where revenues per atm have been historically lower than central and eastern europe  generally due to lower labor costs 
our contracts in the eft processing segment tend to cover large numbers of atms  so significant increases and decreases in our pool of managed atms could result from entry into or termination of these management contracts 
banks have historically been very deliberate in negotiating these agreements and have evaluated a wide range of matters when deciding to choose an outsource vendor 
generally  the process of negotiating a new agreement is subject to extensive management analysis and approvals and the process 
table of contents typically takes six to twelve months or longer 
increasing consolidation in the banking industry could make this process less predictable 
our existing contracts generally have terms of five to seven years and a number of them will expire or be up for renewal each year for the next few years 
as a result  we expect to be regularly engaged in discussions with one or more of our customer banks to either obtain renewal of  or restructure  our atm outsourcing agreements 
during the fourth quarter and first quarter  certain customer contracts were terminated or expired  resulting in a decrease of atms in the fourth quarter and approximately  atms in the first quarter most of the atm reductions resulted from bank customers shifting their processing to related processing subsidiaries in contemplation of selling the subsidiaries to raise capital  rather than the loss of contracts to competitors 
the reduction in the number of atms from contract terminations or expirations was partially offset by increases in atms driven under new contracts  expansion of atms under existing contracts and the deployment of atms in markets where we operate euronet branded atms 
for contracts that we are able to renew  as was the case for contract renewals in romania and greece in prior years  we expect customers to seek rate concessions or up front payments because of the greater availability of alternative processing solutions in many of our markets now  as compared to when we entered into the contracts 
we have been able to renew or extend most of the remaining contracts that came up for renewal in or expiration in while we have been successful in many cases in obtaining new terms that preserve the same level of earnings arising from the agreements  we have not been successful in all cases  and therefore we expect to experience reductions in revenue in future quarters arising from the expiration or restructuring of agreements 
for the contracts that expired during the fourth quarter and first quarter  excluding substantial termination fees that we expect to receive  we estimate that the impact to will be a reduction in revenue of approximately million to million  resulting in reduced operating income of approximately million to million 
we cannot be sure we will have sufficient revenues from new contracts to offset potential revenue reductions from expired or restructured agreements 
direct operating costs direct operating costs consist primarily of site rental fees  cash delivery costs  cash supply costs  maintenance  insurance  telecommunications and the cost of data center operations related personnel  as well as the processing centers facility related costs and other processing center related expenses 
the increase in direct operating cost for  compared to  is attributed to the increase in the average number of atms under operation  particularly the growing number of independently deployed atms in new markets  and the launch of our cross border merchant acquiring business 
throughout and into  we incurred substantial capital and operating expenditures in anticipation of entering the cross border merchant acquiring business after we entered into an agreement for these services with a large petrol retailer in central europe 
the revenues recorded after launching this business in mid have not been significant  however  the cost structure is largely in place and is contributing to the increase in direct operating costs and certain other expenses discussed below 
additionally  and include losses of approximately million and million  respectively  primarily in poland and hungary  as a result of certain fraudulent transactions by card holders on our network 
gross profit gross profit  which is calculated as revenues less direct operating costs  increased to million for from million for this increase is mainly attributable to the increase in revenues discussed above 
gross profit as a percentage of revenues gross margin was for compared to for the decrease in gross margin is primarily due to the impact of the expiration of the atm services contract in the uk and launching the cross border merchant acquiring business 
salaries and benefits the increase in salaries and benefits for compared to was due to staffing costs to support growth in the average number of atms managed and transactions processed and for new products  such as pos  card processing and cross border merchant processing and acquiring 
salaries and benefits also increased as a result of general merit increases awarded to employees 
as a percentage of revenue  however  these costs decreased slightly to of revenues for compared to for selling  general and administrative selling  general and administrative expenses for include a million arbitration loss awarded by a tribunal in budapest  hungary arising from a claim by a former cash supply contractor in central europe 
excluding the impact of the arbitration loss  as a percentage of revenues  selling general and administrative expenses increased to in compared to in this increase in selling  general and administrative expenses for compared to is due primarily to the launch of our cross border merchant acquiring business that occurred during the second quarter as explained above  the revenues recorded after launching this business have not been significant  however  the cost structure is in place to support this new business 
depreciation and amortization the increase in depreciation and amortization expense for compared to is due primarily to additional atms in poland and india and additional equipment and software for our processing centers in hungary and china 
as a percentage of revenue  these expenses remained flat at for both and operating income the increase in operating income was primarily due to the increases in revenues described above 
additionally  operating income was affected by several unique items in and operating income was reduced million by the arbitration loss described above  operating income was million greater in compared to due to the decrease in fraudulent card losses described

as of december   we had deployed and were providing all of the day to day outsourcing services for atms 
under current agreements  we expect that the total number of atms in china deployed and for which we will be providing day to day outsourcing services will increase to over  during the next months 
software sales backlog as of december  and  the eft segment had a software contract backlog of approximately million compared to approximately million as of december  this backlog represents software sales based on signed contracts under which we continue to have performance milestones before the sale will be completed 
we recognize revenue on a percentage of completion method  based on certain milestone conditions  for our software solutions 
as a result  we have not recognized all the revenues associated with these sales contracts 
we cannot give assurances that the milestones under the contracts will be completed or that we will be able to recognize the related revenue within the next year

these increases were attributable to most of our operations  but primarily our operations in poland  india and greece and our software operations 
additionally  beginning in and during  the us dollar weakened compared to the currencies of most of the countries in which we operate 
because our revenues are recorded in the functional currencies of our operating entities  amounts we earn in foreign currencies are positively impacted by the weakening of the us dollar 
partially offsetting these increases was a reduction in revenues associated with the extension of certain customer contracts for several years beyond their original terms 
in exchange for these extensions  we paid or received up front payments and agreed on gradually declining fee structures 
as prescribed by us gaap  revenue under these contracts is recognized based on proportional performance of services over the term of the contract  which generally results in straight line ie  consistent value per period revenue recognition of the contracts total cash flows  including any up front payment 
this straight line revenue recognition results in revenue that is less than contractual invoices and cash receipts in the early periods of the agreement and revenue that is greater than the contractual invoices and cash receipts in the later years of the agreement 
as a result of the revenue recognition under these contracts  amounts invoiced under the contracts exceeded the amount of revenue that we recognized by about million for  compared to approximately million for

revenues the increase in revenues for compared to was generally attributable to the increase in total transactions processed across most of our prepaid processing segment operations  particularly australia  germany and poland 
the growth in australia has been the result of our main competitor ceasing business during  allowing us to strengthen our position in this key market 
in certain more mature markets  such as the uk  new zealand and spain  our revenue growth has slowed substantially and  in some cases  revenues have decreased because conversion from scratch cards to electronic top up is substantially complete and certain mobile operators and retailers are driving competitive reductions in pricing and margins 
we expect most of our future revenue growth to be derived from i additional products sold over the base of prepaid processing terminals  ii developing markets or markets in which there is organic growth in the prepaid sector overall  iii continued conversion from scratch cards to electronic top up in less mature markets  and iv acquisitions  if available 
revenues per transaction decreased to for from for due primarily to the growth in revenues and transactions recorded by our atx subsidiary  which is euronet owned 
in accordance with us gaap  atx is consolidated and the amounts in our financial statements and in the table above reflect of atx s results 
results attributable to the minority owner are reflected in the minority interest line of our consolidated statements of operations 
atx provides only transaction processing services without direct costs and other operating costs generally associated with installing and managing terminals  therefore  the revenue we recognize from these transactions is a fraction of that recognized on average transactions  but with very low cost 
partly offsetting this decrease was the growth in both volumes and revenues in australia which generally has higher revenues per transaction  but also pays higher commission rates to retailers  than our other prepaid processing subsidiaries 
direct operating costs direct operating costs in the prepaid processing segment include the commissions we pay to retail merchants for the distribution and sale of prepaid mobile airtime and other prepaid products  as well as expenses required to operate pos terminals 
because of their nature  these expenditures generally fluctuate directly with revenues and processed transactions 
the increase in direct operating costs is generally attributable to the increase in total transactions processed 

table of contents gross profit gross profit was million for compared to million for gross margin increased to for compared to for and gross profit per transaction was for compared to for most of the reduction in gross profit per transaction is due to the growth of revenues and transactions at our atx subsidiary and the general maturity of the prepaid mobile airtime business in many of our markets

as a percentage of revenues  these selling  general and administrative expenses remained flat at for both and goodwill impairment in  we recorded a non cash impairment charge of million related to the goodwill of the spanish prepaid business in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
we perform our annual goodwill impairment test during the fourth quarter of each year  which coincided this year with severe disruptions in the credit markets and the macroeconomic business climate 
these events have caused credit  currency and stock markets to plummet in the second half of and have adversely impacted corporate valuations across most industries  all of which contributed to a significant decline in our stock price 
an important component of the goodwill impairment testing was the reconciliation of a company s equity to its market capitalization 
during the fourth quarter and into  our total market capitalization was less than the recorded value of the company s equity by an amount approaching of recorded equity  creating a strong indicator of impairment for our goodwill balance 
because of these macroeconomic conditions  after incorporating assumptions that we or another purchaser would likely make into the company s business outlook and projections for the spanish prepaid business  we determined that the resulting valuations were not sufficient to support the recorded value of our investment 
specifically  growth in the prepaid mobile phone business in spain has been slower than expected and commission pressure from mobile operators  as well as intense competition from other prepaid processors  has reduced profitability 
any adjustment to that estimated charge resulting from the completion of the measurement of the impairment loss will be recognized in the first quarter see note  goodwill and acquired intangible assets  net  to the consolidated financial statements for a further discussion of this charge 
federal excise tax refund during  the internal revenue service irs announced that internal revenue code section relating to communications excise tax will no longer apply to  among other services  prepaid mobile airtime services such as those offered by the prepaid processing segment s us operations 
additionally  companies that paid this excise tax during the period beginning on march  and ending on july   are entitled to a credit or refund of amounts paid in conjunction with the filing of federal income tax returns 
during  million was recorded for amounts paid during this period as a reduction to operating expenses of the prepaid processing segment 
depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization expense primarily represents amortization of acquired intangibles and the depreciation of pos terminals we install in retail stores 
the increase in depreciation and amortization for compared to reflects additional pos terminals installed as the business has grown

beginning in and during  the us dollar weakened compared to most of the currencies of the countries in which we operate 
because our revenues are recorded in the functional currencies of our operating entities  amounts we earn are positively impacted by the weakening of the us dollar 
revenue growth was partially offset by reduced revenue growth in spain resulting from the second quarter expiration of a preferential commission arrangement with a spanish mobile operator 
additionally  in certain more mature markets  such as the uk  new zealand and spain  our revenue growth slowed substantially and  in some cases  revenues decreased because conversion from scratch cards to electronic top up was substantially complete and certain mobile operators and retailers were driving competitive reductions in pricing and margins 
revenues per transaction decreased to for from for due primarily to the growth in revenues and transactions recorded by our atx subsidiary 
transaction volumes for atx in increased over compared to partially offsetting the decreases described above was the growth in both volumes and revenues in australia and the us  which generally have higher revenues per transaction  but also pay higher commission rates to retailers  than our other prepaid processing subsidiaries 
direct operating costs the increase in direct operating costs was generally attributable to the increase in total transactions processed and foreign currency translations to the us dollar compared to the prior year 
gross profit gross profit  which represents revenues less direct costs  was million for compared to million for gross margin decreased to for compared to for and gross profit per transaction was for compared to for most of the reduction in gross profit per transaction was due to the growth of revenues and transactions at our atx subsidiary  the expiration of preferential commission arrangements in spain discussed above and the general maturity of the prepaid mobile airtime business in many of our markets

money transfer segment the money transfer segment was established during april with the acquisition of ria  which is more fully described in note  acquisitions  to the consolidated financial statements included in this report 
to assist in better understanding the results of the money transfer segment  unaudited pro forma results for have been provided as if ria s results were included in our consolidated results of operations beginning january  the pro forma financial information is not intended to represent  or be indicative of  the consolidated results of operations or financial condition that would have been reported had the ria acquisition been completed as of the beginning of the periods presented

comparison of pro forma operating results during  we combined our previous money transfer business with ria and incurred total exit costs of million 
these costs represented the accelerated depreciation and amortization of property and equipment  software and leasehold improvements that were 
table of contents disposed of during  the write off of marketing materials and trademarks that have been discontinued or will not be used  the write off of accounts receivable from agents that did not meet ria s credit requirements  and severance and retention payments made to certain employees 
these exit costs are not included in pro forma operating expenses in the above table 
revenues revenues from the money transfer segment include a transaction fee for each transaction as well as the difference between purchasing currency at wholesale exchange rates and selling the currency to customers at retail exchange rates 
revenue per transaction was for compared to pro forma revenue per transaction of for on a historical basis  about of our money transfer segment revenues are derived from transaction fees  about is derived from the foreign currency spread and other small amounts of revenue are derived from sources such as fees for cashing checks  issuing money orders and processing bill payments 
for  of our money transfers were initiated in the us  in europe and in other countries  such as canada and australia 
for  of our money transfers were initiated in the us  in europe and in other countries 
we expect that the us will continue to represent our highest volume market  however  significant future growth is expected to be derived from non us initiated sources 
the increase in revenues for compared to pro forma revenues for is primarily due to an increase in the number of transactions processed for compared to for  money transfers to mexico  which represented of total money transfers  decreased by  while transfers to all other countries increased when compared to the prior year due to the expansion of our operations and continued growth in immigrant worker populations in countries other than the us the decline in transfers to mexico was largely the result of immigration issues  downturns in certain labor markets and the current economic crisis 
these issues have also resulted in certain competitors lowering transaction fees and foreign currency exchange spreads in certain markets where we do business in an attempt to limit the impact on money transfer volumes 
we have generally maintained our pricing structure in response to these developments 
direct operating costs direct operating costs in the money transfer segment primarily represent commissions paid to agents that originate money transfers on our behalf and distribution agents that disburse funds to the customers destination beneficiary  together with less significant costs  such as telecommunication and bank fees to collect money from originating agents 
while direct operating costs generally increase or decrease by a similar percentage as transactions  growth in transactions has outpaced the growth in direct costs in due to a greater growth rate for company owned stores rather than for agents 
gross profit gross profit was million for compared to pro forma gross profit of million for this improvement is primarily due to the growth in money transfer transactions originated in non us locations  discussed above  along with favorable management of foreign currency exchange rate spreads 
we have not engaged in the competitive price wars in our industry that some of our competitors have initiated  choosing instead to preserve our pricing structure and service levels and maintain a more profitable customer base 
we cannot predict how long these issues will continue to affect the us market or whether other markets will experience similar issues and we cannot predict whether we will change our strategy over the short or long term in order to protect or increase market share 
gross margin was for compared to pro forma gross margin of for the improvement primarily reflects the strong growth in transaction volume in our more profitable non us locations 
salaries and benefits salaries and benefits include salaries and commissions paid to employees  the cost of providing employee benefits  amounts paid to contract workers and accruals for incentive compensation 
the increase in salaries and benefits for compared to pro forma salaries and benefits for is primarily due to merit increases and additional costs to support our global expansion efforts  primarily the opening of company owned stores in germany  france  spain and the us selling  general and administrative selling  general and administrative expenses include operations support costs  such as rent  utilities  professional fees  indirect telecommunications  advertising and other miscellaneous overhead costs 
the increase in selling  general and administrative expenses for compared to pro forma selling  general and administrative expenses for is primarily to support our global expansion efforts 

table of contents goodwill and acquired intangible assets impairment in  we recorded a non cash impairment charge of million related to certain goodwill and intangible assets of the ria money transfer business in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets and sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
we perform our annual goodwill impairment test during the fourth quarter of each year  which coincided this year with severe disruptions in the credit markets and the macroeconomic business climate 
these events have caused credit  currency and stock markets to plummet in the second half of and have adversely impacted corporate valuations across most industries  all of which contributed to a significant decline in our stock price 
an important component of the goodwill impairment testing was the reconciliation of a company s equity to its market capitalization 
during the fourth quarter and into  our total market capitalization was less than the recorded value of the company s equity by an amount approaching of recorded equity  creating a strong indicator of impairment for our goodwill balance 
because of these macroeconomic conditions  after incorporating assumptions that we or another purchaser would likely make into the business outlook and projections for the money transfer segment  we determined that the resulting valuations were not sufficient to support the recorded value of our investment 
specifically  we have experienced reductions in volumes for money transfers between the us and mexico  among other corridors  that were initially expected to continue expanding 
should the current economic crisis worsen or should other factors cause us to significantly lower our cash flow projections for our money transfer business  we will need to reassess the business for further possible impairment 
any adjustment to that estimated charge resulting from the completion of the measurement of the impairment loss will be recognized in the first quarter see note  goodwill and acquired intangible assets  net  to the consolidated financial statements for a further discussion of this charge 
depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization primarily represents amortization of acquired intangibles and also includes depreciation of money transfer terminals  computers and software  leasehold improvements and office equipment 
the increase in depreciation and amortization for compared to pro forma depreciation and amortization for is primarily due to additional computer equipment in our customer service centers and increased leasehold improvements  office equipment and computer equipment for expansion of our company owned stores 
as a percentage of revenues  depreciation and amortization was relatively flat at for compared to pro forma depreciation and amortization of for operating income the decrease in operating income for compared to pro forma operating income for is due to the goodwill and acquired intangible impairment charge in excluding this charge  operating income increased in compared to pro forma operating income for which is the result of increased revenues and gross profit as discussed in more detail above  partly offset by additional costs incurred to support our global expansion efforts 
corporate services the components of corporate services operating expenses for  and were as follows year over year change increase year ended december  increase decrease dollar amounts in thousands percent percent salaries and benefits selling  general and administrative depreciation and amortization total operating expenses operating expenses for corporate services increased by for and for compared to the respective prior year 
the increase in salaries and benefits for compared to is primarily the result of severance costs related to certain senior level positions and increased share based compensation related to awards made to new employees  including those in the money transfer segment 
the increase in selling  general and administrative expenses is due primarily to the write off of million in professional fees and settlement costs associated with our abandoned acquisition of moneygram 
the increase in corporate depreciation and amortization is the result of amortization associated with the third quarter purchase of an enterprise wide desk top license 
the decrease in salaries and benefits compensation for compared to was due primarily to lower incentive compensation accruals and the december resignation of our former president and chief operating officer 
the increase in selling  general and administrative expenses was mainly the result of higher professional fees and other expenses associated with acquisitions that were not completed  including envios de valores la nacional corp 
la nacional 
see note  litigation and contingencies  to the

the increase in corporate depreciation and amortization is the result of amortization associated with the enterprise wide desk top license 
other income expense year ended december  year over year change increase increase decrease decrease dollar amounts in thousands percent percent interest income interest expense income from unconsolidated affiliates impairment loss on investment securities  n m n m gain loss on early retirement of debt  n m n m foreign currency exchange gain loss  net total other income expense    n m n m not meaningful 
interest income the decrease in interest income for from is primarily due to a decline in short term interest rates and a decrease in average cash balances on hand during partly offsetting this decrease was the recognition of million in for interest related to a federal excise tax refund 
the increase in interest income for over was primarily due to investment of the unused proceeds from the million private equity placement that was completed during march  as well as cash generated from operations 
increasing average cash deposits held in our trust accounts related to the administration of customer collections and vendor remittance activities of the prepaid processing segment have also generated increased interest income as the segment s operations have grown 
improvements in interest income for compared to were also due to higher average interest rates resulting from a gradual shift of investments from money market accounts to commercial paper and the general rise in short term treasury rates during short term interest rates continue to be at historically low levels at the beginning of and if rates continue to be near these levels  we expect interest income earned on our invested balances for will decrease as a result 
interest expense the decrease in interest expense for from is primarily due to the reductions in borrowings from scheduled repayments and early retirements along with lower interest rates paid on floating rate debt 
we also reduced borrowings under the revolving credit facility to finance the working capital requirements of the money transfer segment 
we generally borrow amounts under the revolving credit facility several times each month to fund the correspondent network in advance of collecting remittance amounts from the agency network 
these borrowings are repaid over a very short period of time  generally within a few days 
the increase in interest expense for over was primarily related to the additional borrowings to finance the april acquisition of ria  described in note  acquisitions  to the consolidated financial statements 
additionally  we incurred borrowings under the revolving credit facility to finance the working capital requirements of the money transfer segment as described above 
the increase in interest expense was also due to higher overall interest rates on our debt obligations in compared to including amortization of deferred financing costs  interest expense on the term loan and revolving credit facility was approximately  compared to approximately for the million in outstanding convertible debentures 
similar to the impact on interest income  due to the recent trend of decreasing short term interest rates  we expect that interest paid on our floating rate borrowings for will also decrease if short term interest rates remain near their current levels 
income from unconsolidated affiliates income from unconsolidated affiliates mainly represents the equity in income of our equity investment in e pay malaysia and our investment in euronet middle east  an eft processing segment joint venture in bahrain 
the increase in income for from is the result of increased earnings from our equity investment in e pay malaysia and our share of the earnings of euronet middle 
table of contents east 
the increase is partly offset by the million gain recognized from the sale of our interest in cashnet telecommunications egypt sae cashnet during the increase in income from unconsolidated affiliates recorded for compared to was primarily because of the million gain from the sale of our interest in cashnet 
the remainder of income from unconsolidated affiliates represents the income from our investment in e pay malaysia 
during  we recognized million of equity losses related to e pay malaysia s unsuccessful expansion efforts into indonesia 
impairment loss on investment securities during  the value of our investment in moneygram declined and the decline was determined to be other than temporary 
accordingly  we recognized an million impairment loss 
gain loss on early retirement of debt during  we repurchased in privately negotiated transactions million in principal amount of the million convertible debentures due this resulted in a million pre tax gain  net of the write off of unamortized deferred financing costs 
additionally  losses on early retirement of debt of million were recorded representing the pro rata write off of deferred financing costs associated with the portion of the million term loan that was prepaid during we expect to continue to prepay amounts outstanding under the term loan and or repurchase additional outstanding convertible debentures through available cash flows 
accordingly  we would recognize losses on early retirement of debt for the pro rata portion of unamortized deferred financing costs and gains on early retirement of debt for any repurchase of the debentures at a discount to par value 
loss on early retirement of debt of million for represents the pro rata write off of deferred financing costs associated with the portion of the million term loan that was prepaid during net foreign currency exchange gain loss assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the local currency of each of our subsidiaries give rise to foreign currency exchange gains and losses 
exchange gains and losses that result from re measurement of these assets and liabilities are recorded in determining net income 
the majority of our foreign currency gains or losses are due to the re measurement of intercompany loans that are in a currency other than the functional currency of either the entity making or receiving the loan 
for example  we make intercompany loans based in euros from our corporate division  which is comprised of us dollar functional currency entities  to certain european entities that use the euro as the functional currency 
as the us dollar strengthens against the euro  foreign currency losses are generated on our corporate entities because the number of euros to be received in settlement of the loans decreases in us dollar terms 
conversely  in this example  in periods where the us dollar weakens  our corporate entities will record foreign currency gains 
we recorded a net foreign currency exchange loss of million during and net foreign currency exchange gains of million and million during and  respectively 
throughout and  the us dollar weakened against most european based currencies  primarily the euro and british pound  creating realized and unrealized foreign currency exchange gains 
this compares to  when in the latter part of the year the us dollar strengthened against these currencies and we  therefore  recorded realized and unrealized foreign currency exchange losses

our effective tax rates were  and for the years ended december   and  respectively 
there are several factors that have caused our effective tax rate to fluctuate over the past three years 
the most significant of these factors include the company s tax position in the us  the impact of foreign currency exchange translation results and  specific to the year ended december   the impairments for goodwill and acquired intangible assets and for investments securities 
excluding foreign currency exchange translation results and the impairments to goodwill and acquired intangible assets and to investment securities from pre tax income  as well as the related tax effects for these items  our effective tax rates were  and for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the increases in the effective tax rates for and compared to  excluding foreign currency gains and losses and the impairment charges  were primarily related to the recognition of income tax expense in the us during tax expense related to our us operations was offset by reductions in our valuation allowance against our us tax net operating losses 
the remaining valuation allowance against our us tax net operating losses was reversed in the and effective tax rates were also unfavorably impacted by the acquisition of ria  which operates in jurisdictions that have tax rates that are higher than our historical effective tax rate  and the recognition of significant deferred tax benefits for net operating losses in certain countries during in conjunction with the goodwill impairment test performed in the fourth quarter of  we reviewed the impact of the adverse macroeconomic business conditions and outlook  as well as business forecasts  on the realization of our net operating losses and other deferred tax assets 
based on this information  we concluded that a valuation allowance was necessary against the net deferred tax assets  including tax net operating losses  of our us and spanish operations 
we determine income tax expense and remit income taxes based upon enacted tax laws and regulations applicable in each of the taxing jurisdictions where we conduct business 
based on our interpretation of such laws and regulations  and considering the evidence of available facts and circumstances and baseline operating forecasts  we have accrued the estimated tax effects of certain transactions  business ventures  contractual and organizational structures  projected business unit performance  and the estimated future reversal of timing differences 
should a taxing jurisdiction change its laws and regulations or dispute our conclusions  or should management become aware of new facts or other evidence that could alter our conclusions  the resulting impact to our estimates could have a material adverse effect to our consolidated financial statements 
other minority interest minority interest was a benefit of million for the year ended december  and an expense of million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
minority interest represents the elimination of the net income loss attributable to the minority shareholders portion of our consolidated subsidiaries that are not wholly owned  including movilcarga  of which we own  atx  of 
table of contents which we own  our owned subsidiary in china  and e pay srl  of which we own 
the benefit in is the minority interest share of the goodwill impairment charge in spain 
discontinued operations during the second quarter of  we decided to sell essentis in order to focus our investments and resources on our transaction processing businesses 
we are in the process of selling the business 
accordingly  essentis s results of operations are shown as discontinued operations in the consolidated statements of operations for all periods presented 
in july  we sold substantially all of the non current assets and related capital lease obligations of our atm processing business in france to atos sa during the first quarter  we received a binding french supreme court decision relating to a lawsuit in france that resulted in a cash recovery and gain of million  net of legal costs 
there were no related assets or liabilities held for sale at december  or net income loss we recorded a net loss of million in compared to net income of million and million for and  respectively 
as more fully discussed above  the decrease of million in compared to was mainly the result of the million decrease in operating income driven by the million non cash goodwill and acquired intangible assets impairment charge in and the million federal excise tax refund recorded in additionally  results include an million unrealized loss on investment securities and a million increase in foreign currency losses 
furthermore  net interest expense increased million and net income from discontinued operations decreased million 
partly offsetting these losses were a million decrease in income tax expense  a million improvement in income from the net gain on early retirement of debt  a million benefit from changes in results attributed to minority interests and a million increase in income from unconsolidated affiliates 
the increase of million in over was primarily the result of an increase in operating income of million  including the federal excise tax refund of million  an increase in the net foreign currency exchange gain of million  an increase in income from unconsolidated affiliates of million and an increase in income from discontinued operations of million 
these increases were partially offset by an increase in net interest expense of million  an increase in income tax expense of million  a loss on early retirement of debt of million and an increase in income attributable to minority interest of million 
translation adjustment translation gains and losses are the result of translating our foreign entities balance sheets from local functional currency to the us dollar reporting currency prior to consolidation and are recorded in comprehensive income loss 
as required by us gaap  during this translation process  asset and liability accounts are translated at current foreign currency exchange rates and equity accounts are translated at historical rates 
historical rates represent the rates in effect when the balances in our equity accounts were originally created 
by using this mix of rates to convert the balance sheet from functional currency to us dollars  differences between current and historical exchange rates generate this translation adjustment 
we recorded a loss on translation adjustment of million in and gains on translation adjustment of million and million in and  respectively 
throughout and  the us dollar weakened against most european based currencies  primarily the euro and british pound  creating translation gains 
however  in the latter half of  the us dollar strengthened against most of those currencies  resulting in translation losses which were recorded in comprehensive income loss 
liquidity and capital resources working capital as of december   we had working capital  which is the difference between total current assets and total current liabilities  of million  compared to working capital of million as of december  our ratio of current assets to current liabilities was at december   compared to as of december  the decrease in working capital is due primarily to the use of cash to reduce long term debt and the reclassification of the remaining million in convertible senior debentures to current liabilities 
we require substantial working capital to finance operations 
the money transfer segment funds the correspondent distribution network before receiving the benefit of amounts collected from customers by agents 
working capital needs increase due to weekends and international banking holidays 
as a result  we may report more or less working capital for the money transfer segment based solely upon the fiscal period ending on a particular day 
as of december   working capital in the money transfer segment was million 
we expect that working capital needs will increase as we expand this business 
the prepaid processing segment produces positive working capital  but much of it is restricted in connection with the administration of its customer collection and vendor remittance activities  therefore  it deposits those amounts in a restricted cash account 
the eft processing segment has little working capital requirements 

table of contents operating cash flows cash flows provided by operating activities were million for  compared to million for the increase was primarily due to fluctuations in working capital  including the collection of million for the federal excise tax refund that was recognized in net income during the increase in depreciation and amortization expense that is added to net income to arrive at operating cash flows is due largely to the inclusion of ria for a full year  compared to nine months in other fluctuations in working capital are mainly the result of changes in the timing of the settlement process with mobile operators in the prepaid procesing segment around year end 
cash flows provided by operating activities decreased to million for  compared to million for  primarily due to fluctuations in working capital associated with the timing of the settlement process with mobile operators in the prepaid processing segment 
offsetting this decrease  operating cash flows also reflect an increase in net income  net of depreciation and amortization expense  and the federal excise tax refund  which was accrued in the increase in depreciation and amortization expense was primarily the result of the acquisition of ria 
investing activity cash flows cash flows used in investing activities were million for  compared to million for our investing activities for include the return of million we placed in escrow in in connection with the agreement to acquire envios de valores la nacional corp 
la nacional 
on january   we entered into a settlement agreement with la nacional and its stockholder evidencing the parties mutual agreement not to consummate the acquisition  in exchange for payment by euronet of a portion of the legal fees incurred by la nacional 
our investing activities also include million and million for the purchase of property and equipment  software development and other long term assets in and  respectively 
while our acquisitions in were million  we used million in  primarily for the acquisition of ria  and another million used to purchase moneygram common stock 
cash flows used in investing activities were million in  compared to million in our investing activities for consisted of million in cash paid related to acquisitions  primarily ria  milling for the purchase of moneygram common stock and million placed in escrow in connection with the agreement to acquire la nacional 
we also spent million for purchases of property and equipment and software development 
our investing activities for included million in cash paid for acquisitions and million for purchases of property and equipment and software development 
financing activity cash flows cash flows used for financing activities were million during  compared to cash provided of million during our financing activities for consisted primarily of net repayments of debt obligations of million 
to support the short term cash needs of our money transfer segment  we generally borrow amounts under the revolving credit facility several times each month to fund the correspondent network in advance of collecting remittance amounts from the agency network 
these borrowings are repaid over a very short period of time  generally within a few days 
primarily as a result of this  during we had a total of million in borrowings and million in repayments under our revolving credit facility 
in  we repurchased million in principal amount of our convertible debentures for million in cash 
additionally  we paid million of scheduled payments and million of early payments on our term loan  as well as million of capital lease obligations 
our financing activities for consisted primarily of million in proceeds from borrowings under our term loan agreement that were used to finance a portion of the acquisition of ria and proceeds from the equity private placement and stock option exercises totaling million 
partially offsetting these increases were repayments and early retirements of debt obligations of million  net repayments of borrowings under the revolving credit facility of million and repayments of capital lease obligations of million 
we also paid dividends to minority interest stockholders of million and debt issuance costs associated with our credit facility of million 
other sources of capital credit facility in connection with completing the april acquisition of ria  we entered into a million secured credit facility consisting of a million seven year term loan  which was fully drawn at closing  and a million five year revolving credit facility together  the credit facility 
the million seven year term loan bears interest at libor plus basis points or prime plus basis points and requires that we repay million of the balance each year  with the remaining balance payable at the end of the seven year term 
we prepaid amounts on this loan in and and we estimate that we will be able to repay the remaining million term loan prior to its maturity date through cash flows available from operations  provided our operating cash 
table of contents flows are not required for future business developments 
up front financing costs of million were deferred and are being amortized over the terms of the respective loans 
during april  we entered into an amendment to the credit facility to  among other items  i change the definition of one of the financial covenants in the original agreement to exclude the effect of certain one time expenses and ii allow for the repurchase of up to million aggregate principal amount of the million in convertible senior debentures due in september and december  we repurchased in privately negotiated transactions million and million  respectively  in principal amount of the debentures 
additionally  we incurred costs of million in connection with the amendment  which will be recognized as additional interest expense over the remaining term of the credit facility 
during february  we entered into amendment no 
to the credit facility to  among other items  i a grant us the ability to repurchase the remaining million of outstanding convertible senior debentures due and b repurchase our convertible debentures due prior to any repurchase date using proceeds of a qualifying refinancing  the proceeds of a qualifying equity issuance or shares of common stock  ii revise the definition of consolidated ebitda and the covenant regarding maintenance of consolidated net worth to exclude the effect of non cash charges for impairment of goodwill or other intangible assets for the periods ending december  and thereafter  and iii broaden or otherwise modify various definitions or provisions related to indebtedness  liens  permitted disposition  debt transactions  investments and other matters 
additionally  the lenders acknowledged that we have sufficient liquidity with respect to the december  repurchase date for the convertible senior debentures 
furthermore  in february  our board of directors authorized the repurchase of up million of these debentures  from time to time  in open market or privately negotiated purchases 
we incurred costs of approximately million in connection with the amendment  which will be recognized as additional interest expense over the remaining term of the credit facility 
the million five year revolving credit facility bears interest at libor or prime plus a margin that adjusts each quarter based upon our consolidated ebitda ratio as defined in the credit facility agreement 
we intend to use the revolving credit facility primarily to fund working capital requirements  which are expected to increase as we expand the money transfer business 
based on our current projected working capital requirements  we anticipate that our revolving credit facility will be sufficient to fund our working capital needs 
we may be required to repay our obligations under the credit facility six months before the potential repurchase dates  the first being october   under our million convertible debentures due  unless we are able to demonstrate that either i we could borrow unsubordinated funded debt equal to the principal amount of the applicable convertible debentures while remaining in compliance with the financial covenants in the credit facility or ii we will have sufficient liquidity to meet repayment requirements as determined by the administrative agent and the lenders 
these and other material terms and conditions applicable to the credit facility are described in the agreement governing the credit facility 
the term loan may be expanded by up to an additional million and the revolving credit facility can be expanded by up to an additional million  subject to satisfaction of certain conditions including pro forma debt covenant compliance 
as of december   after making required repayments on the term loan of million and voluntary prepayments of million  we had borrowings of million outstanding against the term loan 
we had borrowings of million and stand by letters of credit of million outstanding against the revolving credit facility 
the remaining million under the revolving credit facility million if the facility were increased to million was available for borrowing 
borrowings under the revolving credit facility are being used to fund short term working capital requirements in the us  spain and india 
as of december   our weighted average interest rate under the revolving credit facility was and under the term loan was  excluding amortization of deferred financing costs 
short term debt obligations short term debt obligations at december  were primarily the million convertible senior debentures due as the holders have the option to require us to repurchase their debentures at par on december   and the million annual repayment requirement under the term loan 
certain of our subsidiaries also have available credit lines and overdraft facilities to supplement short term working capital requirements  when necessary  and there was million outstanding against these facilities as of december  we believe that the short term debt obligations can be refinanced at terms acceptable to us 
however  if acceptable refinancing options are not available  we believe that amounts due under these obligations can be funded through cash generated from operations  together with cash on hand or borrowings under our revolving credit facility 
convertible debt we have million in principal amount of convertible debentures due that are convertible into million shares of euronet common stock at a conversion price of per share upon the occurrence of certain events relating to the closing prices of euronet common stock exceeding certain thresholds for specified periods 
we will pay contingent interest for the six month period from october  through april  and for each six month period thereafter from april to october or october to april if the average trading price of the debentures for the applicable five trading day period preceding such applicable six month interest period equals or exceeds of the principal amount of the debentures 
contingent interest will equal 
table of contents per annum of the average trading price of a debenture for such five trading day periods 
the debentures may not be redeemed by us until october  but are redeemable at par at any time thereafter 
holders of the debentures have the option to require us to purchase their debentures at par on october   and  or upon a change in control of the company 
on the maturity date  these debentures can be settled in cash or euronet common stock  at our option  at predetermined conversion rates 
we also have million in principal amount of convertible senior debentures due that are convertible into million shares of euronet common stock at a conversion price of per share upon the occurrence of certain events relating to the closing prices of euronet common stock exceeding certain thresholds for specified periods 
we will pay contingent interest for the six month period from december  through june  and for each six month period thereafter from june to december or december to june if the average trading price of the debentures for the applicable five trading day period preceding such applicable six month interest period equals or exceeds of the principal amount of the debentures 
contingent interest will equal per annum of the average trading price of a debenture for such five trading day periods 
the debentures may not be redeemed by us until december  but are redeemable at any time thereafter at par 
holders of the debentures have the option to require us to purchase their debentures at par on december   and  and upon a change in control of the company 
unless the price of our common stock appreciates substantially before december  we believe it is likely that the holders of the debentures will exercise this option effective december  based upon our current expectations  we believe we will have sufficient cash available to fund the potential million purchase price using our cash currently on hand  cash flows we expect to generate during and amounts we expect to be available to borrow under our revolving credit facility 
however  if our capital resources are insufficient to meet these obligations  we may be required to seek additional debt or equity financing 
should holders of the convertible debentures require us to repurchase their debentures on the dates outlined above  we cannot guarantee that we will have sufficient cash on hand or have acceptable financing options available to us to fund these required repurchases 
an inability to be able to finance these potential repayments could have an adverse impact on our operations 
these terms and other material terms and conditions applicable to the convertible debentures are set forth in the indenture agreements governing these debentures and in note  debt obligations  to the consolidated financial statements 
proceeds from issuance of shares and other capital contributions we have established  and shareholders have approved  share compensation plans that allow the company to make grants of shares of restricted common stock  or options to purchase shares of common stock  to certain current and prospective key employees  directors and consultants 
during   stock options were exercised at an average exercise price of  resulting in proceeds to us of approximately million 
we also sponsor a qualified employee stock purchase plan espp under which we reserved  shares of common stock for purchase under the plan by employees through payroll deductions according to specific eligibility and participation requirements 
this plan qualifies as an employee stock purchase plan under section of the internal revenue code of offerings commence at the beginning of each quarter and expire at the end of the quarter 
under the plan  participating employees are granted options  which immediately vest and are automatically exercised on the final date of the respective offering period 
the exercise price of common stock options purchased is the lesser of of the fair market value as defined in the espp of the shares on the first day of each offering or the last day of each offering 
the options are funded by participating employees payroll deductions or cash payments 
during  we issued  shares at an average price of per share  resulting in proceeds to us of approximately million 
these plans are discussed further in note  stock plans  to the consolidated financial statements 
other uses of capital payment obligations related to acquisitions as partial consideration for the acquisition of ria  we granted the sellers of ria  contingent value rights cvrs and  stock appreciation rights sars 
the  cvrs matured on october  and we elected to settle the cvrs by issuing  additional shares of euronet common stock valued at million 
the  sars entitled the sellers to acquire additional shares of euronet common stock at an exercise price of at any time through october  and were not exercised before their expiration 
we have potential contingent obligations to the former owner of the net assets of movilcarga 
based upon presently available information  we do not believe any additional payments will be required 
the seller disputed this conclusion and initiated arbitration as provided for in the purchase agreement 
a global public accounting firm was engaged as an independent expert to review the results of the computation  but the legal process in the dispute has remained dormant for over a year 
any additional payments  if ultimately determined to be owed the seller  will be recorded as additional goodwill and could be made in either cash or a combination of cash and euronet common stock at our option 
in connection with the acquisition of brodos romania  we agreed to contingent consideration arrangements based on the achievement of certain performance criteria 
if the criteria are achieved  during and  we would have to pay a total of million in cash or  shares of euronet common stock  at the option of the seller 

table of contents see the section entitled contingencies below for discussion of liquidity and capital resources involving a settlement agreement related to a previous agreement to acquire la nacional 
leases we lease atms and other property and equipment under capital lease arrangements that expire between and the leases bear interest between and per year 
as of december   we owed million under these capital lease arrangements 
the majority of these lease agreements are entered into in connection with long term outsourcing agreements where  generally  we purchase a bank s atms and simultaneously sell the atms to an entity related to the bank and lease back the atms for purposes of fulfilling the atm outsourcing agreement with the bank 
we fully recover the related lease costs from the bank under the outsourcing agreements 
generally  the leases may be canceled without penalty upon reasonable notice in the unlikely event the bank or we were to terminate the related outsourcing agreement 
we expect that  if terms were acceptable  we would acquire more atms from banks under such outsourcing and lease agreements 
capital expenditures and needs total capital expenditures for were million  of which million were funded through capital leases 
these capital expenditures were primarily for the purchase of atms to meet contractual requirements in poland and india  the purchase and installation of atms in key under penetrated markets  the purchase of pos terminals for the prepaid processing and money transfer segments  and office and data center computer equipment and software 
included in capital expenditures for office and data center equipment and software for is approximately million in capital expenditures for the purchase and development of the necessary processing systems and capabilities to enter the cross border merchant processing and acquiring business 
total capital expenditures for are estimated to be approximately million to million 
an additional million in software development cost was capitalized during for the development and enhancement of our eft processing segment software products 
see note  computer software to be sold  to the consolidated financial statements for a further discussion 
in the prepaid processing segment  approximately  of the approximately  pos devices that we operate are company owned  with the remaining terminals being operated as integrated cash register devices of our major retail customers or owned by the retailers 
as our prepaid processing segment expands  we will continue to add terminals in certain independent retail locations at a price of approximately per terminal 
we expect the proportion of owned terminals to total terminals operated to remain relatively constant 
at current and projected cash flow levels  we anticipate that cash generated from operations  together with cash on hand and amounts available under our revolving credit facility and other existing and potential future financing will be sufficient to meet our debt  leasing  contingent acquisition and capital expenditure obligations 
if our capital resources are insufficient to meet these obligations  we will seek to refinance our debt under terms acceptable to us 
however  we can offer no assurances that we will be able to obtain favorable terms for the refinancing of any of our debt or other obligations 
in the eft processing segment  we are required to maintain atm hardware for euronet owned atms and software for all atms in our network and in our processing centers in accordance with certain regulations and mandates established by local country regulatory and administrative bodies as well as emv europay  mastercard and visa chip card support 
additionally  as regulations change or new regulations or mandates are issued  we may have additional capital expenditures over the next few years to maintain compliance with these regulations and or mandates 
while we do not currently have plans to increase capital expenditures to expand our network of owned atms  we expect that if strategic opportunities were available to us  we would consider increasing future capital expenditures to expand this network in new or existing markets 
litigation during  a former cash supply contractor in central europe the contractor claimed that we owed approximately million for the provision of cash during the fourth quarter and first quarter that had not been returned 
this claim was made after we terminated our business with the contractor and established a cash supply agreement with another supplier 
in the first quarter  the contractor initiated legal action in budapest  hungary regarding the claim 
in april  an arbitration tribunal awarded the contractor million  plus million in interest  under the claim  which was paid and recorded as selling  general and administrative expenses of the eft processing segment during contingencies from time to time  we are a party to litigation arising in the ordinary course of business 
currently  there are no other contingencies that we believe  either individually or in the aggregate  would have a material adverse effect upon our consolidated results of operations or financial condition 
other trends and uncertainties cross border merchant processing and acquiring in our eft processing segment  we have entered the cross border merchant processing and acquiring business  through the execution of an agreement with a large petrol retailer in central europe 
since the 
table of contents beginning of  we have devoted significant resources  including capital expenditures of approximately million  to the ongoing investment in development of the necessary processing systems and capabilities to enter this business  which involves the purchase and design of hardware and software 
merchant acquiring involves processing credit and debit card transactions that are made on pos terminals  including authorization  settlement  and processing of settlement files 
it will involve the assumption of credit risk  as the principal amount of transactions will be settled to merchants before settlements are received from card associations 
we incurred million in operating losses related to this business in and expect to incur approximately million to million in operating losses during stock plans historically  the compensation committee of our board of directors has awarded nonvested shares or nonvested share units restricted stock and stock options as an element of long term management incentive compensation 
the amount of future compensation expense related to awards of restricted stock is based on the market price for euronet common stock at the grant date 
for grants of stock options  we used the black scholes option pricing model or monte carlo simulation model for the determination of fair value for stock option grants and plan to use the black scholes option pricing model or monte carlo simulation model  as appropriate  for future stock option grants  if any 
the grant date for stock options or restricted stock is the date at which all key terms and conditions of the grant have been determined and the company becomes contingently obligated to transfer assets to the employee who renders the requisite service  generally the date at which grants are approved by our board of directors or compensation committee thereof 
share based compensation expense for awards with only service conditions is generally recognized as expense on a straight line basis over the requisite service period 
for awards with performance conditions  expense is recognized on a graded attribution method 
the graded attribution method results in expense recognition on a straight line basis over the requisite service period for each separately vesting portion of an award  as if the award was  in substance  multiple awards 
expense for stock options and restricted stock is generally recorded as a corporate expense 
we have total unrecognized compensation cost related to unvested stock option and restricted stock awards of million that will be recognized over a weighted average period of years 
inflation and functional currencies generally  the countries in which we operate have experienced low and stable inflation in recent years 
therefore  the local currency in each of these markets is the functional currency 
due to these factors  we do not believe that inflation will have a significant effect on our results of operations or financial position 
we continually review inflation and the functional currency in each of the countries where we operate 
off balance sheet arrangements we have certain significant off balance sheet items described below and in the following section  contractual obligations also see note  guarantees  to the consolidated financial statements 
as of december  we had million of bank guarantees issued on our behalf  of which million are collateralized by cash deposits held by the respective issuing banks and million are supported by stand by letters of credit issued against the revolving credit facility 
these letters of credit reduce the amount available for borrowing under our revolving credit facility 
on occasion we grant guarantees in support of obligations of subsidiaries 
as of december   we had granted guarantees for cash in various atm networks amounting to million over the terms of the cash supply agreements and performance guarantees amounting to approximately million over the terms of the agreements with the customers 
from time to time  we enter into agreements with unaffiliated parties that contain indemnification provisions  the terms of which may vary depending on the negotiated terms of each respective agreement 
the amount of such obligations is not stated in the agreements 
our liability under such indemnification provisions may be subject to time and materiality limitations  monetary caps and other conditions and defenses 
such indemnity obligations include the following in connection with contracts with financial institutions in the eft processing segment  we are responsible for damages to atms and theft of atm network cash that  generally  is not recorded on the consolidated balance sheet 
as of december   the balance of atm network cash for which we were responsible was approximately million 
we maintain insurance policies to mitigate this exposure  in connection with the license of proprietary systems to customers  we provide certain warranties and infringement indemnities to the licensee  which generally warrant that such systems do not infringe on intellectual property owned by third parties and that the systems will perform in accordance with their specifications  
table of contents we have entered into purchase and service agreements with our vendors and into consulting agreements with providers of consulting services  pursuant to which we have agreed to indemnify certain of such vendors and consultants  respectively  against third party claims arising from our use of the vendor s product or the services of the vendor or consultant  in connection with acquisitions and dispositions of subsidiaries  operating units and business assets  we have entered into agreements containing indemnification provisions  which are generally described as follows i in connection with acquisitions made by euronet  we have agreed to indemnify the seller against third party claims made against the seller relating to the subject subsidiary  operating unit or asset and arising after the closing of the transaction  and ii in connection with dispositions made by us  we have agreed to indemnify the buyer against damages incurred by the buyer due to the buyer s reliance on representations and warranties relating to the subject subsidiary  operating unit or business assets in the disposition agreement if such representations or warranties were untrue when made  we have entered into agreements with certain third parties  including banks that provide fiduciary and other services to euronet or to our benefit plans 
under such agreements  we have agreed to indemnify such service providers for third party claims relating to the carrying out of their respective duties under such agreements  and in connection with our entry into the money transfer business  we have issued surety bonds in compliance with licensing requirements of the applicable governmental authorities 
we are also required to meet minimum capitalization and cash requirements of various regulatory authorities in the jurisdictions in which we have money transfer operations 
we are not aware of any significant claims made by the indemnified parties or third parties to guarantee agreements with us and  accordingly  no liabilities were recorded as of december  contractual obligations the following table summarizes our contractual obligations as of december  payments due by period less than more than in thousands total year years years years long term debt obligations  including interest estimated contingent acquisition obligations obligations under capital leases obligations under operating leases total for the purposes of the above table  our million convertible debentures issued in december are considered due during  and our million convertible debentures issued in october are considered due during  representing the first years in which holders have the right to exercise their put option 
additionally  the above table only includes interest on these convertible debentures up to these dates 
although in certain circumstances we may be required to repay our obligations under the credit facility six months before any potential repurchase date under our million convertible debentures  the table above assumes that these circumstances will not be met and the credit facility will be fully repaid at maturity 
we have assumed million  the december  balance  will be outstanding at all times under the revolving credit facility 
the computation of interest for debt obligations with variable interest rates reflects interest rates in effect at december  for additional information on debt obligations  see note  debt obligations  to the consolidated financial statements 
estimated contingent acquisition obligations as of december  are additional consideration to be settled in cash or euronet common stock that we may have to pay during and in connection with the acquisition of brodos  totaling up to million 
see note  acquisitions  to the consolidated financial statements for a more complete description of these acquisitions 
for additional information on capital and operating lease obligations  see note  leases  to the consolidated financial statements 
our total liability for uncertain tax positions under financial accounting standards board fasb interpretation no 
fin was million as of december  we are not able to reasonably estimate the amount by which the liability will increase or decrease over time  however  at this time  we do not expect a significant payment related to these obligations within the next year 
see note  taxes  to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 

table of contents critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the us requires management to make judgments  assumptions  and estimates  often as a result of the need to make estimates of matters that are inherently uncertain and for which the actual results will emerge over time 
these judgments  assumptions and estimates affect the amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
note  summary of significant accounting policies and practices  to the consolidated financial statements describes the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
our most critical estimates and assumptions are used for computing income taxes  estimating the useful lives and potential impairment of long lived assets and goodwill  as well as allocating the purchase price to assets acquired in acquisitions  and revenue recognition 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
the following descriptions of critical accounting policies and estimates are forward looking statements and are impacted significantly by estimates and should be read in conjunction with item a risk factors 
actual results could differ materially from the results anticipated by these forward looking statements 
accounting for income taxes the deferred income tax effects of transactions reported in different periods for financial reporting and income tax return purposes are recorded under the liability method 
this method gives consideration to the future tax consequences of deferred income or expense items and immediately recognizes changes in income tax laws upon enactment 
the income statement effect is generally derived from changes in deferred income taxes  net of valuation allowances  on the balance sheet as measured by differences in the book and tax bases of our assets and liabilities 
we have significant tax loss carryforwards  and other temporary differences  which are recorded as deferred tax assets and liabilities 
deferred tax assets realizable in future periods are recorded net of a valuation allowance based on an assessment of each entity s  or group of entities  ability to generate sufficient taxable income within an appropriate period  in a specific tax jurisdiction 
in assessing the recognition of deferred tax assets  we consider whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will be realized 
as more fully described in note  taxes  to the consolidated financial statements  gross deferred tax assets were million as of december   partially offset by a valuation allowance of million 
the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible 
we make judgments and estimates on the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities  historical and projected future taxable income in each country in which we operate  and tax planning strategies in making this assessment 
based upon the level of historical taxable income and current projections for future taxable income over the periods in which the deferred tax assets are deductible  we believe it is more likely than not that we will realize the benefits of these deductible differences  net of the existing valuation allowance at december  if we have a history of generating taxable income in a certain country in which we operate  and baseline forecasts project continued taxable income in this country  we will reduce the valuation allowance for those deferred tax assets that we expect to realize 
additionally  we follow the provisions of fin to account for uncertainty in income tax positions 
fin requires substantial management judgment and use of estimates in determining whether the impact of a tax position is more likely than not of being sustained on audit by the relevant taxing authority 
we consider many factors when evaluating and estimating our tax positions  which may require periodic adjustments and which may not accurately anticipate actual outcomes 
it is reasonably possible that amounts reserved for potential exposure could change significantly as a result of the conclusion of tax examinations and  accordingly  materially affect our operating results 
goodwill and other intangible assets in accordance with sfas no 
 business combinations  we allocate the acquisition purchase price to the tangible assets  liabilities and intangible assets acquired based on their estimated fair values 
the excess purchase price over those fair values is recorded as goodwill 
the fair value assigned to intangible assets acquired is supported by valuations using estimates and assumptions provided by management 
for larger or more complex acquisitions  management engages an appraiser to assist in the valuation 
intangible assets with finite lives are amortized over their estimated useful lives 
as of december   the consolidated balance sheet includes goodwill of million and acquired intangible assets  net of accumulated amortization  of million 
in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  on an annual basis  and whenever events or circumstances dictate  we test for impairment 
impairment tests are performed annually during the fourth quarter and are performed at the reporting unit level 
generally  fair value represents discounted projected future cash flows and potential impairment is indicated when the carrying value of a reporting unit  including goodwill  exceeds its estimated fair value 
if the potential for impairment exists  the fair value of the reporting unit is subsequently measured against the fair value of its underlying assets and liabilities  excluding 
table of contents goodwill  to estimate an implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill 
an impairment loss is recognized for any excess of the carrying value of the reporting unit s goodwill over the implied fair value 
as a result of our annual impairment test for the year ended december   we recorded a non cash goodwill impairment charge of million 
see note  goodwill and acquired intangible assets  net  to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding this charge 
our annual impairment tests during the years and indicated that there were no impairments 
determining the fair value of reporting units requires significant management judgment in estimating future cash flows and assessing potential market and economic conditions 
it is reasonably possible that our operations will not perform as expected  or that estimates or assumption could change  which may result in the recording of additional material non cash impairment charges during the year in which these changes take place 
see impact of new and emerging accounting pronouncements not yet adopted below for discussion regarding issuance of sfas no 
r  business combinations  that will be effective for acquisitions we complete after january  impairment or disposal of long lived assets in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  long lived assets  such as property and equipment and intangible assets subject to amortization  are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
factors that are considered important which could trigger an impairment review include the following significant underperformance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results  significant changes in the manner of use of the acquired assets or the strategy for the overall business  and significant negative industry or economic trends 
recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the respective asset 
the same estimates are also used in planning for our long and short range business planning and forecasting 
we assess the reasonableness of the inputs and outcomes of our discounted cash flow analysis against available comparable market data 
if the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its estimated future cash flows  an impairment charge is recognized by the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the fair value of the respective asset 
assets to be disposed are required to be separately presented in the balance sheet and reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell  and are no longer depreciated 
the assets and liabilities of a disposal group classified as held for sale are required to be presented separately in the appropriate asset and liability sections of the balance sheet 
reviewing long lived assets for impairment requires considerable judgment 
estimating the future cash flows requires significant judgment 
if future cash flows do not materialize as expected or there is a future adverse change in market conditions  we may be unable to recover the carrying amount of an asset  resulting in future impairment losses 
revenue recognition in accordance with us gaap  we recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  the price is fixed or determinable and collection is reasonably assured 
the majority of our revenues are comprised of monthly recurring management fees and transaction based fees that are recognized when the transactions are processed or the services are performed 
when determining the proper revenue recognition for monthly management fees and transaction based fees  we consider the guidance in staff accounting bulletin sab  revenue recognition in financial statements  as amended by sab  revenue recognition  emerging issues task force eitf  reporting revenue gross as principle versus net as an agent  eitf  accounting for revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables  and other various interpretations 
certain of our noncancelable customer contracts provide for the receipt of up front fees paid to or received from the customer and or decreasing or increasing fee schedules over the agreement term for substantially the same level of services provided by the company 
as prescribed by sab and sab  we recognize revenue under these contracts based on proportional performance of services over the term of the contract  which generally results in straight line revenue recognition of the contracts total cash flows  including any up front payment 
we also record certain revenues in the eft processing segment related to the sale of eft software solutions for electronic payment and transaction delivery systems  including professional fees for implementation and customization  ongoing software maintenance and associated computer hardware 
when determining the proper revenue recognition for these items  in addition to sab  sab  and eitf  we also consider the guidance contained in statement of position sop  software revenue recognition  as amended by sop and sop  and sop  accounting for performance of construction type and certain production type contracts 
applying us gaap revenue recognition guidance to the software business requires more detailed knowledge of the rules and is subject to more complex judgment 
for the year ended december   revenues from software and software related products and services represented less than of our total consolidated revenues 
substantial management judgment and estimation is required in determining the proper revenue recognition methodology for our various revenue producing activities  as well as the proper and consistent application of our determined methodology 

table of contents subsequent events during february  we entered into amendment no 
to the credit facility to  among other items  i a grant us the ability to repurchase the remaining million of outstanding convertible senior debentures due and b repurchase our convertible debentures due prior to any repurchase date using proceeds of a qualifying refinancing  the proceeds of a qualifying equity issuance or shares of common stock  ii revise the definition of consolidated ebitda and the covenant regarding maintenance of consolidated net worth to exclude the effect of non cash charges for impairment of goodwill or other intangible assets for the periods ending december  and thereafter  and iii broaden or otherwise modify various definitions or provisions related to indebtedness  liens  permitted disposition  debt transactions  investments and other matters 
additionally  the lenders acknowledged that we have sufficient liquidity with respect to the december  repurchase date for the convertible senior debentures 
we incurred costs of approximately million in connection with the amendment  which will be recognized as additional interest expense over the remaining term of the credit facility 
impact of new and emerging accounting pronouncements not yet adopted in may  the fasb issued fasb staff position fsp apb  accounting for convertible instruments that may be settled in cash upon conversion including partial cash settlement 
fsp apb requires the proceeds from the issuance of such convertible debt instruments to be allocated between debt and equity components so that debt is discounted to reflect the company s nonconvertible debt borrowing rate 
the debt discount is amortized over the period the convertible debt is expected to be outstanding as additional non cash interest expense 
the change in accounting treatment is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  and applies retrospectively to prior periods 
fsp apb will impact the accounting associated with our million convertible senior debentures and our million convertible debentures 
the new accounting treatment will require us to retrospectively record a significant amount of non cash interest as the discount on the debt is amortized 
we estimate that we will record additional interest expense of approximately million for each of the years ended december  and additionally  the pre tax gains on the early retirements of the convertible debentures in will be reduced by approximately million 
in march  the fasb issued sfas no 
 disclosures about derivative instruments and hedging activities  which requires enhanced disclosures about an entity s derivative and hedging activities  including a how and why an entity uses derivative instruments  b how derivative instruments and related hedged items are accounted for under sfas no 
and its related interpretations  and c how derivative instruments and related hedged items affect an entity s financial position  financial performance  and cash flows 
this statement is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years and interim periods beginning after november   with early application encouraged 
this statement encourages  but does not require  comparative disclosures for earlier periods at initial adoption 
our adoption of sfas no 
is not expected to have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements 
in april  the fasb issued fsp fas  determination of the useful life of intangible assets 
fsp fas amends the factors that should be considered in developing renewal or extension assumptions used to determine the useful life of a recognized intangible asset under sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
this fsp is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after december   and the guidance for determining the useful life of a recognized intangible asset must be applied prospectively to intangible assets acquired after the effective date 
our adoption of fsp fas is not expected to have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
r  business combinations  which is a revision of sfas no 
 business combinations 
sfas no 
r will apply to all business combinations and will require most identifiable assets  liabilities  noncontrolling interests  and goodwill acquired in a business combination to be recorded at full fair value 
sfas no 
r will also require transaction related costs to be expensed in the period incurred  rather than capitalizing these costs as a component of the respective purchase price 
sfas no 
r is effective for acquisitions that we may complete after january  and early adoption was prohibited 
the adoption will have a significant impact on the accounting treatment for acquisitions occurring after the effective date 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
 noncontrolling interests in consolidated financial statements  that replaces accounting research bulletin arb  consolidated financial statements 
sfas no 
will require noncontrolling interests previously referred to as minority interests to be reported as a component of equity  which will change the accounting for transactions with noncontrolling interest holders 
sfas no 
is effective for euronet on january  and will result in a change in the classification of noncontrolling interest from a component of liabilities to a component of equity in consolidated balance sheets and will change the accounting for transactions with noncontrolling shareholders after the effective date 

table of contents forward looking statements this document contains statements that constitute forward looking statements within the meaning of section a of the securities act of and section e of the securities exchange act of  as amended

although we believe that the expectations reflected in such forward looking statements are reasonable  we can give no assurance that such expectations will prove to be correct 
forward looking statements are typically identified by the words believe  expect  anticipate  intend  estimate and similar expressions 
investors are cautioned that any forward looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve risks and uncertainties  including  but not limited to  those referred to above and as set forth in item a risk factors 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk in connection with completing the acquisition of ria in april  we entered into a million secured syndicated credit facility consisting of a million seven year term loan  which was fully drawn at closing  and a million five year revolving credit facility  which accrue interest at variable rates 
this credit facility replaced our million revolving credit facility 
the credit facility may be expanded by up to an additional million in term loans and up to an additional million for the revolving line of credit  subject to satisfaction of certain conditions including pro forma debt covenant compliance 
this facility substantially increased our interest rate risk 
as of december   our total outstanding debt was million 
of this amount  million  or of our total debt obligations  relates to contingent convertible debentures having fixed coupon rates 
our million contingent convertible debentures  issued in october  accrue interest at a rate of per annum 
the million contingent convertible debentures  issued in december accrue interest at a rate of per annum 
based on quoted market prices  as of december  the fair value of our fixed rate convertible debentures was million  compared to a carrying value of million 
through the use of interest rate swap agreements covering the period from june  to may   an additional million of our variable rate term debt  or of our total debt  has been effectively converted to a fixed rate of 
as of december   the unrealized loss on the interest rate swap agreements was million 
interest expense  including amortization of deferred debt issuance costs  for our total million in fixed rate debt totals approximately million per year  or a weighted average interest rate of annually 
additionally  approximately million  or of our total debt obligations  relate to capitalized leases with fixed payment and interest terms that expire between and the remaining million  or of our total debt obligations  relates to debt that accrues interest at variable rates 
if we were to maintain these borrowings for one year  and maximize the potential borrowings available under the revolving credit facility for one year  including the million in potential additional expanded borrowings  a increase in the applicable interest rate would result in additional annualized interest expense of approximately million 
this computation excludes the million relating to the interest rate swap discussed above and the potential million from an expanded term loan because of the limited circumstances under which the additional amounts would be available to us for borrowing 
for more information regarding our debt obligations  see note  debt obligations  to the consolidated financial statements 
our excess cash is invested in instruments with original maturities of three months or less  therefore  as investments mature and are reinvested  the amount we earn will increase or decrease with changes in the underlying short term interest rates 
foreign currency exchange rate risk for the years ended december  and  of our revenues were generated in non us dollar countries 
we expect to continue generating a significant portion of our revenues in countries with currencies other than the us dollar 

table of contents we are particularly vulnerable to fluctuations in exchange rates of the us dollar to the currencies of countries in which we have significant operations  primarily to the euro  british pound  australian dollar and polish zloty 
as of december   we estimate that a fluctuation in these foreign currency exchange rates would have the combined annualized effect on reported net income and working capital of approximately million to million 
this effect is estimated by applying a adjustment factor to our non us dollar results from operations  intercompany loans that generate foreign currency gains or losses and working capital balances that require translation from the respective functional currency to the us dollar reporting currency 
additionally  we have other non current  non us dollar assets and liabilities on our balance sheet that are translated to the us dollar during consolidation 
these items primarily represent goodwill and intangible assets recorded in connection with acquisitions in countries other than the us we estimate that a fluctuation in foreign currency exchange rates would have a non cash impact on total comprehensive income of approximately million to million as a result of the change in value of these items during translation to the us dollar 
for the fluctuations described above  a strengthening us dollar produces a financial loss  while a weakening us dollar produces a financial gain 
we believe this quantitative measure has inherent limitations and does not take into account any governmental actions or changes in either customer purchasing patterns or our financing or operating strategies 
because a majority of our revenues and expenses are incurred in the functional currencies of our international operating entities  the profits we earn in foreign currencies are positively impacted by the weakening of the us dollar and negatively impacted by the strengthening of the us dollar 
additionally  our debt obligations are primarily in us dollars  therefore  as foreign currency exchange rates fluctuate  the amount available for repayment of debt will also increase or decrease 
we are also exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk in our money transfer segment 
a majority of the money transfer business involves receiving and disbursing different currencies  in which we earn a foreign currency spread based on the difference between buying currency at wholesale exchange rates and selling the currency to consumers at retail exchange rates 
this spread provides some protection against currency fluctuations that occur while we are holding the foreign currency 
our exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates is limited by the fact that disbursement occurs for the majority of transactions shortly after they are initiated 
additionally  we enter into foreign currency forward contracts to help offset foreign currency exposure related to the notional value of money transfer transactions collected in currencies other than the us dollar 
as of december   we had foreign currency derivative instruments  primarily forward contracts  outstanding with a notional value of million  primarily in euros that were not designated as hedges and mature in a weighted average of five days 
the fair value of these forward contracts as of december  was an unrealized gain of approximately million  which was mostly offset by the unrealized loss on the related foreign currency receivables
